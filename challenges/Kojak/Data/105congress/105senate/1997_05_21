Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today \nthe Senate will immediately resume consideration of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 27, the first concurrent budget resolution. Senator Kennedy \nwill be recognized immediately to offer his amendment on tobacco taxes. \nFollowing the disposition of the Kennedy amendment, Senator Gramm will \nbe recognized to offer his amendment regarding deficit-neutral natural \ndisaster relief.\n  Members can expect rollcall votes in relation to these amendments and \nothers, and all Members will be notified when these votes are \nspecifically scheduled.\n  I am still hopeful that the Democratic leader and I can join together \nin an effort to yield back additional time off the statutory time \nlimitation, which is 50 hours, for the budget resolution and permit the \nSenate to complete its work on the budget resolution today.\n  Subsequently, Senators wishing to offer amendments to this \nlegislation should notify the chairman of the Budget Committee or the \nranking member of the Budget Committee of their intentions this \nmorning.\n  Again, Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout the day. We have \na good deal of other work that we need to complete before the Memorial \nDay recess. For instance, tomorrow we already have a time agreement for \n3 hours on the Chemical Weapons Convention implementation legislation. \nWe would, of course, like to complete this resolution and have it go to \nconference where, hopefully, there will be very little problem in \nworking out the conference. Hopefully, there will be no real \ndifferences between the two bills. That is going to take a lot of \ndiscipline on our part throughout the day until we complete this \nlegislation.\n  We also have at least three nominations that will require some small \namount of time--judicial nominations, district courts--and three \nrecorded votes.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill, or some version thereof, very \nlikely would need to be voted on this week also.\n  So it is essential that we stay with it and that we complete the \nbudget resolution today, if at all possible.\n  There is good news and bad news. The good news is that we made good \nprogress yesterday. I think almost 10 hours have been used or yielded \nback already. We did take up some amendments and had votes. While it \nwas difficult and delicate, the amendments were defeated by \nconsiderable margins. We need to continue to do that.\n  There are going to be a lot of good and appealing amendments offered \ntoday. It will be difficult to resist those. But this is a very \ndelicately crafted budget agreement that the Republican leadership \nsigned onto and that the Democratic leadership has agreed to. The \nchairman and ranking member have been working together more so than I \nhave ever seen before. I commend them for that effort.\n  So I hope that we will continue to hold the line. If we start down \nthe trail of changing the mix, where will it end? I know of several \namendments that I am very attracted to. The one by Senator Gramm \nobviously is very attractive. He basically says we should have some \nrevenue-neutral process to have funds set aside for the annual disaster \nrelief bill. We have to come every year for $5 billion, $6 billion, or \n$7 billion. He says we should go ahead and set that aside so we have \nthat planned for. That is attractive. But that was not included in the \nbudget agreement, so we probably should not do that here.\n  There will be an amendment offered by Senator Warner with regard to \nhighway funds. I would like to see more money go into the highways and \nbridges in America out of the highway trust fund, which is there for \nthat purpose.\n  Of course, there is the amendment offered by Senator Kennedy here \nwith regard to child health care.\n  I want to emphasize that we discussed this at great length during the \nbudget negotiations and in reaching\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\nthe budget agreement. There are funds in here for that area. There are \nmore than enough funds in that area. In fact, I think there will be a \nstruggle to find the best way to provide those funds to the people that \nwant to have child health care.\n  So it will be a very, very bad change in the makeup of this \nlegislation and could unravel the whole budget agreement, if the \nKennedy amendment is approved today.\n  So I hope that we start off the day by having a fine discussion about \nwhat is in the bill, and what the alternative offered is. But we need \nalso to recognize that is a substantial increase in what is provided in \nthis particular area. It is totally different from what was in the \nbudget agreement that the administration agreed to.\n  So I urge my colleagues to keep calm. Let's keep working. But let's \nnot start passing amendments that will change the mix of the make up of \nthis budget agreement.\n  I yield the floor at this time, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4781-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4782-S4849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

I want to know if this amendment is similar to 525 and 526 \nthat you had as health care for children and a tax bill that is now \ncombined? They are basically the same?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is basically geared to get us to that point. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one \nobservation on my time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to make sure that the Senator, \nthe prime sponsor, understands that in the unanimous-consent request \nfollowing disposition of the Kennedy amendment, which I assume----\n  Mr. HATCH. This is not the Kennedy amendment. This is the Hatch-\nKennedy amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That language does not preclude a second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator understands that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand that.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I sent this amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Kennedy. This is well known as the Hatch-Kennedy \namendment. I think everyone in the Senate ought to know that. It is an \namendment that we have worked out over a 6-month period, or longer, and \none that I think deserves consideration in every sense of that term.\n  The amendment that Senator Kennedy and I offer today addresses what I \nconsider to be a top priority of this Congress: making sure America's \nkids are healthy.\n  The Hatch-Kennedy amendment calls for an increase in the tobacco \nexcise tax to fund additional spending for children's health insurance.\n  We have made enactment of a bipartisan children's health insurance \nbill a top priority this Congress, and plan to press forward at every \nopportunity if the Senate does not act in a responsible manner.\n  This amendment is the right thing to do, and I urge its adoption.\n  Specifically, our amendment would raise $30 billion in revenues \nthrough a 43-cent tobacco excise tax increase.\n  Twenty billion dollars will be used for services to uninsured kids, \nand $10 billion for deficit reduction.\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\n  We intend that the money be used for the same purposes as those \noutlined in the bipartisan budget agreement; that is, for Medicaid and \nfor a mandatory capped State grant program to finance health insurance \nfor uninsured children.\n  Under our amendment, $18 billion in program funding will go to the \nLabor Committee, and $2 billion to the Finance Committee, to be added \nto the $16 billion already in the budget resolution. That means each \ncommittee will get $18 billion to work on complementary programs to \nhelp the poor and near poor.\n  To pass this amendment--and this is an uphill battle we face--we need \nto have the will to do two things.\n  First, we must recognize that we need to help children from America's \nworking families, as well as the poorest of the poor.\n  About 88 percent of uninsured children come from families where at \nleast one parent is employed.\n  Don't forget that. Eighty-eight percent of these kids live in a \nfamily where one parent works, at least.\n  The majority of these kids will not be addressed by any Medicaid \nbill.\n  Second, in order to help these forgotten children, we need to have \nthe courage to take on some very powerful special interests.\n  When we started this fight I knew that Big Tobacco would not just \nroll over and play dead. And they have not disappointed me.\n  If we demonstrate one thing by this vote today let it be this: we are \nsending a message today that Senator Kennedy and I and the other \nsupporters of this bill will stand up for children and against Big \nTobacco.\n  Senators, who do you stand with? Joe Camel, or Joey? That is what it \ncomes down to.\n  What the Senate must do today is decide whether we are going to \nprotect Joe Camel, or whether we are going to protect Joey.\n  Let our votes today be the answer.\n  Now I am certain that those speaking in opposition to our amendment \nwill offer a lot of complicated reasons why our amendment is deficient.\n  But as they talk, ask yourself who should be protected: Joey or Joe \nCamel?\n  Sometimes the logic of something is just so simple that no amount of \nobfuscation, legal mumbo-jumbo, technical economic jargon, and \nprocedural objections can fool the American public.\n  I expect that some will come to the floor today and say that this \nbudget resolution is the wrong time and place for this legislation.\n  One of their objections will be that the bill includes $10 billion in \ndeficit reduction. Some will argue that this is not needed in a \nbalanced budget document.\n  Those who make that argument simply do not take into account the fact \nthat the interest payments on the accumulated annual deficits--the $6 \ntrillion national debt--now consume 15% of annual Federal spending. \nThis is as much as we spend for our national defense.\n  Having managed the floor debate for the balanced budget amendment \nthat fell 1 vote short of the 67 necessary votes, I have a special \nplace in my heart for the ``LD'' part of the CHILD bill: lowering the \ndeficit.\n  Once again, think of Joe Camel and Joey.\n  Frankly, as a conservative Republican I am proud to have convinced so \nmany Democrats to cosponsor legislation that provides $1 for deficit \nreduction for every $2 devoted to program costs. If this model is \nadopted in other areas, not only will we more quickly reach the goal of \na balanced budget, but we will also be better able to face the \nformidable challenges of entitlement reform and financing the national \ndebt.\n  Our amendment has two very basic and extremely important goals.\n  The Hatch-Kennedy healthy kids amendment benefits American families, \nworking families so that they can get health care. The healthy kids \namendment helps reduce the deficit and reduce our debt service \nrequirements.\n  Our amendment will help millions of kids get a healthy start in life. \nAs it stands now, we know that too many American children do not get \nthe benefits of health insurance.\n  The General Accounting Office recently made a number of important \nobservations about this problem. In House testimony, the GAO said:\n\n       In summary, we have found that while most children have \n     health insurance, almost 10 million children lack insurance. \n     Between 1989 and 1995, the percentage of children with \n     private coverage declined significantly--part of an overall \n     decline in coverage of dependents through family health \n     insurance policies.\n\n  The GAO concluded:\n\n       Had this decrease not occurred, nearly 5 million more \n     children would have had private health insurance.\n\n  From these observations of GAO, I think it is fair to say that there \nis a big problem in the area of children's health insurance, and unless \nwe do something about it, it is bound to get bigger.\n  Who are these 10 million children? These uninsured kids come from \nworking families. At least 88 percent of those kids come from families \nwhere at least one parent is working. Many live in families whose \nincome is just above the Medicaid limit, but they do not make enough \nmoney to provide health insurance for their kids.\n  Who are the Hatch-Kennedy kids? I will tell you who they are. They \nare, in large part, the children of good, hard-working families who \nmake too much for Medicaid and not enough to buy their own health \ninsurance.\n  This chart shows you that there is a pronounced spike in the number \nof uninsured Americans who live in that $20,000 to $30,000 working-\nclass income bracket. This is the family income range of many of these \nfamilies who stand to benefit from the Hatch-Kennedy amendment.\n  It is clear to this Senator that there is a problem to be solved. \nThese are uninsured Americans.\n  Some are saying we do not need this amendment. The budget negotiators \ndid a good job, in my opinion, in including a significant amount of new \nspending for children's health--$16 billion in this budget resolution. \nThat is a good start, and I praised them for it. No question about it. \nBut the fact is there are about 10 million kids in the United States \nwithout health insurance, and I believe that the budget resolution \nprobably will not cover even half of them.\n  I think it is important that my colleagues understand the \nCongressional Budget Office is coming in with very conservative \nestimates on the number of children who will be served under various \ncongressional proposals. For example, the CBO, Congressional Budget \nOffice, has estimated that the Medicaid 12-month, continuous \neligibility proposal would cost $14 billion alone if implemented by \nevery State. That alone is almost all of the money in this budget \nresolution. Or, if you look at it another way, the Federal share of \nMedicaid costs for a child is about $860 on average this year. \nAccording to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, there are 4.7 \nmillion uninsured children whose parents make less than 125 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level. That is $19,500 for a family of four.\n  How can they afford insurance? By simple calculation, to cover those \nkids under Medicaid would cost $4.2 billion, about $1 billion more a \nyear than is included in this budget resolution, and that is just the \nMedicaid kids. There are 7 million here who are not. And this would \nleave the vast majority of children of working parents under 125 \npercent of poverty level uncovered.\n  While I admit $16 billion is a substantial start and I commend my \ncolleagues on the Budget Committee, it is just not enough to do the \nwhole job.\n  Many of us are also cosponsors of\nthe Chafee-Rockefeller-Jeffords-Breaux CHIPS bill, which is estimated \nto cost at least $15 billion, perhaps even more. This Medicaid bill is \ntargeted to help 5 million kids, including the 3 million or so \nMedicaid-eligible children who are not enrolled because they do not \nknow enough to get enrolled.\n  We see these two bills as compatible. The CHIPS bill improves basic \nMedicaid, and our bill would be added on top of that to take care of \nthese uninsured kids who do not qualify. There obviously is a close \nconnection between the two. That is why in our amendment we decided to \ndivide the money equally between each of the two committees, Labor and \nFinance, and to work out an integrated approach.\n  Let me also take a few minutes to explain my views about using a \ntobacco\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\ntax as the revenue source for our amendment. There can be no doubt that \nsmoking and tobacco use are major public health problems. By any \nmeasure they are costly.\n  Smoking is our Nation's No. 1 preventable health cause of death. \nThere are about 48 million Americans who smoke. About 2 million \nAmericans use other tobacco products like chewing tobacco. There are 3 \nmillion kids who smoke.\n\n  Consider these smoking facts. Smoking causes cancer and is addictive. \nOne out of five cancers is caused by smoking; four out of five lung \ncancers are caused by smoking; 3,000 kids are starting to smoke every \nday; 50 percent of all smokers begin before age 15, 90 percent before \nthe age 18; 419,000 American smokers die annually. Just think about it. \nOf those 3,000 young Americans who start smoking every day, at least \nhalf of them are going to become nicotine addicts.\n  Tobacco accounts for more deaths than homicide, car and airplane \naccidents, alcohol, heroin, crack and AIDS combined. In fact, \ncigarettes are a major cause of fire fatalities in the United States. \nIn 1990, cigarettes were responsible for about one-quarter of all \ndeaths associated with residential fires. This represented over 1,000 \ndeaths in our society.\n  Every day nearly 3,000 young Americans become regular smokers. \nEventually, 1,000 will die early from tobacco-related diseases. \nUnfortunately, cigarette smoking is on the rise among the young. About \n8 in 10 smokers begin to use tobacco before age 18 and about one-half \nof all smokers started at age 14 or earlier.\n  According to a 1994 CDC report, tobacco costs our society $100 \nbillion annually--$50 billion in direct medical costs. Of 24 billion \ncigarette packs sold in 1993, $2.06 per pack in medical care costs. Of \nthis, 89 cents was paid by public sources; $10 billion Medicare, $5 \nbillion Medicaid, $4.75 billion other Federal, and $16.75 billion \nhigher insurance premiums. Just think about that.\n  The price of cigarettes devoted toward taxes has slipped over the \nlast three decades and, even with the increase we propose today, will \nactually be lower proportionately once this bill is enacted than it was \nin 1964 when Surgeon General Luther Terry reported for the first time \nthat smoking causes cancer.\n  As a conservative, I am generally opposed to tax increases. I firmly \nbelieve that the Federal Government should spend less and that the \nAmerican people should keep more of their money that they earn in our \neconomy. Yet the statistics about tobacco use and costs that I cited \nabove, I believe, make the case that tobacco products are imposing \nexternal costs onto society that are not adequately reflected in the \nprice of these inherently dangerous products. Simply stated, the \nproducers and consumers of tobacco products are not paying for the full \ncosts of this product.\n  When I balance the opportunity that we have in terms of helping to \nprovide health insurance and services for children, coupled with the \nsignificant deficit reduction component against my natural aversion to \nraising taxes, I come down in favor of this financing mechanism with \nthe tobacco tax or, as I call it, a user fee because only those who \nsmoke are going to pay this tax. And 50 percent of them, according to \nthe recent polls, are for this tax realizing that smoking causes a lot \nof detriment to society.\n  If we are going to commit ourselves to addressing the problem of \nadequate health care for children, then it is essential that we \nidentify how this program is going to be funded.\n  I knew I was going to take the heat on this one, but I strongly \nbelieved that it was the fiscally responsible thing to do, and I still \nthink this is the case.\n  Accordingly, let me pose to my colleagues this question. What do you \nbelieve is a better offset? From what program do you suggest we take \nthe money? Now, I am willing to listen and discuss this issue but, \nquite frankly, I have not heard from anybody concerning a viable \nalternative financing source.\n  Let us get to the real issue here. Smoking is dangerous for our \npublic health, and it is dangerous for our economy. It hurts the kids \nwe are trying to help. That is the crux of our amendment here today.\n  Many of the critics of our proposal have seized on this amendment \ntoday to express concerns which were raised earlier about the Child \nHealth Insurance and Lower Deficit Act. A lot of those charges against \nthe bill are in error, as I am prepared to debate here today. But the \nfundamental question today is not should we pass the Hatch-Kennedy \nchild bill. Rather, the more pertinent question before the body is \nshould we do more for children's health?\n  The answer, totally clear to this Senator, is ``most definitely.'' I \nconsider children's health to be a top priority issue for this \nCongress. I think the American people expect that of us.\n  My colleagues may be interested in a Wall Street Journal-NBC News \npoll taken between April 26 and 28 of this year. The question was posed \nas follows:\n\n       Two Senators, a Republican and a Democrat, have proposed \n     increasing cigarette taxes by 43 cents a pack and giving much \n     of the money raised to help States provide health insurance \n     for uninsured children. Based on this description, do you \n     favor or oppose this plan?\n\n  The response was astounding. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll, April 26-28, 1997\n\n       Question: Two Senators, a Republican and a Democrat, have \n     proposed increasing cigarette taxes by 43 cents a pack, and \n     giving much of the money raised to help states provide health \n     insurance for uninsured children.

Mr. President, 72 percent of all adults responded that \nthey favor this proposal and only 24 percent were opposed; 67 percent \nof all men approved of this proposal and 76 percent of all women were \nin favor. The results were remarkably consistent throughout each \ngeographic region in the United States, across age groups and, indeed, \nincome groups.\n  The point is simple. This is an idea whose time has come. So to those \nwho believe there is a better way to go, I earnestly solicit your \nviews. Indeed, I will make an offer to every Member in this body. I \nwant to work with each of you and with our leadership to address this \nissue in a responsible way. If changes need to be made, if we need to \nmove toward a middle ground in order to get a proposal enacted, I will \nbe an advocate for these changes. It is for this reason that Senator \nKennedy and I initiated our discussions on this issue several months \nago.\n  The fact is that Senator Kennedy and I approach issues like these \nfrom vastly different ends of the political spectrum. That perhaps is \nwhat strengthens the product of our discussions on those issues, the \nfact that we can find common ground. I believe we desperately need to \nfind that bipartisan common ground on an issue like child health \ninsurance, an issue which matters to so many of all of our \nconstituents.\n  I think one of the lessons we have learned in the last 18 months is \nthat the American public believes Congress is unnecessarily \npoliticizing issues and sandbagging legislation in areas which beg for \naction. Children's health is an obvious example. I caution my \ncolleagues not to be ashamed to work in a\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\nbipartisan manner. Working across the aisle and knitting together \npolitical coalitions in order to get things done is an element of \nleadership, and I think it is what the public expects of all of us. I \nthink that our approach is a true bipartisan partnership. Public health \nleaders back this approach.\n  Six former Cabinet Secretaries of HHS or its predecessor, HEW, \nrepresenting all Presidential administrations back to the Nixon \nadministration support our amendment. I thank Secretaries Elliot \nRichardson, David Mathews, Joseph Califano, Richard Schweiker, Otis \nBowen, and Louis Sullivan for their support and leadership in moving \nthis legislation.\n  I also want my colleagues to know that former Surgeons General C. \nEverett Koop, Julius Richmond, Paul Erlich, and Jesse Steinfield are \nbacking this effort.\n  Today is the time for we politicians to take the advice of these \nleaders in public health and vote to increase the tax on tobacco users \nin order to help children. Indeed, the budget compromise and the child \nbill plus the public's heightened sense of concern about the perils of \ntobacco are coming together to present a rare and historic opportunity \nfor our society to help children get health insurance, further \ndiscourage tobacco use, especially among our young people, and target a \nsizable $10 billion for deficit reduction.\n  This is a unique time, and we should make the most of it. I believe \nthat we can and should strengthen Medicaid and create a new program for \nthose children from working families who are not Medicaid eligible. \nThat is what our amendment is intended to do.\n  I will not use up all our time. Let us just keep this simple. Vote \nfor Joey, not for Joe Camel. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lauren Ewers be given \nprivileges of the Senate floor during the pending debate on the budget \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I commend my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, for explaining the thrust of this legislation \nand the range of support that we have for it and the importance of it \nfor working families. Let me just continue in the presentation.\n  Mr. President, I join Senator Hatch in offering this amendment to \nguarantee a healthy start in life for every American child. Our \namendment to the budget poses a clear choice for every Senator. Whose \ninterests do you care about--the interests of America's children--or \nthe interests of the big tobacco companies? Are you for Joe Camel and \nthe Marlboro Man, or millions of children who lack adequate health \ncare?\n  Our amendment will make the Hatch-Kennedy children's health insurance \nplan part of the budget. Our goal is to make health insurance \naccessible and affordable for every child. The plan is financed by an \nincrease of 43 cents a pack in the cigarette tax. That increase has the \nadditional important benefit of reducing smoking by children.\n  Our plan has broad bipartisan support--because health care for \nchildren is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a human \nissue. Six former Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human \nServices and four former Surgeon Generals have endorsed the plan. These \nleaders served under Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush. \nThey all understand the importance of health insurance for children and \ndecisive action to reduce smoking. They all understand that health care \nfor children is an issue that should transcend political party and \nideology.\n  We all know the crisis we are facing in children's health. Ten and a \nhalf million children in this country--1 child in every 7--have no \nhealth insurance. Over a 2 year period, 23 million children--1 child in \nevery 3--are without health insurance for substantial periods of time.\n  Ninety percent of uninsured children are members of working families. \nTheir families work hard--40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year--but all \ntheir hard work can't buy their children the health care they need, \nbecause they don't qualify for Medicaid and they can't afford to buy \ninsurance on their own.\n  Too many children are left out and left behind because they are \nuninsured. Too many parents face a cruel choice between putting food on \nthe table, paying the rent, and giving their children the health care \nthey need.\n  For millions of children the only family doctor is the hospital \nemergency room. Each year 600,000 sick children do not receive any \nmedical care, because they are uninsured. Each year, 400,000 children \ngo without the medicine their doctors have prescribed because they have \nno insurance. Each year, 1\\1/2\\ million children go without the dental \ncare they need, because they have no insurance. Each year, 600,000 \nuninsured children suffer from asthma and less than half see a \nphysician even once.\n  Each month, 1 million uninsured children suffer from sore throats \nwith high fever. If they have strep throats, it can lead to heart \ndisease and kidney disease if it's not treated. Each year, 300,000 \nuninsured children have chronic, untreated ear infections. Uninsured \nchildren are 50 percent more likely to die in the hospital than other \nchildren because their parents couldn't afford the health insurance \nthey needed.\n  We all know our country's shameful record on infant mortality--we \nrank behind 17 other industrialized countries.\n  The lack of health care for children plagues the education system \ntoo. Children who are sick can't study well in school. Children who \ncannot see the blackboard because they have no eyeglasses can't succeed \nin the classroom. Children who cannot hear the teacher are unlikely to \nlearn. Children who do not get a healthy start in life are unlikely to \nhave a healthy future. And without healthy children, our country won't \nhave a healthy future either--because children are the country's \nfuture.\n  Passage of this amendment, combined with the money already included \nin the budget agreement, can end this crisis and make this the Congress \nin which we guarantee every child the opportunity for the healthy start \nin life that should be the birthright of every child.\n  A budget is about setting priorities. There is no more important \npriority than health care for our children.\n  The amendment provides the additional funds necessary to achieve our \ngoal. It includes in the instructions to the Finance Committee the \nnecessary adjustments to provide for a 43-cent-a-pack increase in the \ncigarette tax to finance the coverage. And it includes in the \ninstructions to the Finance and Labor and Human Resources Committee the \nspending to implement this program.\n  The Hatch-Kennedy legislation includes provisions that were common to \nbills introduced two Congresses ago by Republicans and Democrats alike. \nIt will make health insurance coverage more affordable for every \nworking family with uninsured children. It does so without creating any \nnew Government mandates--on the States, on the insurance industry, or \non individuals. The program is purely voluntary.\n  Our legislation creates no new entitlement. Instead, it encourages \nfamily responsibility, by offering parents the help they need to \npurchase affordable health insurance for their children.\n  The bill does not create any new bureaucracies--either Federal or \nState. The Federal Government already collects tobacco taxes, and all \nStates have agencies that run their Medicaid, public health, and \nchildren's health insurance programs.\n  Our legislation builds on what the States are already doing. Fourteen \nStates have their own public programs on which our proposal is modeled. \nAnother 17 States have private programs to subsidize the cost of child-\nonly coverage for low-income families.\n  Finally, our proposal builds on the private insurance industry. \nStates choosing to participate will contract with private insurers to \nprovide child-only private coverage. Subsidies will be available to \nhelp families purchase the coverage for their children, or to \nparticipate in employment-based health plans.\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\n  Even families not eligible for the financial assistance will be \nhelped by this plan, since children's health insurance policies will be \nwidely available in all States as a result of this proposal.\n  Under our plan, $20 billion over the next 5 years will be available \nto expand health insurance for children, and an additional $10 billion \nwill be available for deficit reduction beyond what is provided in the \nbudget agreement.\n  Paying for this program by an increase in the cigarette tax is both \nlogical and practical. The link between smoking and children's health \nis obvious. If we do nothing, 5 million of today's children will die \nfrom smoking-related illnesses.\n  For years, tobacco companies have cynically targeted the Nation's \nchildren. It is appropriate now to ask those companies and smokers to \nmake a contribution to the cost of health insurance for children. By \nproviding a specific financing source to cover the cost of the program \nwe are doing the fiscally responsible thing.\n  Some will oppose this legislation on the grounds that the $16 billion \nalready included in the budget over the next 5 years is enough. But the \nfact is, the $16 billion is barely enough to cover the 3 million \nuninsured children already eligible for Medicaid but not participating. \nIn total, it will cover only 3.7 million children of the 10\\1/2\\ \nmillion who are uninsured. Let me repeat that: It will cover only 3.7 \nmillion children of the 10 million uninsured.\n  The budget agreement is an important step forward. But that \nimprovement is not enough to help the seven million other children in \nhard-working families whose parents will still make too much to qualify \nfor Medicaid but not enough to buy the health care their children need. \nThe Hatch-Kennedy plan fills that large gap.\n  Some will oppose this legislation on the grounds that the budget \nagreement was designed to cut taxes, not increase them. But a cigarette \ntax increase is a user fee and affirmative step to improve health care. \nIt is not like other taxes. If you don't smoke, you don't pay the tax. \nWe all know the heavy costs that tobacco companies and smokers inflict \non all taxpayers. The average pack of cigarettes sells for $1.80 \ntoday--and it costs the Nation $3.90 in smoking-related costs. This \nproposal helps in a modest way to offset those costs.\n  Every poll shows that, unlike other tax increases, raising the \ncigarette tax has overwhelming public support. The only people who \ndon't like this increase are the tobacco companies and their lobbyists.\n  Some will claim that this program will displace existing private \ninsurance coverage. But our bill has strong safeguards to prevent this \nfrom happening. In fact, it has not occurred in the States that have \nalready acted to implement similar programs.\n  Some will argue that this program creates new mandates on States or \nnew entitlements. But anyone who reads the bill will see that it does \nnot. Participation is voluntary for States. The requirements for \nparticipation are no greater than for other, typical Federal grants to \nStates for health care. The bill states clearly that it creates no new \nindividual entitlement.\n  Obviously, we are not voting today on the specific provisions of our \nlegislation. There will be plenty of time for adjustment and \nimprovement as it moves through Congress. But this vote on the budget \nresolution is the key vote that determines whether the overall budget \nwill contain room for this program, financed by a tobacco tax increase, \nthat will guarantee every family affordable coverage for their \nchildren.\n  Big tobacco opposes this legislation. They are powerful and well-\nfunded, but they do not deserve to succeed in their effort to block our \namendment. A vote for this amendment is a vote for children's health \ncare and a vote against the insidious and shameful poisoning of \ngenerations of children by the tobacco industry. Enough is enough is \nenough.\n  An extraordinary 72 percent of the American people support this \nprogram. Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, low-\nincome families and high-income families, North, South, East, and \nWest--support is overwhelming. The question is whether democracy still \nworks. The American people understand the choice we are making today--\nand Congress should listen to their views. How can any Senator say no?\n  I would like to close by telling my colleagues the story of the \nchildren in two families.\n  Sylvia Pierce of Everett, MA, didn't think twice about taking one of \nher four children to the doctor, when her husband was alive. The family \nmedical bills were covered under her husband's health insurance that he \ngot through his job. When one of the children needed a shot, Pierce \ntook the child to the doctor; if the baby had an earache, Pierce got a \nprescription. ``People don't realize what a luxury health insurance \nis,'' Pierce said. ``I know I didn't. I took it for granted. I never \nthought about it; I never worried about it.'' That all changed October \n6, 1993, when her husband was murdered. In an instant, Pierce's life \nwas changed forever. Gone was the father of her children, the family's \nmain breadwinner--and its health insurance, leaving her four children, \n13-year-old Leonard, 8-year-old Brian, 6-year-old Alyssa, and the baby, \nJillian, unprotected. ``It was the middle of the winter, the worst time \nof year as far as kids and sickness are concerned,'' Pierce said. ``The \nkids were always catching something at school, and the baby had \nearaches and needed to have her immunizations. I kept postponing her \nshots because I didn't have the money. It was a very anxious time.''\n  ``I didn't choose to be in this situation * * * We've got to take \ncare of our children. They can't speak for themselves so we have to \nspeak for them.''\n  Maria lives in California. Shortly after Maria entered a new school \nas a third grader, her progress reports indicated that she seemed to be \nperforming far below her potential. A health examination arranged by \nher school revealed that Maria had suffered multiple ear infections--\nprobably over a period of several years. Maria's father ran a small \nyard maintenance business, but was not able to afford health insurance \nfor her. As a result, her parents were unable to obtain treatment for \nher ear infections. Without timely and thorough medical attention, scar \ntissue had built up, causing her to become deaf in one ear and have \nhearing loss in the other. Maria's inability to access affordable \nmedical care affects not only her physical health but her educational \ndevelopment as well.\n  Every day we delay means more children like Maria and like Leonard \nand Brian and Alyssa and Jillian suffer. It is time to say, ``enough.'' \nWe have failed our children long enough.\n  Children are the country's future. When we fail children, we also \nfail the country and its future. We all know what's at stake. For \nchildren, this vote is the most important vote we will cast in this \nentire Congress.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might just, first, ask that every \nSenator who is interested in this amendment and what it does, that they \nget a copy of the amendment. Look through it. Turn one sheet after \nanother. See if you find mentioned in this document cigarette taxes. \nSee if you see it in here.\n  There is no mention of cigarette taxes in this. The reason is, you \ncannot, in a budget resolution, carry out a mandate that a cigarette \ntax be imposed. Let me repeat. If this amendment is adopted, there is \nno assurance that a cigarette tax will be imposed because you cannot do \nthat in a budget resolution. So let us look at it, page by page. There \nis no mention of a cigarette tax. I repeat to Senator Hatch, my very \ngood friend, that there is absolutely no assurance and no way, in a \nbudget resolution, that you can instruct the Finance Committee of the \nSenate of the United States to levy any kind of tax specifically.\n  You can change the total amount of taxation and say, ``We sure hope, \nwhen you change that, that you will pass a cigarette tax.'' I tell you \nthat because the budget resolution is not the place to argue about what \na tax package is going to look like specifically, especially with \nreference to imposing a new one.\n  Second, for those who are interested in cutting taxes--I assume there \nare a whole bunch of people on our side who want to cut taxes, and I \nthink there are\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\nsome on this side who want to cut taxes--if this amendment is adopted, \nwhile it does not mandate a cigarette tax, believe it or not, it cuts \nthe taxes that you can cut by $30 billion. So that will be a wonderful \naccomplishment, especially by conservative Senators on this side of the \naisle, that essentially the only thing you are assured they accomplish \nis that there will be a tax cut for the American people that will be \nless than we expected when we got this budget resolution passed. That \nis just the arithmetic of an instruction to the committee--just plain \narithmetic. Having said that, there should be no bones about it, \nbecause of what I have just said with reference to a tax cut and with \nreference to adding more money to programs, this is in violation of the \nbipartisan agreement.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, I do not know who is going to \nlobby this in behalf of the agreement. I do not know who is going to \nlobby from the White House or from the office of the minority leader. I \ndo know Senator Lott and I intend to defeat this. So we are not only \ngoing to be lobbying, we are going to be working to see that this \nagreement that we entered into is kept and not violated by this \namendment or any other amendment. For, make no bones about it, if you \nadopt this amendment, this agreement is wide open, if you believe \nanybody on this side of the aisle or that side of the aisle who wants \nto live under this is going to sit by for a major change like this. \nEssentially, the principal change is to reduce the amount of money you \ncan cut taxes by $30 billion.\n  Let me also say, fellow Senators, and anyone listening here today, \nwhatever the wonderful discussions by well-meaning Senators--and they \nare all well-meaning, I say that to my friend, Senator Hatch, looking \nright at him, wonderfully intentioned--the issue of covering children \nin America who are not covered by insurance, listen up, Americans: They \nare all covered in this agreement. The President claims victory in this \nagreement. And guess what he says, Senator Kennedy, when he said this \nis a great agreement--5 million Americans, and he put up his hand with \nhis 5 fingers like that--5 million Americans, young children, are going \nto be covered by health insurance because I made a deal to make sure \nthat occurs.\n  So let us make sure that the speeches about covering children, \ntrying, in this debate, to tie that to raising a cigarette tax--and \nanother day, another place, another way, perhaps many Senators would \nvote for a cigarette tax increase. Perhaps.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator just yield on that point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to finish this thought.\n  Mr. President, this cigarette tax is not needed. We need not break \nthis agreement to cover children who are uncovered, in terms of health \ninsurance, because they are covered. Let me tell you how much they are \ncovered by. There is $16 billion--one-six--$16 billion in new money in \nthis agreement that is there specifically and singularly to cover \nchildren who do not have insurance. All 5 million are covered by the \n$16 billion.\n  Let me suggest that the White House in these negotiations put before \nus a plan to cover the 5 million young people, 5 million young children \nin America. They put forth a plan and they said it is going to be very \ndifficult to find out how to cover these young children because we do \nnot have any experience in it. We do not have any insurance policies \nout there to cover them. But $16 billion ought to do the job.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on my time for 1 minute?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to make it clear, in the budget is \nsome $16 billion. The Medicaid costs are $860 per person. If you work \nthat out, that covers 3.7 million.\n  I think the President said ``up to 5 million.'' So, there is a major \npart of that group, particularly the working poor, who are not covered \nin that.\n  I strongly support the point that the Senator has made in that we are \ngoing to see progress, and it is important progress. I think we ought \nto at least have an understanding. We have $16 billion and it costs \n$860 to cover each child. If you do the math, it is 3.7 million. The \nPresident, I think, said up to 5 million. I think, frankly, if you do \nthe math, it is a little closer to 3.7 million.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, the truth of the matter \nis that nobody knows, nobody knows today how to cover these children \nwho are uncovered in America. Nobody has a plan. Nobody knows which \nplan to use. Obviously, a very large number ought to be put under \nMedicaid. But they will not all fit under Medicaid, so another plan has \nto be developed for the rest of them. Frankly, this Senator is \nconvinced that we can devise a plan in the Finance Committee of the \nU.S. Senate that will cover them all and will not even use the $16 \nbillion.\n\n  That is just as honest a statement as my friend from Massachusetts \nmakes when he plucks a number, because we do not know what it is going \nto cost. Mr. President, do my fellow Senators know that if you went out \n6 months ago across America and you said, ``Let's buy health insurance \nfor some uninsured kids; let's just go around to the insurance agencies \nand say, `How about giving us an insurance bid,' '' there was no policy \nuntil about 2 months ago when a company decided to issue a policy. \nNobody even knows, since it is the only one, whether its price is going \nto remain when they all start issuing them, for it is, indeed, not \nexpensive to cover children; everybody knows that. One of the reasons \ngiven to cover them is it is not very expensive to cover them.\n  All I am suggesting is that the President of the United States, in \nthis bipartisan agreement, made great, great emphasis to the American \npeople that it was a good agreement for many reasons, and one of them \nwas that we had covered the young people who are not covered with $16 \nbillion in new money.\n  I want to close on this point, and I will have a lot more to say, but \nessentially, this amendment in no way will cause a cigarette tax to be \nimposed if that is the wish of the sponsors, because you cannot do it \nin a budget resolution and you cannot find the words ``cigarette tax'' \nin the boundaries of their amendment, because there is no way to do \nthat. They just have numbers plugged in and they wish the Finance \nCommittee will use the numbers the way they are giving their speeches \non the floor. They are hoping that they will do that, but the Finance \nCommittee does not have to.\n  So what we are doing is, we are tying in kids' coverage, which is \nalready in the agreement, to a national issue on smoking cigarettes. \nAnd it is a national issue. It is a terribly tough issue, but, \nessentially, they are unrelated in terms of the budget resolution. So \nwhat we are doing is asking for more money for a program that is \nalready covered, with no assurance that it will be spent for that \nprogram, and we are calling for a tax increase, with no assurance that \nit will be a cigarette tax, but a real assurance that you will have cut \nthe $85 billion that we are providing for net new taxes by $30 billion, \njust the mathematical effect of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Domenici is absolutely correct. If \nthe Senator from Massachusetts wants to render nugatory the work of all \nthe Senators who labored so long to produce a budget, his amendment is \nthe way to do it.\n  At stake, Mr. President, are the livelihoods of this country's \ntobacco farm families as Senators Kennedy and Hatch attempt to extract \nan additional $30 billion tax increase from the American taxpayers by \nupping the existing 24-cent excise tax to 67 cents.\n  The impact of this proposal, if enacted, would not only devastate the \nSoutheastern economy; it will harm the entire country. It will be \nharmful to the lives of thousands of farm families, to the \nmanufacturing workers who stand to lose their jobs, to the retail-store \nowner and his employees, to the truck driver who delivers the product \nto market, to the farm implement dealer who supplies the tobacco \nfarmer, to the schools financed by taxes levied on tobacco farmers, and \non and on.\n  Mr. President, this tax increase will cost thousands of fine North \nCarolinians their jobs; it will effectively destroy the livelihoods of \nthousands of small family tobacco farmers.\n  According to American Economics Group, Inc., nearly 662,402 citizens \nare employed in the production, manufacturing, and marketing of \ntobacco. If\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\nenacted, the 43-cent excise tax on tobacco products would abolish \n43,000 jobs nationwide, and North Carolina alone would lose 17,849 \njobs.\n  Furthermore, any increase in the cigarette excise tax will fall \ndisproportionally on lower- and middle-income consumers--the citizens \nleast able to pay it. Those earning less than $30,000 annually already \npay 5 times more in excise taxes than those earning $60,000 or more. \nThose families earning less than $30,000 pay a staggering 47 percent of \nall tobacco excise taxes, yet these families earn only 16 percent of \nnational family income.\n  Make no mistake about it--the tobacco tax is not a user fee as so \noften claimed by the proponents of this amendment--it is a tax \nincrease. We all know that when excise taxes are increased on any \nproduct, sales of that product decrease. If tobacco revenues fall short \nof projections--which will certainly be the case because there will be \na substantially smaller tax base--how will the shortfall be made up? \nMore taxes? What other group will be singled out to shoulder this \nfinancial burden?\n  Tobacco has been targeted for enormous tax increases because it is an \neasy way for this Government to take even more money out of the \ntaxpayers' pockets. Smokers, tobacco farmers, and those who work in the \ntobacco industry should not be singled out to shoulder the burden of \npaying for the health care of uninsured children.\n  The anti smoking zealots have made clear that they are willing to do \nalmost anything in order to tax tobacco right out of existence. They do \nnot care about the 18,000 people in North Carolina alone who stand to \nlose their jobs. The proponents of this amendment talk about all the \nchildren they are trying to insure with the revenues from this tax. \nWell, I can guarantee that they'll be able to add more uninsured \nchildren to that list if this tax is enacted. There will be a number of \nfolks without work, and a number of children who will suffer because of \nit.\n  Once we head down this road of using the taxing power of Government \nto discourage Americans from undertaking activities Congress and the \nWhite House find objectionable, or politically incorrect, where will it \nstop?\n  This tax discriminates against an entire region, an entire industry, \nand all people who use tobacco products.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield me 10 minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Ford.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am quite proud of the record I have established over \nthe years in support of programs that help children. No one in this \nChamber is going to suggest that this Senator, this grandfather of \nfive, takes second place to anyone when it comes to priorities \naffecting children. I have supported expanding educational \nopportunities ever since I came to the Senate. Nothing is more \nimportant for our children than education. I have supported full \nfunding for Head Start and the WIC Program and expanding Medicaid \ncoverage to poor children. I have supported child care programs. I have \nsupported the expansion of the earned income tax credit. I have \nsupported a child tax credit that will become, hopefully, a part of \nthis budget. I have supported drug abuse funding to help children. I \nhave supported reasonable environmental initiatives that improve the \nlives of our children. But this is not a debate about whether or not to \nprovide funds for child health care.\n  The budget agreement already includes $16 billion in additional funds \nfor child health care. A vote for this budget agreement, as is, is a \nvote for this country's children. I support the budget agreement that \nwas negotiated earlier because it strikes an important balance. It \nprovides much-needed programs for children from education to health \ncare. It provides much-needed tax relief for middle-income families, \nand it balances the budget by 2002. An enormous amount of what we spend \nin the Federal budget is about children, and I believe that is right \nbecause our children are the most important resource this country has.\n  We have to balance a lot of competing priorities. There is virtually \nno end to what we could spend on educating our children, for instance, \nif money were no object, but money is an object, because we have to \nbalance the size--and I underscore size--of Government with the \nappetite of our constituents to pay taxes. I thought the budget \narrangement announced earlier struck a pretty fair balance. It \nprotected a number of national priorities while balancing the budget. \nAs I have always said, it includes $16 billion for children's health \ncare over 5 years, an amount that we are told will cover approximately \n5 million children.\n  The budget deal assumes that there will be $135 billion in gross tax \ncuts offset by $50 billion in new revenues already. Now we look at the \nKennedy-Hatch proposal. No matter how you look at it, this proposal \nundercuts the budget deal by changing the balance reached in that \nagreement. It requires the Federal Government to be $30 billion bigger \nin tax revenues and at least $20 billion bigger in spending programs. \nTax-and-spend.\n  So, with this amendment, there will only be $55 billion in net tax \ncuts. That is not the agreement I agreed to, the White House signed off \non last week, and it is not the agreement that the American public has \nbeen led to believe they are getting.\n  There are plenty of other problems with the substance of the Kennedy-\nHatch amendment. I do not think the budget deal was about raising \ntaxes. If this amendment is adopted, this budget deal will become more \nand more about raising taxes. Put another way, this amendment reduces \nthe net tax cut in this bill by 35 percent, more than a third. It \nrequires a 60-percent increase in revenue raisers in this bill over the \nnext 5 years. Tax increase, revenue raisers.\n  Let's quit talking about taxes a moment, and let's talk about the \nKennedy-Hatch amendment. While it is true that States have the option \nof denying the new block grant under this amendment, once they decide \nto accept the money, several conditions and mandates--I underscore \nmandates--to the States apply.\n  The Kennedy-Hatch proposal contains 27 separate provisions which \nstate that a State ``shall'' or a State ``must'' or a State ``may not'' \ndo something. States have restrictions on how to write their plan to \ncover children. Who must approve the plan before they receive the \nfunds? HHS. Which children are eligible for health insurance subsidies? \nWhat must be covered under the health insurance policy? You have told \nthe insurance companies what they have to write, who they can contract \nwith--think about that now, who a State can contract with for \npolicies and how--how much they must pay out of State funds to receive \nthis money; what percentage of administrative costs they must cover--\nmandates on the States.\n\n  Having been there and done that, I understand what a Governor has to \ndo, but, if faced with a choice of stretching dollars, a Governor might \nprefer to provide a very basic policy but to cover more children. Under \nthe Kennedy-Hatch amendment, the benefits that must be covered are \nspecified in the bill.\n  What is the cost to the States? The Kennedy-Hatch amendment will cost \nthe States up to $5 billion in additional matching funds, requiring \nthem to raise their money or their taxes. The Kennedy-Hatch amendment \nwill cause cigarette consumption to decline by a minimum of 10 percent. \nThis means that States could lose between $4 and $7 billion in excise \ntaxes if they do not participate in the bill, meaning that even more \nmoney must be made up somewhere else.\n  For weeks and weeks and months and months, there has been a bill \nfiled to get rid of Joe Camel, to get rid of Marlboro Man, to do away \nwith advertising, to do all those things that FDA has regulated, and \nthen just ask FDA to get out of adult choice. But people who will not \nhelp prevent youth from smoking are here with an issue, not solving the \nproblem, they are here with an issue, because if they wanted to solve \nthe problem, they had an opportunity months ago to get on a piece of \nlegislation that would do exactly what FDA is now saying will be in \nregulations.\n  So, Mr. President, don't let anyone say that they want to solve the \nproblem. They, by their own words, have let thousands upon thousands \nupon thousands of kids die because months and months and months ago, \nthey would not get on a bill to help stop youth smoking. Now they have \nan issue: They\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\nwant to raise taxes in order to stop youth from smoking.\n  Well, it tells me something that they want the issue and not a \nsolving of the problem.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just for the benefit of the membership, \nthis legislation is drafted in the historical, traditional way of \namending the Budget Act. There should be no question as to exactly what \nthis legislation is about. It is about providing health insurance for \nworking families who cannot afford it. This is spelled out in the \npurpose of the amendment, which also states that it will be * * * \n``financed by an increase in the tobacco tax.'' What we are voting on \nought to be very clear.\n  Second, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a joint tax review that states that even with the decline in \npotential tobacco use, there still will be $30 billion generated over \nthe period of the next 5 years. This also takes into consideration the \narguments of the Senator from Kentucky.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This is a revenue estimate of your \n     bill, S. 526, introduced with Senator Hatch.\n       Under present law, the excise tax rates on tobacco products \n     are as follows: small cigarettes, $12.00 per thousand; large \n     cigarettes, $25.20 per thousand; small cigars, $1.125 per \n     thousand; large cigars, 12.75 percent of wholesale price (but \n     not more than $30.00 per thousand); snuff, $0.36 per pound; \n     chewing tobacco, $0.12 per pound; pipe tobacco, $0.675 per \n     pound; cigarette papers, $0.0075 per book containing more \n     than 25 papers (with no tax on books containing less than 25 \n     papers); and cigarette tubes, $0.015 per 50 tubes. Under \n     present law, there is no tax on fine cut (roll-your-own) \n     tobacco.\n       Under the bill, the tax on small cigarettes would be \n     increased by $0.43 per pack to $0.67 per pack. The excise \n     taxes on other tobacco products are to be increased by the \n     same percentage increase as the increase (179 percent) on \n     small cigarettes except for the tax on snuff, which would be \n     increased by 569 percent to $2.41 per pound and chewing \n     tobacco which would be increased by 4,975 percent to $6.09 \n     per pound. In addition, an excise tax is to be imposed on \n     fine-cut tobacco equal to the tax on pipe tobacco.\n       The proposed tax increases for small cigarettes and other \n     tobacco products would become effective on October 1, 1997, \n     with floor stocks taxes levied on that date. However, a \n     credit to be applied against the floor stocks tax liability \n     equal to $500 would be allowed every vendor responsible for \n     the payment of floor stocks taxes. We estimate that the floor \n     stocks tax credit would reduce fiscal year 1998 receipts by \n     $400 million from what they otherwise would be.\n       We estimate that this proposal would increase Federal \n     fiscal year budget receipts are as follows:\n\n                                                        [By fiscal years; in millions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Item                    1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007    1998-2002    1998-2007\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncrease small cigarette tax by         5,273    5,633    5,673    5,714    5,753    5,791    5,827    5,864    5,904    5,944       28,046       57,376\n $0.43 per pack.....................\nIncrease other tobacco excise taxes\n by 179%:\n    Large cigarettes................

Mr. President, third, using the figures of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, a reduction of about 10 percent is 4.5 million \nAmericans. By and large, the greatest reductions will be among \nchildren, because they become addicted at the earliest age.\n  Finally, I want to address the issue as to whether this is consistent \nwith the budget resolution. The budget resolution reduces the deficit. \nThis program adds $10 billion in terms of deficit reduction. It \nstrengthens the agreement itself.\n  Second, it does not change spending with regard to potential capital \ngains, the estate taxes, the IRA's, the education programs--none of \nthose will be altered or changed.\n  This is effectively a user fee for those who smoke, and it will \nprovide comprehensive coverage for the millions of children who are not \ncovered.\n  I pay tribute to my friend and colleague from Kentucky because he has \nbeen a champion of children the entire time he has been in the Senate, \nand no one in this Senate ought to doubt his strong commitment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I want to make a point again in a little different way. I am talking \nnow to the U.S. Senate, but, obviously, there are people who pay \nattention who are not in the Senate.\n  So I would like to make sure that everybody that was part of this \nagreement--this agreement--the President of the United States signed \nit. I would like to make sure he somehow or other hears this next \ncouple minutes.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, there can be no more frontal attack \nand violation of this agreement than this amendment. Now let me make it \nclear. It says that the tax cut to the American people is reduced by \n$30 billion. And it says we will spend $20 billion of that. So we are \ngoing to reduce the tax cut and spend more money. And we already cover \nthe children in this agreement.\n  Mr. President, why would we work for 2 or 3 months--and in this \ninstance I say, Mr. President, Mr. President Bill Clinton--why would we \nwork for 3 months to shape an agreement that provides some items that \nRepublicans want and some items that Democrats want, including the \nPresident, and then come to the floor and have the President of the \nUnited States not fully aware that this throws the agreement away? \nPerhaps he is unaware of it this morning. But he ought to be aware of \nit soon.\n  I mean, the agreement is as much as a nullity if you are going to \nviolate it to that extent with this amendment, which will not \nnecessarily accomplish the purposes of its sponsors.\n  I repeat, look at the amendment. Read it line for line. And there is \nno mention, I say to Senator Gorton, of a cigarette tax in this \nbecause, as you know, you cannot do that in budget resolutions. They \nare just numbers. So there is no cigarette tax in here, and no \ncigarette tax assured under this.\n  So I hope everybody understands the significance of it. We can debate \nfor quite some time. I was of the opinion we had an agreement. And I \nwas of the opinion that it was Democrat, Republican, Presidential. And \nI think those who are proposing this amendment better think loud and \nclear and think carefully, do they want the agreement to disappear \nbecause of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand well the procedural objections \nof the distinguished Senator from New Mexico to this amendment. He \nargues that there is no way to be absolutely certain that the Finance \nCommittee will levy a tobacco tax. In a narrow legal sense that is \ncertainly true. Well, to that assertion I simply respond that this is \nnot some hinky-dinky little technical amendment. Everybody here knows \nwhat is involved here.\n  We are having one of the most important debates in this Congress. It \nmay be the most important debate that occurs during this session of \nCongress. We are debating in public. We all know what the stakes are. \nIt is our children versus Joe Camel, nobody doubts that, nobody has any \nproblem with that. In fact, even in the purpose clause of the \namendment, it says financed by an increase in the tobacco tax. So it is \nthere. Make no mistake about it, the question is clear today. History \ncan be made today if our amendment is agreed to.\n  The Finance Committee would have no practical other choice but to \npass the cigarette tax to finance this. Of course, there is no legal \nrequirement to bind their actions but sometimes political and moral \nforces cannot be resisted by mere legal technicalities.\n  If we prevail today, there is no political way to turn back. That is \nwhy so many people are so nervous today. This vote may be the most \nimportant vote we cast this year for the future of our children. Let us \nface it. The people out there are watching. And they are going to hold \nus accountable, especially those 72 percent of the public, according to \nthe Wall Street Journal-NBC poll who support our bipartisan approach. \nIt is Joey versus Joe Camel, and no procedural nicety can obscure this \nreality. And everybody here knows it. So that is what it is coming down \nto.\n  There are $135 billion in total tax cuts, gross tax cuts in this \nbudget agreement. And the fact is, that this is a public health vote \nmuch more than a tax vote. Tobacco is the No. 1 cause of premature \ndeath in this country. And that is costing our country literally tens \nof billions of dollars annually by our own Government estimates.\n  GAO is the one who has given us the figure of 10 million children \nhere who do not have adequate health insurance, 3 million of whom do \nnot even know they qualify for Medicaid. This money in this bill will \nhelp those 3 million children, perhaps. But I have to say, in order to \nget to $16 billion they had to cut the DISH. That is going to be a loss \nto children. So we are talking about taking care of the other 7 million \nchildren that are involved according to the GAO.\n  My amendment does direct the Finance Committee to come up with $30 \nbillion more in revenues. We want this to be done with the tobacco tax \nincrease; and it is the only way it will be done. That is the only way \nyou can adjust the budget to accommodate a tobacco tax increase. If the \nFinance Committee refuses to back the tax, then it will be they, not \nus, who have thwarted the will of 72 percent of the American people who \nsupport this amendment.\n\n  I would like to point out nothing in the bill binds any committee to \nadopt any policy. Many committees may consider changes we have not \nanticipated here today. We have to do the best by providing clear \ndirection on the floor. And if that guidance is not followed we will \nhave to deal with that with subsequent reconciliation and tax bills.\n  So this charge ignores the real issue. The proponents of our \namendment, the Hatch-Kennedy amendment, are making a public choice to \nhelp kids at the expense of the tobacco industry. You can try to gild \nthe lily any way you want, but that is the situation here. Big tobacco \nis fighting back. Who are we going to be with? Are we going to be with \nthe kids or are we going to be with tobacco? That is strictly the \nissue.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time does the Senator want, 10 minutes?\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts off of the \nbudget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I am proud to rise to join Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy as a \ncosponsor of this, and to thank them for their leadership on it. Let me \nsay first of all, that it is absolutely disingenuous to suggest to the \nU.S. Senate that this amendment ought to be voted against or is subject \nto criticism because it reduces the tax cut by $30 billion.\n  Every U.S. Senator knows, by virtue of our experience here and the \npractice on the budget, that we are not allowed to specify the specific \nsource of revenue. But every Senator also knows what the source of \nrevenue would be if we decided to pass this legislation. There is no \nquestion about it.\n  There is no other place that the Finance Committee would go as a \nconsequence of an overwhelming vote of the Senate to say that we should \nprovide this care with the understanding of the sponsors and of all of \nthose proposing that there is one source that we are directing our \nattention to for the revenue. So that is an entire smokescreen. No \nSenator can hide their vote behind that kind of smokescreen today.\n  Second, it is absolutely false to suggest that the $16 billion in the \nagreement is going to provide health care to even the 5 million \nchildren that it claims to, let alone the 10 million children we know \ndo not have coverage today. The math is ascertainable. And the math \nwill tell you that you are only going to cover about 3.7 million \nchildren with the amount of money allocated.\n  The fact is, that last year when Senator Kennedy and I and Senator \nRockefeller and others introduced legislation to provide health care \nfor children, we thought we had an approach. And Senator Hatch and \nothers could not find agreement with it. And there have been some \nchanges since then. But let me tell you, Mr. President, what else has \nhappened since then.\n  There are 750,000 additional children who have lost their private \nhealth insurance in this country in that year that we have not seen fit \nto do what Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch are asking us to do \ntoday--750,000 additional kids.\n  One kid every 35 seconds has lost their health insurance in this \ncountry. And the fact is, that most of those 10 million kids are the \nsons and daughters of parents who are working. Ninety percent of them \nare working. And the vast majority, about 68 or 69 percent, both \nparents are working and are working full time.\n  So why is this necessary, Mr. President? Let me just share with you a \nreal-life story from Massachusetts. Jim and Sylvia Pierce were married \nin 1980. They lived in Everett, MA. Jim was a plumber. They had three \nchildren: Leonard, Brianna, and Alyssa.\n  In October 1993, Sylvia was pregnant with her fourth child when Jim \nwas murdered on his way home from the store. In that one horrible \nmoment, her life changed forever. She not only lost her husband, but, \npregnant and alone, she lost her health insurance as well. Her \nsurvivor's benefits made her income too high to be able to qualify for \nlong-term Medicaid but it was too low to be able to pay the $400 a \nmonth premium that would have extended her husband's health plan so \nthat it would have covered her children. Result--she lost her health \ninsurance, pregnant, and with three children.\n  And she said, ``I've always taken good care of my children. I feed \nthem well; I take them to the doctors immediately when they need it. \nAll of a sudden I couldn't do that anymore.''\n  That is what this debate is about, Mr. President. It is about \nfamilies like that that are trying to provide for their children. It is \nabout teachers who will tell us again and again that children in a \nschool who are disruptive in a class are often the children who have \nnot even been diagnosed for an earache or for an eye problem. We are \nthe only industrial country on this planet that does not provide health \ncare to our children.\n\n  That is unacceptable in 1997. It is unacceptable when we are looking \nat 134 billion dollars' worth of gross tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, every person involved with children will tell us the \nvalue of\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nproviding health care to those kids so that you can provide the long-\nterm preventive care and diagnosis necessary to provide them with full \nparticipation in our society.\n  The Journal of the American Medical Association found that children \nwith coverage gaps are more likely to lack a continuing and regular \nsource of health care, so that if you just have a gap in your coverage, \nthe greater likelihood is you are not going to be able to make it up \nand have any kind of long-term preventative care; and that even when \nfactors, such as family income, chronic illness, and family mobility \nare factored out, numerous studies by university researchers and by \nGovernment agencies show that the uninsured are less likely to receive \npreventative care, such as immunizations, more likely to go to \nemergency rooms for their care, more likely to be hospitalized for \nconditions that could have been avoided with proper preventive care, \nand more likely to have longer hospital stays than individuals with \nhealth insurance.\n  So, in other words, the fact that we nickel and dime this and we \nrefuse to give them coverage actually winds up costing us a lot more in \nthe long run.\n  Mr. President, when you really consider the savings in this, this \nought to be a no-brainer for Members of the Senate. And the fact is, \nthe reason we are turning to cigarettes is because cigarettes are the \ngreatest saver of all. You can leave aside the fact that the Wall \nStreet Journal did a poll that suggested that 72 percent of Americans \nfavor this 43-cent tax, but just think about it on the merits.\n  The fact is, the public supports this bill because they want children \nto have health insurance and they also understand the rationale for \nincreasing the cigarette tax. The cigarette tax is a user fee. For \nthree-quarters of Americans they are not going to pay anything \nadditional. But for the one-quarter of Americans who do smoke, they \nwind up costing Americans an additional $50 billion in direct costs, \nhealth care costs as a consequence of that smoking.\n  Mr. President, the tobacco taxes in the United States today are the \nlowest in the industrial world. And even if we passed this 43-cent tax \nin order to fund health care for children, we would still be far below \nthe tax charged in most of those other countries today.\n  There is a rationale for doing this, a rationale that is \noverwhelming.\n  In the next 24 hours, 3,000 children are going to start smoking.\n  Every 30 seconds a child in the United States starts smoking. And the \nproblem is getting worse because smoking among students in grades 9 to \n12 increased by more than 26 percent from 1991 to 1995.\n  And although 419,000 smokers die each year of smoker-related \ndiseases, the fact is that 89 percent of those who start to smoke by \nthe age of 18 are going to be replaced today or the fact is those \n419,000 are going to be replaced by about 1 million new smokers, which \nmeans that you are going to have about 89 percent of those who are 18 \nwill have started smoking before that.\n  Mr. President, the tobacco tax is known to weed out that early \nsmoking. The tobacco tax, according to the American Cancer Institute, \nsuggests that 835,000 children's lives would be saved. So that is \nreally the choice we face in this vote today. We know that if you raise \nthe taxes on cigarettes, the people with the least amount of disposable \nincome, which are kids, are less accessible to cigarettes. The fact is, \nif 835,000 lives could be saved and we refuse to take the step today to \ndo that, then ask yourself what the complicity is in those additional \n835,000 smokers and deaths that would occur as a consequence.\n  Mr. President, this makes sense. This is important in terms of our \nrising to the standards of the rest of the countries in the world, \nindustrial countries. It makes sense to save countless tax dollars that \nare spent for those people who die, the 419,000 each year, as a result \nof smoking-related disease. It makes sense because it provides children \nwith the opportunity to have the diagnosis of preventive care that \nprovides them with a full opportunity to participate in our society.\n  I think Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy are absolutely correct when \nthey say this is one of the most important votes we will cast. This \ndoes not blow apart any agreement. Do not let any smokescreen to that \neffect cloud a vote here. This agreement can hold together because this \namendment provides for revenue and it provides for making up the \ndifference of what is taken away. In the end, this agreement could go \nforward, and America's children would benefit as a consequence of that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend, the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, we are indeed here for a budget resolution designed to \nultimately lead to a tax decrease for Americans. Advocating the \nKennedy-Hatch proposal is a $30 billion tax increase for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, that is not exactly what I thought a Republican \nCongress had in mind in negotiating with the President of the United \nStates to reach a balanced budget agreement. All of a sudden we throw \nthat out right here in the second day of debate and suggest that we \nraise taxes $30 billion on the American people.\n  Now, which people are we suggesting the taxes ought to be raised \nupon, Mr. President? This is a regressive tax against low-income \nAmericans. All of my colleagues on the left of the political spectrum \nhere are advocating a low-income tax increase of substantial \nsignificance all across America. It seems to me the worst way, even if \nthe Kennedy-Hatch proposal were otherwise something that ought to be \nsupported, the worst possible way to finance it by putting a tax on \nlow-income Americans. So not only is this a new tax in a budget \nresolution designed to give us an opportunity to lower taxes on the \nAmerican people, it is a tax directed at low-income Americans.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, this is a tax that is targeted at \na region of the country. It is no secret that tobacco production is \nlargely confined to the southeastern part of the United States of \nAmerica. No one, as far as I know, is suggesting that cigarette smoking \nor the production of tobacco be made illegal. Controversial though it \nmay be, no one is suggesting it be made illegal.\n  So we have in my State over 60,000 tobacco producers engaged in the \nraising of a legal crop for American citizens. The average tobacco \ngrower, Mr. President, used to have in Kentucky about three-quarters of \nan acre. It is a little bit higher than that now. The typical tobacco \nproducer in my State is a part-time farmer. He probably has a job in a \nfactory. His wife probably works in an apparel or cut-and-sew plant, as \nwe call them. They raise this tobacco on their own. They cut it and \nstrip it on their own. They sell it at auction in November and \nDecember, and it provides Christmas money, or, for many families, a lot \nmore than Christmas. It may be the opportunity to send their kids to \ncollege. Frequently, these kids going to college are the first in the \nfamilies to have that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, 60,000 tobacco producers all across Kentucky are being \nsingled out as they raise a legal crop, being singled out to pay for a \nchildren's health insurance proposal in this budget resolution, and I \nam told by the chairman of the Budget Committee, we have already taken \ncare of that. There is $16 billion for children's health insurance in \nthis budget proposal already. So what is going on here is, you will \nhave a whopping new tax increase on low-income Americans that whacks \nthe Southeastern part of the United States the hardest in order to get \nafter cigarette smoking.\n  Mr. President, I do not smoke. I do not advocate it. I think we need \nto do a better job of keeping cigarettes out of the hands of people who \nare underage. But why in the world should we, in this budget \nresolution, designed, among other things, to give tax relief to the \nAmerican people, whack low-income Americans with a $30 billion tax \nincrease is simply beyond my understanding.\n\n  Now, looking at it from a job-loss point of view, Mr. President, from \na Kentucky jobs point of view, estimates are that there are 78,000 \nKentucky residents who have jobs in sectors linked to the production, \ndistribution, and retailing of tobacco products. By increasing the \nFederal excise tax on cigarettes\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\nby 43 cents per pack, we estimate we would lose 43,000 of those jobs \nand 2,000 of them would be the Kentucky farmers. The total payroll loss \nwould be $70 million in my State. Due to declining cigarette sales, \ntotal State cigarette tax revenues would also drop by just under $7 \nmillion.\n  So not only does this proposal advocate a huge tax increase on low-\nincome Americans, it is also going to lose a significant number of jobs \nin my State and a number of other States across the Southeast all, \nallegedly, to go after a habit that many Americans have, which is not a \nhealthy habit, a habit that I do not participate in, but a habit that \nadults are entitled to engage in if they so choose.\n  Now, Mr. President, this is a very, very serious proposal before the \nSenate. It will do great harm to my State and other States across the \nSoutheast. We do not need to enact this proposal to provide additional \nhealth insurance for children. That is already provided in the budget \nagreement before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate not to adopt this \namendment. It is a huge tax increase. It is a tax increase against low-\nincome people. It is a tax increase targeted at a region of the \ncountry. It will have devastating effects on the economy of my State. I \nstrongly urge the Senate not to approve this proposal.\n  To reiterate, Mr. President, I support this budget's constructive \nadvancement of child health care, but I strongly object to the proposed \namendment's destructive impact on child welfare in my home State of \nKentucky.\n  This budget makes an up-front commitment to address the needs of \nchild health because it is the right thing to do. But it does not place \nthe welfare of children at risk in order to score political points \nagainst Joe Camel. I believe that my colleagues believe that no child \nshould be discriminated against in order to benefit another. But the \nHatch-Kennedy amendment takes this course openly. This amendment makes \nit acceptable to reduce a farm family to abject poverty in order to \nprovide a limited health care benefit. This choice is not necessary. \nThis budget supports the health care of children without destroying the \nfoundation of their family and community.\n  As I have mentioned on this floor before, leading tobacco States like \nKentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia are not the only States whose \neconomies benefit from tobacco. Tobacco is grown on over 124,000 farms \nin 22 States and in Puerto Rico. Tobacco provides jobs to countless \nAmericans. The hundreds of thousands of people involved in the tobacco \nindustry buy cars built in Michigan, refrigerators built in Iowa, \ncomputers from California, and insurance from New York companies.\n  The smokeless tobacco industry includes thousands of small farmers in \nStates like Kentucky, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. \nIn many cases, tobacco provides the cash margin that sustains a \ndiversified family farm operation. Smokeless tobacco companies employ \nworkers in States like Kentucky, Connecticut, Wisconsin, New Jersey, \nWest Virginia, Tennessee, and Illinois. Many tobacco product \ndistributors are in States like Texas and Georgia. With the inevitable \nloss of those jobs, the economic harm will be far-reaching throughout \nthe larger farm and rural communities associated with tobacco.\n  The billions of tax dollars supplied by the many facets of the \ntobacco industry support schools, pay for roads--help build America. \nWhere will these funds come from now? Whose taxes are you going to \nraise next?\n  This amendment will raise excise taxes on all tobacco products \nincluding cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and snuff. This represents a \n179-percent increase from the current 24 cents per pack Federal tax on \ncigarettes; a 569-percent increase on chewing tobacco from 36 cents to \n$2.41 per pound; and a 4,975-percent increase on snuff from 12 cents to \n$6.09 per pound. I am unaware of any other product that has been \nsubjected to such outrageous tax increases. The economic repercussions \nof these taxes are far-reaching in terms of the severe economic \ndisruption they will cause.\n  Excise taxes are regressive and discriminatory. Regressive, because \nthe burden of paying them falls heaviest on low-income Americans. In \n1987, the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] called consumer excise \ntaxes the most regressive type of tax. CBO singles out tobacco excise \ntaxes as the most regressive of all estimating that lower income \npersons pay 15 times more in tobacco taxes as a percentage of income \nthan upper income individuals. A 1993 study by the Council of State \nGovernments calls tobacco a worn-out tax source.\n  The tax on these products will be devastating to those Americans \nwhose household income is less than $30,000.\n  Thousands of American jobs will be affected with such increased taxes \nin the form of lost wages and reduced spending, for example, local \nbanks, farm equipment dealers, seed and feed stores, gas stations, \ngrocery stores, and clothing stores.\n  A 43-cent-per-pack increase in the Federal excise tax increases the \ntotal Federal excise tax to 67 cents per pack and boosts the total \nFederal, State, and local excise tax to around $1 per pack. A 50-cent-\nper-pack increase for cigarettes would cause cigarette consumption to \ndecline by about 11 percent. A decline of this magnitude would reduce \ntotal burley consumption in the United States by about 40 million \npounds. Kentucky produced about 420 million pounds last year. Last year \nthe average price per pound was about $1.90 per pound, this would \nresult in a loss of $76 million in farm income.\n  The American Economics Group, Inc. [AEG] estimates that 78,280 \nKentucky residents have jobs in sectors linked to the production, \ndistribution, and retailing of tobacco products. By increasing the \nFederal excise tax on cigarettes by 43 cents per pack approximately \n4,310 of these jobs would be lost, 2,019 would be farmers. Total \npayroll loss would be $70 million. Due to declining cigarette sales, \ntotal State cigarette tax revenues will drop by $6.7 million.\n  Tens of thousands of Kentuckians earn a living from the growing, \nharvesting, manufacturing, and marketing of tobacco products. \nAdditionally, nearly $130 million of Kentucky's tax revenue relates to \ntobacco production, and local governments receive approximately $5.5 \nmillion in property taxes from the value of the quota system alone. \nWhere will this tax revenue come from when Kentucky farmers are taxed \nout of existence?\n  Mr. President, if this tax increase is passed, who is going to pay \ntheir bills, provide them with job opportunities, and pay their health \ncare? Who? If this tax increase is passed, you will see a ripple effect \nthat will be devastating to rural communities in Kentucky.\n  Supporters of the Hatch-Kennedy amendment have spoken often of the \nhealth care needs of America's children. For Kentucky families, the \nhealth of their children is not limited to an insurance benefit. The \nhealth of our communities and our families is directly related to the \nhealth of our children. For Kentucky's rural towns and counties, \ntobacco is their lifeblood.\n  This amendment will dramatically impact the ability of Kentucky \nfarmers to provide a living for their families. The tremendous loss of \nincome will affect whole communities. Most tobacco farmers operate on \nborrowed money from the local bank. Where farmers have been in a \nposition to diversify, they have done so but they have borrowed the \nmoney and use tobacco income to pay back the loans. Land values will \ndecline. Bankers are going to be less likely to make loans. Rural \ncommunities will be decimated.\n  Mr. President, the farmers in my State of Kentucky and across the \ncountry are real people, people with feelings, and people who are hard \nworking. The income they generate does not go toward a lavish \nlifestyle. The money is used to put food on the table, pay the \nmortgage, keep the car running, support the church, educate their \nchildren, and makes Santa Claus real at Christmas.\n  For over 200 years, tobacco has played an integral role in Kentucky's \nhistory and economy. More burley tobacco is grown in Kentucky than \nanywhere in the world. The average farmer grows less than three acres \nof tobacco, and there is no other crop which provides the income \ntobacco does on such small acreage. The economics of this intensively \nmanaged crop do not transfer to planting soybeans, peanuts, or corn. \nThere have been attempts to replace tobacco production with other \ncrops; however, almost none are economically sustaining.\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\n  In eastern Kentucky the impact will be particularly devastating. \nThese are proud, and hardworking families with few alternatives. Their \nfarms are small and tobacco is their only form of income.\n  Tobacco is one of the most economically productive crops for the type \nof soil we have in Kentucky, and researchers have yet been unable to \nfind a viable alternative.\n  Tobacco is a traditional crop for my home State, but Kentuckians do \nnot grow it simply to keep a tradition alive. Tobacco is a hard, labor \nintensive crop. Imagine the strength and sweat it takes to cut and \nspear a pound plant in the heat and humidity of a southern August day. \nNow imagine repeating that effort until--pounds of tobacco are cut, \nhauled, and hung in the barn for curing. Kentuckians grow tobacco \nbecause no other crop provides the same level of economic return.\n\n  Forcing farmers to leave tobacco for an unsuitable crop is \nirresponsible and will cause irreparable damage to thousands of \nKentuckians.\n  We have too many big-picture economists and self-appointed experts \nwho say farmers can find something else to grow, few have ever been to \na tobacco farm to even know what it looks like. If they would go with \nme to Morgan, Owsley, or Wolfe Counties, where over three-fourths of \ntheir farm income comes from tobacco, it becomes very clear why I say \nthere are not many alternatives. Twenty-three counties, all in eastern \nKentucky, rely on tobacco for more than one-half of their farm income.\n  Owsley County--88 percent of farm income is from tobacco.\n  Wolfe County--80 percent of farm income is from tobacco.\n  Morgan County--75 percent of farm income is from tobacco.\n  If they could diversify they would. In western Kentucky, where the \nland is flat, they are growing tomatoes and peppers. In central \nKentucky, they have beef and dairy cattle. But in eastern Kentucky, the \nchoices are coal, tobacco, or welfare. The options simply are not \nthere, no matter what the experts say.\n  Beyond the farm gate, tobacco farming is immensely important to \nhundreds of small rural communities. Without the tobacco program the \nvalue of farmland would fall dramatically, local tax bases would be \nwiped out, and the loss of income from leasing the tobacco quota or \ngrowing the crop would reduce the standard of living dramatically \nacross my State.\n  The real travesty of an excise tax increase would be the impact on \nfamily farmers who have been helping to stabilize and revitalize our \nrural communities. In Bath County nearly 50 percent of all personal \nincome comes from tobacco sales. That means it keeps a steady flow of \nmoney going into the community.\n  If this tax goes through, how are tobacco farmers going to pay the \nlocal truck dealership, church, the farm equipment store, the seed and \nfertilizer store, the local independent bank, and all the other \nimportant elements in the community.\n  There is just no disputing the fact that Kentucky burley brings in \nfar more money than any other crop raised in the State.\n  The average Kentucky tobacco farmer gets about $3,500 in revenue from \nan acre of tobacco, but that same acre generates nearly $37,500 in \nexcise taxes for Federal, State, and local governments.\n  Other sectors will be impacted by this outrageous tax increase such \nas convenience stores. The convenience store industry is concerned that \nthe large tax increase on tobacco products will invite substantial tax \nevasion, and concurrently, expand the underground market for tobacco \nproducts. They are also very concerned about the increase of security \nrisks for convenience stores and other tobacco retailers.\n  In many retail formats, including convenience stores the value of \ntobacco inventory will dramatically increase. Cigarettes are already \nbeing locked up in grocery stores because of the shrinkage and theft \nrisk that they pose.\n  In fact, the convenience store industry has already seen many cases \nin which, because the amount of money in the cash register is kept low, \nan armed robber has opted to rob cigarettes. With such increased excise \ntaxes, a carton of cigarettes will be the most expensive item in any \nconvenience store. This poses serious security concerns.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, I do not use tobacco products. \nHowever, the proposed increased excise tax on tobacco products will \nimpact me and every nonsmoker across the country. The excise taxes on \ntobacco products, as proposed will have a dramatic impact: jobs will be \nlost, sales and income tax revenues to the local, State, and Federal \ngovernments will be lost, unemployment will increase, businesses will \nshut down, and family farmers will go bankrupt. The men and women who \ngrow tobacco, who rely on the money from tobacco, cannot bear this \nunfair tax.\n  I do not believe it is fair or equitable to single out one industry \nor region to finance such a proposal.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I yield a minute off the \nbill and 4 minutes from our time to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. A couple of \nquick points that ought to be made. This amendment, the amendment of \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Hatch, reduces the budget deficit. I hope \nthat point has been made. It does reduce it by $10 billion. That is \nspecifically the amount. It does not change a single spending cut or \ntax cut that has been proposed in the budget agreement. It does none of \nthat whatever, and it is consistent with what is already in the budget \nagreement. It would help children that do not have health insurance. It \nis very complementary to the budget resolution.\n  Let me say this. When I went to West Virginia 33 years ago, I went as \nsomething called a VISTA volunteer, sort of an untrained social worker \ntrying to do good in West Virginia. I worked in a small coal mining \ncommunity, and my life at that point was involved entirely with \nchildren who did not have any health insurance, or any education, for \nthat matter, because the schoolbus would not come to pick them up.\n  Something that has stayed with me forever, since I was a VISTA \nvolunteer, which I have acted on in terms of moral angst and fervor \nsince then, has been the condition of children, particularly regarding \nhealth care. I have to report that the children of the children with \nwhom I was a VISTA volunteer do not have health insurance. In fact, 12 \npercent of our children in West Virginia do not have any health \ninsurance.\n  We talk about the most industrialized nation in the world, and that \nis true, but when you think of certain situations on a case-by-case \nbasis, how can it be that, as a society that has our resources and our \ncapacity, that takes 10 million children, and says they cannot have \nhealth insurance even though the majority of their parents are working, \nit is not fair. America and democracy are based like the progressive \nincome tax, on a concept of fairness. To take 10 million children, most \nof whom have a parent or parents working, playing by the rules, paying \ntaxes, and saying you cannot have health insurance because the person \nfor whom your parent works does not provide health insurance and you, \non your own, cannot afford it, and therefore you--this particular \nchild--are not going to have health insurance, is fundamentally morally \nrepugnant. I think every Senator, in fact, would agree with that.\n  So here we have a marvelous opportunity to help them, and not only to \nhelp them in this amendment, but to help them in the budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, if your heart does not persuade you to this position, \nyour head ought to. That point has been made. That is, we are talking \nabout preventive medicine for the budget in the future, as well as \npreventive medicine for children in our immediate time. How can we \nexpect these children to excel at school; how can we expect them to \nperform at school and learn the skills they need if they do not have \nbasic health insurance?\n  Between 1987 and 1995 the percentage of children with job-based \ninsurance actually declined from 67 to 50 percent. Every minute that \ngoes by, another child loses his or her private insurance.\n  This is the year that can make history for Republicans and Democrats \nalike. It can be the year remembered as the one we prove that we can do \nsomething, together, about a problem we all\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\nacknowledge, we all know doesn't make sense, and we all say needs a \nresponse.\n  I want to congratulate the Hatch-Kennedy amendment because it takes \nthe next step. Senators Hatch and Kennedy once again have paved the way \nfor true bipartisan, common sense action in an area where Americans are \nvery clear. Children count. Even better news is that this partnership \nof two Senators reflects broadening support and momentum that now must \nbuild into real results. The budget resolution before us includes $16 \nbillion to expand health care. Money that can fund the Medicaid-based \nbill that Senator Chafee and I have proposed to expand coverage for \nchildren, with the bipartisan support of many of our colleagues.\n\n  This amendment should pass. The Hatch-Kennedy amendment takes the \nnext step, with the money to make it possible to get most or all \nuninsured children the health care they need.\n  I am in the leadership on the Democratic side over here, and I am \nvoting against virtually all amendments to protect the integrity of the \nbudget agreement. But this amendment, as Senator Hatch said, is a big \ndaddy. It is a big, big daddy. We are discussing health care, again, on \nthe Senate floor, and we are discussing it for children, which is the \nplace where we ought to be beginning.\n  I have spent too many years in a State that I love, in a country that \nI love, as president of the National Commission on Children, going \naround this country, going around my State, seeing children who do not \nhave health insurance, seeing what happens to them, to not be extremely \nsupportive of an opportunity to pass an amendment and to cure that \nproblem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to yield to Senator Faircloth \nsuch time as he needs. I yield up to 10 minutes.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, how much time does each side have on the \namendment itself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the amendment, the Senator from New Mexico \nhas 28 minutes and 52 seconds, and the Senator from Utah has 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We do intend on our side to use time off the bill in \nfurther debate so Senators should not be concerned on our side about \nthe 28 minutes. I will yield off the bill.\n  We should be debating back and forth, and when it is our turn again, \nI ask unanimous consent that Senator Judd Gregg be recognized to speak \nnext and he be given up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to voice strong opposition to \nthis amendment because it simply is another tax on the American family. \nIt is a tax increase, Mr. President, nothing more.\n  This is a $30 billion solution to a far less expensive problem. The \nbudget agreement already sets aside $16 billion over 5 years for \nchildren's health insurance. That will extend coverage to 5 million \nuninsured children.\n  Further, there are 3 million children that are now covered under \nMedicaid who, quite simply, have not yet been signed up. There are \nestimates of 2 million more uninsured children, and, of course, they \ncan be covered for far less than $30 billion. Consequently, Mr. \nPresident, this $30 billion tax package is nothing more than an old-\nfashioned tax increase.\n  We sit here and we hear it is a great opportunity. However, Mr. \nPresident, has there ever been a tax increase that was not an \nopportunity to further gouge the working people of this country? Sure, \nit is always good politics to give a speech about tobacco, and the \ncameras love it. But this vote is not about tobacco, Mr. President, it \nis about a tax increase. It is not about children, Mr. President, it is \nabout another tax increase on the American people.\n\n  I remember sitting in the House Chamber at President Clinton's State \nof the Union Address in 1995. He said that ``the era of big Government \nis over.'' The President campaigned for a middle-class tax cut in 1992 \nand 1996.\n  I recall that we insisted that Government live within its means. I \nremember that the people wanted less Government, not more. That is what \nthe election was about. We told them we would balance the budget and \ncut taxes.\n  Mr. President, nobody campaigned on a $30 billion tax increase, but \nwe did campaign to cut taxes. The President did, too. This tax increase \nwould reduce the net tax cut to $55 billion. That is not the tax cut \nthat we promised the American people. We promised to do better, and we \ncan do better. The American people deserve better than a watered down \ntax cut. We give with one hand and we take with the other.\n  This $30 billion tax increase is not the sole cost to the American \npeople of this bill. No, Mr. President, the costs go farther. Tobacco \nis used in the calculation of the Consumer Price Index. Since the tax \nwill increase the cost of tobacco, the Consumer Price Index will rise, \ntoo. A portion of the Federal budget is based upon the Consumer Price \nIndex. This will have an impact of $4 billion over 5 years. This is \n$1.4 billion over 5 years in lost Federal tax revenue, lost revenue, \nand another $2.6 billion over 5 years in increased expenditures due to \nthe CPI rise.\n  This is a plan that attaches a $30 billion tax increase to an \nunfunded mandate no less. It will force additional costs upon the \nStates. Not only will it cost the States more money, it is going to dry \nup one of their major sources of revenue, tobacco tax revenues. This \n$30 billion tax increase will reduce sales, and that drop will reduce \nthe tax revenues to the States by $6.5 billion.\n  The first bill we passed in 1995 was the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act. \nIt passed the Senate with 86 votes. But this is simply an unfunded \nmandate coming around the backside disguised as something else.\n  It is like all of these new programs that come out of Washington. At \nfirst the Federal Government picks up a major portion of it. However, \nwhen the costs of the new program rise, the States will be responsible \nfor the ever-growing difference between the Federal Government share \nand the program costs.\n  The entire proposal is just another unfunded mandate, a new law \nthrust upon the States, and one not paid for in Washington.\n  This amendment places more than 30 new mandates on participating \nStates. Thirty new mandates. It requires all State plans to be approved \nby the Department of Health and Human Services. This means more big \nGovernment, more bureaucracy. If States fund abortions through their \nMedicaid Program, for example, this will force them to pay for \nabortions for teenagers that come in under this new program. The States \ncannot set up two different sets of benefits.\n  Like every other Federal program, the costs will go through the roof, \nand the taxpayers will be left holding the bag to pay the bill.\n  Why? So we can run back home and tell people we stood up against \ntobacco. We will not go back and tell them that we levied a $30 billion \nnew tax on them and drove some farmers from the land. We were strong. \nWe stood up against tobacco.\n  But this is the type of unfunded mandate that we were supposed to \nstop with S. 1 in 1995. But just 2 years after we passed it, here we go \naround the back to pass another mandate on the States. And that is \nsimply what this is.\n  Mr. President, I also hear some grumbling about the small tax cuts in \nthis budget package. I think the tax cuts are too small for working \nfamilies, of course, but some of the grumbling comes from Senators who \nare concerned about the ``distribution'' of the tax cut. Mr. President, \nthe cigarette tax is the most regressive tax on the Federal books.\n  Families making under $30,000 per year earn 16 percent of the \nnational family income. They pay slightly over 1 percent of the Federal \nincome taxes. But they pay 47 percent of the tobacco excise tax. This \nbill increase taxes on families making less than $30,000. We are going \nto increase their taxes by $230 a year.\n  If we were thinking about putting a tax increase on families making \nless than $30,000 a year from any other source than tobacco, the Senate \nwould rise up in righteous revolution. Yet, under the guise of getting \nthe tobacco farmers, so many of them acquiesced.\n  These taxes are so regressive that high- and low-income families pay \nalmost exactly the same amount of tax rather than the same rate of tax.\n  This is the most regressive tax on the books. I find it odd that some \nof the\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\nbiggest supporters are the same people preaching equity in the tax \nrelief package. If ever there was an inequitable tax, this is it, but I \ndon't hear their complaints.\n  Mr. President, we have a plan that raises taxes by $30 billion, and \nchanges the Consumer Price Index to result in $1.4 billion in lost \nFederal revenues, and $2.6 billion in increased Federal spending. It \nreduces State tax revenues by $6.5 billion, and it wipes out 30,000 \njobs, which means hardship and pain for families across the South.\n  So, in an attempt to insure 2 million children, we are looking at a \n$40 billion package.\n  I support efforts to bring coverage to these children, but this is \nnot the right approach, and the taxpayers deserve a seat at the table \nhere.\n  I ran for the Senate and promised the people of my State that I would \nnot vote for any tax increase under any circumstances at any time for \nanything. I intend to live by my commitment and to oppose this massive \ntax increase and assault on North Carolina farm families with all the \nstrength within me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the pending \namendment. I am pleased to join with the Senators from Utah and \nMassachusetts in supporting this bipartisan effort to launch one of the \nmost important health initiatives since the creation of Medicare in \n1965.\n  At the start of the 105th Congress both the Democratic and Republican \nleadership included comprehensive children's health insurance \nlegislation on their agendas for action. I applauded this decision and \nbelieve that the amendment before us today moves us closer to enacting \nuniversal children's health care legislation.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee I have been \nactively involved in the negotiations and difficult decision, that \nresulted in this bipartisan balanced budget agreement which will \ncontrol spending, encourage economic development and balance the budget \nin 2002. And I have been an adamant proponent of Medicaid and the need \nto maintain the health safety net for millions of children, pregnant \nwomen, the disabled, and senior citizens. Because of my role in the \ndevelopment of this agreement I recognize the fact that there is little \nroom in the current confines of the budget to significantly expand \nMedicaid or other health discretionary programs to serve the 10\\1/2\\ \nmillion children who today lack any health care coverage. We cannot \nsimply turn our backs on these children and their working parents. If \nchildren are truly our priority, we must be more creative in finding \nappropriate solutions.\n  The amendment before us will do just that. It will allow for an \nincrease in the cigarette tax to fund a program that helps working \nparents purchase health insurance for their children or offset the cost \nof premiums, copayments or deductible for employer provided health \ninsurance. It does not create a new Federal entitlement program--it \nrelies on the private insurance market as opposed to a Government run \nplan. In many ways it is very similar to the structure of the Medicare \nProgram which we all know is one of the most successful public/private \nprograms currently administered by the Federal Government.\n  This amendment will not hinder the enactment of a balanced budget \nplan. It does not add one dime to the deficit, as it is entirely funded \nthrough the cigarette tax. It is fiscally responsible and does not \nviolate any part of the bipartisan balanced budget agreement.\n  Some are arguing that we do not need to enact this act as the \nagreement will provide an additional coverage for 5 million children. \nWhile this is an important first step, who wants to tell those other \n5\\1/2\\ million children that they will lose in this agreement? These \nare real children who are in our classrooms, in our homes, in our \nstreets, and in our communities.\n  Today, we have the chance to provide real security for working \nfamilies and to make a positive step forward for all children in our \ncountry. I believe we have a moral obligation as adults to address the \ngrowing health care crisis facing these 10\\1/2\\ million children, \nchildren who have no direct access to quality comprehensive health \ncare, children whose only exposure to health care is the emergency \nroom. In town hall meetings and community meetings across my State, the \npeople I represent have told me that children and their future must be \nour priority.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important for us to realize that, if \nenacted, this proposal would actually have a more positive impact on \nthe deficit than will ever be scored by CBO. A sick child cannot \nsucceed in the classroom and becomes an unhealthy adult with few \neconomic opportunities. As we learned a long time ago from the WIC \nProgram, a little prevention goes a long way. Providing affordable \ncomprehensive health insurance coverage for millions of children will \npay huge dividends in the future. It does little good to help \ncommunities develop the classroom of the 21st century when children are \nsuffering from diseases and illnesses of the 19th century.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support this amendment so that we \ncan move one step closer to ensuring that no child goes without \nnecessary medical treatment and that every parent who works hard can \nprovide health security for their children.\n  Today, let us make the same commitment to our children that we have \nmade to senior citizens by protecting the solvency of the Medicare \nsystem. I urge adoption of this important amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 20 minutes; the \nSenator from New Mexico has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield myself such time as I may consume off the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the proposal that \nhas been brought forward by the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I oppose it on a variety of different levels, and let me \ntalk about them.\n  First off, let us go back to where we stand here. We have before us a \nbudget agreement, a bipartisan budget agreement that was worked out in \nnegotiations, extensive negotiations, between the White House, the \nRepublican leadership of the House and Senate, and the Democratic \nleadership of the House and Senate, at least relative to the Budget \nCommittee, and that agreement included in it language to address the \nissue of uncovered children who are of a low income. Let us define the \nsize of this issue for a second because there has been a lot of \nmisrepresentation on this so far on this floor.\n  There are about 9.8 million kids who it is believed do not have \ninsurance, or about 13.8 percent of the child population of the \ncountry. Of that group, 3.7 million are qualified to be covered by \nMedicaid. In other words, under the law that we presently have, they \nreally do have insurance; they just have not been brought in under \nMedicaid. So we do not need a new law to cover those kids. And of that \nnumber, that 9.8, we have reduced it now by 3.7 and you are down to \n6.1. Of that 6.1 that is left, about 2.9 million are over 200 percent \nof poverty--over 200 percent of poverty--which means that the family \nhas an income of some ability and for some reason they are not using \nthat income to cover those children.\n  So the number of kids that are under 200 percent of poverty who are \nuncovered by Medicaid is really 3.2 million. So that is the population \nwe are talking about.\n  Now, in this bill, the bipartisan agreement that was reached, \napproximately $16 billion was set aside to cover children of low income \nwho are not covered. That is a very significant commitment and \ncertainly more than enough money to pick up 2.9 million children--to \npick up the 3.2 million children who are uncovered today and to also \nmake sure that in the Medicaid accounts we can pick up those children\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\nwho are covered today under Medicaid but have not been brought in under \nMedicaid.\n  So this bill as it is proposed, as it was brought forward, the \nbipartisan agreement as it was brought forward already had in it a very \nsubstantial commitment to children who do not have health insurance who \nare in low-income families.\n\n  What else would you expect? Essentially, one of the great insults of \nthis amendment, one of the great insults of this amendment is it is \nsaying that the President of the United States, who reached this \nagreement on this budget, does not care about children, does not care \nabout uninsured children. Essentially, that is what one of the \nunderlying tones of this amendment is. Or I suspect some of the authors \nof this amendment feel this way anyway, that the Republicans do not \ncare about uncovered children, which I would argue is totally \ninaccurate and inappropriate but maybe from a partisan standpoint is a \npoint made.\n  It is ironic that one of the elements of this proposal is a \nrepresentation that the bipartisan budget package, which has in it $16 \nbillion specifically directed at children who are not presently \nreceiving health care insurance and who are in low-income families, is \nnot enough, that the President did not know what he was doing; that he \ndoes not care; therefore, we have to have this brand new layer placed \non top of the package.\n  It really is a position which is hard to defend just on its face. But \non the face of its indefensibility let us go into the substance of it \nbecause the substance of this proposal is totally indefensible.\n  There has been a representation made that this is a discretionary \nprogram. If this is a discretionary program, my golf game is the same \nas Tiger Woods'. They are about as closely related. The fact is that \nthis is not a discretionary program or anywhere near in the ballpark of \ndiscretionary programs. This is a mandatory unfunded mandate on the \nStates. It is a mandatory program on the Federal Government. It is a \nprogram which is grossly underestimated in its cost because of the \nimpact it will have on the marketplace in taking kids who are already \nin the private-sector insurance realm and moving them onto the public-\nsector realm.\n  It is a classic big Government solution to a problem which ironically \nthe bipartisan budget agreement has addressed not only with dollars but \nwith initiatives to try to give the States the creativity to take this \nissue on and which the States are today actually taking on and \nresolving. And I will get into that in a second.\n  But let us go back to this complete red herring, that this is some \nsort of discretionary program. Now, the proposal as it comes to us is \nin vague terms so we have to go back to the bill that was introduced by \nthe Senators who are the authors of this agreement in order to find the \nunderlying language which defines the program. That bill is not \nincluded but it is obviously assumed, and if you go back to section \n2802 of that bill, this sets up the new entitlement. In the bill in \nthis section a State must--it does not say ``may.'' ``May'' is a \ndiscretionary word. ``Shall'' is not a discretionary word.\n  It says, ``The States shall guarantee issuance of Medicaid level \nbenefits to all eligible children.'' And not only do they say \n``shall,'' they cover that ``shall'' with all sorts of restrictions; 39 \ntimes in this bill the States are told what to do. They shall do this, \nthey shall do that, they shall do this. Every time it says that, every \ntime it says that in the bill, it is a mandate, and every time it says \nit in the bill it is a major cost. Section 2803 is where the shalls \nbegin.\n  Now, not only are the folks who drafted this bill not satisfied with \ncreating a mandate on the States--and I will get into the unfunded \naspect in a second--not only are they unsatisfied with creating a \nmandate on the States, they decided let's create a new mandate. Let's \ndo it the old-fashioned way. Let's not only mandate what the States \nhave to do. Let's mandate the private sector at the same time.\n  This bill includes a private-sector mandate that says essentially, \ndepending on how a State defines its Medicaid eligibility rules, every \nprivate employer in the State must supply health care benefits at the \nsame level as Medicaid to children.\n  Wow. This is a big-time, old-fashioned Government proposal. This is \nright out of the old 1960's school of Lyndon Johnson, how you make \nGovernment gigantic and how you make Government not work, I would point \nout, because one of the things we found out is that when we create one \nof these massive new entitlements that absorbs a whole area of activity \nunder Federal control--and this entitlement does exactly that, \nbasically giving unbelievable authority to HHS, eliminating waivers for \nMedicaid, grandfathering the HHS regulatory structure. When you do \nthat, what happens is that you create major Federal programs which \nfail.\n  Why do they fail? Because all the knowledge does not happen to come \nout of Washington. And what is happening in the States today is that \nyou are seeing a tremendous amount of creative initiative to try to \ncover these kids who need to be covered.\n  There is no argument about coverage here. The bipartisan budget \nagreement states there will be coverage. The argument is about whether \nor not you are going to do it with a massive new federally dominated, \ndirected, controlled and managed program or whether you are going to do \nit by allowing the States the flexibility of initiating programs and \naddressing the issue of the concerns of these kids.\n\n  This bill creates a brandnew, major Federal entitlement. It is not \nonly a Federal entitlement in the classic sense of an entitlement on \nthe States; as I mentioned, it is an entitlement that forces the \nprivate employer to take action, and that is a mandate, an unfunded \nmandate.\n  Of course, the first action which this Congress took when the \nRepublicans took control of it was to say that we were not going to \ncreate unfunded mandates anymore. At least, if we were, we were going \nto require a supermajority. So this bill should be subject to a \nsupermajority if it ever came up for a vote. But whether it is or not, \nit undermines the intent, which was to stop putting mandates on the \nStates that are unfunded.\n  Now, why is this unfunded? Because, of course, there is this dollar \nfigure that is attached to this. It is an additional $20 billion which \nis paid for by the cigarette tax--which is not the issue I am \naddressing, the cigarette tax. It is unfunded because of the way it is \nstructured. It guarantees that the cost of this health care package \nwill exceed the amount of money that is in the proposal--guarantees it. \nAll we need to do is look at history. All we need to do is look at the \nCBO estimations of what would happen if you applied Medicaid coverage \nto a full group, to this targeted population. We know that the \npractical effect of that will be to exceed $20 billion by who knows how \nmuch, but it will be a heck of a lot.\n  So what you have created is an unfunded mandate. You have created a \ncap that says, all right, States, the Federal Government will require \nyou to pay this money. We know it is not enough money, but we are going \nto require you to pay it. Then when we go over the amount of money that \nwe are going to put into the package, well, you have to pay it \nyourself. You have to pay the difference. Unfunded mandate. And some \nwill say, well, that cannot be.\n  Why would that be any different? If that is the case, doesn't the \npresent budget agreement understate the amount of money that is \nnecessary to cover these children? Well, the difference here is in the \ninsidiousness of this agreement, of this proposal in its ability to \ndraw people into a Federal program. Because the way this proposal is \ndrafted, it absolutely guarantees for all intents and purposes that \npeople will be moving out of private-sector coverage and into the \npublic-sector coverage, that a lot of children who are today being \ncovered by their employers, by their parents' employers are going to \nend up moving over to be covered by the Government.\n  Why is that? Because it is requiring a one-size-fits-all health care \npackage be applied to all children, all children who fall in this \nincome category, but, even more importantly, under the way this bill is \ndrafted and interpreted, applying that same package could be required \nupon all employers within a State. So you are going to have a dramatic, \nwhat\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\nis known as woodwork effect, where people move from the private sector \ncoverage into the public sector coverage. It is just going to be \noverwhelming.\n\n  What employer in their right mind is going to say, ``OK, I am going \nto continue covering this parent's children,'' when the employer is \nalready paying a huge tax burden and the Government is being told that \nthey must cover this child if this child is not covered by the \nemployer. Very few will be so altruistic. For all intents and purposes, \nwhat we are doing is federalizing the health care system--nationalizing \nthe health care system, not federalizing; this is no Federal program, \nthis is a national program--nationalizing the health care system for \nall children, for all intents and purposes, who fall into this \ncategory, the majority of whom, today--the majority of whom, today, are \ncovered by private-sector insurance. So, the open-ended cost of this \nprogram is absolutely staggering--staggering. And the concept that the \ncosts will be controlled to $20 billion is absurd on its face, equal in \nabsurdity only to the claim that this is some sort of discretionary \nprogram.\n  How does our bipartisan budget agreement, which the President has \nsigned on to and which tries to address these children's concerns, \napproach this issue? Essentially, what it does is acknowledge the fact \nthat in the States there are some things going on that are working. \nTake my State of New Hampshire, for example. There are 33 States, I \nbelieve, that are pursuing this type of approach. Recognizing we have a \ntargeted uncovered population that needs to be covered, we have set up \nthis program called Healthy Kids. This is a partnership between the \nprivate-sector insurers and the State. In fact, at the present time it \nis hardly costing the State anything because it has gotten the private-\nsector insurers to come in and cover these children.\n  In the targeted area where they are doing the demonstration program, \n50 percent of the kids who would fall into the uninsured categories \nwhich this bill alleges it is trying to cover are being covered at \nessentially no additional cost to the taxpayer--50 percent. It is a \ndarned successful program. It would not be able to continue under this \nbill. All 33 States that have initiated creative programs to address \nchildren's health insurance would have their programs wiped out because \nwe in Washington have decided to take over the issue, to nationalize \nthe issue with this proposal put forward by our colleagues. So, a \nprogram which is insuring 50 percent of these kids at no cost to the \ntaxpayers will be replaced by a program that will draw a whole new \ngroup of kids out of the private sector into the public sector to be \ncovered and will, in the process, drive up costs dramatically and \nincrease the taxpayers' costs dramatically, and, I would point out, for \nthat 50 percent of the kids who presently have coverage under the \nHealthy Kids Program, will have almost no impact on their quality of \nhealth care.\n  So, what our bipartisan budget proposal puts forward--not ours, the \none put forward by the President and the leadership of the Senate and \nthe House--is to allow these types of initiatives to proceed; not with \nas much flexibility as I like, and I may offer an amendment to give \nthese States more flexibility, but with a heck of a lot more \nflexibility than is proposed by this straitjacket of mandated unfunded \nmandates in this bill that is the underlying essence of this proposal.\n  So, why not let the States try to do it? Why not say to the States: \nAll right, there is a population out there that is not covered. See \nwhat sort of programs you can come up with to cover them and meet these \nlimited criteria, criteria that they have to be covered under a certain \nhealth care structure. It is working, working in 33 States, but it will \nnot work after this bill is passed.\n  Let me read part of a letter I received from the deputy commissioner \nof health and human services in New Hampshire, who is a professional. \nShe is not a political appointee. She is a professional. She was \nlooking at this question of how we address these kids who are in need, \nand thinking of the Healthy Kids programs that we have in New Hampshire \nand evaluating the various programs. Here is what she stated was the \ncore of the need, in the way the Congress should approach this issue. \nShe says:\n\n       Consideration must be given to balancing the financial \n     incentives provided in the States to implement health care \n     expansion while retaining sufficient flexibility for \n     innovation. There are multiple [multiple, a word which \n     appears to have escaped the concept of this bill] multiple \n     strategies to extend health care coverage to the uninsured, \n     including preventive, catastrophic coverage options. Please \n     recognize the efforts that are currently underway in many \n     States across this Nation and their value in promoting our \n     common goal, extending health care to those that currently \n     have none.\n\n  Basically, what she is saying is what I suspect every administrator \nof health care at every State agency of health and human services would \nsay if you asked them. It is their goal to cover the kids who are not \ncovered. What the bipartisan budget agreement does is fund that \nability. What the proposal before us does is deny that ability, \nrelative to flexibility at the State level, and to take out of the \nhands of the States the ability to manage this issue in any way, shape \nor manner, and to nationalize the health care delivery of--essentially \nall children who fall within this income category, but potentially even \na dramatically larger group of people, if the bill is applied to \nprivate employers, as I happen to believe it will end up being under \nits present language.\n\n  So, this bill--which is brought forward to us as some sort of \nproposal that is a discretionary program just meant to help kids who do \nnot have coverage--will, in my opinion, have the practical effect of \nnot only not accomplishing its goal, because it is certainly not \ndiscretionary--and I do not think it is going to help any more kids \nthan would be helped under the bipartisan budget agreement structure as \nis proposed--but it would create a massive new entitlement, a massive \nnew unfunded mandate, a massive new federally directed regulatory \nstructure, and would essentially emasculate the private sector's \nefforts to respond to this area, and private insurance as it presently \ncovers these children.\n  I can't think of any program which would be more counterproductive \nand, put in the context of the history of other nationalization \nefforts, will be less successful than that. I mean, essentially we have \nbeen down this road. We have been down this road and we found this type \nof approach to solving national problems does not work. Having the \nFederal Government come in and take things over does not work. This \nbudget agreement attempts to address this issue constructively. It \nfunds, at the level of $16 billion, children who do not have health \ninsurance coverage, yet it leaves some modicum of flexibility with the \nStates to address the issue. So, I find this proposal to be not only \nnot compelling, but to be extraordinarily counterproductive to its \nunderlying goal, which is to obtain fiscal responsibility and to cover \nchildren who do not have health insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see Senator Mikulski and Senator Reed, \nwho have been very patient and want to address the Senate on this \nissue. But I see my friend and colleague and principal sponsor, Senator \nHatch, on the floor. I would like to take maybe 2 minutes in response \nto the Senator from New Hampshire, but I will be glad to yield to the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, \nand also the vice chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  I was very interested listening to the Senator from New Hampshire, \nhis journey from 10.5 million unfunded children, down to the 3.2 \nmillion he says are truly uninsured. First off, the Senator says that \n3.7 million are Medicaid eligible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Utah speaking on his time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am speaking on Senator Kennedy's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. First of all he says he's down to 3.2 million that he says \nthey are truly uninsured. First off, the Senator says the 3.7 million \nare Medicaid\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\neligible. That's what he said. But here is what the CBO said: 10.5 \nmillion uninsured kids, 3 million Medicaid--let me just read it right \nout of there. Here is what the CBO says:\n\n       According to widely quoted estimates, about 10.5 million \n     children through the age of 18, or 14 percent, are uninsured. \n     At least 3 million of them are thought to be eligible for \n     Medicaid.\n\n  That is the CBO. That is what we rely upon around here. So my friend \nfrom New Hampshire is using numbers somewhat different from the CBO. I \nstill do not understand how anyone can seriously believe that $16 \nbillion is adequate to take care of 10.5 million uninsured kids. I will \ngo into that for just a minute, but let me just say this.\n  First of all, the amendment we filed is not a bill, it is strictly \nnumbers. A bill will have to be formed from it. The question is whether \nwe should fund beyond the $16 billion provided for in this bill--which \nI praise, but which is totally inadequate to do what many of us in this \nbody would like to do, including many on this side. Over time, I think \nthat will be the case.\n  Let me just make this case. By the way, talking about mandates, that \nis not part of our amendment. It was not part of our bill either. I \nmight add, it is pretty tough to call a block grant to the States with \nthe States setting eligibility standards a great big bunch of new \nFederal bureaucratic Lyndon Johnson type things. We fought very hard to \nget to a block grant status.\n  I remember the same type of arguments I went through on child care a \nnumber of years ago, until it passed unanimously on the floor here. The \nreason it did is because it was right and it did what was right. And \nour goals here are right. And they do what is right. And it is time for \npeople to wake up and pay attention and do something about these \nproblems.\n  Let me just talk about the Medicaid cuts in the budget. It makes \nsense that the $16 billion children's health initiative in the budget \nwill be put back into the lowest income children. I commend the Budget \nCommittee for that, particularly those eligible for Medicaid, since the \nbudget agreement cuts $14 billion out of Medicaid.\n\n  Much of the $14 billion is expected to come from cuts to the \ndisproportionate share of hospital payments, or DISH, which are funds \nto States to reimburse those hospitals which serve a disproportionate \nshare of Medicaid and other low-income patients.\n  So the loss to children, where they have taken from DISH to get $16 \nbillion, is somewhere between $7 billion to $10 billion. So it is not a \nfull $16 billion. We are robbing Peter to pay Paul. That may be \njustified. I still commend the Budget Committee for trying to do \nsomething here, but it certainly does not cover the problems that some \nare saying it covers.\n  These cuts are taking away money that the States currently have to \nensure that children, the elderly and the disabled are cared for in the \nhospitals. Reducing these funds, as I have mentioned, will likely hurt \nchildren if additional funding is not put back into the Medicaid \nProgram to care for these children.\n  Without the additional funding in the Medicaid Program, States will \nbe forced, or may be forced, to cut back on services to children, and I \nestimate that to be $7 billion to $10 billion. It may be more.\n  The Budget Committee made a good start by allotting $3.2 billion a \nyear over the next 5 years to the Finance Committee to cover children's \nhealth, to cover those eligible for Medicaid and to strengthen \nMedicaid. Let's be realistic what the $3.2 billion a year can and \ncannot do.\n  I think it is important my colleagues understand the Congressional \nBudget Office is coming in with very conservative estimates on the \nnumber of children who will be served under various congressional \nproposals. For example, CBO estimated the Medicaid 12-month, continuous \neligibility proposal will cost $14 billion if implemented by every \nState. That alone is almost all of the money in the budget resolution. \nCBO has also told us they estimate the cost for a child-only insurance \npolicy to be somewhere between $1,000 and $1,200 a year. If true, the \naverage $3.2 billion a year in the budget would only cover about 3 \nmillion kids, far short of the 5 million targeted in the resolution and \nstill 5 million short of those who need to be taken care of.\n  Or, if you look at it another way, the Federal share of Medicaid \ncosts for a child is about $860 on average this year. According to the \nEmployee Benefit Research Institute, there are 4.7 million uninsured \nchildren whose parents make less than 125 percent of the Federal \npoverty level. That is $19,500 for a family of four. We, who make \n$134,000, continually complain about how hard it is to maintain two \nhomes here and there and pay for all the things we pay for. Can you \nimagine what a family making less than $20,000 can do?\n  By simple calculation, to cover those kids under Medicaid would cost \n$4.2 billion, about $1 billion more a year than is included in the \nbudget resolution, and that is just some of the kids. This still would \nleave the vast majority of children of working parents above the 125 \npercent of poverty level uncovered.\n  While $16 billion is a substantial start, and I commend my \ncolleagues, as I have just shown, it is just not enough to do the whole \njob.\n  Some will point out our original bill called for $20 billion in \nspending. They will ask, why is more than an additional $4 billion \nneeded? Are you saying that this is a $36 billion problem, and, if that \nis so, why didn't you ask for that originally?\n  These are fair questions. Let me answer them.\n  The short answer to this concern is that we need these resources to \nhelp the next generation of Americans to be healthy adults. The fact is \nthat the $16 billion in the budget resolution is not enough. When \nSenator Kennedy and I originally introduced the CHILD bill, we set a \nspending limit of $20 billion for services and $10 billion for deficit \nreduction. We hoped to target up to 5 million families not on \nMedicaid--I said not on Medicaid--and that is important.\n  We are also cosponsors of the Chafee-Rockefeller-Jeffords CHIPS bill, \nwhich is estimated to cost at least $15 billion, perhaps even more. \nThis Medicaid bill is targeted to help 5 million kids, although there \nare already about 3 million of Medicaid-eligible children who are not \nenrolled. So we see these two bills as compatible--the CHIPS bill \nimproves basic Medicaid, and our bill would be added on top of that.\n  There is, obviously, a close connection between the two. That is why, \nin our amendment, we decided to divide the money equally between each \nof the two committees, Labor and Finance, to work out an integrated \napproach. So to make wild comments that this bill is going to mandate \nthis, mandate that, take away the powers of the States, when the \noriginal Hatch-Kennedy bill does not do that, is irrelevant to this \ndebate, because if we adopt the Hatch-Kennedy amendment, we will have \nenough money to make a real dent in these problems.\n  The fact is that $16 billion is a good start, but let's not kid \nourselves, it is not enough, especially combined with the Medicaid cuts \nin the resolution, and that is why our amendment should be adopted.\n\n  I understand that the Senator from New Hampshire and others are \nopposed to my CHILD bill. Most of his reasoning is wrong, though, but \nwe will debate that at a more appropriate time when we actually get to \nfleshing out a CHILD bill.\n  This is not a vote on the CHILD bill. Our amendment intends that the \nmoney be used for the same purposes as those outlined in the bipartisan \nbudget agreement. That is, for one or both of the following: Medicaid, \nincluding outreach activities providing continuous 12-month \neligibility, restoring eligibility for disabled children losing SSI \nunder the welfare bill, and, this is also part of the budget \nresolution, a mandatory capped State grant program to finance health \ninsurance for uninsured children. That grant program will be designed \nby the Labor and Finance Committees. We hope it will be like the CHILD \nbill, but it may not be. But we are going to work to try and make it \nwhat we said we would do.\n  Under our amendment, $18 billion in program funding will go to the \nLabor Committee. Will the Senator yield me 1 more minute?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to yield to two other Senators and make a brief \ncomment myself. I do not know where we are on time. I want to take 1 \nminute to respond to the Senator from New Hampshire and then yield to \nmy colleagues.\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. May I have 1 more minute to finish my remarks?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 5 minutes more to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield another 2 minutes, and I will take the last 3 \nminutes and yield to my colleagues.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, under our amendment, $18 billion in program \nfunding will go to the Labor Committee and $2 billion to the Finance \nCommittee to be added to the $16 billion already in the budget \nresolution. That means that each committee will get $18 billion to work \non complementary programs to help the poor and the near poor. We will \nhave to work out the legislative language. I hope it will be like the \nCHILD bill that we have worked so long and hard to make a possibility. \nBut what we are voting on today, if and when we do, is the right to \nhave enough funding moneys to take care of these kids who are the \npoorest of the poor families not on Medicaid who cannot do it \notherwise.\n  Of all the criticisms of our bill, I am perhaps most dismayed by the \ncharge that this bill creates an entitlement. In sharp contrast to last \nyear's Kennedy-Kerry bill which was an entitlement, I succeeded in \npersuading my cosponsor Ted Kennedy, one of the most liberal Members of \nthe Senate, to agree to the following provision:\n\n       Nonentitlement.--Nothing in this title shall be construed \n     as providing an individual with an entitlement to assistance \n     under this title.\n\n  Don't words mean anything anymore?\n  Moreover, not only does this bill make clear it is not an individual \nentitlement program, participation is clearly voluntary on the part of \nthe States. In fact, even if an individual is eligible under the \nState's own eligibility criteria, section 2822(d) of the bill ensures \nthat there is not a requirement for any subsidy to the individual \nshould there be insufficient program funds available. This can be \ncontrasted with programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, which guarantee \nwe will pay for the services of every eligible beneficiary. In fact, \nthe bill states specifically that.\n  Some have interpreted the language that states:\n\n       Shall ensure that children's policies are available to all \n     eligible children in the State and that each eligible child \n     has the opportunity to enroll for coverage under such \n     policies.\n\nas an entitlement.\n  It is true that a State that chooses to participate by negotiating a \ncontract with one or more insurers must make sure that children in the \nState can get that policy. What good is health insurance \navailability if those who need it don't have at least the opportunity \nto get it? However, there is no requirement that the State subsidize \nthat policy in any way unless the State chooses to do so by the \neligibility criteria it sets. And there is no requirement that the \ninsurance policy be available to nonsubsidized children at the price \nnegotiated by the State for the subsidy program.\n\n  To be fair, some may object to this provision, but it is in no way an \nentitlement. Again, the State chooses whether or not to participate, as \ndoes any individual insurer.\n  Finally, the point has been made that the bill would increase Federal \nmandatory spending by $20 billion over the next 5 years. That is true. \nThis provision was inserted to made certain that the revenues generated \nby the companion legislation (S. 526) which increases the tobacco \nexcise tax would be used to fund the CHILD bill and not for some other \nprogram. If there is a better way to write that language to make clear \nit is not an entitlement, I am open to suggestions.\n  I find it curious that many of my colleagues have been arguing \nagainst the fact that my bill calls for mandatory spending, calling the \nmandatory nature of that spending the equivalent of an entitlement.\n  Yet, the budget resolution we debate today includes funding for a \nmandatory capped grant program to States.\n  If ``mandatory'' equals ``entitlement''--which I believe it does \nnot--then the bipartisan budget agreement establishes a new \nentitlement.\n  But we all know that is not the case.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is my friend and my colleague. \nHowever, as is sometimes seen around here, someone misstates what is in \nthe bill and then differs with it. That is what has happened here.\n  When I was listening to the Senator from New Hampshire describe the \nbill, I did not recognize it, because this is not an entitlement. No \nindividual will ever be able to receive any kind of benefit on the \nbasis of an entitlement. Participation is voluntary for the States and \nit is authorized for just 5 years. It is completely funded, and it \nprovides the kind of flexibility to the States that will allow them to \nbuild on what thy are currently doing.\n  Let us not lose sight of what the issue is before the Senate this \nafternoon: Will we support the Hatch-Kennedy bill that will provide the \nresources to ensure the sons and daughters of working families in this \ncountry? That is the issue. You can talk about other kinds of issues \nall you want, but every American understands this one. When you come \nright down to it, this is the issue.\n  We are providing the opportunity. We are saying, ``Let us stand up \nfor the children of working families and pay for it with a tobacco tax, \nwhich is basically a user fee.'' That is the way to address this issue, \nby building upon the agreement that has been spelled out here. Covering \nthe Medicaid children will make a difference, but let's build on that \nand cover the children of working families.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island. I see that he wants to \nspeak about this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is our turn.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I stand corrected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Hagel has been waiting for a while.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No problem. The understanding is Senator Domenici has \nthe time next.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can I inquire, how much time is left on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 20 minutes \nremaining; the Senator from New Mexico has 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska, \nand I want to take that off the resolution, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 27. I want to begin by applauding the \ndedication of the Budget chairman and all those who have worked so \ndiligently over the last few months to craft a budget that makes some \nsense and for bringing this balanced budget to the floor.\n  I want to speak in more global terms about this budget issue. I have \nnot been around here very long. It seems to me that if we continue this \n``what if'' theory and ``one more amendment'' theory to budgeting, we \nwill never get there.\n  The fact is, at least in this humble freshman Senator's opinion, that \nthe real challenge to this country over the next few years, well into \nthe next century, is like this: It is the prioritization of our \nresources. If we are going to do that, then we are going to have to \nhave some framework that makes some sense, that disciplines this \nCongress, disciplines this body. We have been an undisciplined Congress \nfor 30 years, and what Chairman Domenici and the President and the \nleadership on the Democratic and Republican sides in the House and the \nSenate, and all those who have been part of this process have brought \nto this floor is something that makes sense.\n\n  This is a historic budget. We have not been able to craft this kind \nof a budget for more than 30 years. We should not forget this point as \nwe debate this budget.\n  Is this a perfect budget? No. I think it is a good budget. Over the \nyears, Mr. President, like many of my colleagues and most Americans, I \nwas running my\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\nown business and paying taxes. Like most Americans, I was doubting \nwhether this Congress had the will and the discipline to ever balance \nthe budget. Now we have an opportunity to do what many thought would \nnever happen, and that is to pass a balanced budget.\n  What also makes this budget significant is it cuts taxes. I, like \nmany of my colleagues, know how difficult it was to craft such a \nbudget. I also know, like in my campaign last year and the campaigns of \nothers, that people said you can't cut taxes, you can't cut spending \nand balance the budget. Well, we can. That is what this is about.\n  Mr. President, there is a reason that more Americans believe in Santa \nClaus than believe we can actually balance the budget. We are at a \ncrossroads in governance. We are at a crossroads in leadership. If we \nallow the further erosion of confidence of the American public in this \nbody, this Congress, trust and confidence to do the right thing, to \nbalance the budget, then it may be some time in getting it back.\n  I don't doubt the sincerity of my colleagues, Senators Hatch, \nKennedy, and others. I applaud what they are doing. But if we continue \nto proceed with amendment after amendment after amendment, I don't know \nwhat we would do at the end of the day. These are issues that should be \ndebated in the appropriate forums. If we are not careful, we will undo \na very delicate balance in coming to this budget agreement.\n  I will support this budget, but I will not support any of the \namendments that are being offered. This budget is too important to our \nNation and the future of our children to place it at risk with various \namendments, regardless of how well-intentioned.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendments offered today and to \nsupport this balanced budget that so many people have worked so hard to \ncraft and make work. This does include tax relief, spending cuts, and \nbalancing the budget, putting this country on a responsible fiscal \nplane over the next few years. Until we bring some stability to our \nfinancial responsibilities and our fiscal responsibilities starting \nright here, then we will pay consequences for that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senate Concurrent Resolution 27.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank the Senator from New Jersey for yielding me time.\n  I want to commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch for their \nleadership on this critical issue. I rise in support of their \namendment.\n  Let us be very clear. What we are talking about today is providing \nhealth care for the children of the working families of this country. \nAnd despite the budget agreement's impressive commitment of resources \nto Medicaid, particularly for children's health care, it is not \nsufficient to cover all the children in this country. The Senator from \nUtah was very eloquent and accurate in describing the vast gap that is \nstill left despite the resources being made available to Medicaid.\n  And why is it important that we provide health care for all of our \nchildren? Because every day we learn from medical science the \ncritical--the critical--role of good health care in the development of \nchildren. Prenatal care, early infant care from zero to 3, and \ncontinuous health care for children are critical factors in providing \nfor the intellectual and social development of children.\n  If children do not have that health care, if we do not allow these \nyoung people access to high quality health care, we are incurring a \nhuge cost to society and a huge limitation on their potential and their \nability to contribute to society.\n  Just last week, we celebrated the passage of the IDEA, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act. Part of it was a further \ncommitment of significant Federal resources for special education. I \nwonder how much we could save in that account if we had a fully funded \ncomprehensive health care program for all the children in this country. \nI think it would be significant.\n  There is something else that is also very clear, and it is why this \nbill is so compelling in its logic. It is very clear that smoking is \nthe No. 1 public health threat to this country.\n  One out of five deaths in this society are attributed to smoking. \nAnd, sadly, 3,000 teenagers a day are turning to that habit. This \nlegislation, the proposed amendment, recognizes the need for good \nhealth care for all of our children, and the way to fund that health \ncare is through an increase in the tax on cigarettes.\n  It is sound fiscal policy. It represents a pay-as-you-go strategy. \nAlso, it represents a further deficit reduction because part of these \nfunds will be applied to reducing the deficit. In effect, it is \nconsistent with the very, very core of what we are about here today--\nproviding access to good health care, sound policies for public health, \nand being fiscally responsible by reducing the deficit.\n  And there is something else worth pointing out today. Many of the \nopponents of this legislation will point to the dire consequences of \nincreasing the tax on cigarettes to the tobacco industry and certain \nregions of the country. But let me share with you what the cigarette \ncompanies themselves are contemplating.\n  Weeks ago, when there was discussion of a possible settlement for \nsome of the liability claims, most financial analysts conceded that the \ncompanies would routinely raise the price of cigarettes by 50 cents a \npack, causing a slight decline in their number of customers--which some \nwould consider a sound business decision. And I do not think there can \nbe anyone on the floor of this body claiming an increase in the price \nof cigarettes by the companies as an unfortunate tax on low-income \nAmericans. In effect, this tax is not only sound policy for funding \nthis particular program, but also would not lead to the horrendous \nconsequences which are being conjured up on this floor.\n\n  One of the opponents said that it is a regressive tax, because the \nrichest smoker in America would pay the same as the poorest smoker in \nAmerica. I can guarantee you, the richest smoker in America has a \nhealth insurance policy. I cannot make that same guarantee for the \nchildren of this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is sound public \nhealth policy. It recognizes that we must make an investment in our \nchildren for our own productivity as a Nation and for their own ability \nto seize all the opportunities of this country. The amendment also is \nsound fiscal policy because the cigarette tax pays for the program and \nreduces the deficit. I do not think we can ask for more in this budget.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I share the deep concern of my colleagues \nfor the approximately 10 million children in our country who are \ncurrently lacking health insurance coverage. It is distressing that \nsuch a large number of our children lack access to primary and \npreventative care. I find it even more disconcerting that recent \nreports indicate that about 3 million of these children are Medicaid \neligible, but are not enrolled in this program.\n  However, after spending a considerable amount of time reviewing the \nproposal by my colleagues, Senators Hatch and Kennedy, I sincerely \nbelieve that it is not the best solution.\n  There are several fundamental reasons why I can not support this \nproposal. First, I can not support a measure which would impose new \nunfunded mandates on the States and will place unfair burdens and \nexcessive costs on our State governments. Second, I can not endorse a \nproposal which is creating another highly bureaucratic federal \nentitlement program.\n  Also while I do have some concerns about provisions contained in the \nbalanced budget agreement and I am continuing to review this plan, I \nbelieve that if enacted, many portions are worthwhile and will be \nbeneficial to the American people, particular in providing tax relief \nand imposing spending controls. However, I believe the Hatch-Kennedy \nproposal would jeopardize some of the most valuable parts of this \npiece.\n  The Republican leadership has worked hard to ensure that this \nagreement contains an appropriate amount\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\nof tax relief for America's working families. The Kennedy-Hatch \nproposal shatters this agreement by lowering the net tax cut in the \nbudget agreement from $85 billion to $55 billion over the next 5 years.\n  This proposal also fails to recognize that the budget agreement \nprovides $16 billion for expanding health care insurance for low-income \ninsured children. These additional funds will allow us to provide \ngrants to the States to finance health care services to approximately 5 \nmillion children who currently lack coverage. Thus, about 5 million of \nthe approximately 10 million children who are currently lacking \ncoverage will now have access to health care under the bipartisan \nbalanced budget proposal.\n  Now, my colleagues may argue this still leaves approximately 5 \nmillion children without coverage. However, we must remember that about \n3 million of these children already qualify for Medicaid services but \nare not enrolled in this program. Therefore, I believe that we should \nfirst focus our efforts toward a bipartisan solution for developing \ninnovative outreach programs to reach these 3 million children and \ntheir families, educate them about the Medicaid program, and get these \nchildren access to health care. This is an achievable goal for the \nnear-term which we all agree should and can be achieved in the near \nfuture.\n  I have written the General Accounting Office and requested that they \nconduct a thorough analysis of the 3 million Medicaid eligible children \nwho are not enrolled in this program. This analysis should provide \nCongress with a thorough profile of who these kids are, where they are \nlocated geographically and what their family environment is like. This \ndetailed study will enable Congress with the necessary tools to develop \nthe appropriate community outreach strategies and national education \nprograms which will address this problem and assist in getting these \nchildren enrolled in the program and finally having access to very \nimportant health care services.\n  Providing access to health care for uninsured children has been a \npriority for me since coming to the Senate. In fact, I offered \nlegislation in the 103d Congress which attempted to address this \nproblem and provide access to health care for many of our Nation's \nuninsured children. This issue still remains a high priority for me in \nthe 105th Congress. Currently, I am developing legislation which will \nconcentrate on developing new innovative, strategic outreach programs \nto educate qualifying families about the current Medicaid program. In \naddition, it will incorporate creative solutions for creating an \nenvironment which provides low and moderate income families with access \nto health care for their children.\n  I sincerely believe that we must continue to work together to develop \na bipartisan solution to this problem and find a way to provide access \nto health care for our Nation's uninsured children. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in developing an affordable and equitable \nsolution to this problem. However, I simply can not support this \nextremely expensive plan, which unravels the tax cut agreement between \nthe administration and Congress, and creates another highly \nbureaucratic Federal entitlement program.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the Hatch-Kennedy \namendment. It is paid for by a 43-cent-per-pack increase in the Federal \nexcise tax on cigarettes. We must do everything we can to discourage \nsmoking and to advance good health policy. In my view, this does both.\n  However, in doing so, I want to be very clear about my order of \npriorities in terms of addressing the children's health crisis in this \ncountry. If the Hatch-Kennedy amendment fails, and we do not get any \nadditional spending for children's health initiatives above and beyond \nthe $16.8 billion already included in this budget resolution, I intend \nto place all of my energies behind strengthening the very cornerstone \nof our Federal efforts to provide health insurance to poor children--\nthe Medicaid Program.\n  My first priority will be to work in the Finance Committee to enact \nthe Chafee-Rockefeller-Jeffords-Breaux bill which provide incentives--\nnot mandates--to encourage States to expand their Medicaid programs to \ncover all children aged 18 and under, up to 150 percent of poverty. \nThrough this voluntary Medicaid expansion, which now has the support of \na majority of the members of the Senate Finance Committee, we can \nstrengthen the system already in place across the country to reach up \nto 5 million more children. This is the most cost-effective way to \nproceed, does not create any new entitlement programs, and is a known \nquantity in every State.\n  What am I saying here? Let us strengthen the foundation before we \nbuild the building. In an environment of scarce resources, we must \nfirst work to reach the very neediest children through the Medicaid \nProgram before we create other programs with potentially overlapping \nobjectives. I would have a very different view if we had unlimited \nresources, but we do not.\n  I would now like to recognize Senators Rockefeller and Jeffords to \nget an indication of their priorities.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Hatch-Kennedy \nbill, I am extremely hopeful that this amendment will pass. If \nthis amendment passes it will enable us to come very close to achieving \nuniversal coverage for all of America's children.\n\n  However, like Senator Chafee, if the Hatch-Kennedy amendment fails, \nthen we simply must target our efforts in the Finance Committee at \nstrengthening the Medicaid Program to achieve health care coverage for \nthe children who should be our most urgent priority. The Medicaid \nProgram has a proven track record in providing cost effective care and \nit has served as a vital safety net for millions of working families. \nBecause of past bipartisan legislation that delinked the Medicaid \nProgram from the welfare program, the vast majority of children on \nMedicaid have at least one working parent. In other words, these are \nchildren in families who are struggling to avoid welfare, play by the \nrule, pay taxes--but they are the ones who don't get health insurance \nfor their children through their jobs and cannot afford it on incomes \nwhere ends barely meet.\n  So I look forward to working with Senator Chafee, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Breaux, and the majority of my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee who have already signed on to our bill, to expand coverage \nfor millions of children in the most cost-effective, targeted way \npossible through the Medicaid Program.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the children of America need our help. \nNearly 10 million children have no health insurance. Many of these \nchildren live in families with working parents who simply do not make \nenough money to afford health insurance.\n  In order to help address this national problem, I have cosponsored \nboth the Hatch-Kennedy CHILD Act and the Children's Health Insurance \nProvides Security [CHIPS] Act. The CHILD Act would establish a State \nhealth insurance grant program and the CHIPS Act encourages States to \nprovide uniform Medicaid coverage up to 150 percent of poverty for \nchildren of all ages. The combination of these two bills provides an \nintegrated approach to ensuring that our Nation's uninsured children \nhave health care coverage and does so in a way that is completely \nconsistent with the policy language in the budget agreement.\n  I have serious concerns, however, that $16 billion is an insufficient \namount to meet the health insurance needs of the 10 million uninsured \nchildren. I, therefore, will support raising an additional $20 billion \nthrough a cigarette tax. I believe using an increased cigarette tax as \nthe revenue source is especially appropriate since it will have the \nadded health benefit of helping to deter children from starting to \nsmoke in the first place.\n  If the Hatch-Kennedy amendment does not pass, I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues to develop a multifaceted approach that has as its \nfirst priority the strengthening of the existing Medicaid Program.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, of the 71 million children in our country \nsome 86 percent have health coverage provided by private insurance or \nMedicaid. This is an impressive statistic. But it masks a problem. \nThere are some 3.2 million children in families whose incomes are too \nhigh to qualify for Medicaid and too low to afford private insurance.\n  This is a problem that ought to be fixed. No child should be without\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nhealth care because his family can't afford to purchase coverage.\n  The basic task we face in fixing this problem is to provide health \ninsurance to these currently uninsured children without jeopardizing \nthe private insurance system that provides care to the rest of our \nchildren. The Finance Committee has the responsibility of deciding how \nto do this. As chairman of that committee I intend to report \nlegislation that will address this problem.\n  The issue before us is how much money to dedicate to this activity. \nThe budget agreement allocates some $16 billion to solve this problem. \nPresident Clinton supports this amount. The House of Representatives \nsupports this amount. I believe this is the right place to start.\n  This budget agreement before us is a delicate compromise of many \ncompeting interests. I think it would be unwise for us to jeopardize \nthis agreement by asking for more.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I support the Hatch-Kennedy Child Health \nInsurance bill, but I reluctantly must oppose their budget amendment.\n  I am pleased that the President has secured over $16 billion to \naddress the serious problem of children who lack health insurance \ncoverage in this Nation. I believe that the funding allotted under the \nbudget resolution for child health can and should be applied for the \nHatch-Kennedy child health bill.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Senate centrist budget group, I \nrealize how difficult it can be to work across party lines to craft a \nbudget plan. I was pleased to be a member of the Chafee-Breaux centrist \ngroup that crafted a fair and balanced budget plan. The budget plan \nthat the centrists put together again this year is very similar to the \nbipartisan budget resolution we are considering today. I support this \nbudget resolution and am concerned that the Hatch-Kennedy amendment \nwould put the entire budget plan in doubt.\n  Although I will vote against this amendment, I believe we must enact \nlegislation this Congress that expands health insurance coverage for \nchildren. The Hatch-Kennedy Child Health Insurance and Lower Deficit \nAct is at the forefront of the proposals that Congress should pursue.\n  The growing problem of children who lack health coverage is extremely \ntroubling. A recent study drawn from U.S. Census Bureau data show that \nduring 1995-96, there were 23 million children who did not have health \ninsurance for all or part of the period. Surprisingly, 9 out 10 of \nthese children lived in households where one or both parents worked. \nAlthough Wisconsin has the second best rate of insurance for our \nchildren, 23 percent, or over 330,000 kids were uninsured for at least \n1 month over the 2-year period. This situation is unacceptable.\n  Helping families obtain health insurance coverage for their children \nis the next logical step to build on the success of the recent Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act. It is an effort that is \nlong overdue. The Hatch-Kennedy bill should serve as the model for the \nplan crafted during the remaining budget process and I will support \nSenator Hatch and Senator Kennedy in their efforts.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides on the \namendment itself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the present time, there are 20 minutes \nremaining in regard to the Senator from Utah; and the Senator from New \nMexico has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I know there are some others who would like \nto speak on our side. But I really think everybody knows what is \ninvolved here. I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time if \nthe other side is and go to a vote, let this thing be resolved at this \nparticular juncture any way Senators decide to do it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, both Senator Mikulski and Senator \nWellstone are on the floor and want to address this issue. But I want \nto join in the observation of the Senator from Utah that I would hope \nthat after they had a chance to speak on this that we might move ahead.\n  This is an important issue. We want the Senate to be able to express \nitself. We would like to move ahead if we have that opportunity. But we \nwill not do that, I guess, at this time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not think we are going to do it at this point.\n  It is our turn for a speaker. We get a chance to speak on our side \nnow. That is correct, is it not, I say to Senator Lautenberg?\n  How much time would the Senator like?\n  I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, less than 24 hours \nago, in introducing this resolution, the distinguished minority manager \nof the bill, the Senator from New Jersey, had behind him a long and \ndetailed chart from which he read all of the initiatives of his party, \nall of the spending programs of his party, that were a part of this \nbudget resolution and were the justification for Members of his party \nwho favored those spending programs to vote for and to support this \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, some of those proposals were also Republican proposals \nwith which a number of us on this side of the aisle agree. Many of them \nhowever were not. Many of them represent Government spending with which \nwe disagree, which we think is wasteful, money that we think ought to \nbe returned to the people of the United States. Nevertheless, we \nsupport the budget resolution and those spending programs because this \nresolution also provides tax relief for the American people and does \noverall reduce the rate of growth in Government spending.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, this is not a Republican budget \nresolution here today. This is a resolution the outlines of which were \nagreed to by the Republican leadership in both Houses, by the \nDemocratic leadership in this body and the President of the United \nStates. We have before us an amendment, however, that totally and \ncompletely breaches that set of agreements. It adds $30 billion in \ntaxes on the backs of the American people. It adds $20 billion in \nspending programs on to the backs of the American people, in spite of \nthe fact that the resolution itself includes $16 billion for health \ncare for young people in our society.\n  I have a copy of the amendment, Mr. President. Nothing in the \namendment talks about tobacco taxes or child health care. It simply is \nthree pages of increased spending and increased taxes --nothing more \nand nothing less.\n  It is a total breach of the agreement made by the Democratic \nleadership, a total breach of the agreement made by the President of \nthe United States. And bluntly, Mr. President, those of us on this side \nof the aisle, who felt constrained to agree to this budget agreement \nbecause it was bipartisan, expect the support for the resolution in its \noriginal form without increased taxes and without increased spending to \nbe supported as eloquently and as strongly on the other side of the \naisle as it is on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I believe the Senator from New Jersey was prepared to \nyield me 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I wish to rise to express my strong support for the Kennedy-Hatch \namendment on children's health. I cannot think of any more important \nissue that faces our country. The health of our children must be a \nnational priority. This amendment will make sure that that happens. It \nwill expand health insurance to cover America's uninsured children. Our \ncountry has failed to meet the health care needs of these children. And \nwe all know the statistics. More than 10 million children do not have \nhealth insurance; that is one out of every seven children.\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\n  In my own home State of Maryland, I am deeply concerned about what \nthe situation is. One in five children is uninsured. Almost 200,000 \nchildren in Maryland alone lack health insurance.\n  Most of the uninsured children are from families with parents who get \nup and work every day. These are families who are doing the right thing \nto be able to support their family and yet they also want to be able to \nensure that their children have health care, where parents are working \n40 hours a week, often at what I call the varicose-vein jobs. They get \nup, they stand on their feet, they are the checkout woman at a grocery \nstore, clerk, or they are some man out there working as a part-time \nlandscaper assistant, sweating, breaking his back, and in very \ndifficult circumstances, to put food on the table, a roof over their \nheads. But they live in fear every time one of their children has the \nsniffles, that those sniffles could lead to pneumonia and they do not \nhave health care.\n  I have had grown men who were veterans, who were so upset that they \nhad health care and their children did not. They support veterans' \nhealth care, and so do I. But those very same dads would say, ``Let me \nbe a dad. And let me be able to support my own children.''\n  I am reminded of a case in southern Maryland where the dad is a self-\nemployed carpenter. His youngest child has a heart disease. He is \nmaking $40,000 a year. But in order to get health insurance, it will \ncost $9,000 a year. That is almost one-fourth of their family income. \nThe wife stays at home to care for this child, to be the backup, to \nmake sure that that health condition does not deteriorate into a \npermanent cardiac disability. Should they go without health insurance? \nShould the mom go back to work? They should not have these melancholy \nchoices to make.\n  That is why we support health insurance for our children, and not \nonly for the children who are acutely ill but we want to have health \ninsurance for children so they can be immunized by the time they are \ntwo, have early detection and screening as they get ready to go into \nkindergarten or elementary school to make sure they are learning ready, \nthat they know whether they need eyeglasses or they need hearing aids \nor whether they have undetected juvenile diabetes, all these kinds of \nthings.\n  I can think of no more important health investment than to have a \nhealthy start for children. And I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues, at the fantastic, bipartisan President's summit on \nvoluntarism, one of the goals established by Colin Powell, one of the \nfive goals to get our kids ready for the future is to make sure they \nhave a healthy start.\n  I say to my colleagues, this amendment would be a very important step \nin being able to do that.\n  I thank the Senate for its attention.\n  I yield back such time as I might not have consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, let me compliment my colleague \nfrom New Mexico for his leadership in putting this budget together. And \nI will make a speech a little later about the entire budget package. \nBut I have a strong feeling, if this amendment should pass, we are not \ngoing to have a budget package. Maybe I will not have to give that \nspeech.\n  I was going to compliment my colleagues from New Mexico and from New \nJersey and the majority leader of the Senate and the minority leader of \nthe Senate, because they worked for hours, for weeks, they worked for a \nlong time with the administration to put together a budget package.\n  I will tell you I do not think everything in this budget package is \nperfect, but I am absolutely certain if we pass an amendment that \nincreases taxes $30 billion and increases spending $20 billion over \nwhat is already in this package, we do not have a deal. We just killed \nthe budget. There will not be a budget agreement. I believe that very \nstrongly. I will be involved with several people trying to make sure \nthat we do not do it.\n  This deal is not very good from many people's perspective because it \ndoes not cut taxes very much. A net tax cut of $85 billion when we have \ntotal taxes in that period of time of over $9 trillion is not much. I \nargue it is better than nothing, but $85 billion of almost $10 trillion \nis not much. You reduce that to $55 billion, and I will say it is not \nworth it.\n  I am a little bit bothered by my colleagues when I hear there is \nbipartisan agreement. Yesterday, we had an amendment on the floor to \nincrease spending and taxes by $15 billion, again, breaking the budget \ndeal. We had eight Democrats vote for that or vote to sustain the \nbudget package. Everybody else said, ``No we want another $15 billion \nmore in spending and $15 billion in more taxes.''\n  Now it looks like almost all the Democrats are going to jump on and \nsay we want more money for this program. Senator Hatch and Senator \nKennedy put together a good program. We do not care that the Budget \nCommittee and the negotiators put in $16 billion; we are going to \ndouble it. We want $20 billion on top of it. It does not matter what \nyou already did; we want more. It is like whatever that program is, \nhey, we are for more. The original bill that Senator Hatch and Senator \nKennedy had only had $20 billion. The committee put in $16 billion. I \ndo not know why they did not high five each other and say, ``Hey, we \nwon,'' and I would probably be on the sideline saying, ``Yes, they did. \nThey got 80 percent of what they are looking for.'' I will say I lost \nbecause I do not think we should have a new mandate.\n  This is mandatory. It is mandatory under the Hatch-Kennedy bill, too. \nI heard people say it is not. I will be happy to read the language, and \nI know we are not adopting the Hatch-Kennedy bill, but we are debating \nit. We already have $16 billion, and now we are coming along with an \namendment that says put another $20 billion on top, adding to it so now \nwe will have $36 billion for this program. No one in their wildest \ndream would have said we should have $36 billion to try to solve this \nproblem, which I will be happy to debate.\n  Do we want to make sure that kids have insurance? Make sure they have \naccess to health care? You bet. I have four kids. I want to make sure \nmy kids have health care. I want to make sure your kids have health \ncare. Is the solution a Federal mandate? I want to make sure kids have \nplenty to eat. Are we going to mandate a Federal program for that? I \nwant to make sure kids have a warm home. Are we going to mandate \neverything? Government is big enough to give you everything you want. \nIt is big enough to take everything you have. We are approaching that.\n  A young child born today is already inheriting a debt of about \n$20,000. If we do not change the way we are doing our business now, a \nyoung person born today will spend 84 percent of their lifetime \nearnings paying taxes and paying for entitlements, working for \nGovernment--84 percent, if we do not start living within our means and \nstart balancing the budget.\n  So, first thing right out of the hopper--we have a budget bill that \npurportedly is to balance the budget within a few years; it has some \nfiscal discipline--the first thing we do, we had an amendment yesterday \nto increase spending another $15 billion and increase taxes $15 \nbillion. Almost all the Democrats voted for it despite the so-called \nbipartisan budget, and now we have an amendment that says increase \ntaxes $30 billion, increase taxes $20 billion, and I understand we are \nonly going to get maybe a few Democrats who will vote against that \namendment. Just break the deal. What deal?\n  I absolutely tell you, Mr. President, if this amendment passes, there \nare going to be other amendments that say, ``Hey, if taxes are on the \ntable, maybe this $85 billion is not sacrosanct. I do not think that is \nenough.''\n  Last Congress we had $245 billion that we passed and we balanced the \nbudget. I thought that was a lot better tax package. We had real things \nin there for American families and it helped the economy. I would like \nit to be bigger than $85 billion. I will not be satisfied with $55 \nbillion. My guess is there will not be a majority in this body \nsatisfied with $55 billion, so if people want to kill this budget \npackage\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\nin the name of saying, ``Hey, no matter what you did, Budget Committee, \nin putting $16 billion in, we will double it because we are for kids \nand against tobacco.'' I do not care that much about tobacco. Somebody \nwants a different tax, a different time, do it on the Finance Committee \nwhen we have the reconciliation bill before us, and they can say, ``I \ndo not like this, raise the tobacco tax.'' They can have that \namendment. It can be in order, and then you are playing with real \nbullets, then you are talking about something that is real.\n\n  All this is, this budget resolution, if one turns to the budget \nresolution, all that says is we want to spend $2 billion more in the \nFinance Committee, $18 billion more in the Labor Committee, and we want \nto raise taxes $30 billion. That is all it says, and it directly \nviolates the so-called budget deal.\n  So we will find out before too long, are we for a budget package? Do \nwe want to balance the budget? Or do we want to play games, and say, \n``I do not care, I am more for kids than you, so I want to increase \nit.''\n  How much is needed? We have heard the statistics. There are 10 \nmillion kids uninsured. How long are they uninsured? A study was done \nthat found that the majority of kids had insurance within 4 months. \nWell, we just eliminated half of the problem. Most of the kids have \ninsurance within 4 months. People change jobs, people move, people have \ndifferent reasons, but for whatever reason, a lot of those kids will \nhave insurance within a short period of time. Of that 9.8 million \ngroup, about a third, over 3 million, already are eligible for \ninsurance, they just have not signed up. Does that mean they will not \nget health care? No, my guess is, if they have an accident, they might \ngo to Children's Hospital or something, they will be covered, and they \nalready have vaccinations and so on, but for whatever reason, there is \na program and now we come up with a bigger program, but they are \nalready eligible.\n  What about the group above 200 percent of poverty? For that group, a \nfamily of four that makes over $32,000 a year, they make enough money \nto provide kid care, health care for their children, they are just not \ndoing it. We will make them do it? We will come up with big subsidies? \nWhat about the 3 million people that maybe are between the 100 percent \nof poverty and 200 percent of poverty? About 3.5 million kids fall in \nthat category. Half of them will have insurance within 4 months. But \nyou still have maybe 2 million children that are chronically uninsured. \nMr. President, $16 billion is more than adequate to cover that \nchronically uninsured child, more than adequate.\n  Yet we are saying $16 billion is not enough, make it $36 billion. We \nwill match you and double it, so now we have $36 billion. If you look \nat the cost of kid care, in many cases it is $600, $700, $800, up to \n$1,000. A population of children between 100 percent of poverty and 200 \npercent of poverty, 3.5 million, most have insurance within 4 months, \nso you are only talking a couple million. You can do that for a couple \nbillion a year. We have more than that in the $16 billion. Yet, no, we \nare coming up now with $36 billion. No, I do not think so. I do not \nthink that is a solution. It may be good politics.\n  Looking a little bit at the substance, we do not have the legislative \nlanguage of the Hatch-Kennedy bill, but the Hatch-Kennedy bill, if \nsomeone reads it, one, they will find out it is a mandate. It mandates \nthe Federal Government shall give money to the States. That is not \noptional. It is a mandate. Then looking at the subsidy, the subsidy for \nthe group of nearly poor, not the Medicaid poor, the subsidy for this \ngroup is much more generous from the Federal Government standpoint than \nit is for Medicaid. Now, if we revamp and improve this program, we have \nMedicaid--Medicaid is a Federal-State program. It is supposed to be 50-\n50 cost shared, but in some cases the Federal Government is up to 70 \npercent or more. Under the Hatch-Kennedy bill, the Federal contribution \nis only 40 percent of whatever the State was putting in. If the State \nput in 50 percent, the State's share would be 25 percent. In many \nStates the Federal share would be 90 percent. You have a lot of States \nright now that are only paying like 22 percent of Medicaid costs. The \nFederal Government is picking up 75 percent. Under the Hatch-Kennedy \nbill in a lot of States the Federal Government would be paying 90 \npercent. So we will have greater subsidies for the income eligibility \nbetween 100 percent and 200 and 300 percent, a greater share of Federal \nfor the lowest income. That absolutely makes no sense, absolutely makes \nno sense whatever.\n  Then to say you can do this in the Finance Committee, and then we \nwill come up and double the program in the Labor Committee absolutely \nmakes no sense. It is like, wait, we do not work together so we will \nhave the Finance Committee solve this problem and then we will come \nover here and have the Labor Committee solve this problem and give both \ncommittees enough money to solve it. That makes no sense.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will have colleagues on both sides who will \nbe fiscally responsible and say let's work to balance the budget and \nwork for America's kids. We are not solving America's children's \nproblems by saddling them with another great big, open-ended, expensive \nentitlement program that can only explode in the future, wreck the \nbudget deal, and totally destroy the budget package. I do not think \nthat is good for kids. I think it is a disaster for children. I think \nif this amendment should pass, we will not have a budget deal and \nthe real losers will be America's children.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think it is clear what some of the \nopponents of the Kennedy-Hatch legislation are trying to offer the \nSenate. They are saying that the Kennedy-Hatch bill, a health insurance \nprogram for vulnerable kids that pays for itself, is a bad idea. I \nsubmit that even Joe Camel would have a tough time selling that \nproposition. The fact of the matter is this is a program that pays for \nitself, that is fiscally disciplined.\n  In my State, close to 100,000 kids without health insurance are going \nto be in a position to get help as a result of this tobacco tax. I \nthink it is important that the record be set clear on this.\n  Now, this morning, Mr. President, the New York Times carried an \narticle that said that the States are going to lose revenue as a result \nof the Kennedy-Hatch legislation and that this should be opposed on the \ngrounds that the States need this revenue. The fact of the matter is \nthat attorneys general across this country are rushing to file lawsuits \non behalf of their States in order to recoup some of the costs to State \ncoffers for health care costs. That is the reality. The fact of the \nmatter is States are losing vast sums right now as a result of our \ncurrent policies.\n  Without the Hatch-Kennedy legislation, I am of the view we are going \nto have children grow up sicker, they will be sicker adults, they are \ngoing to die sooner, and health costs in America are going to increase. \nThis is an important piece of bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I close by paying a special compliment to my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Smith. He has been subjected to very intense \ncriticism at home by the tobacco lobby. I know a bit about what it is \nlike to be attacked by them. They sued me personally when I was a \nMember of the House subcommittee that investigated their practices.\n\n  I want to make sure that people know that Senator Smith has hung in \nthere on behalf of better health care for America's youngsters.\n  This proposal is right. It is fiscally responsible. It is compatible \nwith a balanced budget approach.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject the arguments that have been \nadvanced against this legislation.\n  As I said earlier, I think even Joe Camel might have some difficulty \nselling the argument that a fully funded proposal that will help our \nkids is a bad idea.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I join what I hope is a majority of the Senators on \nthis floor in opposing Hatch-Kennedy. I am not going to argue the \nmerits of it one way\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\nor the other. I don't think that is the issue this morning. The issue \nis that a budget deal gets broken--a budget deal that has been woven \ntogether in a bipartisan format that gives both sides some recognized \nneed and that produces a budget that is good for the American people.\n  All of us are concerned about child health care, or there wouldn't be \n$16 billion in this budget agreement for children without health care. \nTherein lies the issue.\n  I think it is important to note that, while my colleague from Oregon \njust talked about an analysis that said States would lose money, it is \nvery likely they would lose money, and that is, in fact, one of the \nanalyses. It could cost them up to $6.5 billion over 5 years.\n  Again, it is against the very direction that we want to head in; that \nis, empowering the States to take care of their own needs instead of \nhanding them a new Federal mandate and a new program from the top down, \ntelling them what to do and how to do it. We do that, in essence, by \nstealing away from them the very revenue base that they have been using \nfor these purposes.\n  This would directly hurt the health and educational programs in 16 \nStates that earmarked part of their tobacco tax for this purpose.\n  This doesn't include the cost of the mandate included in the \namendment that will be added on. According to the whip's office, there \nare 30 State mandates in the proposal.\n  Therein is a substantial basis for the objection.\n  This Congress has in a bipartisan manner expressed its desire and \nconcern about the health needs of the uninsured young people of this \ncountry. That is what the debate ought to be about.\n  My guess is that this Congress will work its will as the courts will \nwork their will when it comes to the question of tobacco, when it comes \nto the question of: Should it be limited, and in what form ought it be \nlimited? But let us not break a budget deal. For this is exactly what \nwill happen with this issue.\n  So I hope that we will resolve it in staying with our agreement. We \nthink it is a good one and that this one simply disrupts what is an \nextremely valuable part of the total program.\n  If we are moving toward empowering the States and the individuals to \ncare for their own and their citizens, then Hatch-Kennedy goes directly \nagainst that thrust and prescribes again another very large, federally \ncontrolled, mandated program that is cross-grain or cross-directional \nto what we have been attempting to do all along.\n  So when you look at all of the aspects that are incorporated in this \nlegislation, it is not precedent setting. It is returning to the past. \nIt is stepping backwards into a large, federally controlled bureaucracy \nthat in the end probably doesn't produce the kind of health care that \nour citizens would want or that our citizens would expect of their way \nof life or their system of government.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, in 4 minutes it is difficult to really make a major \nargument on the floor of the Senate. Let me just try to pick up on a \ncouple of comments that I heard made in the last 15 minutes of the \ndebate.\n  One of my colleagues has argued that we have to think about the \nfuture and we have to think about reducing the debt to our children in \nthe future. I think all of us agree with that.\n  Then another colleague talked about the budget agreement--the budget \nagreement that ``is a deal, is a deal, is a deal.'' The debate seems a \nlittle bit too abstract for me as a Senator from Minnesota.\n  I would like to ask colleagues to confront the fierce urgency of now. \nThe fierce urgency of now for too many children in our country is as \nfollows: A child with poor vision, with no health care coverage and not \nable to get any assistance cannot see the blackboard and, in all \nlikelihood, will not be able to do well in school and have a chance.\n  The fierce urgency of now is that a child who is suffering from \nasthma and spending too much time in the emergency room--I have met \nchildren like this in Minnesota--though we have done a good job of \ncovering many children with our own separate health care plan, a child \nwho suffers from asthma with extreme attacks, unable to be able to see \na physician, winding up in the emergency room too often, misses too \nmuch time from school, and he or she will not have the same chance to \ndo well as all of our children.\n  In the fierce urgency of now, I think that we ought to look at, as \nopposed to all of these abstractions, a child who has an abscessed \ntooth coming to school because her family can't afford dental care. I \nhave met children like this. That child who is in so much pain and \ndiscomfort cannot do well in school. She doesn't have the same chance \nas our children.\n  This budget agreement has been much lauded, and Senators have worked \nhard on it. But the fact of the matter is, using a conservative \nestimate, we are only covering half the children who are without health \ncare coverage.\n  This amendment is the right thing to do.\n  I will not talk about the tobacco industry. I will not talk about why \nthe tax makes good public-policy sense to me. But I want to say the \nfierce urgency of now is that this is compelling, and, if it is so \ncompelling that our children should have the coverage, and, if it is so \ncompelling that all the children in our country should have good health \ncare coverage, it seems to me then that it doesn't make a lot of sense \nto applaud and celebrate a budget agreement that only covers half those \nchildren.\n  This bipartisan effort of Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy is so \nimportant. This speaks to the goodness of our country. There is nothing \nthat we could do that would be more important than to support this \namendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to compliment my \ngood friends and colleagues, Senators Hatch and Kennedy, for producing \nwhat I think is a very good solution to an increasing, growing problem. \nI confess that I intended to offer legislation similar to this in the \nearly part of the year, but I like this better than the idea for my own \nbill.\n  We can debate and make all kinds of sophisticated arguments about why \nthis is wrong and the impact on the budget and so on. I remind my \ncolleagues that Winston Churchill once said that you can tell more \nabout a nation by the way they treat their elderly and the conditions \nof their prisons than any other two things. He should have added \nchildren to that.\n  I went to the dedication of a new $51 million Federal prison in my \nState this past Monday. All I could think about was the $16 million \nannual cost of that which would, indeed, produce a lot of jobs. But I \nalso thought about how early intervention would have saved every one of \nthose youngsters in that prison. Our priorities are so skewed. If we \nhad that $51 million, or if we had that $16 million a year we spend on \nevery inmate, if we had it spent on children at the ages of zero to 3, \nor zero to 50, whatever age you take, you can send people to Harvard \nfor what we pay to keep people in prison. It is because of our neglect. \nIf you ask the ordinary citizen on the street, ``What do you think is \nmost important for your children?'' the first thing is education and \nthe second thing is their health care. Anybody who doesn't understand \nthat in this body is out of touch with America.\n  I remember as a poor country lawyer in a town of 1,200 people--this \nis a personal story--my daughter had a condition that was very rare and \ncould have\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\nbeen fatal--would have been fatal. We just happened to have a \npediatrician who knew the greatest pediatric neurosurgeon in the world \nat Boston General Hospital. I had just made a $22,000 fee. So Betty and \nI were able to go. She had complications. We spent 6 weeks in Boston \nand used up my $22,000. But during the course of that, having her in \nthe hands of the best pediatric neurosurgeon in the world, Betty asked \nme one day, ``What do poor people do?'' I said, ``I will tell you what \nthey do. They watch their children die.''\n  Here is an opportunity for the Senate to do itself proud, for the \nCongress to do itself proud. You can make all the arguments you want to \nagainst this because this ``t'' is not crossed and the ``i'' isn't \ndotted. If we picked out some little flaw in every bill we voted on, we \nwould never pass anything.\n  There are a couple of things in this bill that are not terribly \npleasing to me. But providing health care for 10 million children in \nthis country who do not have it, you can't find a more noble \nundertaking by a political body.\n  Mr. President, children without health care was, is, and will remain \nthe shame of this great Nation until we deal with it.\n  So I plead with my colleagues in the Senate to please America and do \nsomething that is really noble and laudable and worthwhile and will pay \nthe richest dividends we have ever received.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I noted--since we have all been engaged \nin such a serious conversation--a little article from ``The Hill'' \nabout polling and budgets. It might interest Senators. If I shared it \nwith them, they might be reassured. For those who believe in politics, \nhowever, this fact may be very interesting. Seventy-four percent of the \npeople polled think that news about the budget deal is more interesting \nthan news of Donald Trump's marital failures. Only 10 percent responded \nthat they were more interested in Donald Trump's marriage failures.\n  So we have a winner here.\n  Mr. President, I would like very much to ask my friend, Senator \nLautenberg, if he is prepared to yield back time on the amendment. I \nwill then be prepared to yield and offer a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are prepared to yield any time that remains on the \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand that we still have 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah now has 18 minutes \nremaining on his time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could we make a few closing remarks?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is going to be plenty of time for remarks. But if \nthe Senator would like to do that, fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate the views of the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee. He obviously has available to him other kinds of \nmeasures that he intends to pursue. What I would like to do is take a \nfinal 3 minutes, and then I would welcome the possibility of yielding \nremaining time, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much does the Senator from Utah want?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If we have the 20 minutes, I would like to speak very \nbriefly. We have the 20 minutes. Then I will speak then we will yield \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes that the Senator from Utah \nhas 18 minutes.\n  Does the Senator from Utah yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we find that we have had a good \ndiscussion and a debate about this measure.\n  Those of us who favor this measure have been trying to convince the \nMembers of the Senate what the great majority of the American people \nalready understand. This is a proposal that will cover the sons and \ndaughters of working families that are on the lower two or three rungs \nof the economic ladder. This is something that the American people \noverwhelmingly support, and we pay for it with a modest increase in the \ntobacco tax of 43 cents per pack of cigarettes. This is supported \nacross the country--North, South, East, West, Republicans, Democrats, \nindependents. A majority of smokers all across the country favor this \nproposal. Rarely have we seen an issue that has such support. We have \ngiven life to that proposal with this amendment to the Budget Act.\n  There have been comments about how this is drafted. This is drafted \nas other amendments have been drafted over the history of budget acts. \nIt is consistent with our objective.\n  We have placed in the Record the Joint Tax Committee report that \njustifies our proposal in recognizing that more than $30 billion will \nbe raised. We have allocated $20 billion to go to the States, \neffectively as a block grant, to provide for those children whose \nparents are working and who need this kind of coverage because they are \nmaking $18,000, $19,000, $20,000, or $25,000 and they are unable to \nafford coverage for their children. We commend the fact that the budget \nagreement adds some $16 billion for children. But we also recognize \nthat Medicaid has been cut $14 billion. Half of all those who are in \nMedicaid are children. We are not prepared to say that half of those \ncuts, dollar for dollar will necessarily affect children, but that $16 \nbillion that is supposed to go for children is going to be diminished \nsignificantly given these cuts. We believe there will be more than 3 \nmillion children who currently have no health care who will be covered \nby the $16 billion, but we are still not reaching the core group of \nchildren who are the sons and daughters of working families.\n  This is the issue before us. We know there are parliamentary measures \nthat will be taken, and parliamentary issues raised to prevent us from \nhaving a straight up-and-down vote on the proposal.\n  Every Member of the Senate understands this proposal. The American \nAcademy of Pediatrics understands this proposal. ``America's \npediatricians strongly urge support for the Hatch-Kennedy budget \namendment to increase tobacco taxes to help finance children's health \ncare.''\n  The American Association of Retired Persons understands this \nproposal. They care about their grandchildren: ``AARP believes that the \nHatch-Kennedy proposal is an important step in improving access to \nhealth care for children.''\n  The National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., \ncomprised of the 33 national member communions of the National Council \nof Churches support it. They write, ``We in the religious community \nwill continue to hold Congress to a high standard as to what is \nrequired for the common good. Providing for the health care of children \nis simply basic social morality.''\n  The list goes on; 150 organizations including the Parent-Teachers \nAssociation, and many others support this measure.\n  Mr. President, this is ultimately a choice and a decision about \nwhether we are going to support covering children who are uninsured or \nwhether we are going to be for big tobacco. That is the issue. We have \nchosen the tobacco tax for health reasons, Mr. President. If you \nincrease that kind of tax, you are going to discourage children from \nsmoking and you are going to close a gateway to drug use and other \nkinds of substance abuse.\n  Second, we want to make sure that that industry and the users of \ntobacco are going to pay their fair share of the health care costs; $68 \nbillion a year, according to OTA, is paid by the common taxpayers \nbecause of smoking.\n  We are saying that the tobacco industry ought to bear its fair share \nin covering poor children. That is the issue.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we heard a great deal yesterday about the \nAmerican Medical Association. Here is the letter from the American \nMedical Association that says:\n\n       On behalf of 300,000 physician and medical students members \n     of the American Medical Association, I am writing to express \n     our support of your and Senator Orrin Hatch's efforts, as \n     well as those of other Congressional leaders, to improve the \n     health of American children. We also commend you for \n     financing your legislation by a 43-cent increase in the \n     Federal cigarette tax. The AMA is committed to eradicating \n     the public health crisis caused by smoking and our House of \n     Delegates policy strongly supports increasing the\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\n     Federal tobacco excise tax for health care needs.\n\n  Mr. President, from a medical standpoint, this is right. It is right \nin terms of fairness and equity. There is not a parent in this country, \nnot a single parent in this country, who does not believe that all \nchildren ought to have a healthy start. That is what our amendment \ndoes, and I hope it will be accepted.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have not felt really great about taking \non some of my colleagues and irritating people on my side of the aisle. \nI always try to support the leadership in everything. And, I think I \nhave a very good reputation for doing that.\n  But there occurs in all of our lives--at times--issues that transcend \nthe everyday important issues we face in the Senate on a daily basis, \nand this is one of them. Regardless of what happens here today, this \nissue is not going to go away. I think it is time for people to wake up \nand say, hey, look, this is an idea whose time has come.\n  We must take care of these kids who cannot take care of themselves. \nThe problem in this body, and the problem with the Federal Government, \nis that oftentimes we provide programs for all kinds of people who can \ntake care of themselves, but will not. Yet, we do not take care of \npeople who truly cannot take care of themselves, but would if they \ncould.\n  Children's health care should not be a political issue. This is not a \nDemocrat issue. It is not a Republican issue. I admit that when I first \nread the Kennedy-Kerry bill, I could not support that bill as drafted. \nThe bill provided a new Federal bureaucracy along with $50 billion in \nnew entitlement spending.\n  That bill provided extensive Federal mandates along with extensive \nFederal accountability and review provisions imposed on the States. It \nwas simply unacceptable and provided far too much Federal intervention.\n  I do not mean to find fault with my colleague, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, because he too has taken a stand on this issue and has \nbeen willing to come to the center in a bipartisan way to work with me \nto resolve these problems. But that bill was totally unacceptable to me \nand I know it would have not garnished nearly the support my bill has \nreceived.\n  My bill is substantially different than the Kennedy-Kerry bill. My \nbill provides a block grant funding mechanism to the States which are \ngiven maximum flexibility to administer the program. The States set \ntheir own eligibility standards. And, the program is strictly \nvoluntary. No new massive Federal or for that matter State bureaucracy \nis necessary since my bill builds on existing State programs or private \nsector initiatives.\n  There is no funding mechanism because we already have a system in \nplace to collect the excise tax on tobacco products. We would make \nthose tax revenues available to the States much like we make matching \nfunds available to the States through the Medicaid program. States \nwould not have to hire massive new numbers of bureaucrats. The States \nbasically operate the program in a manner consistent with existing \nchildren's programs or in ways that best meet the needs of the \ncitizens.\n  States will have the flexibility to contract with health insurance \ncompanies to develop new and innovative insurance products for \nchildren. In spite of some of the comments that have been made by those \nwho oppose my bill, States can contract with private health insurers \nand/or health care providers such as community health centers to carry \nout the mission of this program.\n\n  I want to give States even more flexibility in implementing the CHILD \nbill. I am open to further suggestions and refinements in the bill. In \nthat respect, I have challenged my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle alone with the Nation's Governors to help me in that effort. If \nthere is a better way of doing this, then I am willing to discuss other \nproposals and make construction changes to the bill.\n  My willingness to improve my bill extends to the funding mechanism as \nwell. I ask my colleagues to show me a better way of funding this \nprogram. I cannot think of a more just way of funding the program than \nwith an increase of 43 cents on the tobacco tax. In 1955, a pack of \ncigarettes cost 23 cents. The excise tax was 8 cents or 34 percent. \nToday a pack of cigarettes costs $1.80 to $2.30. The excise tax today \nis 24 cents, under 10 percent.\n  Does it not seem fair and reasonable to ask the tobacco industry to \nhelp finance this program particularly in view of the health \nimplications of tobacco use? The fact of the matter is that tobacco use \nis the single largest preventable cause of death. It is the largest \npreventable cause of illness in our society.\n  Four out of five lung cancer victims in our country get cancer due to \nsmoking. There are 51 million smokers in our country, 3 million of whom \nare teenagers. And, everyday 3,000 more teenagers begin to smoke, half \nof whom will become nicotine addicts by the time they are 18 years of \nage.\n  As my colleagues know, currently the so-called global settlement \nnegotiations are on-going between the tobacco companies and the States \nregarding the litigation against tobacco manufacturers. I have had the \nopportunity to review the arguments on both sides of the issue and I \nnote that arguments have been made against any increases in tobacco \nprices on the belief that States will lose revenues.\n  It seems to be that we should be spending more time worrying about \nthe health of our citizens than the tobacco revenues going into State \ntreasuries particularly when these revenues are marginal in comparison \nto health care costs States assume from smoking related illnesses.\n  Now, look, we can put this issue off and we can play procedural \ngames, but this issue is not going to go away. I think virtually \neverybody in the Senate has strong feelings about this issue although \nthere are legitimate differences of viewpoint.\n  Of all the arguments made against my bill, I think the one that is \nparticularly false is that my bill creates a new entitlement. I am \nperhaps more dismayed by that charge because my bill specifically \nstates that no new entitlement is establish by this legislation.\n  I succeeded in persuading my cosponsor, Senator Kennedy, to agree to \nthe nonentitlement provision in this bill which clearly states that: \nNothing in this title shall be construed as providing an individual \nwith an entitlement to assistance under this title. Moreover, State \nparticipation is totally voluntary.\n  There is nothing in the bill that would establish an entitlement to \nthe CHILD Program, but yet that has been one of the principal arguments \nagainst the measure. I guess any bill that has real winning power could \nbe called an entitlement program. Any good program that actually works \nI guess should be called an entitlement even though these programs have \nto face the authorization and appropriations process which the CHILD \nbill is also subject to face.\n  It is unbelievable this these kinds of arguments have been made. This \nis a voluntary program designed to be attractive to States. Does that \nmake it an entitlement program? Does that somehow convert it into an \nentitlement program? It seems to me there are legal and programmatic \ndistinctions between entitlement programs such as Medicare and the \nchild development block grant program.\n  I remember when the Child Development Block Grant Program came before \nthe Senate. Many Senators including those in my party were opposed to \nit. Ironically, that bill passed the Senate unanimously and almost \neverybody claims credit for it because it has been a successful block \ngrant program for the States. The States set their own standards which \nis precisely what my bill provides. I think we ought to wake up and do \nwhat is right here.\n\n  Look, it is a fair characterization to say that this is a choice \nbetween Joe Camel and Joey. I am not just saying that because it is \ncute and gimmicky. I say that because it is true.\n  I think the industry that causes much of the illnesses has an \nobligation to be of some help here. This is not a broad-based tax. The \nonly people who pay this tax are those who smoke cigarettes and use \ntobacco products.\n  In all candor, I trust my colleagues will keep this in mind. This \nissue is not going to go away. I understand that the leadership is \ngoing to file an amendment to my amendment. Fine. We will\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\nlook at their amendment and see what it is. I hope it is a constructive \namendment that will get us to what we are trying to do.\n  However, these arguments that $16 billion is all that is needed are \nsimply inaccurate. My bill is something we ought to do. These are the \nchildren who come from families of the working poor. It is very \ndifficult for them to help themselves. I think of the billions of \ndollars we spend on people who can help themselves but will not. If we \ncannot do this, then what can we do?\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have a Senator who wants to speak.\n  Mr. FORD. I just need 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me just make a couple of points if I \nmay.\n  Under the previous bills, not in this bill but I understand are \nincluded in this, they sunset the program at the end of 5 years. Now, \nin the budget program 5 years is fine which when you get in \nreconciliation is 10, and under the 5-year program the reason they \nsunset it is because they run out of money. The cost is greater than \nthe income. So this is a budget buster in more ways than one. The cost \ngoes well beyond the income. So it is a budget buster.\n  You talk about whether this is an entitlement or not. All you have to \ndo is read what the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire was trying \nto explain here this morning. It is section 2802. If the State accepts, \nthey shall, they shall, they shall, they shall. And every child in the \nState shall have. You shall contract with an insurer that says certain \nthings. So I hope States understand it is in the cover of children. I \nhope my record is as good as the next one.\n\n  I hope we can work this out--I understand what is coming next--but, \nafter today, at least we can keep a budget together that we agreed on. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield off the bill as much time as the \nmajority leader desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee for yielding this time and for the outstanding work he has \nbeen doing.\n  We have before us a budget resolution that has been in the making for \n4 months. A lot of hard work went into it, a lot of give-and-take. It \nis truly a bipartisan agreement. It is not a Democratic package, and it \nis certainly not a Republican package. It is one that we came to \nagreement on. There are provisions in it that I don't agree with. There \nare changes that I wanted to make until the very end, and some I would \nlike to make at this very moment. But we entered into an agreement, \nHouse and Senate, Republican and Democratic leadership, working with \nthe Budget Committee leaders and the administration, specifically the \nPresident of the United States. We came to a budget agreement. We shook \nhands. Now we have this budget resolution to implement that agreement.\n  The House spent a very long day yesterday and they stuck with their \ncommitment. They kept the faith. They passed the budget resolution that \nwill carry out the budget agreement. It took them until 3:30 this \nmorning. One amendment that was offered, which was very attractive, was \none that I would like to vote for, to put more money in transportation. \nI think we should take more money out of the highway trust fund and put \nit in the roads and bridges of America, and so do many of the leaders \nin the House on the Republican side. But, no, they fought off a very \npowerful, very important chairman by a vote of 216 to 214. The \namendment was defeated. They kept their word. The leadership worked all \nnight to keep their word, to stick with the agreement. And they did it \nand they passed a budget resolution.\n  Just yesterday, here in the Senate, I worked with Senator Daschle, \nSenator Domenici worked with Senator Lautenberg, and we resisted \namendments that would break us out of the agreement. Senator Dodd from \nConnecticut had an amendment he felt compelled to offer and was very \nserious about. But with some nine Democrats and most Republicans, we \ndefeated that amendment.\n  Senator Allard, the Senator from Colorado, had an amendment. I voted \nagainst his amendment. I didn't want to. I am proud of this new, fine \nSenator from Colorado, and I agreed with what he was trying to do. But, \nno, I kept my word. I kept the faith.\n  Now, my colleagues, this is a show-stopper. This takes us outside the \nbudget agreement. Remember, in the agreement is $16 billion for child \nhealth care. I thought that was excessive, but we came to an agreement. \nWe do need to make sure that, for some children who are not covered in \nAmerica, there is a way for them to be covered. We said: Finance \nCommittee, here is $16 billion to address this problem, and we believe \nthere are ways that can be found to get that done.\n  I care about children in America. I am a parent. I am from a State \nwhere there are children who are not covered and should be. But we have \na program here that we have agreed to, $16 billion, and the committee \nwill work with that, and I hope and think they will come up with many \ninnovative ideas of how we can make sure these children are covered.\n\n  That is why we are here now. We have an agreement we are committed \nto, that addresses this problem. Now we have an amendment that will \ntake us, clearly, outside the parameters of the agreement. We must \ndefeat this amendment. We must have bipartisan support against this \namendment, or how am I going to be able to stand up here and vote \nagainst some of the amendments that will be offered from my side of the \naisle that will take some of the spending out of our agreement and put \nit in more tax cuts? I would like to do that. I want to do that. The \nAmerican people are overtaxed and overworked, for what they get back, \nin terms of being able to keep their own money. But I am prepared to \nsay no, we have to stick with this agreement.\n  Paragraph 3 of the bipartisan agreement between the President and the \nleadership of the Congress reads:\n\n       Agreed upon budget levels are shown in the tables included \n     in this agreement, including deficit reduction levels, major \n     category levels of discretionary, mandatory, and tax receipt \n     levels.\n\n  This amendment would change those agreed-to budget levels. Like \nyesterday's amendment by Senator Dodd of Connecticut, the pending \namendment would break our bipartisan agreement with the President by \nincreasing spending and taxes beyond the levels in this agreement.\n  By the way, I thought the original Kennedy-Hatch bill just provided \nfor $20 billion. We have $16 billion in this package. If you add $20 \nbillion on top of that, now it is $36 billion. The Kennedy-Hatch \namendment would create $20 billion of new entitlement spending above \nand beyond what is already in this resolution.\n\n  The sponsors of the amendment claim the amendment would increase the \ntobacco tax. That is not true. It is false. The budget resolution \ncannot tell the Finance Committee which taxes to raise and which to \ncut. The practical effect of this amendment on taxes is not to raise a \nspecific tax. It is, instead, to reduce the size of the net tax cut by \n$30 billion, to only $55 billion over 5 years. That is not enough to do \nwhat we have committed to do--some tax credits for families with \nchildren, some capital gains tax rate cuts for Americans who are \nentitled to it and deserve that opportunity, some modification of the \nestate taxes. And it puts an additional squeeze on the President's \neducation program. We cannot do what we have committed to do with this \nchange.\n  I am a party to the bipartisan agreement with the President that we \nentered into and we outlined in paragraph 2 of the agreement. I am \ngoing to keep the faith on this amendment and other amendments. We are \ngoing to stick with our budget resolution agreement. I have talked to \nthe President, because the President is in on this. He has made it \nclear he supports the concept of Kennedy-Hatch. But he is also \ncommitted to me that he is going to\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\nwork to try to get Democrat votes for our second-degree amendment and \nagainst making this change in the budget resolution. That is what I \nhave been told by the President of the United States. If anybody doubts \nthat here on the floor or in the news media, call the White House and \ncheck it.\n  I signed in on the deal and I have taken criticism for it. The \nPresident signed in on the deal, and he is going to take some criticism \nfor it. He already has. But this is clearly a deal-buster. If this \namendment should be adopted right at the gate, the wheels will come off \nof this thing. They will come off. And I only have two options: One, \noffer second-degree amendments, and if we have to, we may go through a \nseries of them, and let me assure you, each one will get hairier and \nmore difficult for Senators to vote against, more uncomfortable.\n\n  Or the other one is to say, look, we had a deal. Is the deal off? We \ncan pull this down. We have a little work we can do. We can go back to \nthe comptime-flextime bill, to give the working men and women of \nAmerica an opportunity to make some decisions, taking time to be with \ntheir children. We can go onto the chemical weapons implementing \nlegislation. Maybe we can go to other bills, like product liability. \nThat is pending. We could take that up. Or national missile defense. We \nhave other things we could be doing.\n  But we should, instead, vote for the second-degree amendment. It is a \nvery responsible and reasonable amendment. I urge Senators on both \nsides, vote for the second-degree amendment we are going to offer. Let \nus move on and complete our work on this today, on this whole \nresolution, so we can get to conference, meet tomorrow, and pass this \nbudget resolution on Thursday or Friday.\n  The amendment we will offer as a second-degree amendment will allow \nus to adhere to our bipartisan budget agreement with respect to health \ncare for our children. This amendment accomplishes this by wiping out \nthe increases and decreases in the dollar amounts which have been \nproposed by our colleagues in the Kennedy-Hatch amendment. It allows us \nto stick with the balanced budget plan now before us and to provide \nhealth care for kids.\n  I think that is the responsible thing to do. I would prefer to even \ngive some direction, maybe even have a vote like they did in the \ncommittee, saying what we should do is having 100 percent deductibility \nof the self-employed. That would be a major help. There are all sorts \nof things we can do. But we should not break out of the agreement here. \nWe should not mandate a new program at this point, on the budget \nresolution. We should not raise taxes when there are other options that \nare as good or better.\n  So, my friends, I just want to sum up by saying I think we have come \na long way. A lot of time has been invested in this, a lot of effort. \nWe need to be able to get this budget resolution done so we can go on \nto the reconciliation bill and the appropriations bills. If we do not \ndefeat this amendment and if we do not pass this budget resolution \ntoday or tomorrow, in our effort to get a balanced budget, with \nspending restraint and some tax relief for working Americans, and some \nreform in Medicare that will save the program on out well after the \nturn of the century, we will have made a terrible mistake today.\n  So I urge my colleagues, when we get to the vote, that we vote for \nthe second-degree amendment and we move on to other issues in this \narea.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield? Can I ask the majority leader a \nbrief question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Surely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just ask the majority leader whether he will permit us \nto have an opportunity to vote on the children's insurance program? Is \nit the position of the majority leader that we will not be able to have \na vote on the children's insurance program? Is that the thought?\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my intention that this amendment not be added to the \nbudget resolution. Now, there are a lot of different ways we can do \nthat. We can have second-degree amendments adopted, or we can defeat \nthe Senator's amendment on a straight up-or-down vote. But I would have \nto have assurances from your leadership and from the White House, from \nthe President, that in fact it is going to be defeated. If that does \nnot occur, then our only other option would be to pull down this budget \nresolution and move on to other issues.\n  You know, the Senator has made his case here today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Right.\n  Mr. LOTT. I knew he would take the opportunity, the first opportunity \nthat came along, to do that. That is fine. But I think he has to \nunderstand this is a very carefully crafted budget agreement which we \nreally spent 4\\1/2\\ months putting together. We cannot allow this \namendment in this form to be added to the budget resolution. So we will \nfind a way, hopefully, to accomplish that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just had two just quick questions. It is going to be \nan interesting meeting here, because I listened to the Senator, our \nmajority leader, speak about how the President is supporting his \nposition when the Vice President is on his way up here to vote for our \nposition. So, sometime they might get together.\n  Mr. LOTT. Maybe they will get together someday; and this would be a \ngood day for them to be together.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just want to say this. When the amendment is offered \nby the majority leader, we are going to urge everyone on our side to \nsupport it. Because we, as right from the beginning, have supported the \n$16 billion to take care of those needy children on Medicaid. So I \nwould certainly urge all of our supporters to support it. Then I hope \nwe will have an opportunity to come back on and have a vote on what we \nhave offered here, to build on that. So that makes it--if the Senator \nwants to have a reaffirmation for that which has been agreed on, I hope \nwe could get to an early vote on it, because we would have every \nintention, then, to come back in and have a vote on our particular \nmeasure.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can reclaim our time, I would certainly \nlike to have a reaffirmation of our support of what was in the budget \nagreement, that we worked through very carefully. I agreed to what was \nin there reluctantly.\n  If we then come along and vote for the Senator's amendment, we have \nundercut, we have broken out of the agreement, and we will reverse the \naffirmation we just voted on. That does not make any sense.\n  So, I yield the floor at this time so the second-degree amendment can \nbe offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to address the concerns that have \nbeen raised today on the floor. This is not the first time we have had \ndifferences of interpretation on this agreement, and it will not be the \nlast.\n  This has not been an easy process for anybody on either side of the \naisle. I know that the majority leader and I have attempted to work \nthrough disagreements dispassionately, to keep our cool, and to \nrecognize there are going to be honest differences of opinion on how we \nshould proceed. I just hope we have learned some lessons from the way \nthis budget agreement was handled, and Republicans and Democrats will \nmake a commitment to not repeat this kind of process so we can avoid \nthe pitfalls we are now experiencing.\n  The fact is, when this agreement was negotiated, we had a handful of \nSenators in a room making decisions for the rest of us. While I agree \nwith the end product, I have no qualms about disagreeing with the way \nwe got there.\n  Now we have to make decisions with regard to whether or not \namendments are consistent with this budget agreement. The terms of the \nagreement call for the leaders to seek to produce support for the \nagreement by a majority of Democrats and Republicans and to pursue \nremedial action against provisions deemed to be inconsistent. The \nagreement says, in other words, that we are going to support this \nagreement and try to encourage a majority of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support it and to oppose amendments that are \ninconsistent with it.\n  Yesterday, on a couple of occasions, I joined with the majority \nleader to oppose what I considered to be inconsistent amendments. I am \ntold we have over 25 Democratic amendments. As I review those \nDemocratic amendments,\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\nalmost all of them, in my view, are inconsistent. But that issue is, \nobviously, going to be subject to debate and disagreement for as long \nas this resolution is on the floor.\n  I believe that this amendment is consistent with the budget agreement \nfor three reasons. First, it deals with an issue that is already \naddressed in the budget. Expanded health coverage for children is in \nthis resolution. The budget negotiators acknowledged on policy grounds \nthe value of extending child coverage and this budget includes funding \nto cover 5 million uninsured children. How is it inconsistent to say we \nare going to add additional children to the ranks of children to whom \nwe have already committed in this budget agreement?\n  Second, the Kennedy-Hatch amendment would alter the revenue numbers \nby raising a fee on tobacco, but it would not remove one single tax \nproposal agreed to by the negotiators and memorialized in the letter \nfrom the majority leadership.\n  Those elements of the budget agreement are untouched: the higher \neducation deduction; the HOPE scholarship credit; the capital gains tax \nreduction; estate tax reform; the $500-per-child tax credit--every one \nof those initiatives are still in the budget. This amendment doesn't \naffect any of those measures.\n  It should be noted that the details of the tax provisions were kept \nintentionally vague, oftentimes at Republican insistence. They didn't \nwant to specify the details of the proposals. As vague as those \nprovisions are, they are not affected at all by this amendment.\n  Third, the Kennedy-Hatch amendment does not worsen the deficit. In \nfact, it helps to reduce it.\n  So, Mr. President, based on deficit reduction, based upon how this \namendment affects the tax package, based upon the fact that this policy \nis already incorporated in the budget, I find it very difficult to \nunderstand how this amendment is inconsistent with the budget \nagreement. It happens to be entirely consistent with 1 of the 10 \nleadership bills that I proposed on the very first day of Congress. It \nhappens to be a piece of legislation that the entire caucus feels very, \nvery strongly about.\n  I hope we can find a way to work through this disagreement, but I \nwill tell you this: If it means bringing down the budget resolution, as \nsome of our colleagues have threatened, then so be it--so be it. That \nisn't my first choice. I would like to find a way not to avoid these \nkinds of confrontations. I would like to find a way to resolve this \ndispute. But if it means dropping this agreement, then let's do it, \nlet's go back to the drawing board, or let's figure out another way to \ndo this. But I have to tell you, again, this debate highlights the \npoint I have been trying to make about the problems with the process \nthat produced this budget agreement.\n\n  I hope we can find a way, in spite of our differences on this \namendment, to keep the budget agreement intact and to resolve to find a \nbetter way to get these kind of agreements in the future. Whatever we \ndo, let us remember how important this matter is, not just to \nDemocrats, not just to some Republicans, but to a lot of children who \nare counting on this legislation passing sometime this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has time been yielded back on their side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Both sides have time remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Both sides have time remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 15 minutes, 14 \nseconds.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to use 3 minutes and then yield back the \nremainder of my time, if that is satisfactory.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 2 minutes, 46 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am prepared to yield back my time. Is the Senator \nprepared to yield back his time? I am prepared to yield back mine, but \nI won't yield back mine until he yields his and I have the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back my time. I might add, I am \nprepared to accept the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to accept the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that; I heard that statement made by our \ncolleague.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 307 to Amendment No. 297\n\n     (Purpose: The Bipartisan Budget Agreement of May 15, 1997, as \nimplemented in this resolution, would spend $16 billion over five years \n (to provide up to 5 million additional children with health insurance \n  coverage by 2002). The funding could be used for one or both of the \n   following, and for other possibilities if mutually agreeable: (1) \nMedicaid, including outreach activities to identify and enroll eligible \n  children and providing 12-month continuous eligibility; and also to \nrestore Medicaid for current disabled children losing SSI because of a \nnew, more strict definition of childhood eligibility; and (2) A program \n   of capped mandatory grants to States to finance health insurance \ncoverage for uninsured children.

Mr. President, first, parliamentary inquiry. Under the \nrules prevailing for this bill, each side has a half hour on this \namendment, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me just read this amendment:\n\n       The Bipartisan Budget Agreement of May 15, 1997, as \n     implemented in the resolution, would spend $16 billion over \n     five years (to provide up to 5 million additional children \n     with health insurance coverage by 2002). The funding could be \n     used for one or both of the following, and for other \n     possibilities if mutually agreeable: (1) Medicaid, including \n     outreach activities to identify and enroll eligible children \n     and providing 12-month continuous eligibility; and also to \n     restore Medicaid for current disabled children losing SSI \n     because of a new, more strict definition of childhood \n     eligibility; (2) A program of capped mandatory grants to \n     States to finance health insurance coverage for uninsured \n     children. The resources will be used in the most cost-\n     effective manner possible to expand coverage and services for \n     low-income and uninsured children with a goal of up to 5 \n     million currently uninsured children being served.\n\n  The remainder of the amendment strikes the additions and subtractions \nfrom the resolution that are included in the Hatch-Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me just speak for a couple of minutes. First, I \nlistened attentively, I say to my fellow Senators, to the explanation \nof the minority leader of the Kennedy-Hatch amendment. Frankly, I \nnormally I have great, great esteem for the leader, and I respect him \nalmost every time he speaks on the floor. But let me suggest, I would \nbe willing to submit to arbitration by any three intelligent people \nthat you want to pick, and ask them if this amendment, the amendment \nthat I have just tried to modify, the Hatch-Kennedy amendment, does not \nviolate the agreement.\n  The parties to the agreement agreed that they would fight against \namendments that are inconsistent with the agreement. Mind you, what do \nyou think we argued for 3 months over? We argued one thing: What is the \nlevel of net new tax cuts that are going to be available? We \ncompromised and the President compromised. The distinguished minority \nleader now comes along and tells the Senate, ``It's not inconsistent to \ntake $30 billion of that $85 billion.'' Now, I am not good enough with \npercentages, but could somebody figure that out----\n  Mr. GORTON. More than a third.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. More than a third, and just whack it out of there and \nsay, ``That's not inconsistent''? I cannot believe there could be \nanything more inconsistent with the agreement than that.\n  If that is not enough, let's take the next one. We agreed in this \nagreement that many of the things the President wanted he would not get \nand many of the things he wanted he would get, and the one thing he \nwanted, and most Republicans wanted, was to cover children that are not \ncovered. So we agreed, I say to my fellow Senators, on $16 billion, and \nI just read to you, not the budget resolution because it can't do that, \nbut the agreement between the President of the United States and the \nleaders and what it said about covering children, and $16 billion that \nwas not in any program was put in the budget in compromise with the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I do not think it matters much whether something is so patently \ninconsistent as that. It is not going to change any votes, but I do not \nwant the record of this Senate to go by with even such a distinguished \nSenator as the minority leader suggesting that this amendment is not \ninconsistent with the budget agreement. It is impossible that anybody \ncould get any dictionary and look up the word ``inconsistent'' and \napply it to these two sets of facts and not conclude that this is \ninconsistent.\n  There is nothing precluding these two distinguished Senators and \ntheir cosponsors from offering inconsistent amendments, and when I am \nfinished they are probably going to stand up and say they didn't agree \nnot to submit inconsistent amendments, unless they want to try to \ncontinue on with some illogical idea that it is not inconsistent.\n  But the point of it is not what their rights and privileges are, the \npoint of it is what we agreed to after all those months. I suggest, \nSenator Kennedy has already told us--I yield 5 additional minutes--that \nperhaps the Vice President is standing by to come up here and vote. I \nhope not, I say to the leader. I hope not. I have no idea whether he is \nor is not. But, frankly, had I the slightest suspicion that the Vice \nPresident himself would come here and vote inconsistent with the \nagreement that the President signed, I would have asked that the Vice \nPresident sign the agreement. That is what we should have done, for he \nfeels not bound by it, I assume.\n  He can come up here and vote absolutely inconsistent with it and \nbreak a tie, if that occurs, and I doubt that that is going to occur. \nHe can feel comfortable and the President can say--I don't know what. \nMaybe he will say, ``I don't control the Vice President.'' Do you think \nhe might say that, I say to the leader? Maybe that is what he will say. \nOr maybe he will say, ``I'm sorry, Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy \nhave more sway over me than you do, Mr. President, for you're telling \nus that you support our position.'' What is the Vice President saying? \nYou support the President? The President signed this agreement. This is \nnot just some little piece of paper floating around.\n  Anybody that knows about this Senator, I have been through so many \nbudgets, so many that I am hoping this is the last one, I say to the \nleader, because it might be balanced. But I tell you, never have we \nworked harder to get something bipartisan that is supported by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Let me tell you, this language that the distinguished minority leader \nread from that is included in this agreement--there are 10 covenants. I \nsay to my good friend, Senator Gorton, at one point there were 20. So \nit is not as if they were just all of a sudden agreed to. There were \n20.\n  We said, ``You know, that's too many agreements. It's too hard to \nenforce an agreement with so many covenants.'' We spent 3 days arguing \nabout those. In fact, one time the majority leader said, ``Why don't \nyou go and solve that and don't bother me.'' We did. So we left, and in \na couple days we came back and got it boiled down to 10 covenants as \npart of this agreement. It clearly says things inconsistent with this, \nthe President and the Democratic leadership will use everything within \ntheir power to see that those kinds of amendments are defeated.\n  I am going to take another 3 or 4 minutes beyond the time I have just \nreserved and talk about a couple of other things.\n  My good friend, Senator Hatch, I say to the Senator, if you desire to \nraise taxes on cigarettes--what is the amount you would like to do it \nin your bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. Forty-three cents.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you would like do raise it----\n  Mr. HATCH. Plus the equivalent for others.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thirty, forty, sixty cents, you go to the Finance \nCommittee. You are a distinguished member. You sit very, very high up \nin seniority on that Finance Committee. There is nothing in this budget \nagreement--nothing--that says you cannot try to raise cigarette taxes \nin that committee. You just propose it. You can raise cigarette taxes \nright there in that committee. You do not need very many votes. There \nis nothing that precludes you from it.\n  Let me tell you, the irony of it all is that if the Kennedy-Hatch \namendment passes, you will have the exact same difficulty getting the \ncigarette tax through as if you did not have this thing, because there \nis nothing in this amendment that you propose here today that says the \nFinance Committee of the United States is bound to vote in a cigarette \ntax--nothing.\n  I said once--I will say it again--cigarette taxes are not mentioned \nin the amendment. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts got up \nand said, we have drawn it like amendments have been drawn forever. You \nare right. And the interpretation and the efficacy is as it has exactly \nbeen forever. That foreverness has meant it is not binding, it is not \nbinding on anyone. To the extent that you want to put a statement with \nthis, it is hortatory. It is giving your\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\nviews and talking to the American people about what you would like to \nsee happen. But it is not binding, never has been binding. We have \nnever had this kind of situation where you could make it binding.\n  Now, having said that, I do not believe anybody in this country \nshould believe that the President of the United States, the Democrats \nwho were at the table with him, his three negotiators, Senator \nDomenici, Frank Lautenberg, John Kasich, and John Spratt--Members of \nthe House, the last two--I do not think anybody should believe that we \nignored a need in our society, to wit: to cover young children who are \nnot covered. We did not. I can say with as much certainty and integrity \nand sincerity as Senator Hatch has said, we intend to cover them. We \nintend to cover those who are in need. We said it in disagreement; and \nthere is $16 billion in there.\n  Incidentally, for Members who might be interested how this money gets \nspent--and I draw no inferences from it--but the distinguished Senator, \nSenator Kennedy, does not sit on the Finance Committee. All the $16 \nbillion that is in this agreement goes to the Finance Committee because \nthey have Medicaid, which is one of the major programs. It is \ninteresting, with the amendment, the committee that the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts sits on will get $18 billion to spend. So \nnow we will split the responsibility, $18 billion to his committee, to \nthe committee he serves on, and $18 billion for the Finance Committee. \nAnd, again, it seems to me there is little need for that.\n\n  So I close by saying I have offered an amendment that clearly says \nand unequivocally says we have provided for the children who do not \nhave insurance in this country, and how we provided it is contained in \nthe budget resolution.\n  I believe any Senator voting for that ought to be held to saying, \n``We voted for it. That's what we are getting. That's what the \nagreement says. And we are not going to vote to turn right around and \ndestroy the very agreement that created that right.''\n  I want to assure everyone, if this budget agreement falls apart, and \nI know on this one--I think I know what I am talking about--there is \nlittle assurance that this body is going to approve $16 billion for \nchild health care, little assurance, because clearly there are all \nkinds of ideas on how we ought to do it, and it will take a few years \nfor those to pan out. We said, ``OK, Mr. President, even though you \ndon't know how you're going to do it, we'll put it in there for you.'' \nThat is the very truth about the $16 billion.\n  Mr. President, I want everyone to know--and I want to state for the \nother side--at the expiration of the time on this amendment, I will \nclaim the floor back as the floor manager, and unless you intend to let \nus vote on the Domenici substitute, I will perfect the tree with \nanother amendment, so we will get a vote on it, and we will get a vote \non it before anything else happens here in the Senate in terms of this \nbudget resolution.\n  I yield the floor at this point.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the distinguished minority manager yield me time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield such time as the Senator from Utah needs to \nmake his presentation.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  I think that the Democratic leader has made a very compelling case. \nThe amendment we are offering does not break the budget agreement.\n  He summarized three points basically.\n  No. 1, our amendment, just like the Domenici amendment, embodies no \nnew health care program but builds on the existing monies in the budget \nresolution.\n  No. 2, although our amendment alters the revenue numbers by raising \nthe tax on tobacco there is no excise tax in the body of the text. It \nis my understanding that such language would not be in order. I think \nit would also raise serious constitutional questions about a tax \noriginating in the Senate. I think my colleagues understand that point.\n  No. 3, as I am pleased to recognize, as Senator Daschle has noted, \nour amendment does not worsen the deficit. In fact, it lowers the \ndeficit.\n  You would think that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would \nbe interested in doing supporting this language, especially on a \nbalanced budget resolution. Keep in mind, although this budget \nresolution claims to balance the budget, the U.S. Government will still \nhave a $6 trillion national debt. The Hatch-Kennedy amendment would \nreduce that debt by $10 billion more over the next 5 years.\n  Frankly, for these reasons I believe that our amendment is fully \nconsistent with the budget resolution as described by the distinguished \nBudget Committee chairman.\n  Let us not use as an excuse to avoid an important vote on a major \npublic health problem that we are somehow trying to break the agreement \non the budget resolution. My amendment helps the budget. And, in the \nend, we will be helping 10 million uninsured children who otherwise \nwill not have the help we can provide them today.\n\n  Let me also be very candid here with respect to the strategy. We all \nknow that if we do pass this amendment, it will probably have to be \nincluded in the reconciliation bill. If we do not pass the Hatch-\nKennedy amendment today, I understand--and I believe it is probably \naccurate--that it will take 60 votes to do it on a reconciliation bill. \nI am not saying we cannot get the 60 votes, but naturally we would like \nto be able to have it in the budget resolution so that we do not have \nto have that hurdle.\n  If I have some advice for my colleagues on my side of the aisle, I \nwould suggest you acknowledge that $16 billion is not enough, \nespecially when you, in a sense, rob Peter to pay Paul. We will end-up \ntaking DSH moneys that were to be used for the poor and using many of \nthem for a new program of children's health.\n  At that, the $16 billion will not take care of more than what the \nChafee-Rockefeller-Jeffords-Breaux bill provides. It will take care of \nmaybe 3 million kids who are eligible for Medicaid but are not \nenrolled, but it does not take care of the 7 million kids who are not \neligible for Medicaid but can't afford health insurance.\n  So those who believe that they are doing the right thing by upholding \nthis so-called budget agreement when, in fact, my amendment does not \nbreak the agreement, may be making it even more difficult to pass \nlegislation that would help poor children in working families.\n  One of my colleagues said, you have won Senator Hatch because you got \n$16 billion in the budget resolution. I admit that I am very pleased \nwith this result and that it is a step in the right direction. And, in \nfact, that money would probably not be there in the budget resolution \nhad it not been for the efforts of those Senators who support the CHILD \nlegislation as well as other proposals.\n  I commend my colleagues on the Budget Committee for doing providing \nthe $16 billion. Unfortunately, that amount will not provide the \nnecessary financial commitment needed to ensure those children most in \nneed.\n  Senator Domenici's substitute amendment to my amendment essentially \nstrikes out all the moneys raised in my bill for children. In effect, \nthe substitute amendment is what is already contained in the budget \nresolution for children's health--and nothing more.\n  Frankly, if you look at that amendment, basically it says on page 3, \nline 3, where we had increased the amount by $16 billion, it strikes \nout $16 billion; page 3, line 4, it strikes out the money; there on \npage 3, line 5, it strikes out the money; there on page 3, line 6, it \nstrikes out the money there, right on down through the whole amendment.\n  So all they are saying is they are going to limit new spending for \nchildren's health to $16 billion, whether that is adequate or not. I \nthink we have made better than a good case that it is inadequate. I \nthink we made a case that every Senator in this Chamber ought to be \nable to support.\n  It is time to resolve this problem. We are going to have to resolve \nit. You know, the odds have been very heavily against us from the start \non this thing in the budget context. But I hope that those who are \nsupporters of the Hatch-\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\nKennedy bill will stand up, and I hope that there are others who may be \nsupporters who will think this through and realize that it is a good \namendment to support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with all due respect, I think \nthe position of the chairman of the Budget Committee is to deny us an \nopportunity to get a vote on our particular measure.\n\n  I listened with great interest to what he said. He said that, ``I \nthink three mature adults would be able to look at this amendment and \nmake a judgment that it's inconsistent with the budget agreement.'' We \nhave more than that number here that are prepared to vote on that \nissue. We think that at least 100 adults ought to be able to vote on \nthat issue and make a judgment. We have tried to address the concerns \nthat were raised concerning the consistency of our amendment with the \noverall budget agreement, and we did address them earlier.\n  I want to point out that the budget resolution is the right vehicle \nfor this measure and I am sure that the Members are aware of this. I \nlistened and watched how the Senator from New Mexico was looking over \nat the Senator from Utah saying with great fanfare, ``You can raise \nthese issues at any time. You're a member of the Finance Committee.'' \nOf course, as the Senator from New Mexico knows, measures dealing with \nraising a tax must begin in the House of Representatives, not in the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  So to raise the tobacco tax, we need to amend the revenue bill. The \nConstitution requires tax bills to originate in the House, the \nreconciliation bill created by the budget resolution will probably be \nthe only revenue measure considered this year.\n  We ought to understand substance of this debate. This is not a case \nwhere we will be able to address this tomorrow, next week or 2 months \nfrom now--this is it. For the parents of children that need health \ninsurance, this is the opportunity. Now is the moment. Today is the day \nin the U.S. Senate. Unless we provide for the tax in the budget \nresolution, we will not have an opportunity to offer the amendment \nlater. This budget is not only the right place for this amendment, it \nis the only place for this amendment. That is why this debate is so \nimportant.\n  We were prepared to vote a few moments ago, and we are prepared to \nmove now to reach some conclusion.\n  Given the reasons I outlined, I urge that we support the Domenici \namendment. What that will do is restate what is in the budget \nagreement, which is the $16 billion in the restoration in terms of \nMedicaid. We agree with that. We would not council our Members not to \nvote for that. We agree with that. We hope we will have an opportunity \nafter that amendment is completed to vote on our amendment.\n  As I understand, the Senator from New Mexico will ask for recognition \nand he will put in another amendment. He can do that. That amendment \nwill be accepted and we will be right back to a point where we can \noffer our amendment again. We can do that again and again and again and \nagain and again. The question then becomes, why can we not have the \nvote on this particular measure? Why can we not go ahead and have the \nvote on this measure? We believe very sincerely that it is not \ninconsistent with the budget resolution.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has not told us about how this would \nreduce the possibility of a capital gains tax. He has not stated that \nour amendment will eliminate the possibility of increasing the estate \ntax exemption. He has not said it will compromise our opportunity to do \nsomething about IRA's or the education tax. He has not said this will \ncut back on the issue of spending cuts, because, as he knows, the final \namount as mentioned in the reported $138 billion, will be included in \nthe first downpayment and installation. None of this is altered or \nchanged by our amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have to come back to the issue here. The issue is \nwhether the Senate of the United States will go on record this \nafternoon in saying we will provide a very modest increase in the cost \nof cigarettes, 43 cents a pack, that will convey direct health benefits \nto millions and millions of children discouraging them from smoking and \nproviding $20 billion over the next 5 years to help States pay for \nchildren's health coverage. States can then make the decision as to \nwhether or not they want to participate. It will also provide a $10 \nbillion deficit reduction.\n  That does not do violence to the budget agreement. This is not an \namendment that says we want this coverage, now you find the revenues. \nWe are not taking the revenue out of any particular area. This \namendment is self-funded. It is probably one of the few, or only, self \nfunded initiatives that will be offered this session. Maybe others will \ncome down.\n  That is the issue. I hope the leadership would not deny us the \nopportunity for the Senate to express its will. It is 10 minutes to \n2:00. We were scheduled to debate from 9:30 to 11:30. We had speakers \nready to speak and we were ready to vote at 11:30, and now at 10 \nminutes to 2 o'clock we are told we will have one underlying vote and \nmaybe another. I think the message that will come out of this debate is \nthat the Republican leadership refuses to let the Senate of the United \nStates vote on a children's health care issue. I think that would be \nvery unfortunate--unfortunate to the children and unfortunate to the \nparents.\n  I do not see why we should be denied the opportunity to let the \nSenate work its will. We are completely within our rights in offering \nit. We are within our rights to expect we would have a resolution. This \nis a matter of enormous importance and it has overwhelming support of \nthe American people.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been listening to the Senator and I think anybody \nwho understands the parliamentary situation knows we can get a vote. It \nmay take a few days, but we can get a vote. I do not want to have that \nkind of a confrontation, but if that is the way it is, then that is the \nway it is. I am prepared to accept the Domenici amendment and probably \nsome of the future amendments, and I am prepared to vote.\n  That still does not resolve the problem that the distinguished \nSenator and I have been trying to solve, am I right?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. We have made our \ncase. We have strong support on both sides of the aisle. All we want to \ndo is get the Senate to work its will on an issue involving the \ncoverage of health care for children which will be paid for with a \ncigarette tax.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask my colleague another question? Is it not correct \nthat all we are saying here is that we would like to have a vote, win \nor lose, on our amendment today? If we win, that makes it easier for us \nto go through the process. Naturally, any good legislator should want \nto do that if you really believe in what you are doing. I have to say \nboth of us believe in what we are doing.\n  That is true, is it not?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. This will be the most important \nvote in this Congress on children's issues. This vote we are about to \neither have an opportunity to conduct or be denied that opportunity, \nwill be the most important vote in this Congress. There is no question \nabout that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I normally would not get this argumentative, but, to be \nhonest with you, I have heard some of the worst arguments against this \nbill that I have ever heard in any Senate proceeding.\n  This morning I read a New York Times article, ``Citing Lost Cigarette \nRevenue, GOP Fights Child Insurance.'' I could not believe what I read:\n\n       Republican senators today attacked a children's health \n     insurance bill, saying the higher Federal tax it would put on \n     tobacco would cost the states more than $1 billion in revenue \n     annually by cutting cigarette sales.\n       The measure, proposed by Senators Orrin G. Hatch, \n     Republican of Utah, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of \n     Massachusetts, calls for raising the current 24-cents-a-pack \n     Federal tax to 67 cents to pay for subsidized insurance for \n     children of the working poor. The sponsors of the bill intend \n     to offer it on\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\n     Wednesday as an amendment to the budget resolution.\n\n  Here is where it is interesting:\n\n       The Republican Policy Committee, an arm of the leadership, \n     today called the sponsoring Senators' intentions \n     ``admirable'' but misguided, ``because states depend to a \n     great degree on excise tax revenue.'' The committee estimated \n     that decreased smoking resulting from the tax increase would \n     cost states and localities $6.5 billion over five years.\n       ``Even if one believes that decreased demand for tobacco is \n     positive from a societal view, it still has negative fiscal \n     aspects for the States,'' the committee said.\n\n  Let me tell you, that is really something. I had just heard about \nthis recent policy analysis put out by the Republican Policy Committee \nabout the ``unforeseen effects'' of the tobacco tax. I was not exactly \nproud to be a Republican under those circumstances. I am sure some of \nmy colleagues wish I were not today.\n  But I am going to be because I believe in the Republican Party and I \nbelieve in what we stand for and I believe in taking care of kids. I \nbelieve in helping those who cannot help themselves.\n  Let's start taking the money away from those that can but won't help \nthemselves.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, on April 23, the Republican Policy \nCommittee issued a report entitled, ``The Complex Problem of Insuring \nUninsured Children.'' This report, revised on May 1, noted that this is \nthe first in a series of RPC papers devoted to this issue. We can only \nhope that this most recent May 16 piece of tortured logic is the last \nof this series unless more compelling analyses are forthcoming.\n  Here is the point that is entirely missed. It would be a great thing \nfor the public health of this country and particularly for the health \nof young Americans if tobacco tax revenues dropped substantially \nbecause tobacco is the single greatest preventable threat to our \nNation's public health.\n  No one should be so protective of lower tobacco taxes because the \ntaxes might raise more revenues, any more than the public would support \nappointing Dr. Kevorkian as a Surgeon General in an attempt to achieve \nMedicare savings.\n  I look forward to economists studying in detail the analyses of the \nMay 16 RPC paper. It seems to me that the tobacco companies would have \nliked to have been able to have included this somewhat mysterious line \nof reasoning in their public comments to the FDA rules pertaining to \nthe regulation of tobacco sales to minors.\n  I wonder how much of the supposed $6.5 billion in lost revenues to \nStates that they say will happen comes in the form of illegal sales \nthat are quite literally poisoning and hooking our youth. I also want \nto know what Governors publicly take the position that State tobacco \nrevenues are more important than the public health. I doubt many of the \n20-plus attorneys general involved in lawsuits to recover State \nMedicaid funds attributable to tobacco-related illnesses would agree \nthat a decrease in tobacco consumption is a bad idea.\n  It seems to me that the title of the May 16 report, ``Unforeseen \nEffects of the Much-Touted Tobacco Tax Should Be Changed,'' frankly, it \nwould be better titled, ``The World Turned Upside Down.'' I will be \ninterested to know what the experts on the Joint Tax Committee and \nother groups, how they will view this RPC analysis.\n  If I were not just a humble country lawyer from out West, I would \nalmost get the feeling that somebody told the analysts at the RPC to \ntrash the tobacco tax in any way possible. I have been around here for \n20 years, better than 20 years. I have been trashed by more gifted \nanalyses than this.\n  Let me close this portion of my thoughts by saying that if I could \nget a list of Senators who are withholding support of our amendment due \nto the reasoning contained in the RPC document, I would immediately \nenter into discussions with my cosponsors. I think it is probably safe \nto say that if this is what it takes to attract more supporters to our \nmeasure, we can probably shift some of the funds marked for Federal \ndeficit reduction to indemnify the States from potential revenue losses \nto any decrease in tobacco uses.\n  Who are these Senators? Senator Kennedy and I would like to talk to \nyou.\n  Now the Republican Policy Committee is implying that it is more \nimportant to preserve tobacco excise taxes than the health of our \nchildren because we will get people, especially children, to quit \nsmoking in the process. We know that every time smoking goes up 10 \npercent, 7 percent of the kids will never touch a cigarette.\n  Are we to sacrifice people's health and lives to preserve tobacco \nexcise taxes? Would we rather have excise taxes than healthy citizens \nin our States? Those who argue this way seem to want to maintain big \ntobacco revenues at the expense of the life and health of our citizens.\n  Now, I find this appalling because all Senator Kennedy and I are \noffering is legislation that will result in good health for smokers and \nwhich will help children. The arguments of the opponents are logically \nflawed. Their interest in maintaining State tax revenues at a certain \nlevel is more important to them than the health and welfare of the \ncitizens in our States.\n  When it gets to the point that we are so ideologically constipated \nthat we place the preservation of State tobacco revenues above the \nwelfare of our American citizens, then we need to rethink our \nphilosophy. I have to say I would have been willing to sit down and \ndiscuss this matter with anybody, reasonably, on how to handle this.\n  I have to admit that I am probably irritating everybody around here. \nBut I am irritated, too. If you want to play this game, we can just \nhave one vote after another from here on in until the end of the \nprocess, and we will finally get our vote. If it means day and night, I \nwill be here. I have done it before. I can do it again.\n  All I want is some consideration for our side. In all honesty, I \ndon't think we have had much. We are talking about kids here. We are \ntalking about the poorest of the poor kids not on Medicaid, and about \nMedicaid kids, too. We are talking about doing something right--doing \nsomething for people who cannot help themselves and doing it by raising \nmoney from the industry that is causing a lot of the troubles.\n  I also have to tell you that 72 percent of all adults in this country \nthink this is the right thing to do. And even 50 percent of all smokers \nthink it is the right thing to do.\n  There isn't a better tax cutter in this body or one more zealously \ndevoted to it than Orrin Hatch. Don't tell me about raising taxes, or \ncutting taxes.\n  I have been for every tax cut I can get. I was one of the few who \nvoted against the 1986 tax increase in the Reagan years and the Bush \ntax increase when it came up. I voted against that even though I was \nbrought down to the White House and asked to vote for it. I sincerely \ntold the President I couldn't do it.\n  So I have the credentials on tax cutting. I was one of the original \nsupply-side proponents and went all over this country to 36 States for \nthen-Governor Reagan arguing for tax cuts.\n  Here we have something that could be done to rectify some of the \nproblems of our society without a cost to 80 percent of American \ntaxpayers--only about 20 percent would pay this--and you would think \nthe whole world was coming to an end.\n  I really believe that if big tobacco were smart, they would come and \nsay we ought to do this. People out there would respect them, and there \nwould be more of an interest in trying to work out their difficulties \nwith them.\n  I have to say that I am getting a little frustrated. This is an \nimportant issue. It shouldn't be treated trivially.\n  So we will just see what happens. Unless I can be shown some better \nway of getting this amendment considered and having an up or down vote \non it, then we are just going to keep fighting this battle until we get \nthat vote.\n  I am open to the suggestions of my colleagues. I am open to sitting \ndown with them to talk to them and see what can be done. But until \nthen, this is the way it is going to be here.\n  We may lose here today. But, if we do, it won't be for the lack of \ntrying, and it won't be the last time we try either. It isn't going to \nend, even if it is right up to the end of the Congress. I just want to \nnotify everybody now. I do not want any arguments next year that \nsomebody is going to be hurt by this debate because I have notified \nthis body that I plan to press the issue.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding to me.\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\n  I yield back to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take maybe 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute 40 \nseconds remaining on the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Three minutes from the bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 3 minutes from the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to commend my friend from \nUtah for presenting what is the real issue before the U.S. Senate at \nthis moment, and for making such a convincing case in support of this \namendment which will provide health insurance for children.\n\n  Mr. President, I am having trouble understanding why our majority \nleader is not willing to let us vote on health insurance for children \nfinanced by a cigarette tax. I am just wondering why he is hesitating. \nWhat are we afraid of? Why can't the Senate decide by a majority vote \nwhether our national priority is to children or to tobacco companies? \nWhy can't we vote on whether the Senate stands with children or with \nJoe Camel and the Marlboro Man?\n  I think we ought to move ahead and have a vote. That is what the \nregular order would be. We don't take any satisfaction in just urging \nthe Senate to accept the amendment of the Senator of New Mexico. The \nonly thing we are trying to do is get a vote on our particular \namendment. I certainly hope that cooler heads of leadership will at \nleast permit us the opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. President, my time has expired. I urge all of my colleagues to \nvote in favor of the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico because \nit is a restatement of what is in the budget resolution bill--$16 \nbillion for needy children. We are in strong support of that proposal.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also suggest that everybody vote for this \namendment. That is fine with me. We will just vote for it. I am \nprepared to take it, but if not, then let's vote, and we will go from \nthere.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could you tell me the time on the \nDomenici second-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the sponsor is 16 minutes 51 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes is yielded to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to make just two arguments.\n  The first one is somewhat in response to my friend, Senator Hatch, \nfor whom I have great respect.\n  Mr. President, I think it is inconsistent with the facts of the \nagreement between the President and the Congress for any Senator to \nstand up here on the floor and talk to the American people as if their \nproposal is the only one that is going to take care of children in \nAmerica. That is not true, whether it come from my distinguished \nfriend, the senior Senator, Senator Hatch, or from whomever. The \nstatement should be that they think they have another way to do it. But \nto try to look out there and say to America this is a serious issue, it \nis about kids, as if to say the agreement we made with the President \nisn't about kids.\n  So we are not going to stand here and let that occur without telling \nthe American people that that just isn't so, no matter how or under \nwhat circumstance my good friend, Senator Hatch, desires, or speaks it \non the floor of the Senate. We are just as much about kids as his \nproposal is. For him to stand here and imply that that isn't the case \nis just not fair.\n  We believe in the agreement with the President, although we would do \nit a different way. We wouldn't send the money to the Labor and Health \nand Human Services Committee. We would send it to the Finance \nCommittee. But we believe we took care of the kids who are going to be \nuninsured during the next 5 years of this budget agreement.\n  So I just want in my first observation to say, yes, this is about \nkids. Yes, it is about uninsured kids in America. And, yes, we cover \nthem. If we want to talk about another issue, a cigarette tax, which \nthis amendment does not guarantee--in fact, there is every reason to \nbelieve that, if you adopt it, the Finance Committee of the U.S. Senate \nand the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. House need not adopt it.\n\n  So to make like that is the issue, like something in this amendment \nis going to get you cigarette taxes--which I am not against, \nincidentally, I am not against them--but that just isn't what the \namendment does. You can talk about some bill you have in mind, but this \nis a budget, not a bill.\n  My last point is this. I defy anyone--and I urge my good friends who \nwould like to take the position that this amendment is not inconsistent \nwith this agreement. I would like them to do just one thing. I ask my \nfriend, Senator Hatch, to do just one thing: Just get the bipartisan \nagreement when you have a moment. Look at item No. 1. I will read it to \nyou. ``The elements of this bipartisan agreement provide for deficit \nreduction amounts that are estimated to be the result in the balanced \nbudget by 2002.''\n  It proceeds then to say that there is a tax--a summary of the \nagreement. It is in a chart form. The agreement then proceeds to say \nthat the majority leader, the minority leader, the President of the \nUnited States--as I indicated, maybe not the Vice President, because \nmaybe he is not bound by the President--but it says that this \nagreement, as contained in this piece of paper, these numbers, governs \nand that anything that will be offered that is inconsistent will be \nopposed.\n  I say to Senator Hatch that his amendment takes this agreement, this \none right here, and it changes two of the numbers right off the bat--\nthe $85 billion on the tax cuts is changed by his amendment. In fact, \nit is reduced by $30 billion. Excuse me. The Presidential initiatives, \na line here, $31 billion, you have altered that by adding $20 billion.\n  So now I don't believe anybody ought to be taking the point that the \nmajority leader of the U.S. Senate, or minority, or our whip, or myself \nas chairman, that when we say this does break the agreement, I cannot \nconceive how anybody could say that they have another interpretation \nthat says it doesn't. That makes it a very important event.\n  Would Senator Nickles like to speak for a few moments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to echo the comments made by my \ncolleague from New Mexico. This is even more important than the budget \nagreement.\n  You are only, in the Senate, as good as your word. There is a \ndocument that says we are going to have net tax cuts of 85. This makes \nnet tax cuts 55. There is an addendum that says there is going to be a \nkid care initiative that costs 16. This amendment makes that kid care \ninitiative 36.\n  This is not the agreement. If people on the other side are now saying \nthis is consistent with the agreement, that is not the case. And it \nreally does unravel this deal. It is beyond me.\n  I would like to think that people would have more credibility in \ntheir word and would say, ``I will always tell you the truth.'' If \npeople are going to say this doesn't break the deal and the Vice \nPresident is going to come down and say this is consistent with the \ndeal, then we don't have a deal. Some people are just evidently quite \nhappy to break it up and make sure that we don't have a deal.\n  I will go further to say that this is consistent with the deal. I can \ncertainly have an amendment to cut discretionary spending by $20 \nbillion and increase the tax cut by $30 billion. I would like to offer \nthat amendment. Tell the majority leader, I would like\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\nto offer that amendment. I think we spent too much money on the \ndiscretionary side, and I think we didn't cut taxes enough. It wasn't \nmy intention to offer that amendment because it would be inconsistent \nwith the deal.\n  I want a balanced budget. I want some tax relief. But this amendment, \nif it passes, tells me there won't be a budget. It tells me that people \nwho ``negotiated in good faith'' can say that this is consistent. \nFrankly, that bothers me more than the amendment. It bothers me a lot. \nYou have to be as good as your word.\n  There is a package here that says here is the agreement. It says kid \ncare, $16 billion. It didn't say 36. It said net tax cuts 85. It didn't \nsay net tax cuts 55. I do not want to go to my constituents and say it \nwas going to be 85 but now it turned out to be 55. But, boy, we got \ngypped. We didn't do what we said we were going to do.\n  We ought to at least try to do what we said we were going to do, but \nyet we have not been here 1 day and people are undermining this \nagreement and, frankly, making allegations that this is consistent with \nthe package when it absolutely is not.\n  If this amendment should pass, this is one Senator who will not be \nsupportive of this package. And it bothers me because I want to balance \nthe budget. I want to provide some tax relief. I want us to help save \nMedicare, and I think the net result is the passage of this amendment \nsays there will be no budget package this year.\n  I hope people are aware of this when they cast this vote. I hope they \ndo not think this is just a free vote. I hope they do not think the \nrest of the people are going to run over on this side and put this \nbudget resolution together and pass a net tax cut of 55. I do not think \nthat will be the case. I do not think it will happen. So I hope people \nwill recognize we are not talking about trivial, little things, that we \nhave legislation in here that encompasses the Hatch-Kennedy bill, but \nwe do have language that says we are going to have a net tax cut of 55. \nThere is a $30 billion tax increase.\n  If somebody wants to raise taxes--and I hear my colleagues talk about \nthis--if they want to raise taxes on tobacco, very easily they can wait \nuntil the reconciliation bill comes in the Chamber. The reconciliation \nbill, consistent with the budget package, will have a net tax cut of \n$85 billion. If they want to have an amendment to that tax cut that \nsays they want to raise cigarette taxes and cut other taxes, that is \nconsistent with the package; they can do that. They cannot come in and \nsay, we want to spend an extra $20 billion in kid care that is not \nconsistent with the package, but they could do that. And then they will \nbe playing with the real bill. They are talking about real bullets. \nThey are talking about taxes.\n  If they want to raise cigarette taxes and cut other taxes, I might \nsupport them. I might help them draft it. But they cannot come in and \nsay, hey, we are going to change the net side of this tax cut as this \namendment proposes to do from 85 to 55. They cannot do it. It is not \nconsistent. It is a deal-breaker. This says the agreement is not worth \nthe paper it is written on. And if the President is going to come down \nhere and endorse it by his vote, or his effort, his presence, that \nmeans we have a real credibility problem. We have a real credibility \nproblem.\n  This amendment is not consistent with the agreement, and I do not \nthink anybody should make that allegation. This is a budget-breaker. \nThis amendment basically says we do not want a budget this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator from New Jersey will yield 3 or 4 \nminutes, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts \nfrom the resolution itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is yielded 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As Senator Hatch and I have pointed out, this is \nbasically budget neutral. I included earlier in the Record the \nassessment of the Joint Economic Committee, and what we have \ndemonstrated is that the expenditures that will be used in order to pay \nfor the program will be raised by the increase in the cigarette tax.\n  The opponents of this amendment cannot have it both ways. You cannot \nspend half the morning saying we are against the increase in the \ncigarette tax and then in the afternoon say, well, this is going to \nsomehow diminish the whole budget agreement in terms of revenue.\n  That is what they have been saying. That is what opponents have been \nsaying.\n  The fact is, as everyone in this body understands, this is revenue \nneutral. This is revenue neutral. I have said if they can come in and \nfind out where our amendment is going to reduce the capability of the \nFinance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee to affect the estate \ntaxes, capital gains, IRA's, student assistance, let them make that \ncase. You cannot do it. You cannot do it. I listened to the rhetoric, \nand it still does not stand.\n\n  Mr. President, the real issue I think is whether we in the Senate, on \nthe one vehicle that can make the difference, are going to have an \nincrease in the tobacco tax and have a children's health insurance \nprogram. That is what we are talking about. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  I have increasing frustration with why the majority leader and the \nchairman of the Budget Committee are refusing to let us do so. We can \nmake up our own minds. The case has been set. People have listened to \nthe debate. Let them make up their own minds on it.\n  It is our position that when it says in this budget agreement if \nbills, resolutions or conference reports are deemed to be consistent--I \nthink our minority leader had indicated how it is consistent, because \nthe budget points out we are taking $16 billion to look at the \nMedicaid. We are looking at those individuals who are just above the \nMedicaid, the working poor, looking at those children. A child is a \nchild. We should not say, OK, it is all right, it is consistent with \nthat. If you are going to be below a certain level of poverty, it will \nbe 85 percent above the poverty, and say, well, that is completely \ninconsistent. The American people are not going to buy that. The \nAmerican people are not buying that. That is an absolute phony, fake \nargument.\n  This is consistent because it is looking after needy, poor children--\nthat is the issue--paid for by a cigarette tax. If you do not want that \nand want to oppose it, at least say let us go ahead and vote and take \nthat position. But we have been on it now since 9:30 this morning. It \nis 2:30. We are denied the opportunity to let the overwhelming majority \nof the American people have a vote on it.\n  Seventy-five percent of the American people support this. And if they \nare watching television today, they are saying, why can't the Senate of \nthe United States at least vote it yes or no? We are being denied that. \nQuite frankly, the children who have been denied that health insurance, \nunable to get it, have been very patient. Their parents have been very \npatient. They are very patient every single night when they are \nconcerned about those children. They are spending all night, all day, \nevery day. We can certainly be patient, too, if the parliamentary \nprocess is going to deny us that opportunity. The majority has the \nright of recognition, and they can put on another amendment; we are \nsupporting this. Then they put on another. But eventually that slot is \ngoing to open up and Senator Hatch and I are going to be here to fill \nit.\n  That is where we are, Mr. President. We just cannot understand why \nhere, after all these hours, with this issue and debate, somehow some \nMembers on that side are saying, if you pass a small health insurance \nprogram for needy children, 10 million children, that is paid for, it \nis going to end the whole budget deal. That is what they are saying. \nThey are saying, if you provide enough money for 10 million children, \nthe world is going to come to an end. We are ending the budget deal. We \nwill never get to a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, they cannot be such strong defenders of Joe Camel.\n  That is where we are, Mr. President. I hope we can move ahead. We are \ngoing to try to point this out all the way along the line, but I hope \nwe can move ahead and get to some judgment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Why not give me 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is yielded up to 10 \nminutes.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in all of this passion, in all of our \nefforts to vilify cigarettes and talk about taxing them, I think we \nhave really forgotten a fundamental fact, and that is that we already \nhave more money in this budget than we need to buy an insurance policy \nfor every child in America for whom we are seeking to provide health \ncoverage.\n  Let me go back and try to remind people of what this whole debate is \nabout. What this whole debate is about is that the President, after \nlooking at various statistical estimates, concluded that if you look at \nevery family in America with income up to 300 percent of the poverty \nlevel, and I remind you, for a family of four that is $48,000 a year of \nincome--I say to our distinguished majority leader from Mississippi, \nthat is higher than the per capita income and family income of his \nState--that if you look at families up to 300 percent of poverty, there \nare as many as 10 million children in America who are not covered by \neither Medicaid or private health insurance.\n  Now, what the President has done is set the goal, recognizing that \n3.3 million of these children already are or will be qualified for \nMedicaid--they just had not signed up--the President set out a goal of \ncoming up with a program that helps 5 million more children to get \nprivate health insurance.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that the cost of a private \nhealth policy for a child, looking at various data that is available, \naverages about $500 per child for a fairly standard policy--lower with \na higher deductible, higher with a much lower deductible, but basically \n$500 per child. We could go out and buy an insurance policy for all 5 \nmillion children in America that we want to cover, and we could do it \nfor less than the $16 billion that is in this bill.\n  So why should we pass an amendment--unless we just get some pleasure \nfrom spending money, why should we pass an amendment to raise it up to \n$36 billion, which would allow us to buy three policies for every child \nin America that we are trying to help. What could possibly be the \npurpose of such an amendment? What is the purpose of the Kennedy \namendment when he started out saying we need $20 billion? The President \nstarted out with a program that was less than $10 billion. We ended up \nwith a budget that was $16 billion. But the amendment does not say we \nwill take it to $20 billion. The amendment says take it to $36 billion.\n  Now, is there no limit on the amount of money that we want to spend? \nIf we already have in the budget enough money to buy an insurance \npolicy for every child in America that we are trying to target here, \neven up to families that make $48,000 a year, where 82 percent of those \nfamilies already have private health insurance policies that cover \ntheir children, is that not enough? Isn't one insurance policy enough? \nWhy should we have in this bill enough money to buy three insurance \npolicies?\n  That is what the debate here is about. If we simply want to say how \nmuch we want to deal with this problem, maybe this amendment has some \nrelevance. But the plain, honest-to-God truth is, it is going to be \nhard in any rational manner to spend the $16 billion we have already \nprovided. If we just simply went out and bought every child in America \nthat qualifies in this 5 million children problem that the President \nhas defined, we have more than enough money already to do it.\n  Why do we want to add $20 billion more? Could we not use that money \nfor some better purpose? Could we not let families keep the money and \ninvest it in their own children and their own future?\n  So I just want to remind people, in all of this passion about how we \nwant to pound our chest and say how much we care about children, we \nhave already have enough money in this resolution to buy an insurance \npolicy for all 5 million of the children that the President has \ntargeted and that we have agreed to. We clearly could do the job for \nmuch less than we have already committed to spend. But the point is, \nwhy spend three times as much as is required to simply buy the \ninsurance policies? There is no logical reason for doing it. All we are \ndoing is bidding with each other for spending money.\n\n  I would like to note, finally, two additional things. No. 1, I am not \nfor this budget agreement, and I am going to be in the Chamber when \nthis amendment is disposed of telling people why I am not for it. But I \nam not going to vote for the Kennedy amendment to try to kill this \nbudget agreement. And I hope there is nobody on our side of the aisle, \nif this vote turns out to be very close, who is going to cast a vote \nfor the Kennedy amendment thinking, by doing that, they are going to \nkill all the bad things in this budget agreement that we are not for. I \nhave never found that I was smart enough to game the system and end up \nwhere I wanted to be on that basis.\n  So we are going to have an opportunity on final passage to vote \n``no'' if we are going to be against it. I am going to offer amendments \nthat present another vision. But what I want to urge my colleagues to \ndo is to look at this amendment and see we already have more than \nenough money to buy the children's insurance policies that we need. So \nlet us stay with the amount we have in the bill. As chairman of the \nsubcommittee that is going to be instrumental in trying to put the bill \ntogether, I would attest that we can cover all 5 million children with \nthe $16 billion we have.\n  Finally, let me say that it is discouraging to see a budget deal that \ncommits to $16 billion of brand new programs, little baby elephants \nthat are just going to grow, and we cannot pay the bills we already \nhave in Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. But, even for many \nof our Members, the $16 billion is not enough. The ink is not even dry \non the budget deal and here we are, talking about busting it big time. \nIt has to be very discouraging.\n\n  Defeating this amendment, it seems to me, is the reasonable thing to \ndo, unless you really believe that it is just important that you be \nable to say to people: Not only did I want to insure people, but I \nwanted enough money to do it several times over so we can do it just as \ninefficiently as we wanted to and still reach everybody. Unless that \ngets you something at home, don't waste this $20 billion. Don't vote to \nraise taxes and spend this money. We already provide the funds \nnecessary to serve the children we seek to serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield off the bill as much time as the distinguished \nmajority leader desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me that \ntime. We don't want to go over everything that has been said two or \nthree times this afternoon, but let me again make it very clear, if the \nKennedy health care proposal had been in this budget agreement, I would \nnever have agreed to it. I would have never signed on to it. This is a \nnew entitlement program. It is money on top of what is in the budget \nagreement. As a matter of fact, I agree with the Senator from Texas, \nwhat he just said, the $16 billion was more than I thought was \nnecessary. But it is in the agreement and the Finance Committee is \nalready working, I am sure, on ways to deal with those children that \nmight, in fact, be uninsured or not covered. They have the opportunity \nto do that. And there is enough money in here to do it.\n  But, now the Senator comes in here and makes all kinds of threats \nabout how we will go on and on and on today, until we get a vote--I \nguess he presumes to put this in there. And then the argument is made \nthat this does not change the agreement.\n  Would it change the agreement if an amendment is offered to cut \nspending, which I think should happen--there is not enough spending \nrestraint in this agreement--and add it to tax cuts? I would be \ninclined to vote for that, want to vote for that. That would be the \nright thing to do. But that would clearly change the makeup of this \nagreement.\n  So, to now say that this does not change it, that it is revenue \nneutral, when in fact it adds a tremendous\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\namount of money to the area of child health care--the Senator from \nMassachusetts wants a Government takeover in this area. That is what \nreally is at stake here. He knows this clearly is beyond what was \nincluded in the agreement and it would completely unravel it. What will \ncome out of this is we will reach a point where we will not have a \nbudget resolution. I think that would be a real tragedy. But I want to \nmake it clear, I am opposed to this amendment, No. 1, because I think \nit violates what we agreed to, but, also, I am opposed to the Kennedy-\nHatch approach here. I think it costs too much money. I don't think it \nis the answer to the problem.\n  The Finance Committee can work on this and come up with solutions \nthat will get the job done for those children who do in fact have a \nproblem. So I do not think it is fair to imply we are not concerned \nabout this area and we cannot deal with this problem. It is just the \nKennedy-Hatch proposal is not the be-all and end-all. There are other \nproposals out there: 100 percent deductibility or 80 percent \ndeductibility of the cost of this health care is one way to go, with \nmore flexibility for the States. Why, the States are already using that \nflexibility to make sure children are covered. In the State of Utah \nalready the Governor, with limited flexibility, has been able to make \nsure that a third of the children that were not covered are in fact \ncovered. That was pointed out in a Wall Street Journal article in April \nof this year.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator points out the State of Utah already has a \nprogram where they are attempting to cover uncovered children, as do 32 \nother States.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Under the language in the bill presented by the Senator \nfrom Utah and the Senator from Massachusetts, that program would \nessentially be overridden. That program would no longer exist, because \nthe eligibility requirements are strict, those required under the \nKennedy bill are so strict that the Utah program would no longer fit in \nit and therefore could no longer function.\n  This bill would eliminate that Utah program, along with 33 other \nStates. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Including New York.\n  Mr. LOTT. I was not aware that it was actually that restrictive, but \nI know the Senator, who is a former Governor, knows what the States \nalready have been doing and is familiar with the specifics of this \nproposal and how it would make it even more difficult to provide the \ncoverage that is needed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the distinguished majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield, yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it should be pointed out to the majority leader \nthat our bill does not interfere with the innovative programs in Utah \nand many other States which are doing so much to help children get \nhealth care.\n  I think it is important to underscore that even with the great Caring \nprogram, there are still 56,000 kids in Utah who are not covered. This \nis in spite of the Utah Governor's substantial efforts as well. And I \nmight add that throughout the country similar efforts are occurring.\n  If the Senators believe that the language of my bill is not clear on \nthis point, I am open to suggestions on what we can do here.\n  But I think that a much larger point bears repeating. The budget \nincludes a reduction in spending of about $14 billion for Medicaid. \nClearly, everyone recognizes that most of the reductions will probably \ncome from the disproportionate share program, or DSH. There are not \nmany other offsets within the Finance Committee.\n  At the same time, the budget includes $16 billion in new money for \nchildren's health care initiatives. It seems reasonable to assume that \nthe Medicaid reductions will come from DSH--which, after all, is a \nprogram for the poor--and the increase will be given back to the poor \nin the form of Medicaid improvements or a mandatory grant program.\n  So it looks to me like a fairly good percentage of the $16 billion in \nnew money will end up being taken from another program serving poor \nchildren and seniors.\n  Don't get me wrong. I think it is a wonderful thing for the budget to \ninclude the $16 billion.\n  But if you analyze the numbers, you will see that that amount \nprobably will cover the 3 million kids who currently qualify for \nMedicaid but are not enrolled, and maybe even a few more. But I doubt \nit will even cover 5 million in a meaningful way, as the budget \ndocument suggests.\n  And that still leaves 5, 6, or 7 million kids who are not covered.\n  All I am saying is this. We are not interfering with any of those 33 \nState programs. This bill does not interfere with them. In fact, it \nbuilds on existing State efforts.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could regain my time--\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may just finish? I apologize for taking so much time, \nbut let me make this point, since my State was mentioned and since I \nthink the statements were not completely accurate.\n  Under our bill--which as Senator Nickles pointed out earlier is not \neven the subject of our amendment today--participating States would use \nFederal grants to help working parents with incomes too high for \nMedicaid buy private health insurance or purchase care through a \nCommunity Health Center for their children.\n  So Utah could use the Federal funds under the CHILD bill to \nsupplement the current privately supported Blue Cross/Blue Shield \nCaring program for children, which serves over 1,000 children. This \nprogram provides a base on which to greatly expand subsidized private \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  And I know this is true, because I am one of those who helped get \nthat program up and running.\n  I might also add, just for my good friends and colleagues, the \ndistinguished majority leader and the Senator from New Hampshire, the \nUtah program has endorsed the Hatch-Kennedy bill. I think that is just \nsomething that needs to be said.\n  Mr. LOTT. What the Senator from Utah is trying to do, along with the \nSenator from Massachusetts, is mandate how this problem should be \naddressed and add more money beyond what is needed to get the job done, \nand to put it in the budget resolution. We had lengthy discussion about \nhow to deal with this. Meeting with the President's representatives, \ntalking with the President, we came up with what we thought was a \nreasonable compromise in terms of the amount of money, $16 billion, \nwithout the Government takeover provisions, without the Federal \nmandates. I have information here that indicates there are five new \nmajor Federal mandates included in this bill, which will, in fact, \ncomplicate the job of insuring the children.\n  We have an adequate amount of money. We are saying to the Finance \nCommittee and the Members of the Senate, in a subsequent vote that we \nwill have on a reconciliation bill, that there is an area where we need \nto help children who are not covered. We have the funds to do it. And \nfor them to come up with proposals.\n  They will be able to do that. But, no, the Senator is saying: Do it \nour way and do it with an additional $20 billion. Clearly, this is not \ngoing to get through the process. It just cannot, because we will not \nhave a budget agreement if this is included in there. I do not mean \nthat as any sort of threat. I just mean, if we start down that trail \nthere are going to be other amendments offered that then--look, if the \nagreement we shook hands on is going to be wiped out here with this \namendment, where does it stop? There are other amendments pending out \nthere. There are amendments I would like to vote for. I intended, on \nour side, to oppose them because they were not part of the agreement. I \nwould like us to have a disaster fund set up in advance. The Senator \nfrom Texas has an amendment on that. I do not think there are adequate \ntax cuts in this agreement. I think we should have more.\n  If we are going to start doing that, we will wind up with at great \nbig mess on our hands and no budget agreement. That is what is at stake \nhere. Over the insistence that we do it the way the Senator from \nMassachusetts says, to add another $20 billion above what we agreed to \nand what is necessary, we are going to threaten to take down a \nmultitrillion-dollar budget agreement\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\nthat gets us to a balanced budget, that has some reforms in it, some \nrestraint on spending--not nearly enough--and some tax cuts, and not \nnearly enough in that area either. I don't think it is worth \njeopardizing a multitrillion-dollar agreement that the President signed \non to.\n  If he has changed his mind, if he has walked away from this, I think \nhe owes me, you know, the right to know if that is the case. I expect \nthat before the day is out we are going to have some votes. We are \ngoing to see whether the Democrats are going to live up to holding this \npackage to the way we agreed to it or not. If you are not, then how am \nI going to be able to do that?\n  I have taken the flak, I have kept my word. This clearly will defeat \nthe whole purpose of the agreement and what has already been approved \nin the House of Representatives last night in the wee hours of this \nmorning, and what came out of the Budget Committee on a 17-to-4 vote.\n  Now we are going to rewrite it here on the floor, mandating it has to \nbe done this way. I just think it is absolutely the wrong thing to do, \nMr. President, and we intend to resist it all the way.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield 5 minutes on the bill?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this debate is reaching the ridiculous. \nTo say that one-third of 1 percent--that is what we are talking about \nin the total budget agreement--the majority leader--this is going to \ntake the budget deal down. We are talking about one-third of 1 percent \nspending, over the next 5 years; over one-third of 1 percent, paid for.\n  They say ``Oh, that is going to bring it down because it is \ninconsistent with the budget agreement.''\n  Look, Mr. President, I am reading from the budget agreement under \n``children's health, paragraph 2.'' The funding that is in the program \nhere can be used for this purpose:\n\n       A program of capped, mandatory grants to States to finance \n     health insurance coverage for uninsured children.\n\n  That is what our bill is. That is what our bill is. It is a capped \ngrant to the States for uninsured children. It could not be any more \nspecific than what is included in the budget agreement. That is what \nsome of the $16 billion could be for. So we say: Well, let us add it \nfor some of those who are the sons and daughters of working families \nthat do not make sufficient kind of income to be able to do it. Now, \nwhen the majority leader gets up--all we are looking for is a vote. We \nare voting. It is quarter to 3 now, and we are being denied a chance to \nvote on this issue. He refuses. He says if this goes through, this one-\nthird of 1 percent on an issue that relates to a grant to States to \nfinance coverage for uninsured children--that is a good statement of \nwhat our bill is all about, included in the budget agreement, and he is \ntrying to say this is so far removed--it is difficult for me to be able \nto accept.\n  Finally, just on this point, I listened to my friend from Texas talk \nabout the problems, how easy it is to cover all of these children. It \nis interesting, Texas has 1.4 million uninsured children 18 years of \nage or younger; nearly 1 in 4 children, 23 percent, is uninsured. It is \nthe second-highest percentage and the second-highest total number in \nthe country. Texas would receive, under our legislation, $2.6 billion \nto insure uninsured children with this particular program, an average \nof $655 million a year for the uninsured children.\n  This is supported by close to three-quarters, 74 percent, of the \nState of Texas.\n  I respect my colleague from Texas saying, ``Well, there really isn't \na problem out there,'' but there is a problem out there. There is a \nproblem across the country. All we are saying, all Senator Hatch is \nsaying, is this is paid for; it is an issue of covering children which \nis paid for with a tobacco tax.\n  Can we not in the U.S. Senate say, let us, on this issue, go forward \nwith a vote? Evidently, we are being denied this. It is suggested that \nif we dare to go forward with a vote and we possibly are able to \nconvince Republicans, as well as Democrats, that this is a national \npriority, a priority for families in America to provide insurance for \nuninsured children of the neediest families, that suddenly the whole \neconomy and the Nation is in danger. This is a simple choice between \nchildren and the tobacco industry, Mr. President. That is what we are \nfaced with. It seems to me we ought to be able to decide on children \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time does the Senator from Illinois--do we \nwant to alternate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to alternate. How much time does the \nSenator want?\n  Mr. GREGG. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes off the resolution to Senator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise again to recall some of the comments \nI made earlier, but also to address a couple of other issues that have \nbeen raised here.\n  First off, I think it is good that the Senator from Massachusetts has \nfinally admitted--I suspect maybe over the active opposition of his \ncolleague from Utah--that this is a mandated program. He calls it a \n``capped mandated program,'' I call it an unfunded mandated program, \nbut the fact is, we finally got it out in the open. This is a brand new \nmajor entitlement, and it is a mandated entitlement. There is nothing \ndiscretionary about this, nothing at all discretionary about this.\n  As I said earlier, if this is discretionary, this has the same \nrelationship of being discretionary as my golf game has to Tiger \nWoods'. The simple fact is, it has no relationship to discretionary.\n  Let's talk about a couple specific events that occurred relative to \nthe States that get stuck with this program, because they are all going \nto get stuck with this program. Under section 2802, States lose almost \nall flexibility in designing health care programs for kids--almost all \nflexibility. Under section 2802, programs like the one we have in New \nHampshire, which I described earlier which is covering in its \ndemonstration period up to 50 percent of the kids we are trying to \ntarget without additional public costs, and we will get to the 100 \npercent as we develop a plan under the proposal in this budget \nagreement, which gives us the additional money to do that, but that \nplan will be wiped out. And there are 33 other States in this country \nthat have initiatives going forward to address these targeted youth, \ntargeted children, which programs would be put at dramatic risk, if not \nbe wiped out.\n  I suggest the interpretation of the amendment of the Senator from \nUtah is inconsistent with the amendment's language itself. The \namendment states very clearly--very clearly--that States must comply \nwith the Medicaid criteria for supplying health care, and almost in \nevery State, these initiatives that are going forward do not comply \nexactly with the Medicaid criteria as for insurance purposes. So \nflexibility is denied.\n  Not only does that happen, as I mentioned earlier, this amendment is \njust the ultimate in the Federal Government coming in and taking over \nan entire sector of health care. It is a nationalization of health care \nfor, basically, kids and, thus, creating a tremendous movement from the \nprivate sector to the public sector with costs, as kids will move out \nof private-sector coverage on to public coverage.\n  Not only does that occur, but this amendment specifically states that \nwaivers are rejected now. I have to tell you, as a former Governor, it \nis hard to get waivers, but one of the good things that this President \nhas done is that he has loosened up the waiver process, and Secretary \nShalala has been receptive to States that come forward with ideas \nrelative to Medicaid and have asked for waivers. I suspect Utah and I \nsuspect Massachusetts--I know Massachusetts, and I know New Hampshire \nand New Mexico have all participated in this waiver process to try to \ndeliver better health care using imaginative and creative ideas that \nthe State health agencies develop. But do you know what this amendment \nsays? It says, ``Tough luck, States. From here on out, we give no \nwaivers at all''--the ultimate regulatory dictatorial action; the \nultimate\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\nexcess of the Federal regulatory structure.\n  This is a power grab, pure and simple, an attempt to move the issue \nof how you finance health care for kids in America to the Federal level \nand, as a result, it is an outrageous--an outrageous--new mandated \nprogram. It is nice we finally have an admission of that after all the \ndenial we heard earlier, which I found incredible, but finally we have \nan admission that this is a mandated program.\n  The practical effect of creating this program will be it is going to \ncost an additional $20 billion on top of the $16 billion already in the \nbudget for this targeted population which can be taken care of, as so \nappropriately presented by the Senator from Texas, with the $16 \nbillion, which obviously can be taken care of because the President \nsigned on to it and it is his No. 1 priority. This is such an insult to \nthe President to bring this forward in this manner, because they are \nessentially saying the President didn't know what he was talking about \nwhen he said he could take care of this problem with $16 billion.\n  They are saying we need $36 billion to do it. The reason they need \n$36 billion, and $36 billion is an extraordinarily low estimate, is \nbecause they have a nationalization plan. That is what they are \nplanning, they are planning to have all the kids today who are in \nworking families who have low incomes but who happen to be covered by \nhealth insurance moving off that private sector on to the public \nsector. There will be a stampede of employers essentially saying, \n``We're no longer going to cover you, you have to be covered by the \npublic sector.'' That is why the price is going up. That is why they \nneed all this extra money.\n  It is not going to give any child any more coverage of any \nsignificant nature. All it is going to do is allow the Federal \nGovernment to take over the program and allow the taxpayers to pick up \na large percentage of the costs which is presently being picked up by \nthe employer.\n  It is truly an outrage for us--after we have been down this road for \nthe last 40 years of seeing Federal programs that have not worked when \nthe Federal Government has federalized them, programs where the States \nhave been delivering services, and suddenly the Federal Government \ncomes in and federalizes it and we see they do not work, and in an \nattempt to address that just a year ago, we tried to reverse the \nsituation with welfare, for example, and move the programs back to the \nStates--for us to have proposed before us a program which says \nessentially the Federal Government knows best, States are going to be \nwritten out of the process, and we are going to create a huge new cost \nto the taxpayers of this country so that some bureaucrats here in \nWashington can control the definition of how kids are delivered health \ncare and in the process wipe out the coverage that is occurring in the \nprivate sector and the capacity of States to have flexibility, it is \njust a public policy initiative which is totally inconsistent with what \nhas been the flow of events in this country from a standpoint of \nknowing what works and what does not work in the last few years.\n  We have this one other issue that keeps being thrown in our face: We \nhave a choice between tobacco and children. That is not the choice. The \nchoice is between whether or not we want to nationalize health care or \nwhether we want to let the States continue to participate in the \nprocess. There is no choice on coverage here. The President has \ndemanded, and we have put in because we believe it is appropriate, $16 \nbillion to cover kids, to cover the targeted population. That is a fait \naccompli; it is done. The extra $20 billion demanded in this amendment, \nwhich is going to be paid for by a tobacco tax increase, has nothing to \ndo with coverage. What it has to do with is federalization, \nnationalization of a program. So this does not have anything to do with \na choice between kids and tobacco. The kids have already won. We have \nalready in this bill taken care of that issue.\n  Now, if the other side were honest about this, they would allow us to \ndivide the question. They would allow us to divide the question, and \nlet's have a vote on the tobacco tax increase, independent of this \nbrand new major entitlement. But they are not going to let us divide \nthe question. I will move to divide the question. It will be objected \nto.\n  I am happy to have an up-or-down vote on tobacco tax increases. As \nGovernor, I increased tobacco taxes. I do think it is an area we should \nleave to the States, because I do think it is a revenue source most \nStates like to use. I know my State of New Hampshire right now has \nanother tobacco tax proposal on the table to pay for kindergarten. If \nthis goes through, I suspect the projected income from that tax \nincrease to pay for the kindergarten program will be severely \nrestrained.\n  These two have been joined together in order for somebody to have a \nnice little phrase they can put on television at night, but it has no \nrelationship to reality, substance or the manner in which this bill is \nstructured and the way it will deliver services, because we have, in \nthe bipartisan budget agreement--well, the President has in the \nbipartisan budget agreement, with the support of the leadership of the \nCongress, committed to caring for these kids and making sure they have \ninsurance.\n  All this plan does is create a brand new huge bureaucracy which is \ngoing to, once again, federalize the system, write the States out of \nthe process, eliminate the private sector effort in the area and give a \nFederal bureaucracy new lateral control over an element of the economy \nor an area of the economy where the States are making progress and \nwhere with the underlying budget proposal problem will be generally \nsolved.\n  So it is about as misdirected a proposal as I have seen in recent \ntimes, probably not since the Clinton health care plan have I seen a \nmore misdirected proposal, and I believe that was appropriately \nrejected and I hope this proposal will be appropriately rejected.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Illinois 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate, and \nit reminds me of a lesson I learned in politics many years ago. The \nteacher was a fellow who was my boss at the time in Illinois in the \nIllinois State Senate by the name of Cecil Partee. He was president of \nthe senate. He was an African-American Senator from the city of \nChicago. He used to say, when it comes to political decisions, you will \nalways hear a good reason for a decision, but you may not hear the real \nreason.\n  We have heard a lot of good reasons from the other side as to why \nthey might oppose the Hatch-Kennedy proposal, but very few of them are \nwilling to articulate the real reason that they oppose it. Some have \nsaid it is a mandate, a Federal mandate. You hear the word over and \nover and over again. I went through the legislation again, and I have \nto tell you, they should read it more closely. This is voluntary. Each \nState will decide whether to participate and under what terms they will \nparticipate. There is no Federal mandate, there is an opportunity here \nfor a State to address a problem, a problem which I think both \nDemocrats and Republicans would agree is a serious national health \nproblem: 10.5 million uninsured children in America. These are kids who \ndo not get the appropriate medical care, the children of working \nfamilies, families that, unfortunately, do not have health care \nbenefits that many of us enjoy. These kids deserve the same level of \nprotection, and it would be voluntary for each State to determine \nwhether or not they want to participate in the program.\n  Then, of course, there is this argument that this is not part of the \nbudget agreement. Senator Kennedy made a point very well a few minutes \nago that the actual budget agreement before us has a specific reference \nin every type of program. So if these so-called good reasons--the \nmandate and going outside the four corners of the budget agreement--are \nnot the real reason, what is the real reason for the opposition to the \nHatch-Kennedy amendment? I think the real reason is very obvious. This \nis the last gasp of the tobacco lobby to stop a 43-cent-a-pack tax on \ncigarettes. They know what is going to happen.\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\n  When you raise the price of cigarettes, as has been demonstrated in \nCanada and so many other countries, children are less inclined to start \nsmoking. They cannot afford it. Look what this means in terms of the \nimpact upon our public health. Increasing the Federal tax by 43 cents a \npack is going to mean 16.6 million fewer smokers, 5.3 million fewer \nchildren dying prematurely and 835,000 children's lives saved.\n  It is going to mean a lot fewer sales for tobacco companies, too. \nThat is what this is about. They know that if we put this Federal tax \nin place, kids will stop smoking, they are less likely to be addicted \nto the product, and, down the line, they will not be the steady \ncustomers the tobacco industry needs to stay in business.\n  It is no accident that over 80 percent of smokers today started \nsmoking before the age of 18, over half before the age of 16. When they \nare immature and make a rash decision to start using chewing tobacco or \nspit tobacco or cigarettes, they become addicted to nicotine, an \naddiction which will claim one out of three of them in terms of lives \nlost.\n  So that is what this debate is about. It is about a tax which an \nindustry is fighting. They will not come out and say it on the floor \nbecause, quite honestly, it is not a popular thing to say. \nOverwhelmingly, the public supports an increase in the cigarette tax. I \nwill tell you that 76 percent of the women, 69 percent of Independent \nvoters, 67 percent of Republican voters, 79 percent of Democrat voters \nunderstand that this tax is a reasonable, revenue-raising measure to \npay for an important national priority.\n  I think it is time to blow through this smokescreen from the tobacco \nlobby. As they say in the ads here: Take your pick, Senator. Who are \nyou going to stand with, Joe Camel or a little boy named Joey who is \nuninsured? This is an easy choice for me. It should be for every \nMember. I think the Senate owes Senators Hatch and Kennedy, because of \ntheir leadership, a clear vote on this issue. I think with that clear \nvote, we will say definitively that the real reason for the opposition \nto this amendment is not a good reason, that we in fact are going to \ngive to each State the opportunity to participate in a program to \ninsure their children. We will pay for it with a tax on tobacco \nproducts.\n  Frankly, let me add this, too. For those who say, why do you keep \npicking on tobacco? Why do you zero in on cigarettes so much? Take a \nlook at this chart.\n  In 1993, cigarettes killed more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, car \naccidents, fires, cocaine, heroin, murders, and suicides combined. This \nis not just another issue. This is the No. 1 public health issue in \nAmerica. With this bill we not only insure the children who need the \ninsurance, we attack a problem which is claiming lives every single \nday.\n  Will the Senate have the courage to rally behind this Hatch-Kennedy \nbill? I certainly hope so. And for good reason we can stand up and say \nto the people of America, we are protecting your children, not just \nwith insurance, but also with a tobacco tax which discourages children \nfrom taking up tobacco habits.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Mexico yield me 3 \nminutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes off the bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is interesting to listen to those who are \nnow so interested in tobacco and kids. They say, ``Will you support Joe \nCamel or Joey?'' For months and months and months we have had a bill \nhere that would embrace all of FDA regulations, that would do \neverything to prevent kids from smoking. Nobody wants to get on it. \nNobody wants to help. We get rid of Joe Camel. We get rid of the \nMarlboro Man.\n  All you want is an issue. You do not want to solve the problem. So, \nyes, we can get emotional about kids. I have voted for 22 long years \nfor kids. I am a grandfather with five grandchildren, and I am not \ngoing to do anything to harm them. They do not smoke. I do. That is my \nbusiness. I am an adult. They are underage.\n  So why can't adults make a decision and let us go ahead and try to \naccomplish those things that will stop youth from smoking? Do you think \na 43-cent-a-pack increase is going to stop kids from smoking? They will \njust find cheap tobacco and bring it in here and reduce the price of \ncigarettes. You want to do away with the program? Let them grow tobacco \nfrom fence row to fence row. Tobacco gets so cheap you cannot raise it, \nand cigarettes go to a quarter a pack. They are using kids here and not \ntrying to solve a problem.\n  That is what irritates me. I am from a tobacco-growing State. It is \n$3 billion every year to my farmers. And 69 percent of those farmers \nhave other jobs. It is a husband, wife, and family income. But you do \nnot want to do that. You want to try to eliminate all that. You do not \nwant to try to stop kids from smoking. You want to stomp up here--\n``Every day 1,000 more will die.''\n  Those are your words.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  Mr. FORD. Where in the world have you been to try to stop it? \nNowhere. You just want to increase the tax on a pack of cigarettes, on \na pack of cigarettes to stop kids from smoking. That is it. That is \nwhat you are saying. But there is a bill here to get rid of it. No one \nwants to join in that effort.\n  So it is kind of tough for me, coming from a tobacco State, trying to \ndo what everybody here is talking about, except let the adults have a \nchoice. I think that is what it ought to be. But, no, we want to add \nthe tax on. We want to reduce by 35 percent--I heard the Senator from \nMassachusetts say it is only one-third of 1 percent of the budget. It \nreduces 35 percent of the tax cut. That is a pretty healthy hunk.\n\n  One State gets $29 million under this bill of the so-called Kennedy-\nHatch. And it is $1.4 billion additional taxes to that State. So they \ndo not come out ahead. How do they come out ahead? They have to match \nif they voluntarily accept it. Under this bill, they have to match. And \nthey are mandated--mandated--on what they do once they accept it.\n  I do not understand. People talk about trying to save kids. You have \nan opportunity to do it. But, no, they want the issue. They want the \nissue. Bigger Government, less tax cuts, but they do not want to get at \nthe real root of the thing and try to begin to work.\n  For months now--month after month after month--you refuse to join \nwith some of us, even from tobacco States, that want to stop kids from \nsmoking. All you want to do is make an issue out of it and say, I want \nto choose between Joe Camel and Joey. That is not true, because I have \ngiven every Senator here an opportunity to put Mr. Joe Camel where he \nbelongs, and the Marlboro Man.\n  I have made my choice. I want the adults to have a choice and kids \nnot to smoke. But all you want to do is have another issue and pound \nand pound and pound here to try to unravel a balanced budget amendment \non the backs of the children on the basis you want to make a choice \nbetween Joe Camel and Joey. I have made my choice. I am for Joey. I \nhave been for him for 22 years. But you act like I cannot join in \ntrying to help reduce the ability of children to smoke. It is there.\n  So I just want everyone to know that if you want--want--to help Joey, \nhelp me get rid of Joe Camel. This does not get rid of Joe Camel. This \ndoes not get rid of the Marlboro Man. It just increases the cost of \nsmoking to the lower income, just increases the cost to the lower \nincome and unravels a balanced budget. One-third of 1 percent--you \nreduce 35 percent of the tax cuts in this bill.\n  I hope my 5 minutes are up. I am beginning to sweat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank you, Madam President.\n  I am not for Joe Camel, but I am for this budget agreement. I think \nthat the question before the Senate today is, are we willing to run the \nrisk of unraveling an agreement that has been entered into by \nRepublican Members working in good faith with Democratic Members \nworking in good faith with this administration to try to do something \nthat we have not been able to do for many years?\n  We shut the Government down in the last Congress because we could not\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\nagree on a budget. You talk about affecting children. When you shut \ndown all the services of the Government, you affect young people, you \naffect children, you affect senior citizens, and you affect every \naspect of our society. We did that in the last Congress because we \ncould not come together and agree on a budget that was balanced in \nterms not only of spending but of how we spend the money that we are \nallocated to spend.\n  We have a historical agreement in front of us that breaks that \npattern of not being able to work together, by coming together and \nsaying, yes, there are Democratic priorities and, yes, there are \nRepublican priorities, and both sides have to give.\n  It is really interesting that the people who have said that they \ncannot support this agreement--I respect their positions; they are good \ncitizens, they are good Congress men and women, they are good Members \nof the Senate. But if you look at where the opposition is coming from, \nit is not from the center, it is not from the mainstream, it is from \nmore liberal Members and more conservative Members. Again, I respect \ntheir positions. But what we have been able to put together is a budget \nagreement that can work.\n  There will be all kinds of efforts to try to change that agreement. I \nam concerned those efforts will do damage to the overall agreement. \nGenerally, when things sound so simple, they generally do not work, and \nthis sounds so simple: Let's insure more children, and do it by raising \nthe tax on a product that many people do not like. If it sounds so \nsimple it is too good to be true, generally it is.\n  I think what we are neglecting to focus in on is what this agreement \nalready has in it. This fragile agreement already has about $16.8 \nbillion in it right now without this amendment to insure more children \nwho are currently uninsured. That is a major achievement.\n  Should we insure every child? Of course. But we cannot do it all at \nonce. This agreement insures 5 million more currently uninsured \nchildren in this country. $16.8 billion is already in this budget \npackage for that purpose. I know that you know certainly the folks who \nsupport increasing it right now--I mean, their intentions are good \nintentions. I agree with their intentions. The question is not should \nwe do it? The question is how we do it, how we do it in the context of \nthe other priorities we have as a nation and as a society.\n\n  Just this week, I think yesterday, in the other body, our friends on \nthe other side of the Capitol, some said, ``Well, we ought to spend \nmore money for highways.'' There is no question about that. We need \nmore transportation, better transportation, we need mass \ntransportation, we need highways, we need to fix the bridges that are \ncrumbling down that when they fall they kill people, highways that kill \npeople every year, 40,000 deaths on highways, much of it as a result of \ninadequate highway systems in this country.\n  Should we improve highways? Of course. Should we spend more money on \nhighways? Yes. The question is how we go about getting there. This \nbudget provides a blueprint, a map, a way to get from here to there \nthat has been agreed to by Republican leaders, by Democratic leaders, \nand by the administration.\n  I just say that we have a plan of action. I suggest that we support \nthat plan of action, and, in doing so, we are going to have to be \ncalled upon to say no to some ideas and concepts that I have no \ndisagreement with. Of course we want to do this. Of course I want to \nmove in that direction.\n  Again, the question today is not whether we should do it, but how we \ngo about doing it. I suggest that the fragile package that is before us \nis the proper approach to solving the problem of uninsured children in \nthis country. Five million more insured under this budget package is a \nmajor, major achievement. We should be proud of it.\n  Should we discontinue our efforts? Of course not. We should continue \nto work and to expand. There will be ways offered in the respective \ncommittees in order to achieve those goals. But I suggest that this is \nnot the right approach at this time.\n  I think that one of the concerns I have is that if the whole entire \nbudget agreement begins to unravel and fall apart we run the risk of \ndoing a great deal more damage, not just to one segment of our \npopulation, but to the entire country. We did that in the last \nCongress. It was not a proud moment for this body nor the other body.\n  I think we have come a long way since then. Let us not go back to \nthose days. I suggest that we should stick with the budget package. \nThat is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank Senator Breaux for his \nremarks. I think he has offered kind of a calming set of remarks for \nus. Somebody observing, whom I have great trust in, sent me a little \nnote to say thank Senator Breaux for being so calm in his response.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Pat Sellers, \na congressional fellow assigned to Senator Daschle, be granted floor \nprivileges for the duration of the debate on Senate Concurrent \nResolution 27.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining on \nthe substitute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the distinguished Senator from New Mexico yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes off the bill to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Madam President. I thank my friend from New \nMexico.\n  Madam President, I listened to the earlier remarks of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, and I believe that my colleague has either misread \nor mischaracterized many aspects of the CHILD bill.\n  Let me set the record straight.\n  First, despite what the Senator from New Hampshire and other Senators \nmay have alleged here, nothing in this bill mandates any State to \nparticipate.\n  Let's go through some of the other erroneous accusations that have \nbeen made by those who oppose the bill.\n  First, they said it created an entitlement program. This totally \nignores the fact that the bill states explicitly ``Nothing in this \ntitle shall be construed as providing an individual with an entitlement \nunder this title.''\n  Moreover, the States themselves establish eligibility criteria for \nthis voluntary block grant program. The bill explicitly provides that \nparticipating States need not provide subsidies to otherwise subsidy-\neligible children, even according to their own criteria, if funds are \nnot adequate. Funding for the program is automatically reduced if \nrevenues are insufficient to cover costs including the cost of deficit \nreduction.\n  Some have said this bill creates new mandates on States. \nParticipation in this program is purely voluntary for States. The \nprogram maximizes State flexibility and merely establishes reasonable \nrequirements for States choosing to participate to assure that Federal \nfunds meet program objectives, in the same way as such other health \nblock grant programs as the substance abuse block grant, the maternal \nand child health block grant, and the preventive services health block \ngrant operated.\n  There is nothing new about this. This is the way you write a grant \nprogram.\n  Then, opponents of the bill said it mandates the Medicaid benefits \npackage. The facts are that the States choosing to participate in the \nprogram are expected to provide the benefits for children that the \nState already provides under the State Medicaid program. We advanced \nthis proposal recognizing the importance of potential sensitivity of \nthis issue and have indicated our willingness to modify this section if \nbetter ideas emerge. And we will certainly do that.\n  Medicaid benefits include services that are particularly critical for \nchildren such as broad coverage for preventive benefits. Children \nmeeting the State eligibility requirements in families that receive \ninsurance through employer-based plans are eligible for subsidies to \ncover the employee coinsurance and copayment attributable to\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\nthe children and such employer-based plans need not comply with the \nMedicaid package of benefits. The limits on cost sharing under Medicaid \nare not mandated.\n\n  Another claim that has been made here today, on more than one \noccasion, is that the CHILD bill eliminates any future Medicaid \nwaivers.\n  The fact is that, first, if a State chooses not to participate in the \nCHILD Program, the law will have absolutely no effect on its ability to \nreceive a Medicaid waiver. In other words, the provision will only \naffect participating States.\n  If a State chooses to participate in the CHILD Program, it must not \ncut back on the existing Medicaid eligibility requirements for \nchildren. We did this to assure that States use program funds to cover \nadditional children, rather than replace existing State funding \nresponsibilities under Medicaid.\n  This has nothing to do with Medicaid managed care and expanded \nMedicaid coverage, the two major subjects of Medicaid waivers.\n  Another claim that has been made is that the bill mandates abortion \nfunding for teens because the program requires benefits the equivalent \nof those under Medicaid.\n  As a Senator who is proud of his pro-life voting record, I would \nnever do anything to advance the cause of those who wish to expand \nabortion coverage. I do not believe that my bill would cover abortions. \nAs an appropriated program, the CHILD bill would be subject to annual \nappropriations and would fall under the Hyde amendment prohibitions \nrelating to abortion services.\n  I know that some of my colleagues are disappointed in having to \nconsider this amendment today. Some believe it would break the budget \ndeal. Others are fearful of a tax increase. My purpose is simple: I am \nexercising my rights as a Senator to amend this budget and increase \nfunding for children.\n  Why can't we just get a vote on this one way or the other?\n  Let me just say that I worked with the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for many years when I was on the Budget Committee. I know \nthat he worked very hard in achieving this budget agreement, and I \ncommend him for it. In fact, I admire him for it. I was not part of \nthat negotiating team. But I am still a U.S. Senator who should be \nallowed to have a vote on his amendment.\n  As I understand the situation, we are now in the process of allowing \nSenators who were not part of the Budget Committee or part of the \nbudget negotiating team to review what the leadership of the Congress \nand the administration have agreed upon. Our job today is to review \nthis deal, use our judgment and decide whether we support this \nagreement.\n  What it comes down to is that the sponsors of this amendment believe \nit improves the budget package. We get $10 billion more in deficit \nreduction under our amendment. And we help about 5 million more kids \nwho aren't helped.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand what is the matter with that. \nWhat is so difficult about that? Why can't we help these kids?\n  I agree that the $16 billion in the bill is a good provision. I feel \ngood about that.\n  But much of that money--as much as $14 billion--will be in effect \ntaken from other existing programs for seniors and kids that are \nimportant--such as the disproportionate share hospital program.\n  So what we are doing here is taking moneys that have been used to \nhelp the poor and other people and put it another category to help the \npoor.\n  Well, I am happy to have the $16 billion in additional funding for \nkids, and the recognition that there is a problem here. But that still \nwill only solve the problems probably for the 3 million kids who \nqualify for Medicaid and who the CHIPS bill is designed to help.\n  But I keep asking myself, ``What about the 7 million kids who weren't \ncovered?'' Perhaps there will be enough funding to cover some of them. \nBut there are at least 5 million, probably 6 million--and maybe as high \nas 7 million--who are not taken care of.\n\n  That is all we are trying to do here.\n  And we are recommending a block grant to deal with the problem, a \nblock grant just like the many other health and social services block \ngrants that have worked very well through the years.\n  I understand that one of the key areas of concern relates to the \nbenefit package. Having been through the victorious battle over the \nflawed Clinton health care proposal in 1993-94, I know full well all \nthe baggage that a Washington-dictated benefit package carries.\n  When I introduced the CHILD bill, I stated my willingness to work \nwith the Governors and others to see whether an alternative to the \nMedicaid benefit plan would be acceptable to all parties. I remain \nwilling to do so. I think Senator Kennedy as well has said that he is \naware that this is a sensitive issue which needs to be addressed.\n  Perhaps an explanation of why I agreed to the Medicaid package will \nbe helpful to everyone here.\n  First, there was the practical concern of moving the legislative \nprocess forward that I felt argued against an endless series of \n``reinventing-the-wheel'' type meetings to come up with a benefits \npackage. I have been through that before. As you can appreciate, this \nwould have touched off a time-consuming siege by the various medical \nprovider specialty groups arguing that their specialty merited \ninclusion.\n  Second, on the merits, while I remain open to be persuaded otherwise, \nI am unaware of a children's health insurance model clearly superior to \nthe current Medicaid standard with its children's early and periodic \nscreening, diagnosis, and treatment--EPSDT--component. As you know, the \ngeneral standard of EPSDT is that medically necessary services be \nprovided. On its face, it is difficult to fault this principle.\n  While I understand the view that EPSDT is too generous compared with \nother health insurance plans as implemented by the States and \ninterpreted by the courts, I think it incumbent upon those who make \nthis criticism to specify precisely what services should not be \nincluded in the benefits package.\n  I am open to that. Such a dialog, if grounded in specifics, could \nonly have a salutary effect on the refinement of the CHILD bill and \nperhaps for the Medicaid Program as well.\n  I expect that the Governors will have something to say about this \ntopic after they develop their principles for child health insurance \nwhich we expect to see at the end of the month. I plan to hear what \nthey have to say and continue to work with them.\n  We have to keep in mind that our amendment addresses the problem of \nchildren from poor families where parents work but just do not earn \nenough money to provide for health insurance. We ought to be ashamed \nnot to solve this problem, when we solve so many other problems that \nare a lot less important than this one.\n  I don't see why we should have this big donnybrook or why we should \nbe fighting so vigorously over this. We ought to just do it.\n  And we can do it--fully funded--by asking the one community that many \nexperts acknowledge has caused $50 billion to $100 billion in \nunnecessary costs annually to help pay for the problem.\n  With that, I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts \noff of the resolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have said since early today that we \nare prepared to move ahead with a vote, if we are unable to get the \nassurances that we would go ahead with the vote on the underlying \namendment, the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, which we are \nsupporting.\n\n  I would just say to my friends that have spoken recently that we are \nin strong support of that amendment because that will provide the $16 \nbillion to take care of some of the neediest children. But there is \nalso the $14 million deficit that is going to be basically traded off \nagainst that. That represents the $14 billion on Medicaid. And half of \nall the Medicaid recipients are children. So it will be diminished in a \nvery substantial degree.\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\n  We heard again somewhat that this is spoiling the budget agreement. \nAs I reiterated, this is one-fifth of 1 percent of the total budget \nover the period of the next 5 years. It is difficult for me to believe \nthat one-fifth of 1 percent affecting one-fifth of 1 percent of our \neconomy is going to be a budget buster, particularly when it is paid \nfor. As we indicated, it is paid for. And, as I indicated in the former \npart of the debate, many of those who have spoken in opposition \ncomplain about it being paid for because it is going to increase the \ncigarette tax. But I want to say that those who wondered about whether \nthis was really relevant in the budget agreement, as I have mentioned, \nunder the children's health proposal they talk about that how that $16 \nbillion for the 5 years could be spent. They said it could be spent in \none of the following ways, or it mentioned other possibilities. It said \none of the ways is a program cap of mandatory grants to States. That is \nwhat our program is. It caps grants to States to finance insurance \ncoverage for uninsured children.\n  So, Madam President, we believe that we should be entitled to a vote.\n  Again, I am really amazed that it has taken this long a time to get \nto a vote with all of the kinds of complex issues that we have to \ndebate and talk about here on the budget resolution. This is a very \nsimple issue. Are we going to put the interests of children of working \nfamilies, those that are on the bottom, second, third, fourth rung of \nthe economic ladder--are we going to side with them on a selfsustaining \nfinanced program of health insurance through the States based upon what \nthe States are doing through the private sector with the discretion of \nthe State making those judgments or are we going to side with the \ntobacco interests?\n  That is the issue. That is the question. It is not very difficult. We \nhope for those reasons--plus I thought the excellent statement that was \nmade by the minority leader in terms of how he, too, believes that this \nis entirely appropriate--that we could move ahead and get some action.\n  I thank the Chair. I withhold the balance of the time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes off the resolution \nto the distinguished Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished floor leader. I very much \nappreciate the 5 minutes.\n  Madam President, I have watched this debate now for the last couple \nof hours from my office. I think it is an important debate. In a sense \nit is a bellwether debate.\n  I think the case which the proponents for the Hatch-Kennedy \nlegislation have made is very clear and a strong case. Probably no \nState would be more helped by the Hatch-Kennedy legislation than my own \nState, the State of California.\n  I had the privilege of working with the Senator from Louisiana as our \nDemocratic leader, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, \nas a Republican leader on the centrist coalition. Over a period of \nabout a year and a half in that work I have come to the conclusion that \nthe only way to balance the budget is in a bipartisan way; that if it \nis a Democratic budget, Republicans vote against it; and, if it is a \nRepublican budget, Democrats vote against it. Therefore, it has always \nseemed to me that the only way you do this is to sit down and work the \nnumbers out together and come up with a plan.\n  What do you know, Madam President, that has happened. And it has \nhappened because of the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee. It has happened because of the President. It has \nhappened because of the majority and minority leaders of both sides of \nthis great House giving their imprimatur to the process and \nparticipating. After 4 or 5 months of discussions there is an \nagreement.\n  It is not everything that everybody wants, but if you believe, as I \ndo, that the only way to balance this budget is to do this, then this \nbecomes a very significant debate. I would like to vote for Hatch-\nKennedy. It would help my State. We have--let me give you the exact \nfigure--1.7 million uninsured children in California. This is a big \ndeal. I would like to vote for it.\n  If this bill is taken down, though, it is a major commitment and \nstatement that this body cannot work together, that both sides of this \nbody cannot solve what is a critical problem facing this Nation. Every \nweek, I have a meeting of constituents, about 100, 125 people, who just \nhappen to come by the office, and I show them a small pie of outlays in \nthe year 2003, that if we do not do something, what happens. The result \nof the small pie is that you have almost 75 percent of the outlays of \nthe Federal Government consumed by net interest on the debt and \nentitlements. And by then, you could eliminate all discretionary \nspending and you cannot solve the problem.\n  Well, we have not gone the whole way, but this bill before this House \ngoes a major way in solving the problem.\n  I stood with the President in Baltimore. I said I would support this, \nas did a number of people on our side. The Senator from Louisiana was \nthere. We stood and we remarked how close the numbers in this budget \nbill are to the numbers of the centrist coalition. So we felt in some \nway that our year and a half, or whatever it has been, I say to the \nSenator from Louisiana, has been worthwhile.\n  I am very concerned. I am very concerned that this bill will be taken \ndown if this amendment is successful. I would like to vote for this \namendment. So I am looking for a way, and I hope that both the minority \nleader and the majority leader might in some way hear this, that there \nmight be a time when we could have a separate vote agreed to on Hatch-\nKennedy and move ahead with this budget reconciliation bill at this \ntime.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I congratulate the Senator for making this point, that \nevery budget we have had in the past and been signed into law is \nnecessarily a compromise. There are a lot of things that a lot of \npeople would like in this legislation that are not there. I know the \nSenator from California has talked about additional children being \ncovered. I support that effort. I mentioned the highway bill. We need \nmoney for transportation. We have talked about needing more money for \nschools, to try to fix schools that are falling down around the \ncountry. The point is, and I think the Senator from California is \nmaking it, that we have to deal with an agreement that has the chance \nof passing, if the $16 billion for more child care that is in this \nbudget now ever has a chance to become law.\n  I would say, as one member of the Senate Finance Committee, we are \ngoing to look at exactly what the essence of this amendment does in the \nSenate Finance Committee. There is no problem with us considering this \napproach and voting on it and adding it to later legislation coming \ndown the pike. So this does not mean this is over. We can continue to \nlook at this suggested means in future legislation.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana very much. It has \nbeen a very special privilege for me to work with the Senator on the \ncentrist coalition.\n  I am not in the leadership of this body, but I would be hopeful that \nthe leadership would hear this. I think this budget agreement--on our \nside, we have said every time we have had the debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment, we do not need an amendment to the Constitution. Let \nus just sit down and do it. Well, we make a mockery of our own \nstatements if we do not sit down and do it right now. And we have that \nopportunity to do it in this agreed-upon compromise.\n  So I would be hopeful that it might be possible to put together some \nguarantee both for the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who have worked so hard, both of them. I have never seen \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee as passionate as he has been in \nthe Chamber in the last 2 hours. He obviously believes. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has a long history--the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, \nother bills, his chairmanship and his ranking status on the Labor \nCommittee. I think we know his commitment and we know he will be there \nfor\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\nworking families and for children at any time. I hope there can be some \nappreciation in this body for the need to have an agreement to honor \nthe agreement that was made and to once and for all say to the American \npublic we have come together as two political parties. We have balanced \nthis budget by the end of 5 years, and we can all be proud of working \ntogether.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So I say to the leadership, please do something. Let \nus get another time to consider the Hatch-Kennedy bill so that we can \nmove on and be very proud of this body.\n  I thank the Chair for its indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I say to Senator Feinstein, just about \nthe time this Senator feels like he is not being heard, the hard work \nthat you put in on the budget was not worth it, something very pleasant \nhappens, and I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator like 10 minutes off the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I would like to make a couple comments \nabout where we are, and I also wish to thank our colleague from \nCalifornia, as well as Louisiana, in saying there is an agreement; we \nought to abide by it.\n  I was looking at the budget agreement. There is one enclosure which \nsays children's health, and it says 5-year expenditure, $16 billion. It \nis enclosed. It says we want to provide health care, $16 billion, 5 \nyears, to provide health care for 5 million children by the year 2002. \nThat is in the agreement. It is included.\n  So for somebody to say that it was included in the agreement to add \nanother $20 billion, to make this $16 billion $36 billion, is \nabsolutely not the case. It really loses credibility, and it makes a \nlot of us wonder whether we can trust the White House, whether we can \ntrust our colleagues in trying to implement a 5-year deal if we could \nnot trust them basically for a day, not to mention we are trying to \nmake obligations for the next 5 years.\n  I am a little shaken. I will absolutely say I have wanted to support \nthis deal, hope to support this deal, but when I hear some of the \npeople who have negotiated it say it is within the context of the \nbudget agreement to have $36 billion for child care, a new additional \nchild care entitlement, when the provision clearly added to the budget \nresolution was $16 billion, not $36 billion, there is a difference. \nThere is a big difference.\n  Now, I want to make a few comments concerning the underlying bill \nthat Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy are promoting and maybe respond \nto some of the statements that were made and maybe challenging some \nprovisions of this bill.\n  I do not support the bill. I think the underlying bill that \nindividuals are trying to promote--that is not what we are voting on. \nWe do not have bill language added to this budget resolution.\n  A budget resolution, for the information of colleagues and the \npublic, is not a law. It is a guideline. It says spend so much money, \ntax so much money. This amendment spends $20 billion more and it raises \ntaxes $30 billion more, both of which are inconsistent with the \nagreement, both of which, frankly, are outside the scope of the \nagreement.\n  Now, should we pass it? I would say no. Should we pass the so-called \nHatch-Kennedy bill? I would say no. I would tell my colleagues from \nUtah and Massachusetts, I think they did very well in this budget \nnegotiation. They got 16 out of 20--that is 80 percent--for a new \nprogram, a new entitlement program when we are trying to balance the \nbudget. I think they should be high-fiving each other and saying, hey, \nwe won; we got 80 percent of what we want. We stuffed those people who \nreally wanted to hold the lid on new programs. We beat them. But \ninstead of saying, hey, we got 80 percent, we are happy, they came back \nand said, we are going to double our offer. We are not satisfied with \n16. The original bill that they introduced was 20, but now they want \n36. I just find that to be grossly fiscally irresponsible.\n\n  Now I want to talk a little bit about the substance of the underlying \nbill. I heard my colleague say that, well, it is not an entitlement. \nAnd I have stated repeatedly that it is an entitlement. Let us look at \nthe bill. If you look at page 19, it says ``budgetary treatment.'' \n``Authority in advance represents an obligation of the Federal \nGovernment to provide payments to the States.''\n  An obligation. It does not sound like it is discretionary to me. An \nobligation for the Federal Government to provide payments to the \nStates.\n  Now, in the first place, maybe I should ask, the tobacco taxes \nenvisioned, are those discretionary? I do not think so. All the States \nwould have to pay into the program; all the States would be paying \nadditional taxes. That is not discretionary. I don't think anybody has \nmade that allegation.\n  Page 19 says there is an obligation of the Federal Government to pay \nto the States. I mentioned earlier that the Federal mix of this is much \nmore generous than under Medicaid, that the Federal Government would be \npaying, in many cases, 80 to 90 percent of the cost of this program, \nnot 50-50, not splitting the cost with the States. The Federal \nGovernment paying 4 to 1, 5 to 1 what the States are paying.\n  Now, sure, a State is going to opt out of that. If Uncle Sam is going \nto be paying 90 percent of the cost of the program, more generous than \nMedicaid, the States are going to opt out. First, the States have to \npay the taxes and then you create a new entitlement program. The \nFederal Government is going to pay up to 90 percent of the cost of the \nprogram, and you say, oh, the States do not have to participate. They \nhave to pay the taxes and then Uncle Sam will pay 90 percent of the \ncosts, and the States are going to say, no, I don't think so. And then \nyou look at the underlying provisions of the bill; what do the States \nhave to do. If this is such an optional program, you need to look at \npage 6, ``Requirements for Qualifying Children's Direct Benefit \nOption.''\n  Page 7. ``The States shall insure.'' Paragraph 2: States shall \ninsure, each participant shall insure, shall insure, shall provide, \nStates may not, and on and on. States may not allow imposition of cost \nsharing; States may not enter into a contract, on and on. There are \nsomething like 30 ``States shall'' or ``States may not'' in this \nprovision. This is not optional. All kinds of mandates, telling the \nStates what to do with this program, including saying, States, you do \nnot get another Medicaid waiver. Most States have Medicaid waivers \npending. This says, ``No more. Need not apply. Cannot do.''\n\n  They don't want to touch on the issue of abortion, because I heard my \ncolleague say this bill does not mandate abortion. I just disagree. I \nthink people are entitled to their own opinion, but I don't think they \nare entitled to their own facts. If my colleagues would look at page 5 \nin the bill: For purposes of this title, qualifying children policy is \na policy for an eligible child that provides coverage for medical care \nfor such child that is the equivalent of medical assistance available \nfor State child assistance available under title XIX of the Social \nSecurity Act.\n  If this is available for a State plan, if abortion coverage is \navailable in Medicaid under a State plan, then it must be provided \nunder this plan.\n  I know I heard my colleagues say, wait a minute, this is covered by \nHyde language, and we don't pay for abortion under Hyde language. That \nis not what this says. This says, if abortion is a benefit under a \nState plan--and you have a lot of States, 14 States, including some of \nthe biggest States, New York and California, for example, they have \nState-paid-for Medicaid coverage of abortion; 14 States have it. The \nFederal Government does not pay for it. But remember, Medicaid is a \nFederal-State program and some States have mandated State program \nbenefits. In this case, the State pays for abortion coverage.\n  This bill says that if the State provides this benefit, they have to \nprovide the same benefits they provide under the State Medicaid plan. \nIt does not say Federal Medicaid plan. It doesn't say only Federal \nMedicaid benefits. It says State Medicaid benefits. So you have 14 \nStates that now have State-paid-for abortion coverage that would have \nto have it under this plan. It is in\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\nthe bill. It is on page 5, line 19 through 25.\n  So I just make that point. I want to be very factual. This bill \nleaves a lot to be desired. We should not set up a new entitlement and \nhave the Federal Government paying 80 or 90 percent of the costs of \nMedicaid coverage for kids when we do not pay that much for the lowest \nincome. This is a higher level than for the lowest income level. We are \ngoing to have a greater subsidy for this group than we are for the \nlowest group? I don't think so.\n  What we have is we have the situation now where we find ourselves, \nwhere we have the $16 billion entitlement--I think it should be \ndiscretionary under the underlying bill--$16 billion to provide health \ncare for kids that, for whatever reason, do not have insurance.\n  I might review that scope because I have heard people say, wait a \nminute, we are going to provide health care for 10 million kids. Let us \nlook at that scope. Madam President, 3.3 million of those kids already \nare eligible. They have health care. They are eligible for Medicaid. \nThey qualify. About a third of them have incomes above 200 percent of \npoverty. If they are a family of 4, if they have an income of $32,000 \nor more, we should not be buying them insurance. That is not the \nFederal Government's role. So you have about 3.5 million between 100 \npercent of poverty and 200 percent of poverty. You have 30-some-odd \nStates that already have coverage for kids in excess of the Medicaid \neligibility standard, Medicaid eligibility standards going up to 133 \npercent of poverty. Thirty-some-odd States, 39 States, have Medicaid \ncoverage in excess of Federal mandates. We are going to preempt those \nin this case, and we are going to provide a very expensive Federal \nmandate on the States to provide that coverage for that 3.5 million, \nwhich, I might mention, half of those kids will have insurance within 4 \nmonths.\n  So, really, the chronically uninsured population is probably around 2 \nmillion. The underlying bill provides $16 billion. It starts out at a \ncouple of billion and grows to 2.5 billion, 3.5 billion, almost 4 \nbillion over that period of time. That is enough, maybe more than \nenough, to provide ample coverage for the chronically uninsured child.\n  What we do not need to do is say: Here is $16 billion--the original \nHatch-Kennedy bill had $20 billion--so they have $16 billion. They have \n80 percent of what they are looking for. Then they want to, maybe--I \ndon't know what the purpose is--to say now we want $20 billion on top \nof our $16 billion, we want $36 billion, even though in the bill they \noriginally introduced, they wanted $20 billion. Now the demand is for \n$36 billion--certainly a budget buster. Certainly a deal breaker.\n  If we have a deal that says new kid care entitlement is $16 billion, \nand we are going to have an amendment and just make it $36 billion; if \nwe are going to have a deal that says net tax reduction is going to be \n85, and then all of a sudden it turns into 55, then we don't have a \ndeal. That means maybe we cannot trust people. If we cannot trust \npeople, that does not speak very well for this institution.\n  I urge my colleagues, if and when we get to an up-or-down vote on the \nHatch-Kennedy bill, I urge them to vote ``no''. First, because it is a \ndeal breaker, and, second, I urge them to vote ``no'' because this is \nnot good policy and we do not need to do it twice. We do not need to \ntry to solve this problem on uninsured kids both in the Finance \nCommittee and the Labor Committee and give equal amounts of money for \nboth to solve this problem.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So, Madam President, I----\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, I didn't hear the request.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I asked the Senator from New Mexico for an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. HATCH. Oh, sure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What's the dispute? I give you 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. He said 5.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I said 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am sorry, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, to conclude, a couple of points. A deal \nis a deal. If we are going to break the deal, if we are going to be \namending what the size of the tax cut is, if people want to do that, \nthen I am going to have an amendment. This amendment cuts the size of \nthe tax cut by $30 billion. I am going to have an amendment to increase \nthe tax cut by $30 billion. If this amendment spends $20 billion more, \nI am going to have an amendment to spend less money someplace else.\n  In other words, this bill unravels the whole package and people will \nfind out this is not the easiest package to craft. There is no question \nit unravels the package, if one would just look at the budget package \nwe already have. So I urge my colleagues, if for no other reason, to \nvote ``no''.\n  Also, likewise, I urge them to vote no on the substance. Somebody \nsaid something about, wait a minute, because you are trying to defend \ntobacco--that is hogwash. If my colleagues want to have an amendment to \nraise tobacco prices, let them do it. But let's not be doubling the \nsize of the new entitlement program before the new entitlement program \neven starts. Let's not more than double it in the name of fiscal \nausterity. It is ridiculous. When the tax package comes out, if people \nwant to, on the reconciliation bill, if they want to have an increase \nin the tobacco tax, so be it. If we offset it with another tax \nreduction, maybe I will support it. But let's not do it in this \npackage. This, in my opinion, would be a killer amendment and certainly \nshould be defeated. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to clarify some issues raised \ntoday on the Senate floor by a colleague of mine. Specifically, these \nissues had to do with a paper entitled ``Unforeseen Effects of the Much \nTouted Tobacco Tax'' published on May 16, 1997 by the Senate Republican \nPolicy Committee, of which I am chairman.\n  My colleague made several statements about the analysis but failed to \naddress the substance of the paper's argument: That the $6.5 billion \nloss in state revenue over the next five years will hinder states' \nability to provide services to their citizens. This loss of revenue \nwill pressure states to accept a new program that includes many \nmandates and additional costs that will yet further strain their \nbudgets. Finally, this substantial incursion to a state revenue source \nestablishes a dangerous precedent for further such incursions by the \nfederal government.\n  It is a principle of the Republican party that the federal government \nshould not place an unfunded mandate on the states, regardless of the \nreason. If the end is so laudable, then the federal government should \nprovide the means for delivering it. In the last Congress, a proposal \nto prevent unfunded mandates was given the Republican party's highest \npriority. Introduced as the first bill in the Senate, S.1, passed (86-\n10) with all Republicans supporting it, and sent to the President who \nsigned it.\n  The program debated today violated that principle by not only leaving \nstates with an unfunded liability, but reducing their revenues for \ntheir own priorities. In short, the program being debated not only \nwould increase states' spending but decrease their revenues at the same \ntime.\n  The paper put out by the Republican Policy Committee made that clear. \nThe fact that my colleague chose to ignore it and the underlying \nproblem of the program's approach, does not change the program's impact \nand should not diminish our concern that the states be treated fairly \nand honestly by the federal government.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent all first-degree amendments in \norder to Senate Concurrent Resolution 27 must be offered by the close \nof business on Wednesday, May 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent all amendments be subject \nto\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\nsecond-degree amendment as provided under the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I now ask for the vote to occur on Domenici amendment No. \n307, and it be considered a first-degree, and, following that vote, the \nSenate proceed to vote on or in relation to amendment No. 297, with 4 \nminutes of debate to be equally divided, all without intervening \naction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nDomenici amendment, which we just agreed is a first-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, could I inquire of the manager, is that \nimmediate? Is there any intervening time, or is that immediate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is immediate. There are 4 minutes after this \nDomenici amendment before the vote on Hatch-Kennedy, or in relation to, \nwhich probably means a table, but you understand that.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced, yeas 98, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 75 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Hagel\n     Thompson\n       \n  The amendment (No. 307), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 297\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FAIRCLOTH). There are 4 minutes of debate \nequally divided on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the Hatch-Kennedy \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes equally divided on the \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will take a minute and then the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts will take the other.\n  I have to say, this was a constructive debate. I think we all learned \na lot about children's health and more importantly about the political \nprocess.\n  You know, it is tough work trying to spend money for kids.\n  I have been accused of being a Democratic pawn here today.\n  So I find it amusing that several of our ``yes'' votes have been \nquietly converted to ``noes'' this afternoon by some of the biggest and \nbest lobbyists there are. And I am not speaking of the tobacco \nindustry.\n  There is no way of knowing, but I think we would have won this one if \nwe had it at the scheduled time at 11:30. We will leave that discussion \nfor a later date.\n  How much time does this Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just end it this way.\n  I think the President and the people in the White House have caved \nhere, people who we had every reason to believe would be supportive of \nkids' health.\n  Let me say, the Washington Post framed the issue in its editorial \npage just yesterday. They said, ``This is a vote against the harmful \neffects of tobacco, in favor of children's health, in favor of State \ndecision-making, and in favor of fiscal discipline. How many times do \nthey get one like that? They ought to vote aye.''\n  I hope Senators will vote against the motion to table, and in favor \nof our amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Excuse me, I say to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we made a great deal of progress \nin this debate. We knew it would be an uphill battle because we knew \nthe power of the tobacco industry. And we intend at the next available \nopportunity to offer this proposal again. And we shall offer it again \nand again until we prevail.\n  It is more important to protect children than to protect the tobacco \nindustry. Every child deserves a healthy start. We who support this \namendment are not afraid to debate it on its merits. We are willing to \nstand to be counted for our children. We are willing to stand for our \nchildren's health. And we are willing to stand in favor of the single \nmost important means of reducing teenage smoking--the tobacco tax.\n  On both of those issues, this will be the most important vote of the \nyear. We will stand with children. And I hope our colleagues will stand \nwith us.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, most people in the United States think \nthe best thing we can do for kids and for children is to balance the \nbudget of the United States. If my motion to table does not prevail, \nthe chance of getting a balanced budget for our children and \ngrandchildren then is out the window because this amendment that they \nhave offered is a total breach of an agreement between our President, \nDemocrats, and Republicans. It is as simple as that.\n  Unless you vote to table it, you are voting to accept an amendment \nthat kills the balanced budget, under the rubric of helping children.\n  We have covered uninsured children in this bill to the tune of $16 \nbillion. And there are few among us that think that is an insufficient \namount to cover the uninsured children in the United States. I hope you \nwill support the motion so we can get on with getting this job done.\n  It has been an interesting debate. I thank Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Hatch for the way they conducted themselves, although on \noccasion we all got a little bit too heated up, according to my wife \nwho is watching this on television. She said, in particular, Senator \nKennedy and Senator Domenici, if we talk a little lower our faces would \nnot get so red.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief because I know everybody \nknows what the issue here is now. We are ready to vote. I want to urge \nmy colleagues to vote to table the Kennedy-Hatch amendment. This is a \ndeal breaker.\n  I have had occasion now to again talk to the President. And his press \nrepresentative has gone out and said, while he supports the concept of \nwhat is in this amendment--he recognizes it--it is a deal breaker, and \nthis amendment should be defeated.\n  We have money in the agreement, $16 billion, for child care that the \nFinance\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\nCommittee is going to be able to take and work with and come up with a \nproper solution. That is the way we should go. We should not add this \non this resolution because the net result would be this whole \nresolution and agreement would come unglued.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 76 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 297) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr President, I would like to rise to explain my vote \non the Hatch-Kennedy amendment. The budget resolution under \nconsideration is a fragile compromise. Support from the President, \nRepublicans and Democrats was achieved after months of negotiation.\n  One of the key provisions in this agreement of great importance to me \nis the additional $16 billion for health care coverage of children. \nThis funding will be used to cover an additional 5 million children. \nConnecticut alone is estimated to have 85,000 uninsured children 18 \nyears and younger. The new funding will go a long way to bring health \ncare to those kids.\n  The Hatch-Kennedy amendment was a good faith effort to go farther and \nI agree--we should go farther. Over 10 million American children lack \ninsurance and more each month go uncovered. For these children and \ntheir parents health is not just a blessing, it is an economic \nnecessity.\n  The amendment sponsors also said much about tobacco today with which \nI agree. According to the CDC, smoking is the leading cause of \npreventable death in the United States. Smoking is up among teenagers \nand this rise ultimately will translate into many premature deaths from \nsmoking-related diseases. I have no hesitancy to support an increase in \ntobacco taxes.\n  But the vote I cast today was not on children's health coverage. It \nwas not on a tobacco tax. The vote I cast today was on whether to make \nsubstantial changes in critical elements of an arduously negotiated \nbipartisan budget agreement. On this issue, the issue of whether to \nrisk the resolution, I disagreed with the sponsors of the amendment.\n  I felt that the amendment threatened to undo the careful balancing \nand months of negotiation represented by the budget compromise. In the \nend, the effort to increase spending, threatened the children's health \ncare coverage that we had achieved through negotiations.\n  I hope that we will return to the issue of children's health \ncoverage, but at this time the wiser course is to move forward in \nsupport of the resolution in front of the Senate. Compromise is never \nperfect, but perfection is rarely possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have had several people--I think under \nthe previous order I was to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I may, I have several other people who have asked me to \ndo the same thing so maybe I should begin by asking unanimous consent \nthat I might recognize Senator Hollings to offer an amendment, Senator \nInhofe to offer an amendment, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts to offer \nan amendment, and then I had Bob Kerrey who was going to do an \namendment very briefly that has been accepted, and then let me go ahead \nand recognize my colleagues from South Dakota and from Virginia to \noffer amendments, and I would ask unanimous consent that I might do \nthat without losing the floor and that then I might be able to offer an \namendment that has been agreed to, and then bring up the amendment that \nwill be debated.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent \nrequest just to get someone in the Chamber included in the Senator's \nlist.\n  I have a unanimous-consent request to get someone in the Chamber on \nthe list.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to include it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\n                           amendment no. 312\n\n(Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate on the need for long-term \n                          entitlement reforms)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING LONG-TERM ENTITLEMENT \n                   REFORMS.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that the resolution assumes the \n     following--\n       (1) entitlement spending has risen dramatically over the \n     last thirty-five years.\n       (2) in 1963, mandatory spending (i.e. entitlement spending \n     and interest on the debt) made up 29.6 percent of the budget, \n     this figure rose to 61.4 percent by 1993 and is expected to \n     reach 70 percent shortly after the year 2000.\n       (3) this mandatory spending is crowding out spending for \n     the traditional ``discretionary'' functions of government \n     like clean air and water, a strong national defense, parks \n     and recreation, education, our transportation system, law \n     enforcement, research and development and other \n     infrastructure spending.\n       (4) taking significant steps sooner rather than later to \n     reform entitlement spending will not only boost economic \n     growth in this country, it will also prevent the need for \n     drastic tax and spending decisions in the next century.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that levels in this budget resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should work to enact \n     structural reforms in entitlement spending in 1997 and beyond \n     which sufficiently restrain the growth of mandatory spending \n     in order to keep the budget in balance over the long term, \n     extend the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare Trust \n     Funds, avoid crowding out funding for basic government \n     functions and that every effort should be made to hold \n     mandatory spending to no more than seventy percent of the \n     budget.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the need to keep \nthe budget in balance over the long haul. The budget resolution we are \nconsidering today will bring us into balance by 2002. I support that \nbudget resolution, that budget effort. But after that work is done, \nthere is some additional work and very difficult work that we need to \ndo.\n  There are four sets of numbers that I want to bring to my colleagues' \nattention. The first set of numbers deals with where we are headed in \nterms of how much of the budget goes to discretionary spending and how \nmuch goes to mandatory spending, that is entitlements and interest on \nthe debt. In 1963 our budget was approximately 70 percent \ndiscretionary, 30 percent mandatory spending. At the end of this budget \nagreement, it will be over 70 percent mandatory and less than 30 \npercent discretionary spending. And about 10 years beyond that it will \nbe nearly 100 percent mandatory spending.\n  What my amendment says is we ought to fix it at 70 percent, we ought \nto do what we can to fix it at 70 percent, that at some point we have \nto stop the movement toward this budget becoming 100 percent mandated \nspending.\n  The second set of numbers, Mr. President, illustrates that this \nproblem is not caused by liberals; it is not caused by conservatives. \nIt is caused by a very difficult demographic fact, and that demographic \nfact is the baby boom generation: 77 million people born between the \nyears 1945 and 1965.\n  Third, today we have 133 million Americans who are working; they are \nsupporting about 39 million beneficiaries in the Social Security \nprogram. In 2030, when a baby born today will be 33 years of age, there \nwill be 163 million workers, a 20-percent increase, but there will be \nmore than a doubling of number of people who will then be \nbeneficiaries, 80 million. We need to address the difficult policy \nissues behind these numbers sooner rather than later.\n  Let me give you my last set of numbers, Mr. President, and then I \nwill be finished. I have heard lots of people come to the floor and \ntalk about the need to take care of our children and make sure that we \nare investing in our children.\n  In 1996, 29 percent of our population is under the age of 20. In \n2030, 24 percent of our population will be under the age of 20. So \nagain, in 33 years, a relatively short period of time, we are going to \ngo from 79 million people under the age of 20 to 83 million people \nunder the age of age 20. But in the over 65 category we will go from 13 \npercent to 20, from 34 million to 68 million, a doubling of that \npopulation.\n  This amendment simply says to understand the growth of mandatory \nprograms and get that growth under control, it is the sense of the \nSenate that we make every effort we can to hold mandatory spending \nbelow 70 percent of the Federal budget and that we make the structural \nreforms necessary to make that happen.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from Texas allowing me to do this, \nand I appreciate very much both the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from New Jersey agreeing to accept this as part of this budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment from the \nSenator from Nebraska which expresses the Sense of the Senate that \nadjustments in Federal benefit programs should be considered by the \nSenate. I commend my colleague from Nebraska for his work on this \nimportant effort.\n  Mr. President, this amendment recognizes the fact that we face an \nexplosion in entitlement spending over the near horizon, not just \nbecause we promised too much to too many, but principally due to simple \ndemographics. Our people are living longer and the great baby boomer \ngeneration is getting closer to retirement.\n  In l940, the average woman in America who retired at age 65 received \nsocial security benefits for l3.4 years. By l995, women--and men--were \nliving much longer. And the average woman retiring in l995 will receive \nl9.l years of Social Security--or nearly 6 more years of benefits--\nbecause the retirement age still remains at 65.\n  In l950, seven workers supported each social security beneficiary, \nMr. President. By l990 there were just five workers per beneficiary. \nAnd by the year 2030, there will be fewer than three workers per \nbeneficiary.\n  We all know the statistics. By the year 20l2, if no changes are made, \nentitlements and interest on the debt will consume every single dollar \nthe Federal Government takes in. This stifles our ability to invest in \nour Nation and protect some of our most vulnerable citizens.\n  And it doesn't have to be, Mr. President. Small steps today can save \nbillions tomorrow. Billions of dollars of debt we will not leave to our \nchildren--the baby bust generation, as Pete Peterson calls those who \nwill inherit our debt.\n  Mr. President, this amendment proposes that we work to enact \nstructural reforms which will successfully restrain the growth of \nmandatory expenditures. In my view, the Senate should consider such \nreforms as using the most accurate measure of cost-of-living available, \nextending the civil service retirement age for future Government \nworkers, extending the military retirement age for future enlistees, \ngradually tracking Medicare eligibility with Social Security \neligibility, and extending the retirement age for Social Security.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Otherwise, the day \nwill surely come when we will have to explain to our children why, when \nwe could have made a difference, we failed to enact entitlement reform.\n  These kinds of choices are never easy politically--but they just get \ntougher as the problem becomes more acute. Now is the time to act if we \nare going to act responsibly.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nWithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 312) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request, if \nI may. I ask unanimous consent that Nick Minshew, a fellow in the \noffice of Senator Wellstone, be granted floor privileges for the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 291\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress concerning domestic \n                               violence)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FAMILY VIOLENCE OPTION \n                   CLARIFYING AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Domestic violence is the leading cause of physical \n     injury to women. The Department of Justice estimates that \n     over 1,000,000 violent crimes against women are committee by \n     intimate partners annually.\n       (2) Domestic violence dramatically affects the victim's \n     ability to participate in the workforce. A University of \n     Minnesota survey reported that \\1/4\\ of battered women \n     surveyed had lost a job partly because of being abused and \n     that over \\1/2\\ of these women had been harassed by their \n     abuser at work.\n       (3) Domestic violence is often intensified as women seek to \n     gain economic independence through attending school or \n     training programs. Batterers have been reported to prevent \n     women from attending these programs or sabotage their efforts \n     at self-improvement.\n       (4) Nationwide surveys of service providers prepared by the \n     Taylor Institute of Chicago, Illinois, document, for the \n     first time, the interrelationship between domestic violence \n     and welfare by showing that from 34 percent to 65 percent of \n     AFDC recipents are current or past victims of domestic \n     violence.\n       (5) Over \\1/2\\ of the women surveyed stayed with their \n     batterers because they lacked the resources to support \n     themselves and their children. The surveys also found that \n     the availability of economic support is a critical factor in \n     poor women's ability to leave abusive situations that \n     threaten them and their children.\n       (6) The restructuring of the welfare programs may impact \n     the availability of the economic support and the safety net \n     necessary to enable poor women to flee abuse without risking \n     homelessness and starvation for their families.\n       (7) In recongition of this finding, the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate in considering the 1997 Resolution on \n     the budget of the United States unanimously adopted a sense \n     of the Congress amendment concerning domestic violence and \n     Federal assistance. Subsequently, Congress adopted the family \n     violence option amendment as part of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996.\n       (8) The family violence option gives States the flexibility \n     to grant temporary waivers from time limits and work \n     requirements for domestic violence victims who would suffer \n     extreme hardship from the application of these provisions. \n     These waivers were not intended to be included as part of the \n     permanent 20 percent hardship exemption.\n       (9) The Department of Health and Human Services has been \n     slow to issue regulations regarding this provision. As a \n     result, States are hesitant to fully implement the family \n     violence option fearing that it will interfere with the 20 \n     percent hardship exemption.\n       (10) Currently 15 States have opted to include the family \n     violence option in their welfare plans, and 13 other States \n     have included some type of domestic violence provisions in \n     their plans.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the provisions of this \n     Resolution assume that--\n       (1) States should not be subject to any numerical limits in \n     grading domestic violence good cause waivers under section \n     402(a)(7)(A)(iii)) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     602(a)(7)(A)(iii)) to individuals receiving assistance, for \n     all requirements where compliance with such requirements \n     would make it more difficult for individuals receiving \n     assistance to escape domestice violence; and\n       (2) any individual who is granted a domestic violence good \n     cause waiver by a State shall not be included in the States' \n     20 percent hardship exemption under section 408(a)(7) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 608(a)(7)).\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my amendment seeks only to clarify the \nsupport of this body for the family violence option, adopted during \nconsideration of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act. The family violence option allows States to waive \nvictims of domestic violence and abuse from punitive work and education \nrequirements, without being penalized. States would not be required to \ninclude these individuals in their 20-percent hardship exemption.\n  The family violence option amendment, which I joined with Senator \nWellstone in offering to the welfare reform legislation, was intended \nto give States the flexibility to ensure that victims of domestic \nviolence and abuse do not become victims of welfare reform. The \namendment was adopted and accepted as part of the final conference \nreport.\n  At the time, it was clear to many of us that there is a direct \nrelationship between domestic violence and poverty. Many women and \ntheir children become trapped in violent situations based on their \neconomic dependency. For many women and their children, welfare offers \nthe only way out of a violent and dangerous environment. To create \narbitrary obstacles to this assistance simply ensures that women and \nchildren will be trapped. This was obvious to many of us, but a recent \nreport from the Taylor Institute made our case more solid. This report \nreviewed previous studies on domestic violence and abuse and made some \nstartling conclusions regarding the number of women who are receiving \nwelfare and who have been abused by their partner. I can tell my \ncolleagues that this number alone could well exceed the 20-percent \nhardship exemption.\n  Giving States the flexibility that they need to address this crisis \nis absolutely necessary if the true objective is welfare reform. Any \neffort to move people from welfare to work must address the obstacles \nfacing those victims of abuse and violence.\n  Many States have attempted to include a family violence option in \ntheir welfare reform implementation plans. However, because there \nappears to be a general lack of congressional intent on this option, my \namendment is necessary to assist those States who are trying to do the \nright thing. The States need to know that they will not be penalized \nfor exempting victims of domestic abuse and violence from the mandatory \nwork and training requirements.\n  For many victims, simply finding a job can place them and their \nchildren in great danger. Giving an employer their home phone number or \naddress exposes them to their abuser. Placing their child in unsecured \nday care exposes the child to the abuser. Victims of domestic violence \nand abuse cannot simply utilize most day care options. Once they leave \ntheir abuser they subject themselves and their child to the risk of \nretaliation. How can we say to a victim of domestic violence that they \nmust find a job knowing that we are placing them and their children in \nharms way?\n  Helping and guiding abused women and children off of welfare involves \nmuch more than job training. Many of these women are already employed \nor have been employed in the past; but their abuser is the obstacle \nthat traps them into a life of poverty. States must be able to meet \nthese needs without jeopardizing the overall success of their welfare \nreform plans.\n  I ask my colleagues for not just their support, but their help as \nwell. Please vote yes on this amendment to prevent women and children \nfrom being trapped in a violent situation simply because they cannot \nmeet certain requirements that have nothing to do with improving their \nlives. I know that none of my colleagues would have supported placing \nobstacles in the way of women trying to leave a violent home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator from Washington wish her \namendment set aside?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 313\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL \n                   INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) heart disease was the leading cause of death for both \n     men and women in every year from 1970 to 1993;\n       (2) mortality rates for individuals suffering from prostate \n     cancer, skin cancer, and kidney cancer continue to rise;\n       (3) the mortality rate for African American women suffering \n     from diabetes is 134 percent higher than the mortality rate \n     of Caucasian women suffering from diabetes;\n       (4) asthma rates for children increased 58 percent from \n     1982 to 1992;\n       (5) nearly half of all American women between the ages of \n     65 and 75 reported having arthritis;\n       (6) AIDS is the leading cause of death for Americans \n     between the ages of 24 and 44;\n       (7) the Institute of Medicine has described United States \n     clinical research to be ``in a\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\n     state of crisis'' and the National Academy of Sciences \n     concluded in 1994 that ``the present cohort of clinical \n     investigators is not adequate'';\n       (8) biomedical research has been shown to be effective in \n     saving lives and reducing health care expenditures;\n       (9) research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health \n     has contributed significantly to the first overall reduction \n     in cancer death rates since recordkeeping was instituted;\n       (10) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has resulted in the identification of genetic \n     mutations for osteoporosis; Lou Gehrig's Disease, cystic \n     fibrosis, and Huntington's Disease; breast, skin and prostate \n     cancer; and a variety of other illnesses;\n       (11) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has been key to the development of Magnetic Resonance \n     Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning \n     technologies;\n       (12) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has developed effective treatments for Acute \n     Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Today, 80 percent of children \n     diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia are alive and \n     free of the disease after 5 years; and\n       (13) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health contributed to the development of a new, cost-saving \n     cure for peptic ulcers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this Resolution assumes that--\n       (1) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal \n     years; and\n       (2) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by $2,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1998 \n     over the amount appropriated in fiscal year 1997.\n\n  Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 316\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that, to the extent that \n    future revenues exceed the revenue aggregates contained in this \n resolution, those additional revenues should be reserved for deficit \n                      reduction and tax cuts only)\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF SENATE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH DIVIDEND \n                   PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       The Senate finds that with respect to the revenue levels \n     established under this resolution:\n       (A) According to the President's own economists, the tax \n     burden on Americans is the highest ever at 31.7 percent.\n       (B) According to the National Taxpayers Union, the average \n     American family now pays almost 40 percent of their income in \n     state, local, and federal taxes.\n       (C) Between 1978 and 1985, while the top marginal rate on \n     capital gains was cut almost in half--from 35 to 20 percent--\n     total annual federal receipts from the tax almost tripled \n     from $9.1 billion annually to $26.5 billion annually.\n       (D) Conversely, when Congress raised the rate in 1986, \n     revenues actually fell well below what was anticipated.\n       (E) Economists across-the-board predict that cutting the \n     capital gains rate will result in a revenue windfall for the \n     Treasury.\n       (F) While a USA Today poll from this March found 70 percent \n     of the American people believe that they need a tax cut, \n     under this resolution federal spending will grow 17 percent \n     over five years while the net tax cuts are less than 1 \n     percent of the total tax burden.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     with respect to the revenue levels established under this \n     resolution, to the extent that actual revenues exceed the \n     revenues projected under this resolution due to higher than \n     anticipated economic growth, that revenue windfall should be \n     reserved exclusively for additional tax cuts and/or deficit \n     reduction.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DISASTER ASSISTANCE FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) emergency spending adds to the deficit and total \n     spending;\n       (2) the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 exempts emergency \n     spending from the discretionary spending caps and pay-go \n     requirements;\n       (3) the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 expires in 1998 and \n     needs to be extended;\n       (4) since the enactment of the Budget Enforcement Act, \n     Congress and the President have approved an average of $5.8 \n     billion per year in emergency spending;\n       (5) a natural disaster in any particular State is \n     unpredictable, but the United States is likely to experience \n     a natural disaster almost every year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assume that--\n       (1) the Congress should consider in the extension of the \n     Budget Enforcement Act provisions that budget for emergencies \n     or that require emergency spending to be offset;\n       (2) such provisions should also provide flexibility to meet \n     emergency funding requirements associated with natural \n     disasters;\n       (3) Congress and the President should appropriate at least \n     $5 billion every year within discretionary limits to provide \n     natural disaster relief;\n       (4) Congress and the President should not designate any \n     emergency spending for natural disaster relief until amounts \n     provided in regular appropriations are exhausted.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 318\n\n (Purpose: To hold nondefense

Under the unanimous-consent request, the first amendment \nis a disaster amendment that has been accepted by Senator Domenici. I \ndo not think that will require much debate. The amendment that we will \ndebate and we will vote on is the amendment having to do with taxes. \nAnd so what I would like to do is to set aside the other two amendments \nand go ahead and begin the debate on the amendment on taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 318\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to make an opening statement now \nabout the budget before I turn to the amendment on taxes. Let me begin \nby congratulating those who have put the budget agreement together. I \nhave had an opportunity in both the House and the Senate to work on \nmany budgets. I understand the difficulty of putting a budget agreement \ntogether. And I think when so many people have done so much work, it is \nincumbent on someone who opposes that final product to say why. So what \nI would like to do is to go ahead and explain why I am not for this \nbudget, what I believe is wrong with the budget, and then consider an \namendment which corrects to a significant degree not everything that I \nfind objectionable in the budget, but certainly as a movement toward \nthe vision that I have for the future of the country and what we would \nlike that future to be.\n  Let me begin by going through a couple of charts which I think will \nsave time for the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend for one moment.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 318.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me start by going through the budget \nthat is before us and outlining the concerns I have about it. I would \nlike to discuss it in some detail. Let me say in advance the two points \nI hope to make. No. 1, that this does not balance the Federal budget, \nand neither the country nor the Congress should be deceived about that, \nnor should this change our behavior in being vigilant about spending.\n  Second, I want to make the point that this does not save Medicare, \nthat, quite the contrary, it simply engages in a bookkeeping entry on \nMedicare that makes it look better in the short run, but we are adding \nfive new or expanded Medicare benefits which clearly will add to the \nfinancial insolvency of the system.\n  Having gone through that, then I will turn to the amendment. First of \nall, let me talk about deficits. When this budget debate started, based \non a re-estimation of the economy due to stronger economic output and \nstronger performance, what was required to balance the Federal budget \nwhen this budget debate started was $339 billion of deficit reduction. \nWhen the President and congressional negotiators met for the first \ntime, that was the level of deficit reduction that was required, as \ncompared to current law, to balance the Federal budget. In other words, \nif we had simply not had a budget and left every law in place, not \nrepeal any law, not pass a new law, and kept discretionary spending at \nits current level, it would have taken $339 billion of deficit \nreduction to balance the Federal budget.\n  I would like to first go through how this budget balances the budget \nin 2002.\n  On Thursday night 3 weeks ago, when we reached an impasse in the \nbudget negotiations, the Congressional Budget Office came forward with \nthe glorious news that, due to a change in the estimation they had \nmade, the Federal Government could expect to collect $225 billion of \nadditional revenues over the next 5 years. That $225 billion of \nadditional revenues that the Congressional Budget Office decided to \nproject for the future represents 66 percent of all deficit reduction \nrequired to balance the budget that is before us; 66 percent of the \ndeficit reduction simply comes from the fact that the Congressional \nBudget Office, 3 weeks ago, decided to change the estimate about the \nfuture performance of the economy and tax collections, based on the \nvery strong quarter of economic growth we are in.\n  Mr. President, $28 billion of the deficit reduction in the budget \nbefore us comes from an assumption that the measure of inflation will \nbe lower in the future, and that $28 billion of savings that comes from \nan assumption about the Bureau of Labor Statistics changing the measure \nof inflation represents 8 percent of the deficit reduction needed in \nthe budget before us.\n  Mr. President, $77 billion of the deficit reduction in the budget \nbefore us comes from the assumption that, with a balanced budget, the \neconomy will be even stronger, and that represents 23 percent of the \ndeficit reduction in this budget.\n  So, when we total all this up, 97 cents out of every dollar of \ndeficit reduction in the budget before us comes not from changing \npolicy, not from constraining entitlements, not from cutting \ndiscretionary spending, but from assuming--from assuming--that revenue \ncollections will rise in the future, from assuming that inflation will \nbe lower in the future, from assuming that the economy will be stronger \nin the future. So, before this budget ever does anything, it assumes 97 \ncents out of every dollar of the projected deficit for the next 5 years \naway. Only 3 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction in this\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\nbudget represents a change in policy. In fact, that is a whopping total \nof $9 billion of deficit reduction in this budget that comes from \nchanging Government policy.\n  In fact, every penny of that deficit reduction comes from assuming \nthat we are going to sell to radio and television stations, and to \nnonbroadcast users, spectrum, and that spectrum is going to bring $26 \nbillion into the Treasury. In fact, the last year where all this $9 \nbillion of savings is needed, it is assumed to bring in $14.8 billion. \nLast year, we sold spectrum to fund increased spending of $2.9 billion. \nWe estimated it would bring that. When it was sold, it brought $13.6 \nmillion. In other words, for every $200 we thought we were going to get \nby selling spectrum, we got $1. But we still spent every dollar of the \n$2.9 billion we assumed.\n  So the first point I want everybody to understand--and it is \nimportant that they understand it because someone might believe that we \nhave put the deficit behind us by making hard choices here--the truth \nis, 97 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction in this budget, \nas compared to current policy and current law, comes from simply \nassuming the economy is going to be stronger in the future and that \nprices are going to be lower in the future. And, of course, no one \nknows what is going to happen in the future.\n  Next, I would like to go through and show you a startling fact, which \nis, not only does this budget not reduce the deficit, but in reality it \nraises the deficit by $71 billion over the next 4 years as compared to \nwhat would happen if there were no budget. Let me try to explain this. \nI know it is a little complicated, but, if you look at this, I think \nyou can see it.\n  Under current law, with current spending, if we simply continue to do \nexactly what we are doing now, with no budget, the deficit next year \nwould be $76 billion. But, under this budget, with policy changes, we \nare adding $14 billion, much of it in new spending on discretionary \naccounts and 13 new mandatory and entitlement spending programs. So \nactually, by passing this budget today as compared to current policy, \nwe are raising the deficit for the coming year by $14 billion, from $76 \nto $90 billion.\n\n  In 1999, if we simply continue current policy, the deficit would be \n$77 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But we are \ngoing to add $13 billion to the deficit, so it will actually be $90 \nbillion.\n  In the year 2000, we are raising the deficit from $70 to $83 billion, \nby $13 billion. In the year 2001, continuing current policy would \nproduce a deficit of $22 billion, but we are going to raise it by \nanother $31 billion. We are going to more than double it, so the \ndeficit would be $53 billion. And the first and only deficit reduction \ndue to policy change in this budget is $10 billion in the year 2002, in \na new century, under a new President. Until we reach that point, \nnothing in this budget lowers the deficit by a penny, and, in fact, \nthis budget raises the deficit by a total of $71 billion in those 4 \nyears.\n  Let me turn to some other points. Probably the most startling thing \nthat people will come to understand about this budget is that it spends \nso much money that the first thing we have to do in this budget is \nwaive the spending limit set in the 1993 budget. Let me remind my \ncolleagues and anybody at home who might be watching this debate, in \n1993 we had a Democrat Congress and we had a Democrat President. They \npassed a budget where they increased spending and increased taxes. But \nthey set a spending cap in that budget, and that cap said, by 1998, we \nwould spend no more than $546.4 billion on discretionary accounts. That \nwas in the President's budget. The Congress actually lowered that a \nlittle to $545.9 billion the next year.\n  Under this budget deal, we are going to spend $553.3 billion. So the \nfirst act of this new budget is to bust the budget law that is \ncurrently in effect, and we are going to have to waive a point of order \nat some point that I am going to raise so that we can spend $7.4 \nbillion more than we set out, in the 1993 budget, to spend in 1998. \nThis is a partisan point, but it is very relevant. This is going to be \nthe first time in history that a Republican Congress is going to vote \nto bust the budget set by a Democrat Congress so we can spend more \nmoney.\n  We have had a lot of discussions about what this budget does and does \nnot do with regard to spending. I am sure, as people who follow the \ndebate know, we have all kinds of ways of confusing this debate. We \nhave what we call a current service baseline, where you cut relative to \nwhat you would have spent. So, for example, if you are going to buy a \nnew shotgun and you come home and your spouse looks at you funny \nbecause you already own 20 shotguns, you say, ``Look, honey, I was \ngoing to spend $1,200, but I only spent $1,000, so I saved $200.'' It \nis that kind of baseline under which people talk about this budget \nsaving money.\n  But let me talk about things you know something about. Do you \nremember the Contract With America? Well, I remember it. I think the \nAmerican people remember it. The Senate and the House have forgotten \nit. But we wrote a budget called the Contract With America, and we all \nran for office on it, at least people on this side of the aisle did. We \npassed that budget in 1995, and, as compared to that budget for the \nyears 1998 through the year 2002, this budget we are voting on here \ntoday will raise spending by $212 billion on discretionary nondefense \nprograms, basically social programs, above the level contained in the \nContract With America budget that was adopted in 1996. So however you \nwant to define spending, the one thing we know is, compared to the \nbudget that we adopted 2 years ago for the same years, we are \nincreasing spending by $212 billion, basically on nondefense \ndiscretionary social programs.\n  We voted on a budget right here on the floor of the Senate a year ago \nthat set spending totals for 1997 and 1998, through the year 2002. As \ncompared to the budget we voted on just last year, the budget before us \ntoday spends a whopping $189 billion more in the same years on \ndiscretionary social programs than we spent in the budget we adopted on \nthis very floor only a year ago at this time. As compared to the \nPresident's budget that he offered last year, this budget spends an \nadditional $76 billion on social programs, and, as scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office, this budget actually spends slightly more \nthan the President asked for in this year's budget.\n\n  In reality, the 1 year that really matters is the year that this \nbudget will set out in detail, that is, the 1998 budget as compared to \nour 1996 budget. This will spend, in 1 year, $38 billion more than the \nContract With America; as compared to the budget we adopted last year, \nit will spend $23 billion more; as compared to the budget the President \nsubmitted last year, it will spend $3 billion more, simply on \ndiscretionary programs. But that is just discretionary programs.\n  This budget will create or fund 13 mandatory and entitlement programs \nthat will either be created new or will be expanded or will represent \nnew benefits. I remind my colleagues that every one of these mandatory \nprograms in these entitlement programs is a little baby elephant that \nis set to grow in the future. We just adopted, by unanimous consent, an \namendment of our dear colleague from Nebraska that said to us, listen, \nwe need to be alert about the growth of entitlements and maybe we ought \nnot to let these programs consume more than 70 percent of the budget. \nWe all supported the resolution. But you need to realize that the \nbudget before us has 13 new spending programs or additions or \nadditional funding to mandatory and entitlement programs that do not \nexist under current law.\n  Let me go over what those are: environmental reserve fund. We have \nfive new or expanded Medicare benefits. I am going to come back to \nMedicare. We increase Medicaid funding for the District of Columbia and \nPuerto Rico. We increase Medicare funding in terms of reducing \ncopayments at the very time we cannot pay for Medicare as it now \nexists. We restore welfare benefits for immigrants and refugees and \nasylees. We expand the Food Stamp Program. We expand a welfare-to-work \ngrant. We expand child health care and barely avoided raising it by \nanother $20 billion.\n\n  So, basically, there are two reasons that I am not for this budget, \nand I didn't come here today to argue against it thinking I was going \nto convince anybody. This is a wonderful political deal. It is a \nwonderful political\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\ndeal because it allows everybody to get what they want. It allows \nPresident Clinton, in his own words, to have the largest expansion in \nsocial programs since the 1960's. It allows Republicans to talk about \nhaving a tax cut. And it allows both parties to claim they are \nbalancing the Federal budget. But in reality, if it sounds too good to \nbelieve that we are having the largest increase in social spending \nsince the sixties and we are cutting taxes and balancing the budget at \nthe same time, the reason is that it is too good to be believed. In \nreality, it is not true.\n  The two points I want to make are these: First, we are not balancing \nthe budget here; we are simply assuming the budget is balanced. It may \nbe that, based on a strong economic performance in the last quarter, \nthe future picture of the economy is changed for 5 years. It may be \nthat this is going to be, by far, the longest and strongest recovery in \nAmerican history. But the probability is that that is not true, and it \nis not sound policy to set out the financial plan for the whole country \nbased on those kinds of assumptions. I do not think it would be quite \nas far-fetched as assuming you could pay your bills because you are \ngoing to win the lottery, but, basically, for anybody to believe that \nwe are balancing the budget based on policy decisions that I already \ndemonstrated are not true, it is important that the Congress, it is \nimportant that the country not let its guard down and understand that \nall we have done in this budget is assume the deficit away, and it may \nor may not be gone.\n  I raise this concern because in the supplemental appropriations that \nwe dealt with last week, we added another $6.6 billion to these \nspending totals, so that we have, in reality, already busted this \nbudget which has not yet been adopted. These spending totals that I \ntalked about of being $189 billion above last year's budget in this \nbudget, we have already added to that by passing a supplemental last \nweek, which adds another $6.6 billion to the deficit.\n  The second and final point I want to make about the budget is it is \nvery important that nobody believe that this budget solves the Medicare \nproblem. What does this budget do about Medicare? First, it says we are \ngoing to lower reimbursement for doctors and hospitals. We have done \nthat a dozen times. It has never worked, and it has never worked \nbecause, like all wage and price controls, people find ways to get \naround it. Yet, while we know it has never worked in the past, we have \nit in this bill because we have agreed to take, in essence, the \nPresident's policy in Medicare.\n  But that is not the worst part of it. The claim that this budget \nsaves Medicare for 10 years is not just based on that unachieved and \nunachievable savings by simply reducing payments to hospitals and \ndoctors; it is based on taking the fastest growing part of Medicare and \ntaking it out of the Medicare trust fund and funding it in general \nrevenue. Home health care, which is the fastest growing part of \nMedicare, is taken out of the trust fund under this budget agreement \nand is funded out of general revenue.\n  Virtually every person on my side of the aisle, when this was \ndiscussed 6 months ago, said, ``Well, that's fraudulent.'' That is \nequivalent to having a bunch of debt on your credit card and you go to \nthe bank and borrow money and pay part of it off and then you say, \n``Well, look, I'm out of debt.''\n  As I said when this was suggested by the President, ``Look, I can do \nyou better, I can make Medicare solvent for 100 years. Take hospital \ncare out of the trust fund.'' But does that change anything? Does that \nsolve anything?\n  So here we are engaging in a shell game which is totally fraudulent, \ntaking the fastest growing part of the trust fund out, not counting it, \npaying for it out of general revenues and claiming we save Medicare for \n10 years when Medicare is going to cause a $1.6 trillion drain on the \nFederal Treasury in the next 10 years.\n\n  The terrible tragedy of this is we were on the verge of getting a \nbipartisan consensus to really reform Medicare. I am afraid that by \naccepting this budget deal we are going to take the pressure off \nCongress, because if Medicare is solvent for 10 years because we have \ntaken the fastest growing part of it out and hidden it in general \nrevenues, is there a problem? Why should we all cast tough votes that \ncould cost us our jobs if we can tell people there is no problem?\n  Do not believe this balances the budget. It simply assumes the budget \nis balanced. We have assumed it was balanced on many other occasions, \nand it has not been balanced, I am afraid. Just like a family budget, \nassuming you win the lottery normally does not work. The way you \nbalance your budget sitting around your kitchen table is by saying no. \nThere is no ``no'' in this budget. There is no ``no'' here. There is no \n``no'' to anybody. There is nothing in this budget that really \nrepresents any kind of fundamental change in policy. What this budget \nis is a wonderful political document, but I am afraid that this \npolitical document is going to induce us to spend more, it is going to \ninduce us not to deal with Medicare, and America is going to be the \nloser.\n  Let me turn to my amendment, and let me say this is a controversial \namendment. Some are going to say this is a deal-breaker amendment and, \nin a sense, if you want to argue that, you can. But let me talk about \nthe amendment.\n  First of all, I have a chart up here, and I want people to understand \nwhat has happened to the Federal budget in the last 10 years. If you \nlook at 1987 and then you look at 1996 and you adjust for inflation, \nreal spending on defense has gone down by 27 percent, real spending on \nentitlements has gone up by 38 percent, and despite all of the protest \nfrom the President and from Members of Congress, nondefense \ndiscretionary spending, the fundamental general Government, social \nprograms, general Government operating expenses, are up over 10 years \nby 24 percent. So all of Government has grown dramatically in the last \n10 years except defense.\n  What has happened to family income in the last 10 years? If you take \nthe average family income of America and you adjust it for inflation \nand take out taxes and payroll taxes and look at what the average \nworking family in America had to spend in 1987 and what they had to \nspend in 1996--we do not have the figure for this year yet--basically \nwhat happened to the American family, as compared to the American \nGovernment during this same 10 years, was Government grew and grew \nrapidly, but here is what happened to the average family:\n  After taxes, after inflation, the income of the average working \nfamily in America fell, after-tax income from $28,302, 10 years later, \n10 years of working and struggling and often both the husband and the \nwife where families are blessed with two parents in the household, 10 \nyears later, that average family is making $27,737 after taxes. So in \n10 years where Government has grown, in 10 years where we have not said \nno to Government, working families have actually seen their spendable \nincome after taxes decline from $28,302 to $27,737.\n  My amendment is very simple. My amendment says, let's go back to the \nbudget that President Clinton submitted last year. I remind my \ncolleagues that in the budget he submitted last year, it provided \nfunding for not only last year but this year and every year to 2002. \nWhen we voted on our budget, the President said his budget for 1997 \nprovided the education funding, housing funding, the medical care \nfunding that America would need through the year 2002. Various Members \nof the Senate stood up and spoke on behalf of this budget.\n  Senator Lautenberg said:\n\n       It makes critical investments in education and training. It \n     provides increased funding for programs like Head Start, \n     title I, safe and drug-free schools.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       This budget funds my priorities.\n\n  One year later, for the same years, the President says, ``Well, you \nknow I said last year I had enough money for all those things, but \nactually now, I need $76 billion more for the same 5 years than I said \nI needed last year.''\n  So here is what my amendment does. My amendment goes back and takes \nthe President's last year's budget for 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 \nand says, ``OK, Mr. President, we are going to give you everything you \nsaid last year you needed to spend in these years, and then we are \ngoing to take the $76 billion of savings and we are going to give them \nback to families by cutting taxes and by guaranteeing that families \nwill\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\nget the $500 tax credit per child that we promised in our budget and \nguaranteeing that we will get full capital gains tax cut.''\n  If you vote for this amendment, what do you say? You are going to \nhear many ways of saying what you are saying is, ``You are cutting \nGovernment spending below the President's requested level, below the \nbudget; you are breaking the deal.'' In reality, what you are saying \nis, ``We are giving the President everything he said he needed last \nyear,'' but we are saying more than that. We are saying, rather than \nspending another $76 billion in Washington on behalf of all these \nfamilies, we are going to give that money back to them and let them \nspend it themselves. That is what this is about.\n  The question you have to answer on this amendment is this: Can we \nspend this money on behalf of American families better than they can \nspend it? By letting families keep $500 more per child, for every \nworking family in America, can they take that money and invest it in \neducation, housing, nutrition, and health care better than we can spend \nit on their behalf? Do we know their interests better than they do?\n  Let me say, I do not think so. I know the Government, and I know the \nfamily, and I know the difference. I believe that the biggest problem \nin America, in terms of finances, is that Government is spending too \nmuch and families are spending too little. We are literally starving \nthe only institution in America that really works, and that is the \nfamily. How can it make sense for Government to grow year after year \nafter year when the family budget has declined in real terms on an \nafter-tax basis for the last 10 years? Shouldn't we take this $76 \nbillion more than the President asked for last year and let families \nspend it instead of letting the Government spend it?\n  Now, if we adopt this amendment, we are going to change the budget, \nwe are going to have $76 billion less of Government spending, basically \non social programs. I am not saying there are not some good programs in \nthere, but I am saying this, that if you take all $76 billion of new \ndiscretionary spending and you let American families look at it and \nsay, ``Would you rather have us spend this for you or would you rather \nspend it yourself?'' the vast majority of working families would say, \n``I would rather spend it.''\n  In fact, if you just ask taxpayers, who paid for it, I would not \ndoubt that 95 percent of them would say, ``Yeah, I think probably I can \nspend it for my family a little better than you can spend it for me.'' \nSo that is what this is about.\n  This does not raise the deficit. It just simply says, instead of \ngiving the President $76 billion more to spend than he asked for last \nyear, since he said last year he could fund the Government and do \neverything he wanted to do for $76 billion less, and now this year he \nwants more. They discovered this magic money out there where the \nCongressional Budget Office decided that we were going to collect all \nthis revenue. So the President said, ``Look, I need more spending.'' \nNow, that is one argument. It is a legitimate argument. I just do not \nhappen to agree with him. I am saying, let us give it back to families. \nAfter all, that is where the money is coming from. Let families spend \nit. This is our vision. This is the Republican vision. It is America's \nvision.\n  A budget is about choosing between two competing visions. The budget \nbefore us is a clear vision: more Government. The budget before us is a \nbudget that says, more Government is in the interest of the American \npeople. The President may say the era of big Government is over, we may \nparrot those words, but this budget does not say the era of big \nGovernment is over. This budget says the era of big Government is \npermanent and it is expanding.\n  What my amendment says is, let us let families spend this new money \ninstead of giving it to the Government to spend.\n  I know this is a controversial amendment. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it. I do not suffer under any delusions, but I wanted to show \nmy colors on this amendment. I want people to know there are at least a \nfew people in the Senate who have not forgotten what we promised.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I say to the Senator, in this budget negotiation there \nseemed to be an impasse, and then all of a sudden it appeared there was \na substantial additional block of money.\n  Now, is that money the result of people working more and paying more \ntaxes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, I hope that is what it is. But all we know is that \nthe Congressional Budget Office came up with this estimate, that \nbecause of the strong economy that we have had in the last quarter, \nthat looking into the future, we were going to collect $45 billion a \nyear off as far as the eye could see. Now, to the extent they are \nright, it is coming because families are paying more taxes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. And people are working hard?\n  Mr. GRAMM. They are working harder. They are working longer.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Instead of rewarding people who work harder by letting \nthen keep more of what they are earning, the approach is to take more \nof it and spend more on Government?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Basically what happened was that they said, ``Well, now \nthat we've got all this money, let's let Government spend more of it.'' \nThe President is actually asking for--and we are giving him--$76 \nbillion more to spend for the same years that he said last year he had \nenough, but now because of this bird's nest on the ground, this new \ndiscovery of revenues, what is happening is we are getting ready to let \nthe Government spend $76 billion more, but never once apparently did \nanybody say, ``Hey, maybe with this new money we ought to let families \nspend it.'' What my amendment says is, look, give the President \neverything he asked for last year, but do not go up another $76 billion \nsimply because there is more money there. Let us give it back to \nworking families.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. To the people who have to earn it and pay the taxes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The person who earned it will end up keeping more of it \nbecause with this we will guarantee that we have enough money--unlike \nthe current bill which has a net tax cut of $50 billion--to fund a $500 \ntax credit for every child in a working family in America, which costs \n$105 billion, and capital gains tax cuts and changes in death duties. \nThe problem is, we have $188 billion of promises and a $50 billion net \ntax cut. It is like trying to pour 188 pounds of sugar into a 50-pound \nbag. What we are doing here is, we are raising the tax cut by not \nletting Government spend this money so families can spend it.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It seems to me that what you have proposed is giving \nthe President everything he asked for when he asked for it last year, \nbefore he saw this potential of a bigger pie. Certainly he knows how to \nask largely and how to ask to meet the need. He certainly has no \nreticence about asking. With the additional potential for resources, \nwhen people earn more and develop more for this country, we ought to \nlet the people have some of what they earn instead of saying, we will \ntake that and spend it on Government, even if it means we have to \nadjust our--it occurs to me they are having to adjust their ambition \nbigger and bigger. The harder and harder the American people work, the \nidea is, the more the Government can spend as a result of it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. When they are working, they are not doing it so the \nGovernment can spend it. I think they are doing it so they can spend \nit.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Of course they are.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The tragedy is, 10 years ago, after taxes and being \nadjusted for inflation, the average working family made over $28,000 a \nyear, $28,300. And 10 years later, after inflation and taxes, they are \nmaking $27,700. The average working family has less to spend today than \nthey did 10 years ago. Government spending has grown every year for 10 \nyears. And now, rather than letting working families keep more of what \nthey earn, we are letting Government grow more.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is it fair to say then, Government has taken the raise \nthat people would have anticipated in the last 10 years, and they took \nit and spent it?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes. Again, if you believe that Government can spend it \nbetter than families, if you believe--some of our colleagues do--if you \nbelieve that Government knows what is\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\nbetter for families, that Government is a good steward of their money, \nyou might want to say, ``Well, these families might waste it. If we \ngave them this $500 tax credit, a family of four getting to keep $1,000 \nmore to invest in their children and family, their future, they might \nmake bad decisions,'' and leave it here with President Clinton and the \ntrustworthy Congress, if you believe that this is a bad amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If you believe that you may want to make a downpayment \non a bridge someone wants to sell you in Brooklyn.\n  It is pretty clear to me, Government has not been the most efficient \nor effective way to deploy resources.\n  I want to thank the Senator. I thank him for yielding for this point \nof clarification.\n  I find very appealing the idea that we would let the American people, \nwhen they earn more, keep more. Families would rather spend it on \nthemselves rather than send it here in hopes that something would \nhappen with it here that might benefit their families.\n  I commend the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator.\n  Let me conclude and yield the floor, because I know others want to \nspeak.\n  This is a pretty simple amendment. It says that we are giving the \nGovernment $76 billion more than the President said that he needed last \nyear for these same years to do everything he wants to do from child \nhealth care to education.\n\n  Much of this spending increase occurred when we discovered \nmiraculously--and I hope in fact we discovered it instead of making it \nup--that the future looked brighter. What I am saying is, do not give \nthis additional $76 billion to Congress and the President. Give it back \nto families and let them invest it in their future and their children.\n  I believe this amendment represents a different vision than the \nbudget before us. I think it represents a vision that believes that the \nfuture is going to be brighter if we have more opportunity and more \nfreedom. What freedom is more basic than the right of families to spend \ntheir own money? Should Government grow every year even if working \nfamilies see their budgets declining? I do not think so. So, as a \nresult, I have offered this amendment. I want people to know that there \nis support for having Government tighten its belt a little so that \nfamilies can loosen their belt a little. That is what the amendment is \nabout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield to the Senator so long as he might speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 321\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that a nonrefundable tax \n credit for the expenses of an education at a 2-year college should be \n                                enacted)\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. First, I would like to send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for it to be considered and that it then be temporarily set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 321.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with and that the amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING TAX CREDIT FOR \n                   WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING AT VOCATIONAL \n                   SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, any legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution, contain a tax credit for \n     expenses of workforce education and training at vocational \n     schools and community colleges.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on education. I \nusually don't agree with the President on policy. However, this is one \noccasion where I do agree. The President in this year's State of the \nUnion Address, proposed that billions be spent on education in his \n``Call to Action for American Education.'' One of the principles in \nthis plan is his hope scholarship proposal. President Clinton proposes \n2 years of a $1,500-a-year for college tuition, enough to pay for the \ntypical community college.\n  I agree that we should give every adult American the opportunity to \nobtain the first 2 years of higher education. On January 21, I \nintroduced S. 50 which provides for a $1,500-a-year tax credit for \nstudents attending two-year schools. S. 50 has the cosponsorship of the \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, and Senators Connie Mack, Lary Craig, \nHarry Reid and Jim Jeffords. Just last week, at the Republican National \nCommittee annual dinner, House Speaker Newt Gingrich listed vocational \ntraining as one of the four top priorities for our budget resolution.\n  S. 50 will encourage workers in all age brackets to pursue an \neducation beyond high school without incurring the costly expenses of \nattending a 4-year college. By improving the training and skills of our \nworkers, we will create better jobs in manufacturing and technology \nthroughout the United States. There is nothing more important to \nkeeping competitive in the global marketplace.\n  As State commerce secretary for North Carolina, I attracted more than \n500,000 jobs into North Carolina by strengthening our community college \nsystems and offering custom training of workers in specific skills. In \nthe past 8 years, North Carolina has been among the top three States in \nnew-plant locations and gained a toehold in the film industry which now \ninvests $2.5 billion a year in my State.\n  As we begin to see the impact of changes made to welfare in the last \nCongress, more people will be off of welfare and looking for work. This \nbill would provide the job skill training needed for these individuals \nto find gainful employment. Senator Lott understands the importance of \nvocational training. So does Speaker Gingrich. As discussions proceed \nin the budget resolution, let us please find money, within that $35 \nbillion set out for education, to help community colleges. Community \ncolleges help people find real jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is set aside.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 318\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to now speak very briefly \non Senator Gramm's amendment.\n  I think he has just reached to the heart of Government spending, and \nhe did it very succinctly. There is $76 billion more that the President \ndiscovered he needed because by some mathematical manipulation we \ndecided we had $76 billion more to spend. We discovered $76 billion; we \nspend $76 billion. Now, if we had discovered $176 billion, guess how \nmuch the President would have needed? $176 billion.\n  I just want to say that I strongly support the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas. I intend to speak on it further later. But I at \nthis moment enthusiastically support it and will continue to speak on \nit at a later time when we have time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield the Senator from Missouri additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 322\n\n     (Purpose: To add enforcement mechanisms to reflect the stated \n commitment to reach a balanced budget in 2002, to maintain a balanced \n  budget thereafter, and to achieve these goals without raising taxes)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

The amendment is set aside.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 318\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Gramm amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Gramm, let me compliment you on the \nexpression of your philosophy this evening. I think you have heard me a \ncouple times. I think perhaps it is a question of how much can we do \nand get it done? But I have a vision of the United States that I would \nexplain to you in a way that is very new to me.\n  I did not grow up with this vision. I came to this place. I had been \na public servant, and I kind of liked the idea so I said I will run for \nthe Senate. I guess it was because in my State we had so few \nRepublicans then that they looked around and said, well, that young guy \njust lost a race--thank God, it is the only one I ever lost--he is as \ngood as any, why not ask him to run. So I ran. I came here as the first \nRepublican in 38 years.\n  I was here for about 3 years when an announcement came that the King \nof Spain--remember the young man, King Carlos of Spain, a magnificent \ntransition figure in Spanish modern times. He had been a king, well-\ntaken care of, no idea, as I thought, of freedom because he lived under \na dictator, right, for all these years. Then, all of a sudden the \ndictator goes away, and they say, ``You are in charge, King.''\n  Then they said, ``Why don't you come over and talk to the Congress.'' \nSo he came over here. I remember sitting in my office as if it were \nyesterday, and I said, ``I don't know whether I ought to go.'' As you \nalready know, I like to work. I was sitting around my desk, in my early \nyears, thinking it was far more important to call to New Mexico or \nwrite a letter to my constituents. Then something said, ``You know, New \nMexico has a lot of Spanish people in it. You know a lot of them. Maybe \nyou ought to go because he might say something about the culture and \nyou may learn something.'' Well, Senator Gramm, I went. He gave an \neloquent speech. I learned nothing about the Spanish culture. I knew \nmore about that than what he talked about up there--he may know more \nthan I--that he alluded to.\n\n  He said something very intriguing that I had trouble with and I did \nnot believe it for a while. He said all significant human achievement \noccurs when a man or a woman is free. I wrote that down and took it \nback to my office, and I said how could that be true? Michelangelo was \na great achiever, and I ticked off in my mind a number of others that I \nhad heard of in history that achieved a lot, and there was not any \nfreedom around to speak of. I was wrong. There was very little freedom, \nbut the great achievers were made free by selection. Somebody with a \nlot of money said, ``I want to make this talented person free and I \nwould like them to achieve.''\n  Frankly, I got a picture of history in my mind right then, but the \nreason the world had achieved so little until we had more and more \nfreedom of individuals was just that. There were not enough people free \nto be enterprising, to be innovative, because society did not let them \nbe free. So what I ended up concluding was a different image of the \nUnited States where I concluded that we have been superachievers \nbecause we have been compared to the rest of the world. In history, we \nmade more and more people free, we got rid of slavery, we made them \nfree. As we moved along, we did civil rights and we made more people \nfree.\n  I began to understand as I worked here that there was something else \nand that was if you worked and made a profit in your business or a good \nsalary in your work that freedom was to be measured by how much you had \nof that money and that achievement in wealth to use in whatever way you \nwanted. I came to the conclusion, once again, that our greatness in \nachievements, and our achievements are everywhere, was because we were \nleaving people with resources that they earned, to be free and take a \nchance. Some failed but many succeeded.\n  Now, my 25 years here has not diminished that idea one bit. In fact, \nI believe that I can even make a case. You know how hard I work for the \nmentally ill. One day we had an exchange on the floor and tonight I am \napologetic because I said to you, ``It is too bad you do not know \nanything about the mentally ill,'' and you said, ``Yes, I do,'' and you \ntold me about somebody in your family. So I was not being fair that \nday. I was being very arrogant.\n  But I can make an argument that if mentally ill people is how I think \nof freedom as the achievement mechanism for America collectively, if a \nmentally ill person can be cured of the devil in them, which people \nused to think is some kind of a devil that is a disease, you can cure 3 \nmillion people, America has more of a chance for even more achievement, \nbecause you never can tell which people you make free are going to be \nachievers.\n  So you see, you have a notion here in your budget, your visionary \nbudget, that you would like to leave more money in the hands of \nindividuals. If I read you right, it is essentially to be free, it \nmight even be free to make mistakes. I have talked to you about that, \nand you said sure, sometimes you just have to let people make mistakes, \nbut let them make it while they are trying to do their thing with their \nresources.\n  You probably had a much earlier vision and a more profound \nunderstanding because you are an economist and\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\nyou understand capitalism so well, but I have been pleased to learn \nfrom you. Capitalism is the essence, when coupled with freedom, is the \nessence of opportunity because the capital works to achieve and the \nindividual works to achieve, and when you marry them up you have an \neconomy that is just hell bent for success and growth, and when you \nsqueeze it, there are a lot of ways to squeeze.\n  People wonder whether regulations have anything to do with freedom. \nWe do not explain it very well. It has a lot to do with freedom because \nthe extent to which you are regulated, you have taken a bit of freedom \naway from someone or something.\n  Now we would both agree in a democratic capitalist society you cannot \nbe free to do everything and anything. We pride ourselves on having \nlaws, but what people do not understand is if you have regulations that \nare $50 billion more than they need to protect the public, you have \ntaken away $50 billion worth of freedom somewhere in this country to \ngrow and prosper and energize. So I understand that and I understand \nwhen you tax people in the wrong way and when you tax them too much the \nvery same thing happens.\n  In fact, I believe you, with your expertise as a Ph.D. in economics, \ncan probably find times in our economic history when we taxed things so \nwrongly that you could actually prove that we went in the wrong \ndirection. I am reminded of one, when in a fit of lunacy we put a big \ntax on these little boats. What happened? It was amazing, like you and \nI told them, but they said, ``No, no, we are taxing these rich people \nthat own boats.'' Well, within 18 months we had our friends down here \nfrom those States saying, ``Our workers are out of jobs because the \npeople who own the boats decided you are taxing them so much they do \nnot get the boats anymore.'' It took a long time but we finally \nrepealed that. To be honest, people have to have a degree of freedom or \nthey will not buy a boat they want. They will say if you tax me too \nmuch I will go without, and there go workers and businesspeople.\n\n  My problem is, Senator, that I do not believe with President Bill \nClinton in the White House that we can get that budget, that consent of \nyours, that we could get it adopted and implemented. I think we almost \ntried something like this, you and I together, maybe even a little \nmore, and we did not get anywhere. That does not mean you should ever \nstop trying what you are doing and expressing your vision, but frankly, \nI do not believe we can get it. I think you will know later this \nevening how many votes you will get for your proposal, and it is a \nlittle bit of an indication of what I felt when I started working this \nyear. One of my better friends said they would finally say to the \nSenators who might not have been there, they said, ``Domenici said to \nme last year unless we have some kind of assurance out of the White \nHouse I am not sure I want to do a totally Republican budget because I \nam not sure we are getting anywhere.''\n  We are having a great exercise in doing what you and I are doing on \nthe floor and maybe making some sense to a few million but we do not \nget it done, so I will not even take time to go through how much more \nwe would have to reduce various programs so that Senators might know. I \nwill just say that there would be a substantial reduction in the \ndiscretionary accounts of our country almost across the board and \nalmost every one if your amendment was adopted over what we agreed to \nwith the President.\n  I am firmly convinced, Senator Gramm, that if we produced \nappropriations bills at those levels, I do not think we can get there \nbecause I do not think we can get that kind of agreement out of either \ncase, and if we were to adopt them, I believe you would have a veto and \nwe would be back as we have been before. So I chose as one who probably \ndoes not understand as deeply as you do what economic freedom is, but I \nthink I have shown you today in the few minutes on the floor that I \nthink I am getting it. It has taken me 65 years, but I think I am \ngetting it. I think what we did is the best we can do.\n  Frankly, I am going to say what I said before on the previous \nKennedy-Hatch amendment. I believe it violates the budget agreement \nthat we entered into, except I would not expect Senator Phil Gramm to \nread the agreement and say it does not. I think you would read it as \nthe absolute man that you are and you would say, right upfront, it \ndoes. You would not try to make some argument that, well, it does not \nbecause it is this or that. It just does.\n  Frankly, when I find amendments that do that, I hope you understand I \nam obligated to resist them if I feel comfortable and confident we are \ngoing to get there under the budget that you do not like. I totally \nappreciate every reason you give. I think it is better than not having \na budget this year and I think, also, Senator, that unless we have some \ngreat experience that I do not contemplate, understanding what I can \nabout the tea leaves, that we will actually balance before 2002, \nbecause we have used such economic assumptions that are so conservative \nthat I believe we are going to be off again each year $40 billion or \n$50 billion, just as we have been the last 3 or 4 years when the \neconomy helped this curve.\n  Now, if we had a recession that lasted 3 years, all bets are off, but \nI assume even in the budget you propose we would be off the mark, \nthere, too, if we had a recession for 3 years and we take into account \nwhat you economists do when you do multiple years of economic \nassumptions. You build the potential for recession into being a more \nconservative versus a more generous set of economic assumptions. That \nis what I have learned from the CBO as to how they build a recession \ninto their numbers.\n\n  Now, if anybody wants to ask how much more various programs will \nprobably be reduced under Senator Gramm's proposal, I will look it up \nand go over and talk to you and see if I am right, but I believe you, \nagain, are willing to stand up and say it would be substantial compared \nto this budget because you find enough savings in your approach to then \nuse those savings and add on to the tax cuts that we have.\n  Fellow Senators, I hope you understand that I have not for 1 minute \nthis evening on the floor been critical of Phil Gramm and those who \nfeel like he does. It is just that most of us who will be supporting \nthis budget feel the same way, most of the Republicans who support the \nbasic budget, feel the same. They think there are two ways to get there \nand that the bipartisan approach is more apt to be successful because \nit is more apt to happen. It will not necessarily be more successful as \nan instrument in accomplishing a vision, but it probably will occur.\n  With that, I say to the Senate, my instructions from our leader are \nthat we not take any longer time than you need and perhaps my ranking \nmember, and then we would proceed to a vote as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Domenici.\n  Let me simply reiterate a couple points I made early on. First of \nall, I am not claiming for a minute that even though we are spending \n$76 billion more than the President asked for last year--I am simply \ntrying to take us back to a budget that last year he thought was \nadequate. There is no doubt about the fact that $76 billion is going to \ndo a lot of things for a lot of people.\n  I am not claiming there will not be programs that would have \nbenefited with the $76 billion that will not be losers under my \namendment. What I am saying is that I believe that working families can \nspend the $76 billion better than the Government can spend it, and that \nis really the choice that my amendment proposes.\n  Let me also say to Senator Domenici that I am a firm believer in the \nold Jefferson adage that good men with the same facts often disagree. I \nthink one of the good things about the Senate when we follow our \nrules--and sometimes we do not always do that here, we have certainly \ndone it here today, I think--is that we can talk about what we believe \nin and what we want to happen, but the fact that people disagree with \nus does not in any way diminish their belief or say that we are \nnecessarily right and they are wrong. Our system is a system of \ncompeting visions.\n  I say going back to the point about freedom. I am very concerned when \naverage working families find the Federal Government taking the amount \nof their income that is taken today in payroll taxes and income taxes. \nI am also concerned that if we do not do\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nsomething about Medicare and if we do not do something about Social \nSecurity, in 25 years the average taxpayer in America will be sending \nabout 50 cents out of every dollar they earn to Washington, DC. And I \nthink you reach a point where the tax rate is so high that it does \ninfringe on your freedom.\n\n  Are we still the same America that Senator Domenici grew up in and \nthat I grew up in if the Federal Government is taking 50 cents out of \nevery dollar earned by the average family 25 years from now? That is \nthe future that we are looking at if you do not dramatically change \nGovernment policy.\n  My objective today is simply to offer an alternative. I am not for \nthe underlying budget. It is clear that the adoption of my amendment \nwould dramatically change that budget. And I want to change it, which \nis why I have offered the amendment. I don't deceive myself into \nbelieving that this is a majority view today. But I do believe it is a \nmajority view in the country. And I believe that it will ultimately be \na majority view here in American Government.\n  It is obviously a question that we all have to ask ourselves. When \nyou have a divided Government, what are the functions of the two \nparties? Are the functions of the two parties to try to get together \nand make an agreement? Or are the functions of the two parties \nbasically delineated as presenting two competing visions for the \nfuture, and then letting America choose the clearer vision, presenting \ncompeting ideas and letting America choose the superior idea?\n  These are obviously things that people have contemplated, thought \nabout, and prayed over for many years in the U.S. Senate.\n  I choose today to offer an alternative to the budget because this \nbudget does not represent the vision that I believe in. This budget \ndoes not produce the America that I want produced. I believe that it is \nunwise in the America of 1997 to give the Government another $76 \nbillion to spend on discretionary programs when that money could go to \nhard-working American families to spend on their children and invest in \ntheir future.\n  But it is really a choice between two competing alternatives with the \noverlay that Senator Domenici talked about of where we are with the \nDemocrat President.\n  My objective in offering this amendment--and I thank the Senator for \nhis kindness--was to simply give people an opportunity to know that \nthere is an alternative, that there are people who believe that this \nbudget does not move us in the right direction, and that the right \ndirection is less Government and more freedom. I think the fundamental \nway we find less Government and more freedom is by having Government \nspend less so that people can spend more.\n  I don't think anybody is in doubt about where they stand on this \namendment.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I listened with interest to the \ndiscussion that was going on regarding the amendment that we are now \nconsidering. It is a surprise. I shouldn't say that. It is not a \nsurprise. But there is an anomalous difference between where we were \nwhen we were talking about Hatch-Kennedy and the response from those \nwho were opposed when they were talking about how inconsistent it was \nwith what we had.\n  We had an agreement. I use the term ``hammered out'' \nbecause ``hammered out'' seems like it was really tough. And it was \ntough to get this agreement. It took a lot of giving, it took a lot of \nreview, and a lot of hard thinking to get the consensus that we arrived \nat.\n\n  It was said that it is ``inconsistent.'' How can you do it after all \nthe work that was done with the President and ``we,'' and Senator \nDomenici and ``I,'' and the people from the House, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee sitting \nthere night after night for something like 6 weeks, long, long days? \nFinally we get this agreement. And there was shock almost, and people \nwere horrified by the notion that Senators Hatch and Kennedy wanted to \nprovide another $20 billion for children's health and tax tobacco and \ncigarettes to do it. The debate was I would say fairly long, fairly \narduous at times, and fairly strong in terms of the exchange.\n  But here we have now a proposal after we labored so hard to get \nnondefense discretionary up to a point that was acceptable.\n  Once again I do not want to go through the whole litany of what the \nbudget consensus constitutes--some give and take, and some got taken. \nBut we are at this point now when suddenly we are talking about \nincreasing the net tax cuts for the first 5 years from $85 billion to \n$161 billion by taking it out of nondefense discretionary. I hope that \nthis wouldn't get a lot of consideration when it comes time to vote.\n  I heard my good friend and distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee say that President Clinton isn't the kind of President under \nwhich you could do something like this, the thought or the inference \nbeing, ``Well, this is too good. This is too positive.''\n  Madam President, I am not an economist by profession, though my \ndegree from Columbia is in economics. But I learned economics the hard \nway. I started one of America's great companies, modestly I say. And I \nstarted one of America's greatest industries, the computing industry. \nMy name is in the hall of fame in Dallas, TX, for having been a member \nof information processing pioneers. So I learned it by doing it. I also \nlearned it by reading.\n  I remember the days of a very popular President, President Reagan. \nUnder his leadership, about which people were so euphoric, the tax cut \nthat was then introduced was in present terms something like $12.8 \ntrillion. That was supposed to be evidence of how good the supply side \nwould be and what eventually would trickle down into the economy which \nwould stimulate things, and everybody would be kind of happy \nthereafter.\n  But what we saw instead was the incredible growth in the debt in this \nsociety of ours with annual deficits just booming, and total debt \nskyrocketing. We are finally working our way out of it. And the \nreference is that this President wouldn't permit it. When this \nPresident took over the debt, the annual deficit was $290 billion. It \nis projected to be $67 billion, now the third projection by the \nCongressional Budget Office, that neutral body that is targeting their \nsights on what is accurate, and what is honest and what is fair. They \nhave changed their mind three times in the last 6 or 7 months.\n  People are working at more new jobs created than in almost any period \nI think--I will say almost in any period of history. Unemployment is at \na historic low. Inflation is at a very stable rate. All signs are \npretty darned good.\n  We ``hammer out'' this agreement laboring all those hours, people \ngetting angry at one another at times but finally agreeing. I shouldn't \nput the focus on ``angry.'' Once in a while tension would creep in. But \nessentially it was a debate or a negotiation conducted with the best of \nintentions. The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and I, it is \nfair to say, worked very well together, as did our colleagues from the \nHouse. We were determined to try to solve the problem and not get the \ntemperature up too high.\n  We are here now. After all of that, and after the discussion we had \nthroughout the day today about the violation of the consistency of the \nbudget agreement, and now we are looking at what I think is a gross \nviolation--if one can term it a violation--about changing not only the \nnondefense discretionary but increasing the tax cutoff over which there \nwas much labor.\n  A lot of people on this side did not want to see a major tax cut. As \na matter of fact, many of them didn't want to see any tax cut. But it \nwas understood that in the context of an agreement you sometimes do \nthings that you wouldn't otherwise do. If you are working alone you can \ndo anything you want. If you own the company you can do anything you \nwant. If you are the CEO you can do almost anything you want. But when \nyou get here we have to depend on the good will and the good judgment \nof others in order to arrive at agreement. Thus, we are faced with what \nI think is a difficult but nevertheless honorable consensus that was \narrived at.\n  The notion that we might change it at this late hour, change it by \ntaking\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\naway nondefense discretionary, which I frankly think is underfed in \nsome ways. Defense discretionary in my view is overfed in some ways. I \njust hope that our colleagues when it is time to vote--and I hope that \nwill be soon--will reflect on the inconsistency factor that was \nconsidered so delicate and so essential before to maintain consistency \nthat we will maintain consistency here, and that this amendment will be \ndefeated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, we are going to try to do a little \nbusiness even before we vote.\n  Senator Gramm has another amendment that we are going to take up \nshortly that is acceptable, and Senator Brownback has one that has been \nagreed to.\n  But I would like to announce to the Senate that what we are going to \ntry to do is to vote at 6:30, and Senator Gramm has indicated that we \nwill try to do that and work on that together. I would like then to ask \nunanimous consent that when that vote is finished Senator Strom \nThurmond be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, Senator Robert Byrd be \nallowed to speak for up to 20 minutes thereafter, and Senator Moseley-\nBraun has an amendment to send up. We are not going to take an \namendment to debate it until it is on the list. We are putting \namendments on lists and agreeing to tell people that they can take them \nup.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do not know if there is an exchange of lists or \nnot. Was something missed in the mechanics process?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was just trying to make it kind of orderly so \neverybody would know.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I agree to that. But if it were very orderly, then \nSenator Moseley-Braun would be heard right now. But I certainly want to \ndefer, if she doesn't mind.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That isn't true. But anyway I am not going to argue \nabout it.\n  Would Senator Gramm agree by unanimous consent to set his amendment \naside temporarily while Senator Brownback offers an amendment that will \nbe accepted, and then we will return to the Senator from Texas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I wanted to ask a question.\n  We are finished with the debate on the tax amendment. We had a sense \nof the Senate about how we fund disasters in the future, which I \nthought had been agreed to. What I would like to do, if we can set it \nup by unanimous consent, is deal with that one, and then debate and \nvote on the tax amendment. But I would be happy to let Senator \nBrownback go with his amendment and then come back. If we can dispose \nof the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, I would like to get it finished.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He is in order under the previous agreement. Senator \nGramm's amendment was up next. And the amendment that he is referring \nto we thought we would accept. But I understand that the minority is \nnot going to accept it.\n  So I would think the amendment would be in order and would be the \nnext item after we dispose of the amendment that is pending.\n  Did Senator Bond have something?\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I have two amendments that I would like to \nfile and have set aside. Both of them are sense-of-the-Senate \namendments. I ask unanimous consent that the pending business be set \naside so that I may introduce and set aside two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Missouri?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I will not object. But I \nwould like to get the attention of the chairman and the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to get the attention of the chairman and the \nranking member for a moment.\n  I do not want to get in the way of the Senator from Missouri to have \nhis amendments considered. I would like to get in the queue in terms of \nbeing able to make a presentation on the budget tonight. I understand \nthat the chairman and ranking member were entering into agreements with \nrespect to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to include the Senator. I told the Senator a \nwhile ago, and I would like to see if we could do one thing first and \nthen see what we can fit in. But I would like to ask unanimous consent \nthat at 6:30 we proceed to vote on or in relation to the pending Gramm \namendment and no other amendments be in order to the Gramm amendment \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair. All day now I thought there was \nagreement that I would follow Senator Gramm after his amendments, one \namendment and one sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Upon the conclusion \nof those activities, then we would take up the matter of my amendment. \nI have patiently waited all day. I obviously would have no objection to \nthe statement Senator Thurmond would like to make and Senator Byrd, but \ncertainly I would like my amendment to be the next amendment taken up \nat the conclusion of the vote on Senator Gramm.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we have a misunderstanding. We thought we were \naccommodating Democrats by not having amendments for a while because \nthey have some event. But if that is not the case, then what we are \ngoing to do is follow some kind of order here. If we can get this one \nagreed to, we will vote at 6:30. Then I would ask that the next \namendment be the second Senator Gramm amendment, and then, Senator, \nthat your amendment be in order thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest propounded by the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will get the Senator next.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can I get included in this train so when the train leaves \nthe station, I am on board?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. Might I just ask, we have already asked that the \ntrain start with Senator Thurmond, who has 10 minutes, Senator Byrd who \nhas up to 20 minutes to speak--15 to speak. Let us leave it up to 20, \nand now I would ask, how long would the Senator like to take?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Twenty.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator be allowed to speak for 20 minutes. It is \nmy understanding that if we agree to that, the sequence would be we \nfinish the Gramm amendment and vote on it at 6:30. If we can get any \nwork done in here in the meantime, we will and take your last, second \namendment, and then when the Senator has finished----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may inquire of the chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Why are we doing two Gramm amendments in a row? As \nfar as I know, there was no understanding. I would be happy to hear \nwhat the unanimous-consent agreement was, just to refresh my memory.\n  Mr. GRAMM. There was a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We can do that. I just have been telling Senator Gramm \nfor a long time--he had three. We accepted one. We thought this other \none was going to be accepted, and we were going to debate one. I think \nwe waste more time if we argue the point than go ahead.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. You told Senator Gramm what you told him, and I told \nSenator Moseley-Braun what I told her and somehow or other there is a \nmiscue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you mind waiting?\n  Mr. GRAMM. We had a unanimous-consent request whereby I had stopped, \nand we had about 20 people come over and do all kinds of things.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is true.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And I asked unanimous consent that they might be \nrecognized for that purpose. But then that I would be re-recognized to \ndeal with these two amendments. Now, I am not trying to\n\n[[Page S4844]]\n\nhog the floor. I thought that the amendment that had to do with paying \nfor disaster was going to be accepted. Senator Domenici said he was for \nit. I thought people would just take it. Now, all of a sudden, there is \nsome opposition to it. I think we can deal with it very quickly. Why \ndon't I just set a time limit on it of 10 minutes and then we can \neither voice vote it or we can have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Why don't we do this. If we vote on the present Gramm \namendment, the one that is being presented at this time, why don't we \nvote on that and give us a chance to take a look at the other one. And \nI appreciate the misunderstanding of the Senator from Texas because \nthere was some confusion. He was gracious about accepting these UC's, \nand I absolutely agree with that.\n  I thought we were in the process of alternating sides. But I would \nask the indulgence of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Would the Senator from Illinois agree to having a vote on the Gramm \namendment that is presently pending, and give us a chance to review the \nother one and consider it for 10 minutes, if that is OK. Then I would \npropound a unanimous-consent agreement to do just that, or do we just \nhave an understanding to proceed that way?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we have enough understanding to do that.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. May I ask the status of the unanimous consent request that \nbegan this whole process?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are several unanimous-consent requests \nthat are pending.\n  The Senator from Missouri made a unanimous-consent request that we \nset aside the amendment currently pending.\n  Mr. BOND. For the purpose of presenting two amendments which I would \nthen ask be set aside simply to comply with the filing requirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Missouri?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                       Amendment Nos. 324 and 325\n\n  Mr. BOND. I send two amendments to the desk, one a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution regarding protection of children's health on behalf \nof myself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Gorton, and Mr. Ashcroft, reflecting on the \ndisproportionate share of hospital payments; a second sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on behalf of myself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Graham, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Sessions, asking that \nthe Senate reestablish linkage between the revenues deposited into the \nhighway trust fund and transportation spending from the trust fund. I \nsend these to the desk and ask they be filed and I ask that they may be \nset side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will first read the amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes amendments \n     numbered 324 and 325.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 324\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the protection \n                         of children's health)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF \n                   CHILDREN'S HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today's children and the next generation of children \n     are the prime beneficiaries of a balanced Federal budget. \n     Without a balanced budget, today's children will bear the \n     increasing burden of the Federal debt. Continued deficit \n     spending would doom future generations to slower economic \n     growth, higher taxes, and lower living standards.\n       (2) The health of children is essential to the future \n     economic and social well-being of the Nation.\n       (3) The medicaid program provides health coverage for over \n     17,000,000 children, or 1 out of every 4 children.\n       (4) While children represent \\1/2\\ of all individuals \n     eligible for medicaid, children account for less than 25 \n     percent of expenditures under the medicaid program.\n       (5) Disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funding under the \n     medicaid program has allowed States to expand health care \n     coverage to thousands of uninsured pregnant women and \n     children. DSH funding under the medicaid program is essential \n     for current and future coverage of these uninsured \n     populations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the health \n     care needs of low-income pregnant women and children should \n     be a top priority. Careful study must be made of the impact \n     of medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) reform \n     proposals on children's health and on vital sources of care, \n     including children's hospitals. Any restrictions of DSH \n     funding under the medicaid program should not devastate \n     current State medicaid coverage of children and pregnant \n     women, or hinder health care coverage expansion opportunities \n     for these uninsured populations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 325\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning the Highway \n                              Trust Fund)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING HIGHWAY TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) there is no direct linkage between the fuel taxes \n     deposited in the Highway Trust Fund and the transportation \n     spending from the Highway Trust Fund;\n       (2) the Federal budget process has severed this linkage by \n     dividing revenues and spending into separate budget \n     categories with--\n       (a) fuel taxes deposited in the Highway Trust Fund as \n     revenues; and\n       (B) most spending from the Highway Trust Fund in the \n     discretionary category;\n       (3) each budget category referred to in paragraph (2) has \n     its own rules and procedures; and\n       (4) under budget rules in effect prior to the date of \n     adoption of this resolution, an increase in fuel taxes \n     permits increased spending to be included in the budget, but \n     not for increased Highway Trust Fund spending.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) in this session of Congress, Congress should, within a \n     unified budget, change the Federal budget process to \n     establish a linkage between the fuel taxes deposited in the \n     Highway Trust Fund, including any fuel tax increases that may \n     be enacted into law after the date of adoption of this \n     resolution, and the spending from the Highway Trust Fund; and\n       (2) changes to the budgetary treatment of the Highway Trust \n     Fund should not result in total program levels for highways \n     or mass transit that is inconsistent with those assumed under \n     the resolution.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask they be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I really do not like the Senate to be \nin the state of confusion that it is in. This kind of makes me feel as \nif I am not doing my job here. So could we start over and see if I \ncould straighten matters out so that at least I do not feel embarrassed \nabout having everybody talking at the same time.\n  I would like for the rest of the evening if somebody here in the \nmanagement side of this could invent some streamlined method of letting \npeople introduce these amendments that are nothing more than conforming \nUC requests that said you have to file them tonight. Maybe you have a \ncode word for it and we just say this is X amendment and we will get it \ndone so people do not have to read them. And if you get a unanimous-\nconsent that kind of does that for us, we would both appreciate that, I \nassume.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Having said that, I want to ask that by unanimous \nconsent, any unanimous consent that I heretofore received in the last \n20 minutes be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on \nSenator Gramm's amendment and the one that has been debated, either on \nit or related to it, at 6:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Reserving the right for the moment, I intend to \npropose to table the Gramm amendment and do not want to be excluded \nfrom that or precluded by it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You are not.\n  Now, Madam President, let me ask further that immediately after that, \nSenator Brownback be recognized to offer an amendment which is going to \nbe accepted and has been agreed on both sides.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And I have unanimous consent that Senator Kohl be \npermitted to introduce an amendment for 2 minutes.\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is one of these code amendments.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It has the code. The code is zip.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. That will be the next item of business. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest of the Senator from New Mexico that the Senator from Kansas be \nrecognized following the vote on the Gramm amendment?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Reserving the right----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is next. I am going to come right to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. Now, I say to the Senator from Texas, would \nyou mind taking your second amendment and setting it aside and let \nSenator Moseley-Braun go and then you follow her?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That would be fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. So thereafter, Senator Moseley-Braun would be \nrecognized for her amendment, and then Senator Gramm for his second \namendment that everybody knows about. We might be able to work it out. \nAnd then when they are completed, that we then stack the votes until 9 \no'clock and that subsequent to the debate on those amendments, they \nwould be set aside and the following three Senators would be permitted \nto speak on the floor of the Senate: Senator Byrd, 15 minutes----\n\n  Mr. BYRD. When would that be?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That would probably be--I am just going to guess with \nthe Senator, but I am thinking it would be like quarter of 8.\n  Mr. BYRD. Quarter of 8. I could have had my speech made.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know. We are just not as good at putting things \ntogether.\n  Would the Senator want to do that sooner?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will only need 12 or 15 minutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Reserving the right to object, I was not clear \nwhether or not the Senator's request included a request to stack votes \non these amendments. I would have to object to that, to stack the \nvotes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I would object to the stacked votes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will tell you the leader wanted the votes stacked, so \nif you do not want to accept it, I will stand here on the floor and \nspeak until 9 o'clock. I do not know why we could not agree to stack \nthe votes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I also have to reserve the right to consult with our \nleader to see if we could not make that a little bit later than 9 so \nthat we can----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I would ask that all my unanimous-\nconsent requests be vitiated and we proceed to a vote, except the one \nthat we will vote at 6:30 on Senator Gramm's amendment. And then we \nwill stand around here and try to work it out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 326, 327, and 328\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to send to the desk three \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes amendments \n     numbered 326, 327, and 328.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 326\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding truth in \n                    budgeting and spectrum auctions)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that:\n       (1) The electromagnetic spectrum is the property of the \n     American people and is managed on their behalf by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (2) The spectrum is a highly valuable and limited natural \n     resource;\n       (3) The auctioning of spectrum has raised billions of \n     dollars for the Treasury;\n       (4) The estimates made regarding the value of spectrum in \n     the past have proven unreliable, having previously \n     understated and now overstating its worth;\n       (5) Because estimates of spectrum value depend on a number \n     of technological, economic, market forces, and other \n     variables that cannot be predicted or completely controlled, \n     it is not possible to reliably estimate the value of a given \n     segment of spectrum; therefore,\n       (b) It is the Sense of the Senate that as auctions occur as \n     assumed by this Resolution, the Congress shall take such \n     steps as necessary to reconcile the difference between actual \n     revenues raised and estimates made and shall reduce spending \n     accordingly if such auctions raise less revenue than \n     projected.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 327\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to certain \n                    highway demonstration projects)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . HIGHWAY DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) 10 demonstration projects totaling $362 million were \n     listed for special line-item funding in the Surface \n     Transportation Assistance Act of 1982;\n       (2) 152 demonstration projects totaling $1.4 billion were \n     named in the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation \n     Assistance Act of 1987;\n       (3) 64 percent of the funding for the 152 projects had not \n     been obligated after 5 years and State transportation \n     officials determined the projects added little, if any, to \n     meeting their transportation infrastructure priorities;\n       (4) 538 location specific projects totaling $6.23 billion \n     were included in the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991;\n       (5) more than $3.3 billion of the funds authorized for the \n     538 location specific-projects remained unobligated as of \n     January 31, 1997;\n       (6) the General Accounting Office determined that 31 States \n     plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico would have \n     received more funding if the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act location-specific project funds \n     were redistributed as Federal-aid highway program \n     apportionments;\n       (7) this type of project funding diverts Highway Trust Fund \n     money away from State transportation priorities established \n     under the formula allocation process and under the Intermodal \n     Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act of 1991;\n       (8) on June 20, 1995, by a vote of 75 yeas to 21 nays, the \n     Senate voted to prohibit the use of Federal Highway Trust \n     Fund money for future demonstration projects;\n       (9) the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency \n     Act of 1991 expires at the end of the Fiscal Year 1997; and\n       (10) hundreds of funding requests for specific \n     transportation projects in Congressional Districts have been \n     submitted in the House of Representatives.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) notwithstanding different views on existing Highway \n     Trust Fund distribution formulas, funding for demonstration \n     projects or other similarly titled projects diverts Highway \n     Trust Fund money away from State priorities and deprives \n     States of the ability to adequately address their \n     transportation needs;\n       (2) States are best able to determine the priorities for \n     allocating Federal-Aid-To-Highway monies within their \n     jurisdiction;\n       (3) Congress should not divert limited Highway Trust Fund \n     resources away from State transportation priorities by \n     authorizing new highway projects; and\n       (4) Congress should not authorize any new demonstration \n     projects or other similarly-titled projects.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 328\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the revenues \n  generated under legislation described in section 207 should not be \n  appropriated before the enactment of legislation to reauthorize and \n            reform the National Rail Passenger Corporation)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AMTRAK.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any revenues generated \n     to finance an intercity passenger rail fund under section 207 \n     of this resolution shall not be appropriated to the National \n     Rail Passenger Corporation until such time as legislation has \n     been signed into law to reauthorize and reform the National \n     Rail Passenger Corporation.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, if all this has come apart, I would like \nto remind the Chair that when I recognized Senator Dorgan and the cast \nof thousands here, in that unanimous-consent request was the request \nthat we first consider, we deal with two amendments of mine, one that I \nthought was\n\n[[Page S4846]]\n\nagreed to and one that I knew was going to be somewhat controversial. I \njust simply want to reaffirm, if all these other deals are off, that \nthat unanimous-consent request is still there, and that after this vote \nthe pending business would be my amendment.\n  Now, I am perfectly willing to let the Senator from Illinois go \nbefore me, but if that is not going to work out, I want to go ahead and \nclaim the right that I had under that unanimous-consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I concur with that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wonder if we can just take a minute to confer with \nour leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 318\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the Gramm \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to table the Gramm amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second on the motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And the yeas and nays are ordered. Is that correct?\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The time has come for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to table the amendment. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 68, nays 31, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 77 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--68\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--31\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kempthorne\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 318) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nWest Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I propound a parliamentary inquiry. There \nwas some confusion about the unanimous-consent requests that were made \njust before the vote and as to whether or not some of those requests \nhave been agreed to and remain to be fulfilled. That is my question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is uncertain whether a unanimous-\nconsent agreement was reached with respect to the amendment of the \nSenator from Kansas to go next.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, our other distinguished President pro \ntempore is on the floor, and we have a very good attendance. I ask \nunanimous consent, notwithstanding any previous order, I might proceed \nat this time for not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if our colleague \nfrom West Virginia would simply permit me to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. And have it laid aside?\n  Mr. KYL. Exactly.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, I \nwould like to make the same request of the Senator from West Virginia \nin order to offer three amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. I retain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nalso just would like to offer an amendment and lay it aside.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all Senators \npresently on the floor who have amendments which they wish to offer so \nthey will be properly offered, I ask that they be allowed to offer \nthem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from West Virginia that all Senators who wish to offer \namendments be permitted to do so under the terms of the unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I say \nto Senators, before we leave here tonight--and we are going to come \nback and vote at 9--we hope by that time to have a unanimous-consent \narrangement so Senators will not have to each stand up and send those \namendments to the desk. Madam President, I say to Senator Bumpers, we \nhope to have that done, but if he wants to do it now while he is on the \nfloor, fine.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It will take 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection to the Senator's request.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is very generous of the Senator from West Virginia \nto propound this request. I certainly do not object, but understand, I \nsay to my colleagues, that the amendments then should go up \nimmediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment Nos. 333, 334, and 335\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I have one amendment I send to the \ndesk on behalf of Senator Dodd, and I have two amendments which I send \nto the desk on behalf of Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes \n     amendments numbered 333, 334 for Ms. Moseley-Braun and \n     amendment numbered 335 for Mr. Dodd.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 333\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the use of \n                            budget savings)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE USE OF BUDGET \n                   SAVINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest level \n     since our Nation began to keep poverty statistics, due in \n     large part to the social security system and the medicare \n     program.\n       (2) Twenty-two percent of every dollar spent by the Federal \n     Government goes to the social security system.\n       (3) Eleven percent of every dollar spent by the Federal \n     Government goes to the medicare program.\n       (4) Currently, spending on the elderly accounts for \\1/3\\ \n     of the Federal budget and more than \\1/2\\ of all domestic \n     spending other than interest on the national debt.\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\n       (5) Future generations of Americans must be guaranteed the \n     same value from the social security system as past covered \n     recipients.\n       (6) According to the 1997 report of the Management Trustee \n     for the social security trust funds, the accumulated balance \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is \n     estimated to fall to zero by 2029, and the estimated payroll \n     tax at that time will be sufficient to cover only 75 percent \n     of the benefits owed to retirees at that time.\n       (7) The accumulated balance in the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund is estimated to fall to zero by 2001.\n       (8) While the Federal budget deficit has shrunk for the \n     fourth straight year to $67,000,000,000 in 1997, measures \n     need to be taken to ensure that that trend continues.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that budget \n     savings in the mandatory spending area should be used--\n       (1) to protect and enhance the retirement security of the \n     American people by ensuring the long-term future of the \n     social security system;\n       (2) to protect and enhance the health care security of \n     senior citizens by ensuring the long-term future of the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.); and\n       (3) to restore and maintain Federal budget discipline to \n     ensure that the level of private investment necessary for \n     long-term economic growth and prosperity is available.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 334\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the value of the \n              social security system for future retirees)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE VALUE OF THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM FOR FUTURE RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The social security system has allowed a generation of \n     Americans to retire with dignity. Today, 13 percent of the \n     population is 65 or older and by 2030, 20 percent of the \n     population will be 65 or older. More than \\1/2\\ of the \n     elderly do not receive private pensions and more than \\1/3\\ \n     have no income from assets.\n       (2) For 60 percent of all senior citizens, social security \n     benefits provide almost 80 percent of their retirement \n     income. For 80 percent of all senior citizens, social \n     security benefits provide over 50 percent of their retirement \n     income.\n       (3) Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest level \n     since the United States began to keep poverty statistics, due \n     in large part to the social security system.\n       (4) Seventy-eight percent of Americans pay more in payroll \n     taxes than they do in income taxes.\n       (5) According to the 1997 report of the Managing Trustee \n     for the social security trust funds, the accumulated balance \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is \n     estimated to fall to zero by 2029, and the estimated payroll \n     tax at that time will be sufficient to cover only 75 percent \n     of the benefits owed to retirees at that time.\n       (6) The average American retiring in the year 2015 will pay \n     $250,000 in payroll taxes over the course of his or her \n     working career.\n       (7) Future generations of Americans must be guaranteed the \n     same value from the social security system as past covered \n     recipients.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that no change \n     in the social security system should be made that would \n     reduce the value of the social security system for future \n     generations of retirees.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 335\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that the concurrent resolution conforms with the \n  Bipartisan Budget Agreement to restrict revenue reductions over the \n                            ten-year period)\n\n       On page 41, line 9 strike the period and add, ``and \n     $250,000,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 1998 through \n     2007''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

The Senator from West Virginia still has \ncontrol.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am sorry, I thought the Senator had yielded for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think I made a request. If I may be heard, my request was \nthat all Senators who are presently on the floor may be permitted to \nsend their amendments to the desk, and it will be considered as having \nbeen offered in order to comply with the requests that amendments be \nfiled before the day ends. So I think that takes care of it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask the Senator from West Virginia, is his \nrequest that all Senators can simply send their amendments to the desk \nwithout the formality of offering them from the floor?\n  Mr. BYRD. That was my request. I do not know if it was objected to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was the agreement that was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we have an agreement on the amendment \nthat is pending subject to just a modification. Can we do the \nmodification in 30 seconds and clear the floor and then let both our \ndistinguished senior Senators speak, and then we can start the whole \nprocess again? We can do that in 30 seconds. Can we do that?\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection to that. I just hope we will not lose \nan audience before I get to speak.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We can add Senator Thurmond to the unanimous-consent \nrequest and let both speak. I think it will be good.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Brownback has an amendment just like yours. Can \nwe take it right after yours? It will take 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Good, and I promise I will stay around and listen.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 317, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I send a modification to the desk to \namendment No. 317. All the amendment says is it is a sense of the \nSenate that we need to move toward setting aside in advance funding for \nemergencies; that we ought to ask Presidents to submit budgets that \nprepare for emergencies. We know we are going to have them every year. \nWe have averaged $7 billion in emergency spending for the last 6 years. \nWe ought to go ahead and make it part of the process that these are \nfunded in advance.\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Obviously, we will have to \nvote on this to get to appropriations, but it has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  I thank our colleagues for accepting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to amendment No. 317 being \nmodified?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DISASTER ASSISTANCE FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) emergency spending adds to the deficit and total \n     spending;\n       (2) the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 exempts emergency \n     spending from the discretionary spending caps and pay-go \n     requirements;\n       (3) the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 expires in 1989 and \n     needs to be extended;\n       (4) since the enactment of the Budget Enforcement Act, \n     Congress and the President have approved an average of $5.8 \n     billion per year in emergency spending;\n       (5) a natural disaster in any particular State is \n     unpredictable, but the United States is likely to experience \n     a natural disaster almost every year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assume that the Congress should \n     consider in the extension on the Budget Enforcement Act and \n     in appropriations acts--\n       (1) provisions that budget for emergencies or that require \n     emergency spending to be offset;\n       (2) provisions that provide flexibility to meet emergency \n     funding requirements associated with natural disaster;\n       (3) Congress and the President should consider \n     appropriating at least $5 billion every year within \n     discretionary limits to provide natural disaster relief;\n       (4) Congress and the President should not designate any \n     emergency spending for natural disaster relief until such \n     amounts provided in regular appropriations are exhausted.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 317, \nas modified?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 317), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 329\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on enforcement of the \n                      bipartisan budget agreement)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback], for himself and \n     Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 329.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with. We can do this very quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ENFORCEMENT OF BIPARTISAN \n                   BUDGET AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the bipartisan budget agreement is contingent upon--\n       (A) favorable economic conditions for the next 5 years;\n       (B) accurate estimates of the fiscal impacts of assumptions \n     in this resolution; and\n       (C) enactment of legislation to reduce the deficit.\n       (2) if either of the conditions in paragraph (1) are not \n     met, our ability to achieve a balanced budget by 2002 will be \n     jeopardized.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals and limits in this resolution \n     assume that--\n       (1) reconciliation legislation should include legislation \n     to enforce the targets set forth in the budget process \n     description included in the agreement and to ensure the \n     balanced budget goal is met; and\n       (2) such legislation shall--\n       (A) establish procedures to ensure those targets are met \n     every year;\n       (B) require that the President's annual budget and annual \n     Congressional concurrent resolutions on the budget comply \n     with those targets every year;\n       (C) consider provisions which provide that if the deficit \n     is below or the surplus is above the deficits projected in \n     the agreement in any year, such savings are locked in for \n     deficit and debt reduction; and\n       (D) consider provisions which include a provision to budget \n     for and control emergency spending in order to prevent the \n     use of emergencies to evade the budget targets.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Senator Kohl and I have a great deal of concern about \ngetting some enforcement mechanisms put into place during \nreconciliation so that the budget agreement that is reached, if it is \npassed, is then enforced. It is in the reconciliation of the bill. That \nis what this amendment will do. We need to work together during \nreconciliation to enforce the targets that have been established.\n  Madam President, this is a hopeful budget deal. We must hope that we \ndo not have one slight downturn in the economy. We must hope that we \ndid not make one flawed assumption, and we must hope that we don't have \na national emergency.\n  Madam President, no matter how well intended things may be, things \ndon't always work out the way you hope they will. If any one of these \nhopeful events don't occur, then the budget won't be balanced. This is \nwhy Senator Kohl and I are offering this sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  This budget deal was only made possible because the night before the \nagreement, CBO found an extra $225 billion in revenues.\n  This deal assumes we will be able to achieve 72 percent of the \nsavings in the last 2 years with more than half occurring in the last \nyear.\n  And because these numbers are so fragile and ever-changing at best, \nand because this budget promises to balance without much real fiscal \nrestraint, it is imperative that we enact strong budget enforcement \nreforms to assure that the goals of this deal are reached.\n  We cannot simply rely on hope to end this cycle of debt we are \npassing onto our children. To make balancing the budget a reality, this \ndeal needs teeth. We need to strengthen this deal by at least enforcing \nit.\n  This amendment does not change any numbers, it does not alter any of \nthe goals of this agreement. It only says that Congress should put in \nplace tools to make sure this deal is honored.\n  What is in the amendment?\n  This amendment requires that this summer the Budget Committee report \na bill that requires: That every year the President sends Congress a \nbudget that complies with this agreement; that the budget adopted by \nCongress complies with this agreement; provides that if the deficit is \nbelow the targets set out in this budget that the money is not spent, \nrather it shall be saved; that emergency spending is paid for; and this \namendment establishes legal procedures that will assure that the goals \nof this agreement are reached.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise as a supporter of this budget and \nas a sponsor of the Brownback-Kohl enforcement amendment. This budget \ndeserves the support of the Senate for several reasons.\n  It is bipartisan and centrist. It finds priorities--like education \nand child health--that transcend party lines. It includes reasonable \ntax relief targeted toward families and economic growth. It balances \nthe budget by the year 2002, and it produces surpluses to reduce the \ndebt in the years after that.\n  In this budget, the Congress and the administration have found a way \nto do what the American people have long asked us to do: Balance the \nbudget in a balanced manner--grow the economy without growing income \ninequality--strengthen the country by strengthening the working family.\n  The amendment I offer today with my colleague from Kansas makes this \nvery good budget stronger. It calls on the Budget Committee to report \nenforcement legislation that will lock in the deficit targets in the \nagreement.\n  While there are some enforcement provisions in the budget deal, we \ndon't think they go far enough. Our amendment calls for enforceable \ncaps on all parts of the budget--entitlements, discretionary spending, \nand tax expenditures. It requires windfall savings from a good economy \nor lower than anticipated spending to be locked in to deficit \nreduction. And it calls for reform in emergency spending procedures so \nthat Congress cannot use true disasters as\n\n[[Page S4849]]\n\nan excuse for off-budget spending on favorite programs.\n  Again, said. Out amendment does not change the budget deal. It \nstrengthens it. It guarantees that the balanced budget becomes a \nreality. And it will assure the American people that we are serious \nabout reaching balance by 2002.\n  It is important that we make that assurance. This budget is open to \ncriticism because it increases the deficit from $67 to $90 billion in \n1998 and 1999 before bringing it to 0 in 2002. All of the deficit \nreduction in this agreement occurs after the turn of the century.\n  We simply are not credible if we promise to cut the deficit a couple \nof years down the road. People have heard that from Congress for too \nlong. I urge my colleagues to support this budget--and more. I urge \nthem to commit to it by agreeing on strong enforcement procedures that \nwill guarantee the deficit reduction we promise. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Brownback-Kohl amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask that this amendment be agreed to by unanimous \nconsent. It has been worked out between the parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Is there further debate on the \namendment? If there is no objection, amendment No. 329 is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 329) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia, under the \nprevious order, is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator permit me one thing?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I gather Senator Byrd is going to speak and then \nSenator Thurmond is going to speak. Then I would ask unanimous consent \ntwo amendments be in order and in the following sequence: Senator \nMoseley-Braun--and how much time did the Senator want to take on her \namendment?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. It was my understanding that I would be allowed an \nhour tonight and then some time in the morning to vote on it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you want the whole hour? That is all I am asking.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes, the whole hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. Following the debate on her amendment, at the \nconclusion of the time, that Senator Mack be recognized to offer a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  Mr. MACK. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator want to reserve the statutory time of \nan hour?\n  Mr. MACK. I have already received requests of at least an hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. That means then we will not resume voting \nuntil 9 o'clock or slightly thereafter when these matters have been \nfinished. We will vote in sequence, first on Senator Moseley-Braun's \nand then on Senator Mack's. And we are reserving the right to table \neither one if we so desire or if anyone desires to do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that request be granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object. If I could get the----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I get instructions, I am so sorry, that I am unaware \nof. I understand Senator Moseley-Braun will agree to have her vote be \nthe first vote up in the morning.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Tonight at 9 o'clock, we will vote on Senator Mack's \nproposal that I just described.\n  Would the Senator like to vote this evening?\n  Mr. MACK. I would like to have a recorded vote. This evening would be \nfine. My only question would be, are we really fixing a time at 9 \no'clock or----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will not have a vote until 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. MACK. Sometime after that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At 9 or thereafter.\n  Mr. MACK. Very good.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Any other Senators that might have an amendment they \nwould like to call up tonight?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, Mr. Chairman, if I might.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You are in.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to get included in this train. I would like \nto get in on this one.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you want to follow whatever we have just indicated \nthe sequence is? You will follow thereafter with a speech here on the \nfloor. I ask unanimous consent for that to be added to the request.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will not agree to any other amendments at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4782-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4849-S4851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATOR THURMOND'S MILESTONE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are told in the Holy Bible that Abraham \nlived to be 175 years old, that Isaac lived to be 180 years old, that \nJacob lived to be 147 years old, and that Joseph lived to be 110 years \nold. I have consulted Scripture to see if there is any account of \nrecord with respect to the Senator who is the senior Senator of this \nbody, Strom Thurmond, and I found that nothing had yet been entered in \nregard to that venerable gentleman.\n  I rise today to call attention to a very historic and significant \nhappening that will occur on this coming Sunday, May 25, when the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina becomes the longest serving Senator \nin the history of the U.S. Senate. On that day, Senator Strom Thurmond, \nwhose service began on December 24, 1954, will surpass the record set \nby Arizona Senator Carl Hayden, who served 41 years and 10 months \nbetween 1927 and 1969. In the entire 208-year history of the U.S. \nSenate, only three Senators--Strom Thurmond, Carl Hayden, and John \nStennis of Mississippi--served for more than 40 years.\n\n  I should point out that Senator Hayden had previously spent 15 years \nin the House of Representatives, giving him a combined 56 years in \nCongress, a record matched by no one else in either the House or \nSenate.\n  I stand fourth on the overall list of seniority in the Senate, with \n38 years and 5 months of service to date, which does not count the 6 \nyears that I spent in the House of Representatives, beginning in \nJanuary 1953, before I came to the Senate. The rest of the ``top 10'' \ninclude Senators Richard Russell, Russell Long, Francis Warren, James \nEastland, Warren Magnuson, and Claiborne Pell. It is worthy of note \nthat while there have been Senators throughout our history--1,843 \nSenators in our 208-year history--at the time that Senator Hayden \nretired in 1969, 9 of these top 10 Senators were then serving together \nin the Senate. That is quite a remarkable thing, I think. Longevity of \nSenate service is clearly a modern phenomenon.\n  Longevity records have been set on three prior occasions in the 20th \ncentury. In 1905, William Allison, an Iowa Republican, broke the \nprevious record of 31 years and 11 months. In 1928, Senator Francis \nWarren, a Wyoming Republican, broke Allison's record. And in 1964, \nSenator Carl Hayden, an Arizona Democrat, surpassed Warren's tenure. \nNow Senator Thurmond, a Republican from the State of South Carolina, \nwill move past Senator Hayden's record.\n  It is fitting for those of us in the Senate to pay tribute to Senator \nThurmond on this occasion. I note that on February 19, 1962, the Senate \nhonored Senator Hayden when he became the first person to have served \nin Congress 50 years. On June 19, 1970, we commemorated Senator Mike \nMansfield's becoming the longest-serving Democratic leader of the \nSenate. And on December 22, 1995, we similarly celebrated Senator Bob \nDole's breaking of his party's leadership record.\n  It is also fitting for us to recall the great sweep of American \nhistory represented in Senator Thurmond's long political career. And it \nis indeed a remarkable political career. If one will just take the time \nto look at the Congressional Directory, he will view with astonishment \nand amazement the political record of Senator Thurmond. He won his \nfirst election as Edgefield County superintendent of schools in 1928, \nwhen he was 26 years old. Calvin Coolidge then occupied the White \nHouse, soon to be replaced by Herbert Hoover, who was elected President \nthat year. The boom times of the Roaring\n\n[[Page S4850]]\n\nTwenties were soon shattered by the stock market crash of 1929 and the \nGreat Depression that followed. Strom Thurmond and I remember all about \nthose things.\n  During the 1930's, while President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted a \nNew Deal in America, Strom Thurmond served as city and county attorney, \na member of the South Carolina State Senate, and as a circuit judge. \nThe United States entered the Second World War in 1941. And in 1942, \nStrom Thurmond volunteered for service in the Army. He was a \nparatrooper at Normandy Beach on June 6, 1944, 53 years ago. Returning \nto civilian life, he was elected Governor of South Carolina in 1946, 51 \nyears ago. Two years later, he ran as the ``Dixiecrat'' candidate for \nPresident of the United States against the incumbent Democrat, Harry S. \nTruman.\n  In 1954, during the Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Strom \nThurmond became the first and only person ever to be elected to the \nU.S. Senate on a write-in vote. Senator Thurmond took the oath of \noffice on December 24, 1954. Fulfilling a pledge he had made during \nthat first campaign, Senator Thurmond resigned from the Senate on April \n4, 1956, and ran again for his Senate seat in the Democratic primary. \nHe won both the primary and the general election and returned to the \nSenate on November 7, 1956.\n  During his first 10 years in the Senate, Strom Thurmond was a \nDemocrat. When I came to the Senate, Strom Thurmond was a Democrat. I \ncan remember looking up into the galleries and seeing the late wife of \nStrom Thurmond, who died early in her life, relatively speaking. I can \nremember coming into the Chamber that day, and seeing Strom on the back \nrow of the Senate, I walked up to him and expressed my sorrow for the \nloss of his wife.\n  In 1964, during the Presidential campaign between President Lyndon \nJohnson and Senator Barry Goldwater, Senator Thurmond changed his party \naffiliation to become a Republican. And he has been credited with \ndevising the ``Southern Strategy'' that has so significantly reshaped \nthe Republican Party.\n  In 1981, when Ronald Reagan became President and the Republican Party \ngained the majority in the Senate, after 26 years in the minority, \nSenator Thurmond became President pro tempore and chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Today with Bill Clinton in the White House, \nSenator Thurmond is again President pro tempore of the Senate and \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n\n  Now, to that record of endurance we should add one further statistic. \nIn 1957 Senator Thurmond set the record, as yet unbroken, and I imagine \nit will be unbroken for a long, long time, for the longest individual \nspeech delivered in the Senate, for 24 hours and 18 minutes. From \nAugust 28 to August 29, 1957, Senator Thurmond held the floor, speaking \nagainst the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n  As a Senator who once held the floor for 14 hours and 13 minutes, and \nI could have held it much longer and probably would have held it much \nlonger had I not honored a promise that I made to the then majority \nleader Mike Mansfield that I would give up the floor in order to let a \nvote occur, I held the floor for 14 hours and 13 minutes, I can attest \nthat Senator Thurmond's exceptional stamina is quite remarkable.\n  Finally, I shall not allow the occasion to pass without calling \nattention to a historical milestone that would be set on December 31, \n1997, by Senator Thurmond's colleague from South Carolina Ernest \nHollings--we all know him as Fritz--who has now served 30 years and 5 \nmonths as the junior Senator from his State. Senator Hollings will then \nsurpass the ``juniority'' record of 31 years and 52 days previously \nheld by Senator John Stennis of Mississippi.\n  So we have two Senators from South Carolina who are breaking records \nthese days. I salute both of these distinguished Senators.\n  I am proud to serve on the Armed Services Committee now chaired by \nSenator Strom Thurmond, and I am proud to sit on the Appropriations \nCommittee, where for these many years I have worked at the side of \nSenator Hollings, a very fine Senator, a very active and able Senator. \nBoth of these Senators have contributed greatly to the service of their \ncountry. I salute these distinguished Senators and their historical \nrecords, and I commend Strom Thurmond for his lifetime of public \nservice to his State, to his Nation and to the U.S. Senate.\n\n       The hours are like a string of pearls,\n       The days like diamonds rare,\n       The moments are the threads of gold,\n       That bind them for our wear,\n       So may the years that come to you, Strom,\n       Such health and good contain,\n       That every moment, hour, and day,\n       Be like a golden chain.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the junior Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand the agreement has been \nmade.\n  Mr. BYRD. I may have some time and I will be happy to yield to \nSenator Hollings.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nand the distinguished Chair.\n  No one is more qualified to comment upon the distinguished service of \nthe senior Senator from South Carolina than Robert Byrd of West \nVirginia, and certainly no one is more eloquent in this U.S. Senate. I \nthank him for his very generous remarks relative to me, but more \nparticularly the comments relative to Senator Thurmond, because he \ndeserves them.\n  I like work, Mr. President, and no one works harder than Strom \nThurmond. I love the State of South Carolina, and no one loves South \nCarolina more than Strom Thurmond. I love this country, and of course \nno one loves the United States more than Strom Thurmond.\n  My senior Senator is the epitome of Robert E. Lee's comment that the \nmost sublime word in the English language is duty. He is the living \nexample of that particular admonition. The fact is that he has done his \nduty here for the people of the State of South Carolina and this \ncountry over the many, many years because he is the greatest \ndisciplinarian I have ever met. He is totally disciplined with respect, \nnot just to his physical being, which has gotten him 94 years, but more \nparticularly his disciplined service and loyalty to his State and \ncountry.\n  I, too, want to recognize on Sunday he will have most deservedly \nbroken the all-time record for length of service in this U.S. Senate. \nIt will not be the first time the Senator has broken an all time Senate \nrecord. We all know he holds the record for the longest extended \ndebate.\n  I know others are waiting. They have very generously yielded to me, \nso I will not attempt to break that record now. However, I will have \nmore to say about Senator Thurmond's record at another time, but I know \neveryone is interested in hearing from our senior Senator. Let me just \nsay, the greatest privilege for this junior Senator has been to serve \nunder this senior Senator for 30-some years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator from \nSouth Carolina has the time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent I might speak for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I wish to add my voice and tribute to our distinguished \nPresident pro tempore on his magnificent record, and comment about how \nmuch I have admired his work as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  When I joined this body after the 1980 elections, a few days after \nthe November election, in 1980, I was sitting in my bed in Philadelphia \nand the telephone rang and that distinguished southern voice said, \n``This is Strom Thurmond calling. I wonder if you would be willing to \nvote for me for President pro tempore.'' I was really amazed since \nSenator Thurmond did not need my vote that he would call and ask for my \nvote.\n\n  While I served with him on the Judiciary Committee I found him to be \nvery wise. One of the comments he made soon after I joined the \ncommittee, when a judge was up for confirmation, was asking the nominee \nif the nominee promised to be courteous. I thought that was sort of a \nmeaningless question until Senator Thurmond followed up after the \nnominee said yes by saying, ``The more power a person has the more \ncourteous that person should be.'' There is a lot of wisdom in that\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\nshort statement. Whenever Senator Thurmond is not present and I am, I \nmake that statement to the nominees.\n  During the first 4 years of my term here, Senator Howard Baker, the \nmajority leader, used to keep us all night, and on many occasions I \nwould join Strom for a bowl of soup for about an hour, and I have \nlistened to some of the most fabulous stories because Senator Thurmond \nis a legend, having been here when John Kennedy was a Senator, when \nLyndon Johnson was a Senator.\n  I shall tell one very brief story. After Senator Thurmond ran on the \nDixiecrat ticket in 1948, in the Presidential motorcade Inauguration \nDay in 1949 Senator Thurmond rode in an open car with his wife. Senator \nThurmond tells a story of when he passed by the reviewing stand of \nPresident Truman and Vice President Barkley. Senator Thurmond stood up, \ntook his hat off and bowed. And Vice President Barkley started to wave \nto Governor Thurmond. And I shall not tell the whole story, but \nPresident Truman pulled down Vice President Barkley's hand with a \ncomment, which is a remarkable story.\n  I asked Strom on a number of occasions if I could be his biographer. \nHe should have a biographer, if he does not take the time to write his \nown. It is too bad, on this very busy occasion of the Senate, that \nthere are not more Senators on the floor to hear the remarkable \naccolades presented by our noted historian and conscience of the \nSenate, Senator Byrd, and by the senior junior Senator, Senator \nHollings, but I wanted to have my words of admiration for Senator \nThurmond on this very auspicious occasion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Chair recognizes \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I planned to speak about 10 minutes on defense, but I \ndid not know that these wonderful accolades were going to come up at \nthis time. I wish to express my deep appreciation to the able Senator \nfrom West Virginia, who has been minority leader, majority leader, and \nevery position the Senate had to offer. I guess no man in the history \nof this country has filled more important positions in the U.S. Senate \nthan Senator Byrd of West Virginia, and he has filled them well. \nEverything he has undertaken he has done it well. I deeply appreciate \nthe kind words he said today.\n  I wish to thank my able colleague, Senator Hollings. Senator Hollings \nand I are different parties but we have been here a long time together. \nWe respect each other. And I have had the opportunity to work with him \non many matters of various kinds and it has been a pleasure to do that. \nWe have never had an argument that I recall. Although we do not always \nvote alike, we hold each other in respect. I wish to thank him for his \nkind remarks. He is, as someone stated, the longest-serving junior \nSenator in the United States, but after this term, if he is still here, \nmaybe he will get to be the senior Senator. Again, I wish to express to \nSenator Hollings my appreciation for serving with him and working with \nhim. It has been a pleasure to do so, Fritz, and I thank you.\n  I wish to thank the able Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. \nWhen I came to the Senate I watched different Senators come and go. \nWhen Senator Specter came I soon recognized that here was a man of \nunusual talent, a man of great ability. It has been a pleasure to serve \nwith him. He is a great historian. He can tell many stories about \ndifferent people on different things and amuse you to the fullest. I \ndeeply appreciate his fine friendship and thank him for his kind \nremarks here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4849-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4851-S4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this budget resolution represents a \nhistoric endeavor by the Congress and the administration. For the first \ntime in 28 years, we have agreed on a path designed to balance the \nFederal budget by the year 2002. The fiscal irresponsibility that drove \nus into a national debt of more than $5 trillion, with interest \npayments amounting to 15 percent of our annual Federal budgets, was \nsurely leading this Nation toward a day of economic reckoning with \nsevere consequences. I am delighted that, aided by a strong economy, we \nseem to be moving toward setting our fiscal house in order.\n  Despite my enthusiastic support for a balanced budget, I must admit \nthat I remain deeply concerned about the state of our national security \nand plans for funding our defense establishment in this post-cold-war \nera.\n  When the Clinton administration took office in 1993, it immediately \nbegan to cut defense spending. Within the context of the bottom-up \nreview, they cut over $120 billion out of the Future Years Defense \nProgram. Despite this severe underfunding of our military forces, the \nadministration has shown no reluctance to use them. Multilateral \npeacekeeping operations under the United Nations became the vogue \nduring the early years of the Clinton administration. The debacle in \nSomalia, where 18 American soldiers were killed in the streets of \nMogadishu, awakened the Congress and the American people to the folly \nof these policies. Despite this concern, less than 2 years later the \nadministration was dispatching U.S. troops to Haiti and then to \npeackeeping operations in Bosnia. During the first 4 years of the \nClinton administration, our military forces were dispatched on more \nseparate deployments than at any other time in our history.\n  The tempo of these operations has put tremendous strain on our \ndiminished force structure and its aging equipment. Indeed, the \nadministration's willingness to employ our military forces in \npeacekeeping operations without regard to the adverse effects of these \ndeployments has further eroded our capability to execute two \noverlapping major regional contingencies. Defense funds authorized and \nappropriated for military readiness, personnel and equipment have been \ndepleted to pay for unbudgeted operations that have exceeded $15 \nbillion since 1993. Furthermore, the unprecedented personnel tempo from \nthese operations has dramatically stressed our military personnel and \ntheir families.\n  The administration's proposed budgets have neglected the necessary \nimmediate investment in force modernization, and justified this by \nprojecting significant funding increases in the outyears, when the \nadministration promised to recapitalize our military forces. \nUnfortunately, these outyears never arrived. For 6 straight years, the \nadministration's projected increases in the modernization accounts did \nnot materialize. In fact, the amounts requested for the modernization \naccounts were lower each year than projected by the administration in \nthe previous year.\n  In 1995, Republicans gain control of Congress and passed a budget \nresolution intended to alleviate at least some of the problems caused \nby the underfunding of the defense budget. Over $18 billion was added \nto the defense budgets of the 104th Congress. Most of these funds were \ndirected into the modernization accounts which had been so drastically \nneglected by this administration.\n  During negotiations on the recent budget agreement, I urged our \nbudget negotiators to adopt the congressional budget resolution for \nfiscal years 1998 and 1999, since those numbers were above the \nadministration's request. I also urged that we accept the \nadministration's request for fiscal years 2000 through 2002, when the \nprojected spending targets were above those in our congressional budget \nresolution. By agreeing to the administration's spending targets in the \noutyears, we would, in effect, capture in the budget agreement the \nelusive recapitalization funds for modernization.\n  This agreement before us today protects our military forces from \nunrealistic and unwise cuts in defense. I was encouraged that Secretary \nCohen has also supported these more favorable, higher numbers for \ndefense. We do not yet know the full impact on the defense budget \nresulting from the budget agreement and possible effects of outlay \nshortfalls in the later years of this agreement. However, I remain \nconcerned that even the highest levels for defense considered in this \nagreement may not provide sufficient funds to adequately sustain over \ntime the personnel, quality of life, readiness and modernization \nprograms critical to our military services, especially if we continue \nto use funds from the defense\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\nbudget to pay for unbudgeted peacekeeping operations.\n  Preliminary results emerging from the QDR indicate that the two MRC \nstrategy will remain essentially unchanged. However, even using the \nadministration's higher funding in the outyears, the QDR recommends \nforce structure reductions of up to 130,000 personnel to free minimal \nfunds for essential modernization. Key force modernization programs \nwill also have to be significantly reduced in order to remain within \nthe funding limits of the administration's defense program.\n  I hope that, within the balanced budget agreement, we will provide \nadequately for our men and women in uniform to defend our Nation. It is \nclear that we must continue now and in the future to examine the \nadequacy of the funds we allocate to our national security. At the same \ntime, we must continue to search for ways to improve the efficiency and \neffectiveness of our defense establishment--especially in the support \nstructure--so that we can achieve savings to devote to the cutting edge \nof our military combat forces.\n  It is gratifying to me, after almost 42 years in the Senate, to see \nthe possibility of a balanced budget with adequate funds also provided \nfor our national security. It has been worth fighting for. I pledge to \ncontinue the fight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.

Mr. President, this amendment provides $5 billion \nto create a partnership among all levels of government to help States \nand school districts meet their school repair, renovation, \nmodernization and construction priorities.\n  The point of this amendment is to focus Federal resources, and to \nfocus our support as a national community for rebuilding the schools in \nour country. Every day, 14 million American children attend schools \nthat are in such dilapidated condition, and present such an unsuitable \nenvironment for learning, that their ability to access educational \nopportunity is impaired and impeded and diminished.\n  So this amendment seeks to address the budget resolution that has \nbeen agreed upon by allocating $5 billion to the Labor Committee to \nhelp school districts meet their most urgent school repair, renovation, \nand modernization and construction needs. It would allow us to create a \npartnership among the national, State, and local governments to repair \nour crumbling schools and help prepare our children for the 21st \nCentury.\n  This amendment is not specific to any school construction plan. It is \nan up-or-down vote on whether or not the Senate believes school \nconstruction ought to be a priority.\n  I want to take a moment to talk about school construction and why it \nis important for us to be engaged as a national community in support of \nthe environment in which we expect our children to learn. At no point \nin our history has education been more important to individual \nachievement and to our national well-being.\n  According to a just-published Hudson Institute study of the changing \nAmerican work force, ``The crucial factor accounting for long-term \nsuccess in the work force is a basic education provided at the primary \nand secondary levels.''\n  The Wall Street Journal recently quoted a leading U.S. economist who \nsaid, ``One of the few things that economists will agree upon is the \nfact that economic growth is very strongly dependent on our own \nabilities.''\n  Mr. President, that is true.\n  We are putting our Nation's economic future at risk by shortchanging \nour kids at schools that are literally falling down around them. \nUnfortunately--and it is an unfortunate fact--many of our schools are \nnot in adequate physical condition to meet the educational needs of our \nchildren. Many of our children attend schools that are literally \nfalling down around them.\n  The U.S. General Accounting Office, at our request, completed an \nexhaustive study of the condition of America's schools. They found that \n14 million children every day attend schools in such poor condition \nthat major renovation or outright replacement of the schools is needed. \nTwelve million children every day attend schools with leaky roofs. \nSeven million children every day attend schools with life-threatening \nsafety code violations.\n  In this, the greatest country in the world, educational environments \nare in such bad condition that our children's performance is degraded \nby them. Our parents' generation did better by our generation than we \nare doing for our children. And that is why I have submitted this \namendment. It is a tragedy for American children who have to attend \nschools in these conditions. None of us certainly would consider \nworking in conditions this bad.\n  The problem of crumbling schools is one that is not isolated nor \nlimited to inner cities, nor to isolated pockets of rural poverty. The \nGeneral Accounting Office, in one of its studies, found that 38 percent \nof urban schools, 30 percent of rural schools, and 29 percent of \nsuburban schools are falling down around our children.\n  In my State of Illinois alone, it is estimated to cost some $13 \nmillion to meet the school repair needs. Nationally, the GAO has \ndocumented $112 billion of renovation needs.\n  Clearly this is not a challenge that the local government and the \nStates can do by themselves by relying on local property taxes.\n  I am going to inject a little humor because this is a very sobering \nstory. This ought to be a very sobering situation. But I want to inject \na little humor in the debate.\n\n  A couple of weeks ago Charles Schulz had a series of Peanuts cartoons \nfeaturing Peppermint Patty's crumbling\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\nschool. The problem of crumbling schools has become so widespread that \neven Peppermint Patty's school has a leaky school roof. That is what \nthis cartoon is about.\n  In this series of Peanuts cartoons, Peppermint Patty and her friend, \nMarcie, express their frustration over the fact they can't get anyone \nto repair the leaking roof. But the most important one, I thought, was \nthis last one here when Marcie says to Peppermint Patty, ``This is how \nit is, Mr. Principal. Half the kids in our class can't read and half \ncan't multiply 6 by 8. None of the them ever heard of Bosnia and \ncouldn't tell you who wrote Hamlet.''\n  Peppermint Patty says, ``I talked to the principal.''\n  So Marcie says, ``What did he say about the roof leaking?\"\n  She said, ``I forgot to mention it.''\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, that has been the case all along. We \nhave been talking about education and educational achievement. We have \nbeen talking about standards for our kids. We talk about excellence for \nour children. We talk about education making our Nation competitive in \nthe global economy. But we forgot to mention that they have to go to \nschool to learn it. They have to have an environment that is suitable \nfor learning. We have so far and for so long turned our backs on this \nproblem that, again, according to the GAO, is going to require $112 \nbillion nationwide to address. That is just to provide the basics. That \nis just to make up for the years and years of neglect.\n  The GAO also found that many of our schools are not ready for the \n21st century. Again, there is a lot of discussion on this floor about \nthe information superhighway, the information age, and the advent of \ncomputers and technology. Fifteen million children every day attend \nschools that lack enough electrical power to fully use computers or \ntelecommunications technology in their classrooms. Fifty percent of the \nschools in our country lack the necessary electrical wiring to deploy \ncomputers to the classrooms.\n  You can't very well use these technologies if there is not the basic \ninfrastructure to allow them to be used. You can't use a computer if \nyou can't plug it into an outlet that works. Unfortunately, it is the \ncase at this time in our country that many of our classrooms are \ninadequate to meet the technological challenges of our time.\n  So we have two different issues that we have to begin to face up to. \nOne is the decades of neglect and the fact that many of our young \npeople are going to schools that our generation attended. And they have \nnot had the continuing maintenance over time to keep them in decent \nshape or to keep them from crumbling.\n  Then we have the secondary challenge of getting these old buildings \nretrofitted, or new ones built sufficient to meet the technological \nchanges of the information age that this generation is going to have to \ntake up, and the technologies that ought to be tools for them to \nsucceed in this global economy.\n  I point out that for this generation, computers are in many instances \nthe functional equivalent of textbooks. We used books. They ought to be \nable to use the Net, and they ought to be able to use the computer \ntechnology for their education. And, yet, we are denying them even the \nbasic opportunity to do so by putting them in situations in the \ncrumbling schools that we see.\n  I found it very interesting. Today in the New York Times on the front \npage there is an article about tax breaks for schools. This was an \narticle on an entirely different subject--not entirely, but a part of \nthe problem of how it is that we got to the point of having our schools \nliterally falling down around us. Interestingly, the little boy in this \npicture is going to a school of the arts. There is a huge hole in the \nwall in the school at the stairs that he is going up. You can see it \nright here, a huge hole in the wall of the school that he's attending. \nMr. President, I would like to think that this would be the exception \nto the rule. Unfortunately, according to the General Accounting Office, \nit is not the exception. It is, more often than not, the rule.\n\n  Here is another picture that is not quite as graphic. You can see the \npeeling paint. Our children are attending schools with asbestos, they \nare attending schools with lead paint, they are attending schools where \nthe roofs are leaking, where the windows are broken, where the heating \nis not adequate, where the sewage is not working. In short, the \ninfrastructure consigns our children to an environment for learning \nthat is not suitable and ought to be an embarrassment to all of us in \nthis country.\n  Added to that problem is the fact that too many of our schools are so \novercrowded that teaching and education are difficult. Again, according \nto the Department of Education, public high school enrollment is \nexpected to increase some 15 percent by the year 2006. So, just to \nmaintain current class sizes, we will need to build some 6,000 new \nschools by that time.\n  So the question is, how did we get to this point? How did we let it \nget this bad? And it is bad. Crumbling schools are not accidents. \nCrumbling schools happen because of some policy decisions that we have \nmade here in the Congress and in our Nation. That is why this debate, I \nthink, goes to the heart of the future of elementary and secondary \neducation.\n  At the outset, I would like to share with whoever is watching, \nlistening to this debate, some pictures that I have brought out before \nbut I think they are graphic reminders of what we are up against. This \nwould have been a chemistry lab, I guess, if you could use it, in a \nschool. As you can see, there is no way a student can learn chemistry \nin circumstances like this. More often than not it would probably \naffect performance, and that student will not be able to be competitive \nin this global marketplace, in this global economy.\n  Desks, these are desks sitting against walls that are literally \ncracking and falling in.\n  A set of lockers in a high school: Torn in, broken down, dilapidated. \nThat neglect, that kind of disrepair, did not happen overnight. It \nhappens because over a period of many, many years, in some cases \ndecades, these schools have not had maintenance because the maintenance \nwas deferred. Senator Patty Murray addressed this issue. As school \ndistricts have struggled to make ends meet, have struggled to provide \nfor the educational demands of the system, they have neglected the \ninfrastructure. And the result is the crumbling school phenomenon and \ncrisis that we see today.\n  This is another school lab.\n  I point out, Mr. President, this is not just confined to one part of \nour country. It is a nationwide problem. In fact, interestingly, \naccording to the General Accounting Office reports, it happens more \noften in the Western States than any other, but all regions of the \ncountry have crumbling schools. But it also happens in every kind of \ncommunity in America. It happens in urban school districts. The central \ncity school districts experience a 38-percent rate of crumbling \nschools. The rural districts, a 30-percent rate. The suburban \ndistricts, suburbia, which every one thinks of as being so well off, in \nsuburbia 29 percent of the school systems in suburbia have at least one \ninadequate building. So this is a problem that we have to face up to as \na national community. That is why this amendment has been offered.\n  I said earlier, crumbling schools are not just accidents. They are a \npredictable result of the way we fund education. Overcrowding and \ndeterioration in the schools will persist as long as we continue to \nrely exclusively on the efforts at the local property tax level to fund \nschool infrastructure improvements. The local property tax is simply an \ninadequate way to pay for the school infrastructure improvements of the \nmagnitude that our country is facing right now.\n  Poor- and middle-class districts especially cannot raise \nenough revenue to meet their needs. In fact, another one of the General \nAccounting Office studies pointed out a perversity that everyone should \nbecome aware of, and that is that the middle class and poorer schools \ntax themselves harder, do more to raise the funds to provide for their \neducation systems, than the schools in the wealthier districts. So what \nyou have is the whole notion of ability to pay for schools turned on \nits head by tying educational funding to the local property tax--for, \nin some instances, laudable reasons. But by not allowing for any \nflexibility in that arrangement, what we essentially do is consign \nmiddle-class districts, poor districts, to a\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\ngreater effort in terms of raising the money to rebuild their schools \nand provide for educational services for their community. And we do not \noffset that in any way.\n\n  In 35 States, some poor districts have higher tax rates than \nwealthier districts, but they raise less revenue because there is less \nproperty wealth to tax. It stands to reason. If you have a poor \ndistrict with less property tax wealth, the rate has to be higher in \norder to reach the same result as a more well off area that has the \ncapacity and has the property level to begin with. So, for the most \npart, these districts across the country have to look elsewhere, above \nand beyond their own property tax base, to help fund educational \nimprovements such as repairing the crumbling schools. Unfortunately the \nGeneral Accounting Office found that they do not get a whole lot of \nhelp from State governments. In fact, in fiscal year 1994, State \ngovernments contributed only $3.5 billion to the school infrastructure \ncrisis, in other words about 3 percent of the total needed. So this \nmodel, this school funding model, does not work for infrastructure, \njust as it was recognized some 50 years ago in this country, that it \nwould not work for highways and other infrastructure.\n  Imagine for a moment if we based our system of road funding on the \nsame funding model that we use for education funding. Imagine if every \ncommunity by itself, without any outside help, were responsible for \nconstruction and maintenance of the roads within its borders. In all \nlikelihood, with that kind of model, we would have smooth good roads in \nthe wealthy towns, we would have a patchwork of mediocre roads in \nmiddle-income towns, and we would have very few roads if any at all in \nthe poorer towns. Transportation, then, would become hostage to the \nvagaries of wealth and geography, commerce and travel would be \ndifficult, and navigation of such a system would not serve the \ninterests of our whole country.\n  That hypothetical, however, unfortunately, describes precisely the \nstate of our school funding model. That is how we fund schools. We rely \non local property taxes to find the money and then the States chip in \nsome. And, at the national level, we say it is not our problem, it is \nnot our responsibility, it is a State and local responsibility. I \nsubmit it is time for us to rethink that model and develop a new \npartnership, a partnership among all levels of government, that will \nallow us to rebuild and modernize our schools for the 21st century. \nJust as the national community through the Federal Government supports \nthe highway system, but the State and local officials decide which \nroads are to be built and where they should go, I believe that we can, \nat the national level, help finance school infrastructure improvements \nwhile preserving local control of education. Those two concepts do not \nhave to be tied to each other at the hip. If anything, we can look to \nlocal governments to do what they do best, which is to deal with where \nthe school shall be and what the schools will teach and those kinds of \nissues at the local level; but at the same time, engage support from \nthe national community, where we can perform best. We can access money \neasier. We can make it cheaper, we can make it available to the States \nso the States can help local school districts make those decisions.\n  So, we can address this issue. This amendment will engage the local, \nState and national resources in ways that preserve local control but at \nthe same time maximize cooperation. At the national level, we will help \nto supply the funding. At the State and local levels, discussions will \nbe had as to what schools and what features to address. Local control, \nI believe, will be enhanced by deemphasizing reliance on the local \nproperty tax to help solve a $112 billion national challenge.\n\n  I want, also, to share with the Members here this evening some of the \ncomments from some of the endorsers of this legislation, because I \nthink it is important to take a look at how it is that others who are \nconcerned with education see this problem. I have to tell you, I was \nstruck on my travels around Illinois, examining the crumbling school \nphenomenon in my State, how many instances I found the teachers and \nprincipals in classrooms, people in the school systems, just making do. \nIf anything, the teachers and the school administrators, the people who \nhave been involved with education and providing educational opportunity \nto our children, have had to make do over the last several decades, \nprecisely because they did not have any options.\n  I saw schools with children learning, not in a classroom, huddling in \nthe hallway. I saw schools in which the basements had been reconverted \nand cardboard, temporary walls put up to separate one class from \nanother. I saw schools in which the computers were as old, almost, as \nSenator Lautenberg's computer system. They clearly were so outmoded and \noutdated that they were meaningless for the youngsters who were trying \nto use them; one school in which the youngsters could not use the \ncomputers because you had to turn the lights off in the entire building \nto keep from blowing a fuse when you plugged it in. We have computers \nhere at the desk. We use computers in our work. Why can't we provide at \nleast as much for our children?\n  I have to tell you also, some of the situations are almost--border on \nthe tragic, with the condition of America's schools. There is a school \nin a part of my State, and I do not want to embarrass anybody by \ntelling the story, but it is a fact, where the youngsters on the track \nteam, instead of practicing at the track, because of the dilapidated \nand deteriorated condition of the gymnasium, had to go down the road to \npractice at the local prison. The prison had more modern track \nfacilities. The youngsters on the track team had to go there for their \npractice because the school building was not adequate. Mr. President, \nas Americans, I know we can do better and we absolutely have to do \nbetter if we are going to preserve our Nation's competitiveness and \npreserve the quality of life that, as Americans, we have come to enjoy.\n  More to the point, if we are in any way going to meet the challenge \nof providing to the next generation of Americans at least as much as \nwhat our parents provided to our generation, I believe we have an \nabsolute obligation to step up to the plate and help support State and \nlocal governments in meeting this $112 billion challenge that the GAO \nhas documented.\n  The Children's Defense Fund writes a letter in support. I would like \nthis letter to be printed in the Record.\n\n       We simply cannot ignore the environment where nearly 52 \n     million children spend so many crucial hours every weekday.\n\n  Again, recognizing this is a widespread phenomenon that affects all \nchildren.\n  As much to the point, in terms of not just affecting their ability to \nlearn, what do we communicate to our children about the value of \neducation? We preach, ``stay in school.'' We preach, ``It is important \nto get an education.'' Then we send them here. What do we tell them? \nWhat are we telling our children, when we consign them to environments \nin which no one can be expected to function--with leaky roofs and \nbroken windows and floors that are rotting out from underneath them? I \nthink we send them the absolute wrong message. We, in this Congress \nhave, I believe, an absolute obligation to do something about it.\n  I have another letter here, which is interesting, from the Council of \nthe Great City Schools. It says:\n\n       The infrastructure needs of America's schools are complex \n     and varied. Your bill does an excellent job in balancing \n     these needs, in being flexible in how they are met, and \n     leveraging other funds to expand the bill's impact.\n\n  Again, we are not looking to meet the entirety of the $112 billion \nchallenge here. We are just taking a first step with the $5 billion of \nassistance which, going to States and local governments, can give \nleverage additional funds. It is estimated that this legislation will \nallow for States and local governments to leverage 20 billion dollars \nworth of funding to address this crumbling schools phenomenon.\n  This is from the National Association of State Boards of Education. \nThey say, among other things:\n\n       While our schools are literally falling down, they are also \n     filling up. Total school enrollment, already at a record \n     high, continues to increase. The student population in \n     elementary and secondary schools is expected to rise 20 \n     percent over the next decade, due to the demographic \n     phenomenon known as the ``baby-boom echo.'' Overcrowding and \n     the use of temporary portable classrooms have become \n     commonplace across the country. New schools need to be built \n     to accommodate this growing demand.\n\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\n\n  And then they say:\n\n       School construction is a State and local responsibility and \n     should remain so, but their combined resources have been \n     overwhelmed by the estimated $110 billion required to repair \n     existing school facilities. Clearly, this is a national \n     problem that deserves national attention. Federal involvement \n     is consistent with the Government's historical role in \n     promoting educational equity.\n  Again, I would point out this legislation will allow for the kind of \nflexibility to allow school districts with State and local governments \nto work with the national Government on behalf of this initiative.\n  The American Institute of Architects in their letter say:\n\n       By instituting a cooperative partnership between the \n     Federal Government and local school districts, the school \n     construction initiative provides Federal support for local \n     oversight of school repair projects. The return on investment \n     for improving the condition of our schools has many positive \n     dividends as well.\n       By upgrading public school facilities in urban and rural \n     areas alike, this nation can renew its commitment not only to \n     a sound public infrastructure but can also ensure that \n     succeeding generations will grow and prosper from an academic \n     environment that is second to none.\n\n  Mr. President, there was a time when we made the investment in our \nschools. But we have forgotten about them. We forgot about them. Just \nas Marcie pointed out to Peppermint Patty, the roof leaking was \nsomething they forgot to mention to the school board.\n  So among the variety of issues in education that we face, I submit \nthat the crisis of our crumbling schools is second to none. Our \nschoolchildren cannot be expected to learn if their schools are \nliterally falling down around them. And only by addressing the repair \nof these schools, only by providing the kind of assistance that the \nState and local governments so clearly need in this instance will we be \nable to meet the challenge and really remedy the effects of decades of \nneglect.\n  The Associated General Contractors statement of policy says, and I \nwould like to raise this as an issue also:\n\n       As a nation, we have invested $422 billion in our public \n     schools. Now 74 percent of those schools are more than 25 \n     years old and nearly one-third are more than 50 years old; 14 \n     million children attend schools that need extensive repair or \n     replacement. The General Accounting Office estimates that 112 \n     billion dollars' is needed to refurbish our nation's schools. \n     The Federal Government does not currently fund school \n     construction. However, in light of the staggering needs and \n     the importance of education to future generations, improving \n     the quality of our schools should be a national priority.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what this amendment calls on the Members of \nthis Senate to do, to make a statement that education, repairing our \ncrumbling schools, is a national priority, that it is something we put \nvalue on and that we are prepared to step up to the plate and meet the \nchallenge of the $112 billion worth of need that the General Accounting \nOffice has already documented. In so doing, as we do so, we will \nprovide our youngsters with an environment in which they can learn. We \nwill provide them with an environment that says we value education. By \nsending our youngsters to these crumbling schools, schools that are \nfalling down around them, we send a message to our children that \neducation is not important to us, this is not something that is \nvaluable to us.\n  In fact--and I do not mean to be critical--there was a cartoon, \nanother cartoon today by Herblock, who is a famous cartoonist, which \nsays, ``I hear President Clinton wants to spend money to send more \npeople to college--What is College?'' And then in the back it says \n``City School.'' The doors are falling; the bricks are falling; it is \nin general disrepair.\n  This is the situation we see all over this country. Obviously, while \nwe support it, and higher education is important, it is not \ninappropriate for us to recognize that we have the capacity to engage \nin a partnership with State and local governments to give them the help \nthey need.\n\n  Flexibility is a very important buzzword around these parts these \ndays. Everybody wants arrangements to be flexible. Everybody wants the \nFederal Government to turn things over to the States. I think that is \nwonderful, and I have supported that. But at the same time flexibility \nhas to be a two-way street, one in which the State and local \ngovernments can come to us for help and as a national community we \nengage in behalf of our national priorities. Clearly, giving our \nchildren an environment that is suitable for learning ought to be a \nnational priority, and that is why this amendment seeks to start us on \na path toward providing this opportunity.\n  Winston Churchill once said, ``We shape our buildings; thereafter, \nthey shape us.''\n  Well, Mr. President, nowhere is that more important than in the \nschools. The poor condition of America's schools has a direct effect on \nthe ability of our students to learn the kinds of skills they will need \nto compete in the 21st century, global economy. Our children cannot \ncompete if they cannot learn, and they cannot learn if their schools \nare crumbling down around them. So this amendment would ensure that \nschool districts around the Nation are provided some assistance--some \nassistance, not a lot; $5 billion out of a $112 billion starting price \ntag is not a lot of money, but it certainly is money well spent and \nwill give us the ability to begin to address this problem that has \ncrept up on us.\n  So, Mr. President, I encourage support of the amendment. Again, it \nshould not conflict with the objectives of this balanced budget \nagreement. If anything, as the Chair may know, I am a supporter of the \nbalanced budget. I supported the balanced budget amendment. I very much \napplaud the negotiators for reaching an agreement that reaches balance. \nI think it makes sense to do it. But as we do so, it is important that \nwe not also throw the baby out with the bath water, as it were, that we \nalso not forget that our priorities ought to start with providing our \nyoungsters with the opportunity and the environment they need in which \nto learn.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the series of letters and statements I \nreferenced earlier be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: I commend you on your \n     initiative to restore funding to the budget agreement for \n     school construction and renovation.\n       It is clear that the physical condition of many of our \n     nation's public elementary and secondary schools is \n     deteriorating. Over 14 million students attend schools that \n     need major renovation or outright replacement. Some 7 million \n     children attend schools with life safety code violations. \n     About 12 million children attend schools with leaky roofs. In \n     communities in every state, schools are crumbling and \n     children struggle to learn in unsafe conditions. At the same \n     time, schools are not equipped to use modern technology. The \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) has estimated that it would \n     cost more than $112 billion to renovate and upgrade our \n     children's schools.\n       While in the past school construction and renovation have \n     been state and local responsibilities, given the magnitude of \n     the challenge that states and localities face, I believe that \n     we need a new partnership. Certainly the federal government \n     is not the sole answer. However, a federal role in \n     partnership with states and localities as proposed in your \n     amendment makes sense. We simply cannot ignore the \n     environment where nearly 52 million children spend so many \n     crucial hours every weekday.\n       Children need your amendment. If I can provide any \n     assistance to you, please let me know.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Marian Wright Edelman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Council of the\n\n\n                                           Great City Schools,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: On behalf of the Council of the \n     Great City Schools, a coalition of the nation's largest urban \n     public school systems, I am writing to give our enthusiastic \n     endorsement for your new school infrastructure initiative, \n     ``The Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act''.\n       The infrastructure needs of America's schools are complex \n     and varied. Your bill does an excellent job in balancing \n     those needs, in being flexible in how they are met, and in \n     leveraging other funds to expand the bill's impact. The \n     measure is also strong in allowing construction, repair and \n     upgrading. Finally, the bill does a particularly good job at \n     targeting scarce federal money to where the needs are \n     greatest, the nation's poorest communities.\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\n       This proposal, first outlined last summer, is one of the \n     boldest and most helpful initiatives ever introduced in the \n     U.S. Senate. It addresses one of America's most severe \n     domestic needs and does so in a way that has real promise for \n     success. Thank you for your leadership both in calling \n     attention to the needs in school repair and renovation and in \n     shaping a program to meet them.\n       America's Great City Schools are resolute in our support of \n     your proposal. And we will strongly encourage Congress to \n     support it. Our children deserve what this bill proposes.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership and advocacy. Please \n     let us know if we can be helpful to you in this critical \n     effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Casserly,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            The American Institute\n\n\n                                                of Architects,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: The American Institute of \n     Architects (AIA) wishes to commend the sponsors of S. 456, \n     ``The Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act of 1997.'' \n     In order to adequately meet the challenges of the 21st \n     Century, America's elementary and high school students need a \n     modern and safe environment.\n       As the saying goes, ``a picture says a thousand words.'' \n     Hopefully, the photographs received from various school \n     districts around the country will convey the urgency for \n     repairing and modernizing the physical structure of our \n     public schools. By initiating a cooperative partnership \n     between the federal government and local school districts, \n     the school construction initiative provides federal support \n     for local oversight of school repair projects. The return \n     investment for improving the condition of our schools has \n     many positive dividends as well. By upgrading public school \n     facilities in urban and rural areas alike, this nation can \n     renew its commitment not only to a sound public \n     infrastructure, but can also ensure that succeeding \n     generations will grow and prosper from an academic \n     environment that is second to none.\n       The AIA looks forward to working with Congress and other \n     organizations in the months ahead so that America's schools \n     have the resources necessary to provide the quality education \n     our students so richly deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Raj Barr-Kumar,\n     1997 AIA President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    State Boards of Education,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: The National Association of \n     State Boards of Education (NASBE) is a private nonprofit \n     association representing state and territorial boards of \n     education. Our principal objectives are to strengthen state \n     leadership in education policymaking, promote excellence in \n     the education of all students, advocate equality of access to \n     educational opportunity, and assure responsible governance of \n     public education.\n       We are writing to express our support for federal \n     assistance in the area of school construction. As you are no \n     doubt aware, the deterioration of America's school \n     infrastructure has reached crisis proportions. A Government \n     Accounting Office report found that one-third of all U.S. \n     schools are in need of extensive repairs or replacement and \n     60% have at least one major building deficiency such as \n     cracked foundations, leaky roofs, or crumbling walls. We \n     cannot expect our children to learn much less excel in such \n     decrepit and unsafe environments.\n       NASBE has been concerned about the issue of school \n     construction for some time. In the fall of 1995 we began a \n     one-year study of the condition of school infrastructure. The \n     result was a comprehensive report which I have enclosed \n     entitled, Building Our Future: Making School Facilities Ready \n     for the 21st Century. I commend it for your review.\n       While our schools are literally falling down, they are also \n     filling up. Total school enrollment, already at a record \n     high, continues to increase. The student population in \n     elementary and secondary schools is expected to rise twenty \n     percent over the next decade due to the demographic phenomena \n     known as the ``baby boom echo.'' Overcrowding and the use of \n     temporary, ``portable'' classrooms have become commonplace \n     across the country. New schools need to be built to \n     accommodate this growing demand.\n       School construction is a state and local responsibility, \n     and should remain so, but their combined resources have been \n     overwhelmed by the estimated $110 billion required to repair \n     existing school facilities. Clearly, this national problem \n     deserves national attention. Federal involvement is \n     consistent with the government's historical role in promoting \n     educational equity.\n       We applaud both you and President Clinton for your efforts \n     to address this critical situation by proposing a $5 billion \n     federal investment to spur school construction, recently \n     introduced as legislation in the Senate and House as S. 456 \n     and H.R. 1104 respectively. NASBE is encouraged by this \n     action and we look forward to working with congressional \n     leaders like yourself and Administration officials in \n     fostering a partnership between federal, state and local \n     entities to improve the learning conditions of American \n     children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Brenda L. Welburn,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   [Excerpt from Associated General Contractors Statement of Policy]\n\n                          Infrastructure Needs\n\n       Invest in safe schools for our children--As a nation, we \n     have invested $422 billion in our public schools. Now, 74% of \n     those schools are more than 25 years old and nearly one-third \n     are more than 50 years old. 14 million students attend \n     schools that need extensive repairs or replacement. The \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) estimates that $112 billion \n     is needed to refurbish our nation's schools. The federal \n     government does not currently fund school construction. \n     However, in light of the staggering needs and the importance \n     of education to future generations, improving the quality of \n     our schools should be a national priority.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield. I would \nnot like to lose any of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may reserve her time.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Florida has the next \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is the Senator finished?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. Reserving my time, \nI will yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, with great reluctance I rise in \nopposition to the amendment. I do so only because, with the necessities \nof education, we have to establish certain priorities. There is no \nquestion but that rebuilding the infrastructure is an important \npriority. But there are others that at this particular time I think \nhave to take priority.\n  I do appreciate, for instance, in the city of Washington this body, \nCongress, has a certain obligation to restore the schools. That is \nabout $2 billion that we are going to have to find a way to fund in \norder to bring this city back to where it ought to be.\n  On the other hand, there is somewhere around $120 billion in \ninfrastructure repairs necessary in this country. How we get that I do \nnot know. I do know that $5 billion would start it, but there are other \npriorities--and I will tick off a number of those priorities--for which \nwe could use these resources better.\n  First of all, as the body probably knows, I voted in favor of \nexpanding the amount of money that will be available by supporting the \nHatch-Kennedy bill. If that money were available, it might tend to \nchange my position. But when I look out there right now, our most \nimmediate needs are trying to get the educational system in order to \nprovide the kind of skilled labor we need in this Nation. That means we \nhave to change the K through 12 programs by professional development in \norder to give us the math standards we need in order to provide the \nskilled labor force. This is going to take a considerable amount of \nimmediate resources.\n  In addition to that, getting our schools up to speed with respect to \nthe technical aspects of computers and other means of being able to \nimprove access to modern technology, to improve the schools, would take \nabout $16 billion. In addition to that, it would take about $8 billion \na year to keep them up to snuff.\n  Another area we have to deal with is higher ed as well. We already \nknow that we have incredible problems in that respect. Most importantly \nare worker training areas. Right now, in order to provide the work \nforce for the future, we have to find ways to, first of all, provide \nsufficient additional remedial help so that our young people who \ngraduate will be ready to go to work in skilled labor. We do not have \nthose resources yet.\n  We will be passing out a worker training bill, and we will be needing \nresources in order to do that. We have created another huge priority in \nthis Nation, and that is taking the welfare people who are involved in \nreceiving benefits, to train them and retrain them in order to have \njobs. That is incredibly important, and it has to be done. That is \ngoing to take other billions of resources.\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\n  So although I sympathize with the amendment, I strongly believe the \nresources at this time that we do have available would have to be \nplaced in slightly different order than would enable us to try to take \ncare of the huge backlog and which has traditionally been accepted as \nthe responsibility by the State and local governments. For those \nreasons, Mr. President, I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Moseley-\nBraun's amendment to the Budget Resolution that would provide $5 \nbillion for a national school construction initiative. I would like to \ncommend Senator Moseley-Braun for her leadership on this issue, and I \nwould also like to thank Senators Kennedy and Harkin for their fine \nefforts to address this critical problem.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. \nCrumbling schools are not just an urban problem. They are a nationwide \nproblem, and rural areas are no exception. In fact, 30 percent of \nschools in rural areas report at least one inadequate building feature.\n  A 1996 report by the General Accounting Office found that in my home \nstate of South Dakota, 25 percent of schools have inadequate plumbing, \n21 percent of schools have roof problems, 29 percent have ventilation \nproblems, and 21 percent percent of schools are not meeting safety \ncodes.\n  We have adopted a nationwide goal of trying to connect every school \nbuilding in the country to the internet. Teaching our children to use \nnew this technology is critical for preparing them for the 21st \ncentury. Yet, in my home state, 22 percent of schools have inadequate \nelectrical wiring. In their present condition, these schools cannot \naccommodate computers in the classroom.\n  South Dakota's tribal schools also face very serious facilities \nproblems and major construction backlogs. There are nine federally \nrecognized tribes in South Dakota. At the same time, my State has 3 of \nthe 10 poorest counties in the nation, all of which are within \nreservation boundaries.\n  With 56 percent of its people under the age of 24, the native \nAmerican population in this country is disproportionately young when \ncompared the American population overall. This population strains \nexisting school facilities. The BIA estimates that there is a \nconstruction backlog of $680 million in its 185 elementary, secondary \nand boarding schools serving Indian children on 63 reservations in 23 \nStates. Of these schools, 63 percent are over 30 years old; 26 percent \nare over 50 years old. Annual appropriations for BIA education \nfacilities improvement and repair have averaged $37 million annually, \nwhich unfortunately meets only 5 percent of total need.\n  Nationwide, the statistics are similarly ominous. Crumbling schools \nare a problem of enormous magnitude. Fourteen million children attend \nclasses in buildings that need major repair or renovation. Seven \nmillion children go to school in buildings that have safety code \nviolations. Sixteen million children study in classrooms without proper \nheating, ventilation, or air conditioning.\n  It is nearly impossible to measure the impact that these conditions \nhave on students' ability to learn, but there is no doubt that the \nimpact is severe.\n  Clearly, there is much we can do to improve our existing school \nbuilding infrastructure. But that is only part of the problem. Our \nNation is experiencing significant growth in school enrollment. \nEstimates are that we will need to build 6,000 new schools by the year \n2006 if we want to keep class sizes the same as they are presently.\n  This amendment would allocate $5 billion to the House and Senate \ncommittees of jurisdiction to devise a school construction and \nrenovation initiative. We are not mandating a specific approach in this \namendment. Rather, we hope that this $5 billion Federal contribution \ncan be used in partnership with State and local efforts to leverage \nover $20 billion of dollars of construction activity nationwide. An \neffort of this magnitude would benefit our students for generations, \nand I am proud to support this amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor and strong supporter \nof Senator Moseley-Braun's school infrastructure amendment.\n  One of the major problems facing elementary and secondary education \ntoday is the poor condition of our school buildings. In my home state \nof Rhode Island, many schools are in need of extensive repairs and \nupgrades.\n  I have visited several of these schools, including the Harris \nElementary School in Woonsocket which was built in 1876. To put this in \nperspective, in 1876 the nation celebrated the centennial of the United \nStates; Rutherford B. Hayes was elected President by one vote; Custer \nconfronted the Sioux at Little Big Horn; Alexander Graham Bell \ntransmitted the first complete sentence by voice over wire; Henry Heinz \nput ketchup in a bottle; and Colorado became the 38th State.\n  Sadly, the Harris Elementary School's library is a small trailer \nparked in the school's playground. In addition, I have received \ncompelling footage of the condition of the schools in North Providence, \nincluding the Stephen Olney School, which has asbestos in the floors \nand water damaged classrooms, and the Centredale School, which has \nleaking classroom ceilings.\n  These examples and numerous others across my State and the Nation \nshow the urgent and real need for a school construction initiative. A \nproblem of this magnitude demands a Federal response.\n  Indeed, a recent General Accounting Office (GAO) report found that in \nRhode Island 29 percent of schools report at least one inadequate \nbuilding of any type; 61 percent have at least one inadequate building \nfeature; 75 percent have at least one unsatisfactory environmental \nfactor, such as heating and ventilation; and 37 percent have \ninsufficient capability for computers.\n  Nationally, the statistics are equally compelling. Fourteen million \nchildren, in one-third of the Nation's schools, are learning in \nbuildings that need major renovations or should be replaced outright. \nSeven million students attend schools with safety code violations, such \nas the presence of lead paint, asbestos, or radon in the walls, floors, \nor ceilings. One-third of students study in classrooms without \nelectrical wiring and power outlets to accommodate computers and \nmultimedia equipment.\n  We should not pass up this opportunity to repair our Nation's \nschools.\n  While the budget resolution before us does include some increases in \neducation funding and provides protection for important education \ninitiatives, the agreement's caps on discretionary funding do not \nguarantee room for the school construction initiative. The same may \nalso be the case for school reform and efforts to improve the \nrecruitment, education, and mentoring of teachers, for which the \nNational Commission on Teaching and America's Future report, What \nMatters Most: Teaching for America's Future, suggests almost $5 billion \nis needed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Moseley-Braun amendment, which \nseeks to make $5 billion available for school repair, renovation, and \nconstruction. Indeed, this must be a top priority as we work to provide \nstudents a quality education and prepare them for the future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I find myself in a very difficult position.\n  First, I commend the Senator from Illinois for her interest not only \nin school construction, the infrastructure for schools, but her view \nabout investments in children, about what it is going to take to help \nour society stabilize, about what it is going to take to avoid \ncriminality and violence that we see so freely around our country. She \nhas been a leader on those issues for children. She is always \ndiscussing what it is that we have to do to make certain that children \nwill grow up as contributing adults with a prospect for their own \nsuccesses.\n  It is consistent with her views on what we ought to be doing for the \nchildren in our country to be concerned about the schoolhouses they \nattend.\n  Senator Moseley-Braun has made too many speeches, written so much \nabout what the alternative to incarceration and prosecution is, and it \nis investment in our kids. If there is not a\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\nparticularly identifying view of what we ought to be doing for our \nchildren than a bunch of broken down schoolhouses, then I would tell \nyou there is nothing else.\n  I am a member of the Budget Committee, the senior Democrat on the \nBudget Committee, and as I said, this is a painful point at which I \nfind myself. We have a consensus budget resolution. It took a lot of \nwork. I was surprised, I must say, when I saw the agreement in its \nfinal form because I was expecting that there would be some funds \nreserved for improvement of the school facilities around the country. I \ndid not think at the time that the original $5 billion request was \nheld, but I thought it might be somewhere in the vicinity of $3 \nbillion, certainly not enough to make a dent when we consider that the \nGAO estimate, as the Senator from Illinois mentioned, is that there is \n$112 billion needed to bring our schools up to date.\n  Now, I happen to come from a highly urbanized State, a State in which \nwe have more than a fair share of poverty.\n  Our cities, and we have many of them, are among the poorest in the \ncountry--Newark, Camden, Paterson, my birthplace, I think is the fifth \npoorest city in America. I visit my old hometown, if I can call it \nthat, on a fairly regular basis. It is often said here that we do these \nthings, but I happen to go to the same barbershop that I have been \ngoing to since I was in college--and that was some years ago--and the \nbarber is still cutting. Even if he misses a few hairs here and there, \nI don't care, but it takes me back to the city of my birth.\n  I have a lot of sentiment attached to that city because they were \nhard-working people, people who were determined to have their children \nsucceed and invest whatever they could in terms of personal involvement \nin the development of those kids. School was the No. 1 thing. That was \nalways the concern of the parents.\n  I can tell you, I don't like to admit this publicly, but I was a \ntruant one day, and it was just my luck my father found out. I was \nnever truant again. I visited that school just last week because I was \nhelping them establish the connections they needed to get ultimately \ninto the Internet, the schools being wired. My old company paid for the \nwiring of the schools in Paterson where our company started because my \npartners, like I, came from poor working-class families. I remember \nwhat it was like living that way, not particularly enjoying anything \nbut the memory of good family life. So we helped to get the schools \nwired in the city.\n  When I was there, I was struck by the horrific condition of not that \nschoolhouse, not that school building in particular, but others in the \ncity, with signs of almost war-type devastation, with broken windows \nand things of that nature.\n  I am also, since I was very active on the environment committee, \nconscious about the hazards to the health of the children. Forget about \nthe disruptions to learning, for the moment--asbestos, lead paint, \nthings that you would not permit your children to be near, to fiddle \nwith if you had any way around it.\n  So when I think of the amendment proposed by the Senator from \nIllinois, I say, yes, it is difficult for me. I am going to support the \namendment that the Senator is offering in hopes that we can find some \nway to finance it. The amendment, I understand, includes a source for \nthe funding coming from where, may I ask, reduction of tax cuts?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is correct. It is not specific. It raises the \nrevenue floor by $5 billion.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is on the Finance Committee.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. She will have the task of having to find a way to do \nit, because I think that it is probably not going to be allowable in \nthe budget resolution.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield? This is \nthe book, ``Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options.'' It is \nkind of a loophole cookbook, and I am certain that in the course of the \nFinance Committee's deliberations that we can find $5 billion here that \nwill make up for the difference, so that will provide the funding \nstream for this.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator from New Jersey. You have seen the \nrealities, you have seen what these children have to live through and \nlive with. You know that they cannot go into the information age based \non the kind of environment we are providing them.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. They cannot even go sometimes to the age of \ncivilization in some of these facilities.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. They are firetraps. They are insecure at a time when \nsecurity is high in the consciousness list. So I hope a source can be \nfound that doesn't violate the basic construction we put into this \nbudget resolution.\n  I commend the Senator from Illinois for her dedication, for her \ndetermination to bring this problem foursquare in front of us and try \nand solve it.\n  The statistics are so terrible that if you look at them, they begin \nto lose their significance: 30 percent of the children not having \nadequate heating and ventilating; 24 percent--other schools without \nadequate plumbing. The list goes on. That is just the physical eyesore \nthat is out there that you would expect to be something resembling a \ndecaying factory and not a facility that is being used by youngsters \nwho are trying, with the help of often inadequate supervision, to try \nand find some life for themselves that they can follow and get through. \nIf you walk into a place that is a dump, it is not going to lift your \nspirits to start your day.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and just remind everybody \nthat we now have other amendments in order and that this amendment will \nbe voted upon. As I understand it, there is a UC that allots the \nremaining time for use in the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator is correct. The \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, that is correct, and we will take \nthis up, again, in the morning as part of the vote.\n  I just want to say in closing, it is a funny thing, reality really \ndoes have a ring about it that is unavoidable, and I don't think there \nis anyone in this Chamber or anyone who is a Member of this Senate who, \nif they spent the time to go around in their own States and visit the \nschools there, elementary and secondary schools, will deny the validity \nof what the GAO has told us is true.\n  Everyone knows about the crumbling school problem, and if you talk to \nyour constituents or visit schools in your area, you will find it \nthere. That is what is so stunning about this issue. It is not an \ninner-city issue, it is not a Midwestern issue, it is an American \nissue, and it affects every kind of community and every kind of child. \nIf, indeed, we are going to turn our back and say we have other things \nto do, we are too busy to get around fixing the window but we want you \nto meet these standards, we are not going to help these States meet \nthis $112 billion burden, but we are going to give them all the \nflexibility in the world, or we are not going to give the local \ngovernments--the local communities that are taxing themselves the most \nand are having the hardest time repairing these crumbling schools.\n  That is what is so compelling to me in engaging this new partnership \nin which we don't take over Federal educational content. No one is \nlooking to do that. It is appropriate that local governments deal with \nwhat kind of schools they have and what the children learn, the \nconditions and the teachers and the curriculum and those kinds of \nthings. I think that is appropriate. So we are not talking about the \nFederal Government taking over anything, but rather, in this air of \nflexibility, saying we are prepared to be responsible and give the \nflexibility and help States and local governments meet this $112 \nbillion challenge, because, indeed, our very national security is at \nrisk. We will not be able to stay the greatest country in the world in \nthis global economy in the world if we send our children to schools \nwhere even Peppermint Patty gets rained on in the classroom.\n  I thank very much the Senator from New Jersey. I thank my colleagues.\n  Madam President, I inquire, how much time is remaining on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 27 minutes; the\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nSenator from New Mexico has 56 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will it come from my time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. It will come from our time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Certainly.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does the current law, Davis-Bacon, apply as well? You \nmentioned flexibility, but would the schools who do the building or do \nthe maintenance also have to comply with Davis-Bacon regulations?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is not addressed specifically in \nthis amendment. However, Federal contracting rules would apply, but the \nStates and local governments would have to come forward with their own \ncontracting rules. The question has been raised about Davis-Bacon, to \nbe honest. We don't yet have, since the funding formula has not been \nworked out in terms of Federal funding of infrastructure and State and \nlocal funding of infrastructure--\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. But there is no exemption from Davis-Bacon?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. No, there is not.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I control the time still.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois controls the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. My understanding is the Senator wanted to ask a \nquestion.\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I want to speak on the amendment.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Let me say this, the amendment does not go to \nthose contracting rules, and, again, I think the issue of Davis-Bacon \nand those arguments which would take up all the time in connection with \nFederal highway projects is not a relevant issue with regard to this \neffort in behalf of rebuilding crumbling schools.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment, \nand in answer to the question, obviously Davis-Bacon applies, because \nall Federal contracting dealing with Federal money would apply. We \nwould have the Federal Government setting wage determination rates. So \nI object to this amendment for that reason, but also for other reasons. \nThe Federal Government does not have a primary responsibility of trying \nto build new schools or to rebuild schools. That is not a Federal \nresponsibility.\n  Some people say, ``Well, we need more education money, we need more \neducation programs.'' We have 788 education programs spending $98 \nbillion a year spread all throughout the Government. One that we don't \nhave, if we adopted the Senator's amendment, would be a $5 billion \nschool building program. That is one program we do not need, and we \ncannot afford.\n  Schools are the primary function of State and local government, and \nto build or rebuild or to figure out which schools should be rehabbed, \nthat really should be decided by local and State government. That \nshould not be decided by Washington, DC. Contingent with that money \ncomes Federal strings, regulations, such as Davis-Bacon. The Federal \nGovernment would be determining what the wage rates would be to comply, \nto rehab the school building. Some of those wage rates are outlandish \nin comparison to what is normally paid for schools or for other \nbuildings and projects in those areas.\n  With greatest respect for my colleague from Illinois, I know her \nintentions are very sincere and I know a lot of schools need to be \nrehabbed, I know a lot of schools need to be replaced, I know a lot of \nschools are in pathetic shape, but it is not the function or \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to try and solve all the \nproblems and certainly not the construction of local schools or the \nrehab of local schools, which, I might mention, $5 billion would hardly \nscratch the surface. Then we would have to have the Federal Government \ndetermine if the needs in the hundreds of billions of dollars--how is \nthe Federal Government going to determine who wins and who loses? I \nimagine you could spend $5 billion for school renovation in the State \nof Texas alone. Quite possibly, I imagine the State of Illinois alone.\n  So you have all this competition amongst the various schools and \nStates for who is going to get this money. This is not a function for \nthe Federal Government. The 10th amendment to the Constitution says all \nother rights and powers are reserved to the States. We should certainly \nleave this one, school construction and renovation, to the States and \nto the localities, not to the Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Madam President. In the first place, \nwhat we are talking about fixing are our Nation's schools.\n  I think we can have a separate debate, a separate vote on the merits \nof paying workers prevailing wages. But I would point out to my \ncolleague that some 32 States, many cities and townships, already have \ntheir own prevailing wage laws affecting school construction. And \nfrankly, any school district that is receiving Federal Impact Aid \nfunding today is already subject to Davis-Bacon.\n  Now, the truth is that Davis-Bacon applies to Federal highway \nconstruction, and few people argue that the Federal Government has no \nrole in highway construction.\n  I ask my colleague, what is the difference? If the highways were in \nthis kind of condition, clearly there would be a rush to create a \npartnership so that we can provide support in order to support \ntransportation in our Nation. But the schools are in this condition. \nAnd the Senator is suggesting that we turn our backs and say it is up \nto the States and local governments to do it by themselves.\n  I think the pictures and the debate about this issue demonstrate very \nclearly that they have not been able to do it by themselves, and it has \nnot been through want of trying. It is not as though school districts \nhave deliberately set out to put children in classrooms that look like \nthis. It is not as though local school boards have not wanted to vote \nthe money to provide for the schools.\n  The Senator from Vermont knows full well that with the District of \nColumbia schools you see the condition. And it is not as though the \npeople here in D.C. did not want to make certain the windows were \nfixed, but they had other emergencies. That is the exigencies of \neducation they had to meet first: classrooms, textbooks, lighting, the \nbasics, teacher salaries. So the funds have gone to that. And \nmaintenance has been deferred time and time again.\n  Again, of the 50 percent of the schools in this country that are over \n50 years old, in all too many instances those schools have suffered \njust about that same amount of neglect and deferred maintenance. Well, \nas with maintenance of anything else, it just gets worse as the problem \ngets older.\n  This problem is going to get worse and worse over time. And school \ndistricts have been trying. In fact, one of the reports by the General \nAccounting Office talked about the fact that school districts that have \nthe least try the hardest and that they have been trying to meet these \ninfrastructure needs, but all too often have not been able to. They \ncannot go into the capital markets to borrow money at favorable rates \nbecause they do not have the bond rating. So the result is classrooms \nthat look like this.\n  So I will just suggest to my colleagues that this is not in any way \nabout Washington telling school districts what classrooms to fix or \nwhat schools to rebuild or where to put the construction effort. In \nfact, the whole idea is to have that kind of decisionmaking start at \nthe local level and start and stay at the local and State level. That \nis the point of their decisionmaking. All we would do as a national \ncommunity is to give financial assistance in ways that will allow these \nlocal districts to leverage additional money to meet what is clearly \ntheir local need on the one hand but, in the final analysis, is our \nentire need.\n  If one community or another cannot afford to provide their youngsters \nwith laboratories in which their youngsters\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\ncan learn chemistry, how can we expect to be competitive in a global \neconomy, in global competition? If a community cannot afford it and is \nbeing taxed to the maximum extent, and they just do not have the money \nto address the basics of the rain coming through the window or the roof \nleaking, how can we expect these youngsters to learn, even assuming for \na moment there are other program priorities that the Federal Government \nhas traditionally taken up with regard to elementary and secondary \neducation?\n  Of course, our role has always, as a national community, been limited \nin elementary and secondary education. But even assuming for a moment \nthat there are other priorities, I daresay, it should go without \nargument that ought to be a priority also. Our kids cannot learn, they \ncannot take advantage of whatever those other priorities are in schools \nthat are literally falling down around them.\n  We are going to take a vote on this tomorrow morning. There will be \nsome further debate about it tomorrow morning. I encourage my \ncolleagues to take a close look, to call home, to check out what is \ngoing on in your own States, because this is a problem that, again, is \nnational in scope, but it particularly goes to the well-being and the \naccess to educational opportunity for every child in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I would point out that the primary \nresponsibility for this construction lies with the States, and that if \nwe were to go on in a new venture to pick up the responsibility of \nreconstructing the schools in this country of about $115 to $120 \nbillion, that obviously would create a huge change in our priorities.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I understand that under the unanimous-\nconsent order, the Moseley-Braun amendment is now set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it will be set aside.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order agreed to was to recognize the \nSenator from Florida at this time.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I have no objection to allowing the \nSenator from Vermont to proceed at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will be very brief.\n  I thank my good friend from Florida for allowing me to do this.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 337\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have a motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] for himself and Mr. \n     Coats, moves to recommit S. Con. Res. 27 to the Committee on \n     the Budget with instructions to report the same back to \n     the Senate forthwith with the following amendments:\n       Strike the reconciliation instruction for the Committee on \n     Labor and Human Resources.\n       Adjust the reconciliation instructions for the Committee on \n     Finance to reflect an increase in revenues of $1,057,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 2002 and $1,792,000,000 for the period of \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2002.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, so I do not sound totally inconsistent \nwith the arguments I just made, I would let it be known that I intend \nto withdraw my amendment at the conclusion of my statement.\n  I rise today with my good friend from Indiana, Senator Coats, to \noffer this motion. What this does is to remove the reconciliation \ninstructions from the budget bill, the reconciliation instructions of \nmy own committee. The reason for that is that this would require us to \nreduce the aid for our higher ed students.\n  I would remind everyone that last year this body greatly reduced the \ninstructions then of some many billions of dollars and sent it over to \nthe House. They came back and refused to go along. And this body voted \n99 to 0 to insist upon the Senate's position. That resulted in \nrestoring almost all of the money to the higher ed area.\n  The only area that my committee, the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, has any money that is in the reconciliation area is with \nrespect to the higher ed funding of our student loans. The budget \nagreement as recently written cuts the student financial aid account by \n$1.8 billion over 5 years. I would note that that is substantially \nlower than last year. We end up, even after all the reductions from \nabout $19 billion down, we still ended up with $4 billion. So I commend \nthe Budget Committee for coming back with half of what was required \nlast year.\n  Our motion would restore these funds however and remain budget \nneutral by providing for adjustment on the revenue side of the \nagreement. I think it is important to remind my colleagues of the \ncentral importance that student aid plays in our children's future.\n  The balanced budget agreement is dependent upon increases in working \nproductivity and in future economic growth. This growth in turn is \ndependent upon the quality and availability of a well-educated work \nforce.\n  Let us take a minute to reflect on the facts regarding the economic \nimpact, the higher education impact upon Federal aid to student \nparticipation. Participation in higher education is one of the most \ndramatic predictors of economic success.\n  As you can see from this chart--the chart I would have had but do not \nhave--that shows dramatically that the more education you have, the \nmore economic availability you have.\n  With a high school degree, your high range is at $43,000. If you have \na bachelor's degree, it is $73,000. And if you have a doctorate, it \ngoes well above that.\n  In the past years, only those that had postsecondary education have \nbeen able to stay even with the cost of living. And only those with \ndoctorates and masters degrees have improved their standard of living.\n  So it is incredibly important we provide the access of our young \npeople to go to higher education. The postsecondary, as I referred to \nit now--we have given much emphasis on the higher education without \nkeeping in mind the postsecondary training education that is available.\n  Federal financial aid plays an essential role in allowing students \nfrom low and middle income families to attend community colleges and \nuniversities. Thirty-six percent of all students receive some form of \nFederal financial aid in order to allow them to attend college. This \nFederal investment is returned many times over in increased economic \nproductivity and income in Federal taxes. Without this aid, however, \nmany of the students would not be able to fulfill their dreams to \nattend college.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, education is, for many of us, a top \npriority. S. 1, the first bill introduced in the 105th Congress \nevidenced that fact. The rhetoric from our President would seem to \nindicate that education was also his top priority, yet at this very \nmoment he is supporting a budget which will result in a decrease of \n$1.8 billion to student aid programs. I rise today to support the \nJeffords motion which ensures access to educational opportunities for \nall Americans.\n  Since the early 1980's, the price of going to college has increased \nat more than twice the rate of inflation; growing even more rapidly \nthan the cost of health care. This is the chief reason that a college \neducation is unaffordable for American families.\n  Initiatives, such as those included in S. 1, provide tax relief for \nfamilies, encourage planning for the future through the use of college \nsavings accounts, and build on already successful programs, such as \nFederal student loans and work study. These initiatives deserve our \nsupport. Unfortunately, the budget that we are considering today will \nmake it virtually impossible to adequately provide these critically \nimportant programs to students and their families.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Jeffords and I in this firm \nresolve to protect higher education programs, thereby ensuring that all \nstudents have access to post-secondary educational opportunities. \nAccess to higher education is critical and should not be compromised in \nthis budget resolution.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would again ask Members to keep in mind the 99 to 0 \nvote which occurred last year that said we should not do anything that \nimpacts in the ability of our students to attend higher education. So I \nwill ensure that the reconciliation that we send, if anything, will \nmake sure that\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nit does not in any way hinder the ability of students to attend higher \neducation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my motion at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 337) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 315\n\n     (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n  commitment to biomedical research should be doubled over the next 5 \n                                 years)\n\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack], for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Frist, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. DeWine, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Breaux, \n     Mr. Specter, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Dorgan, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 315.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL \n                   INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) heart disease was the leading cause of death for both \n     men and women in every year from 1970 to 1993;\n       (2) mortality rates for individuals suffering from prostate \n     cancer, skin cancer, and kidney cancer continue to rise;\n       (3) the mortality rate for African American women suffering \n     from diabetes is 134 percent higher than the mortality rate \n     of Caucasian women suffering from diabetes;\n       (4) asthma rates for children increased 58 percent from \n     1982 to 1992;\n       (5) nearly half of all American women between the ages of \n     65 and 75 reported having arthritis;\n       (6) AIDS is the leading cause of death for Americans \n     between the ages of 24 and 44;\n       (7) the Institute of Medicine has described United States \n     clinical research to be ``in a state of crisis'' and the \n     National Academy of Sciences concluded in 1994 that ``the \n     present cohort of clinical investigators in not adeuqate'';\n       (8) biomedical research has been shown to be effective in \n     saving lives and reducing health care expenditures;\n       (9) research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health \n     has contributed significantly to the first overall reduction \n     in cancer death rates since recordkeeping was instituted;\n       (10) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has resulted in the identification of genetic \n     mutations for osteoporosis; Lou Gehrig's Disease, cystic \n     fibrosis, and Huntington's Disease; breast, skin and prostate \n     cancer; and a variety of other illnesses;\n       (11) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has been key to the development of Magnetic Resonance \n     Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning \n     technologies;\n       (12) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has developed effective treatments for Acute \n     Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Today, 80 percent of children \n     diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia are alive and \n     free of the disease after 5 years; and\n       (13) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health contributed to the development of a new, cost-saving \n     cure for peptic ulcers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this Resolution assumes that--\n       (1) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal \n     years; and\n       (2) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by $2,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1998 \n     over the amount appropriated in fiscal year 1997.\n\n  Mr. MACK. I ask unanimous consent that no second-degree amendments to \nthis amendment be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand the following Senators: Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Frist, \nSpecter, Harkin, D'Amato, DeWine, Boxer, Collins, Durbin, Reid, Breaux, \nand Dorgan.\n  Madam President, let me quickly state the amendment is a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. Let me just say to my colleagues that I \nrecognize that what we are doing here is merely making a statement. But \nI think it is an important statement to be made.\n  This has to do with a sense of the Senate about doubling the \ninvestment in the National Institutes of Health over the next 5 years.\n  It further States that it is our intent that the investments of the \nNational Institutes of Health be increased by $2 billion in this next \nfiscal year.\n  I begin my remarks, as I do often about this issue, by speaking about \nmy own personal experiences, in essence, what motivates me to offer \nthis sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Before I get into those kinds of personal feelings, maybe I ought to \nshare with my colleagues an experience that I had just a few months \nago, the last hearing that the Senate--at least I believe it was--the \nlast hearing that the Senate held in the 104th Congress. It was a \nhearing that was chaired by Senator Hatfield and Senator Cohen, and it \nwas a hearing to raise the awareness of the American people about the \nadvantages and the needs of more research dollars.\n  General Schwarzkopf was one of those individuals who testified. He, \nin essence, said that one of these days the American people are going \nto realize how little we have invested in basic research in health \ncare, in health care research, health research in this country, how \nlittle we have done. He said, in essence, when they find that out, they \nare going to be mad as hell and they are going to want something done \nabout it.\n  I have spent many years now here in the Senate trying to raise the \nvoices of concern, and the time has now come, frankly, that another \nyear cannot pass without this Congress and this Senate making a \ncommitment to doubling the investment at the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  And I say so in recognizing I do this from an emotional perspective \nbecause I, like so many others, represent families that have been \ndevastated by disease. In my particular case, I am talking about \ncancer. Since the last time I spoke on the floor of the Senate about \nthis issue I lost another member of my family to the disease. I lost my \nfather, who died at the age of 83 with esophageal cancer.\n\n  I remember at a particular moment as he was fighting the disease, and \nI guess this moment comes for most of us, dad realized regardless of \nall the advantages and all the breakthroughs that have taken place with \nresearch, that frankly nothing more could be done for him. One of the \ndoctors suggested what they needed to do next was to insert a feeding \ntube into his stomach. Dad's reaction to the doctor was, ``That's not \ngoing to happen to me. I have lived a pretty good life. I have raised \neight children,'' and he said with a little grin, ``They have all done \npretty well. So I look upon my life as one that has been pretty \nsuccessful.'' He said, ``It's time for me to die. I'm going back home. \nI'm not going to stay in the hospital. I'm not going to eat anything \nelse. I'm not going to drink anything else. It is time for me to die. I \naccept that.''\n  That was totally different than the experience that I had with my \nyounger brother who died of melanoma at the age of 35. At that age, I \nguess it is almost impossible to give up. You have a sense that you \nhave got to fight every step of the way. Maybe there will be a \ndiscovery made is the sense of what people feel. I can tell you as a \nmember of the family, I sure was hopeful, each day, maybe a new \nprocedure, maybe a new experimental drug would come along and save my \nbrother Michael's life, who for 12 years, from the age of 23, on knew \nthat each year could be the year in which he would lose his life.\n  So I say today, Madam President, I can no longer be kind of quiet \nabout this issue. I realize I am here today speaking about my own \npersonal experiences, but in essence I represent every family in \nAmerica. Why are we taking this? Why have we, as a Nation, said over \nand over and over again we do not have the money to invest in this kind \nof research? We are talking about $2 billion more in this next fiscal \nyear--$2 billion more, and we are told we do not have the money. Now I \nknow how difficult it is going to be to find it. I do not mean to be \nunderestimating that. But if our Nation made the commitment to do it we \ncould find the resources to invest $2 billion more at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  As I say, my story is a story about cancer. I was diagnosed with the \nsame cancer that killed my brother, within months after I came to the \nU.S. Senate. And I would say this, if it had not\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\nhave been for Michael's death, I probably would have been the one who \ndied because I would not have been sensitive to the information on the \nearly warning signs of the disease. I would have ignored the mole on my \nside until maybe it was too late. All I am saying is I do not think we \nas a Nation should ignore the warning signs.\n  You can talk about Parkinson's disease, and many of us have had the \nopportunity to talk with Morton Kondracke or with Joan Samuelson. In my \ncase, a dear friend, Bob Finkernagle, another dear friend, Pat Hucker, \nwhose wife is suffering with the disease. There have been tremendous \nbreakthroughs with respect to Parkinson's disease but there is a lot \nmore out there that can be discovered, a lot more that can be done.\n  During these past several years I have had the opportunity to speak \nwith Dr. Varmas, Dr. Klausner, Francis Collins, all out at the National \nInstitutes of Health, and as you listen to them talk about breakthrough \nafter breakthrough after breakthrough you cannot help but be excited \nabout what the opportunities are for further investments in medical \nresearch.\n  There is a gene known at the P-53 gene with respect to cancer. \nInterestingly enough, this gene, when it malfunctions, when it is \nmutated, has been found in somewhere between 50 percent and 80 percent \nof all cancers. It is a tumor suppressor gene and research scientists \nall across America and around the world are, in fact, trying to figure \nout the mechanism. They have indicated that in their tests in the \nlaboratory that when a P-53 gene that is not mutated is placed in with \nother cells it, in fact, stops the growth of those cells. More money \nneeds to be invested to find out whether P-53 holds a key for a cure.\n\n  What can be the benefits from more research? One of the things that \nwould happen is that we would see that the number of people that \nparticipate in clinical trials would go from 2 percent to 20 percent. \nWhat does that mean to the average person? Well, it means that some \nmother or some father or some brother, some sister, might have an \nopportunity to have drugs that are available on the market but only \nthrough a clinical trial. We would increase from 2 percent to 20 \npercent if we were to double the investment at NIH.\n  The number of grants that would be approved would jump from 25 \npercent to 40 percent. More access to state-of-the-art care, ability \nfor the research centers to attract new talent. I could go on and on.\n  The point here is this, and I will close my comments at this time, \nwith another story from that same hearing that I referred to a little \nbit earlier. There was an individual on that panel with General \nSchwarzkopf by the name of Travis Roy. Travis Roy is a young man whose \ndream it was to play ice hockey in Boston, and he succeeded. \nUnfortunately, in the first 11 seconds of a game he was hit in such a \nmanner that he is paralyzed from the neck down. He said to the Members \nat that hearing, to the panel, that his dream was to be able to hug his \nmother again someday. You know something, if we had listened to that 15 \nyears ago, our reaction, sure, we would have had the compassion and the \nconcern for that young man, but in the back of our mind we would have \nsaid, but you know there is nothing we can do about it. Well, something \ndramatically has changed in America. We no longer believe that there is \nnothing we can do about it. We have seen so much happen in the field of \nresearch that we now believe there are opportunities all across the \nboard in all different kinds of diseases for breakthroughs that will \nsave lives.\n  Today, I had the opportunity to listen to a physician by the name of \nLaSalle LaFalle, a former President of the American Cancer Society. He \nsaid, ``When I was trained, I was told that there was no cure for \nleukemia, that everyone died from leukemia. Hodgkin's disease, everyone \ndied from Hodgkin's disease.'' We know now the cure rate of leukemia is \naround 60 percent, and Hodgkin's disease is 80 percent. That is a \nresult of the investments we made in basic research. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask my distinguished colleague, Senator Mack, who \ncontrols the time, for an allocation of 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to support this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution because the results of the National \nInstitute of Health have been dramatic, really stunning. We have seen \ndramatic breakthroughs in heart disease, in breast cancer, in prostate \ncancer, in ovarian cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, new \ngenerations of AIDS drugs are reducing the presence of the AIDS virus \nin HIV-infected persons to nearly undetectable levels. With respect to \nthe variety of cancers, the death rates have begun a very, very steady \ndecline. Most recently we have made enormous progress as well in \nschizophrenia.\n  The accounts on the National Institutes of Health have risen \nconsistently over the past decade and a half. Regardless of whether the \nchairman of the subcommittee was Senator Weicker, Senator Chiles, \nSenator Harkin, or myself, a position which I now hold, we have found \nthe money for very, very substantial increases in the funding for NIH. \nLast year we had an increase of some 6.9 percent for a total of $820 \nmillion. The year before, $643 million. I commend my colleague, Senator \nMack, for his leadership in first offering a resolution early on to \ndouble NIH funding over the next 5 years, and the resolution tonight, \nto add $2 billion to NIH funding.\n\n  I suggest that we need to go a step beyond the sense-of-the-Senate \nResolution, and if I might attract the attention of the distinguished \nmanager of this bill, Senator Domenici, in supporting this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution, I wish to point out that the figures, while well \nintended, to express the views of the Senate, are not binding in terms \nof what will occur. The reality is, of course, that nothing is binding. \nThe whole budget resolution is, in a sense, the sense of the Senate. \nNow there are some parts which are protected, as Senator Domenici has \nexplained, under an agreement between the congressional leadership and \nthe President. Those, however, require the confirming by the entire \nbody, and that may not happen and they are subject to a veto if that \ndoes not happen, but in the very broad sense we express in this budget \nresolution what we would like to see done.\n  Now, at a later point in the budget resolution I will call upon my \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico to support an amendment which I \nwill offer which will add $1.1 billion to the 550 function, which \nsurprisingly has been reduced in the resolution now before the Senate. \nUnder a freeze, that figure is set at $25 billion and in the budget \nresolution it is at $24.9 billion.\n  So, notwithstanding the very impressive presentation made by my \ncolleague from Florida, he is talking about Confederate money. If we \nare to have real money in order to present this to the Appropriations \nCommittee, in a discussion I have had with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska, Senator Stevens, we are going to have to have real dollars \nput in an offset. As much as I would like to see $2 billion as \nsuggested by Senator Mack I do not know quite how to get there with an \noffset, but I think this is admirable.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that if we take four-tenths of 1 percent \nfrom discretionary nondefense, a total of some $258 billion, we will \nhave $1.1 billion. That sum of money would enable us to have an \nincrease in the NIH budget, something in the neighborhood of $950 \nmillion, which would be hard cash and something which is really very, \nvery, badly needed.\n  When we talk about the number of grants provided through NIH, we \ncurrently have some 27,000 research project grants, 878 center grants, \nnearly 15,000 training grants. But even at that, only one in four \napproved grants are funded.\n  Now, beyond NIH, we will face in this subcommittee LIHEAP, Low-Income \nEnergy Assistance. I know my distinguished colleague from New Mexico \nhas been a leader on mental illness, and he will be coming to the \nmarkup and will be making a very valid, very impassioned plea, as he \nhas done each year. If I could continue to have the attention of my \ncolleague from New Mexico,\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\neach time he as come to me as chairman--and we have had rotations as to \nwho is the chairman of which subcommittee--and each time Senator \nDomenici has come to me, I have said, ``Yes. Pete. Yes, sir.'' He is \nright. But if I am to be able to say that as chairman of the committee, \nwe are going to have to have some hard dollars. For Senator Domenici's \nrecommendation, I had a discussion with Senator Stevens, and he said, \n``I will follow Pete's lead, but we are going to have to have more than \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution.''\n  I know my distinguished colleague from New York is standing beside \nme. I want to yield the remainder of my time because I think there is \ngoing to be a very persuasive argument offered by my colleague, Senator \nD'Amato.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom New York?\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me say to my friend and colleague from \nNew York that Senator Frist was--2 minutes?\n  All right.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I will not take a long time.\n  Mr. President, let me just simply say this: I support the efforts of \nmy distinguished colleague from Florida. He has been instrumental in \nhelping to lead the way. I remember when we first appropriated money \nfrom the defense account for breast cancer research. Were it not for \nhis persuasiveness on the floor, I do not know if we would have ever \nmade that historic breakthrough. That was an amendment offered by \nSenator Harkin and myself. It was really Senator Mack who made a \ndifference in this presentation with his efforts.\n  Let me say this: We are missing the boat. We are just dreadfully \nmissing the boat. Where is our sense of priority in terms of how we do \nthe business of the people?\n  I have to tell you something. We should take money from any one of a \nnumber of sources to see to it that the NIH is properly funded. What we \nare doing today--making scavengers and beggars of the best in \nbiomedical research--is just simply wrong, whether it is for AIDS, \nwhether it is pediatric work, cancer research, breast cancer, or \nprostate cancer. Virtually every male in this Chamber is going to get \nprostate cancer if they live long enough.\n  What are we doing to ourselves and to future generations? I suggest \nthat we are mortgaging it by not coming forward and allocating \nresources. I don't care if it comes from the gasoline tax, the \ncigarette tax, or from cutting expenditures in other areas. We couldn't \ninvest money more prudently than in this kind of medical research.\n  We shouldn't be juggling funds and saying take it from diabetic \nresearch and put it into some other area. Every one of these areas \nunder NIH needs more money.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we not only pass this resolution but \nthen do the business of the people, and that we stand up and say, \n``Yes, we are going to allocate the necessary resources.'' There was a \n4.3-cent-per-gallon raise in the gas tax to help bring the deficit \ndown. You ask the American people if they wouldn't take one penny of \nthat--which is a lot of money on an annual basis, well over $1 \nbillion--and use that for medical research. You ask them whether or not \nthey would be willing to see to it that expenditures that we are making \ntoday should not be diverted to this area. And they would tell you to \nspend the money for the research so we don't have to go begging and \nturning down worthy applications because we are talking about the lives \nof our children and future generations.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  Mr. MACK. I say to the Chair that I believe the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has three amendments.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition simply to send forward \nto the desk three amendments in accordance with the pending rule.\n  I thank my colleague from Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK. I now yield 5 minutes to Senator Frist of Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \namendment before us just introduced by the Senator from Florida which \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal commitment to \nbiomedical research at the National Institutes of Health is one of the \nhighest priorities in this year's budget resolution. This amendment \nvery simply states that Congress should double the appropriations for \nthe National Institutes of Health over the next 5 years and, in the \nfiscal year 1998, increase NIH funding by $2 billion.\n  I would like to commend my colleague, the Senator from Florida, \nSenator Mack, for his leadership in bringing this amendment forward \ntoday to ensure our commitment short term and long term to biomedical \nresearch. I was an original cosponsor with Senator Mack of similar \nlegislation, Senate Resolution 15, introduced on the first day of the \n105th Congress, the Biomedical Research Commitment Resolution of 1997, \nwhich demonstrated collectively our commitment to increasing biomedical \nresearch substantially over the next 5 years.\n  I rise as a member of the Senate Budget Committee who has struggled \nwith the effort to balance the budget which we will achieve by the year \n2002 and at the same time preserve a strong role, a vital role, a \ncritical role, in biomedical research during the times of obvious \nfiscal restraint. Historically, Congress has in many ways over the \nyears demonstrated a continued strong support of increased funding for \nthe important work that we all know occurs at the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  The scientific and medical breakthroughs supported by the NIH in the \nlast 50 years have vastly improved our capacity to prevent disease, to \ndiagnose disease, and treat human disease. I contrast my status as a \nheart and lung transplant surgeon to my father, a family physician who \npracticed medicine for 50 years, when he started, he carried around \nmost of the knowledge that he needed at that time to treat somebody in \nhis head and most of his tools in a simple black bag. How far we have \ncome because of our commitment to invest in biomedical research.\n  As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I have had the opportunity to \nsee firsthand the great advances which have revolutionized the way we \nthink about disease. As Americans, we benefit every day from the \nhighest quality of health care in the world. And it is vital--it is \nvital--that we continue to invest for the long term as well as the \nshort term in our research efforts to maintain this high quality.\n  The research supported by the NIH has resulted in numerous medical \nadvances. A whole new industry in the postwar period has sprung up that \nsupports and encourages research. For the first time in this postwar \nperiod we have had mortality rates more affected by chronic disease \nthan infectious disease.\n  I want to speak, as I see the Senator from New Mexico here on the \nfloor, about the Human Genome Project and what we have seen. We are \npoised today to move into a whole new era that we couldn't have \nimagined 10 years ago where it is critical that we continue to maintain \nthat investment to see these potential cures, these new ways to make a \ndiagnosis come to fruition.\n  The Human Genome Project is an international effort, historic effort, \nwith the goal of understanding and deciphering the human genetic code. \nThe project has achieved already hugely important milestones in our \nunderstanding of the molecular basis of disease and the crucial role \nthat our genes play in how we function and how disease is caused. This \npast year we have witnessed the mapping of chromosomal locations for \ngenes related to, as referred to earlier, an inherited aspect of \nParkinson's disease as well as a hereditary form of prostate cancer, \nwhich was just mentioned by the Senator from New York. The tools of \nthis Human Genome Project have led to the isolation of a gene \nresponsible for hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron in our metabolism \ndisorder which causes multiple organ failure which we didn't understand \nhistorically.\n\n  These advances in genetics research are opening the door to our \nunderstanding of the causes of disease and giving hope to millions of \nAmericans suffering from genetic disorders. We\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\nwill see these treatments and we will see these cures for some of the \nmost devastating diseases.\n  Again, I have to recognize the Senator from New Mexico, because it is \nhe who deservedly has the title of the father of the Human Genome \nProject, for his wisdom in launching this project in the United States \nof America--the very person who has spent all day today and yesterday \nand will be tomorrow leading us into a balanced budget by the year \n2002. The Human Genome Project is a success story for Federal \ninvestment in biomedical research.\n  In closing, the Human Genome Project is just one example of the many \nsuccess stories from the National Institutes of Health. As chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, as a scientist, as \nsomeone who has seen, firsthand at the bedside, people die, and who has \nsat at the bedside of those whom we can have a cure for if we make that \ninvestment today, I stress the importance of our continued commitment \nto this investment so that we can reap these benefits.\n  In this spirit, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport passage of this amendment in recognition that the future of our \nNation's health and the future of the health of our children is \ndependent upon our strong investment in biomedical research today.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Florida for this opportunity.\n  One of my great pleasures in the Senate has been to chair the Senate \nCancer Coalition with Senator Mack, and in that capacity, we have had \nfour hearings. We have listened and heard a great deal about cancer.\n  I think, Mr. President, if you ask the American people two questions \nabout Federal spending, in two areas, and if you asked, ``How much do \nwe spend as a portion of our budget on foreign operations?'' the \nAmerican people would think it is very high. If you ask them, ``What do \nyou think we spend on research for health?'' I think they would say it \nis a great deal. In fact, it is less than one percent of our budget.\n  Today, at the NIH only 28 percent of the grant applications are \nfunded. That is down from 30 percent in 1992. We are doing less. Only \n20 percent of new grants are funded.\n  How would NIH use more funds? They would use the funds in areas that \nshow scientific promise:\n  Brain disorders: areas such as neural development, neural \ndegeneration, with emphasis on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's \ndisease.\n  New Therapies: drugs to combat cancer and AIDS; bioengineering to \nrepair damaged tissues; treatments to improve care at the end of life.\n  Genetics: better identification of inherited mutations which \ncontribute to cancer risk; better identification of environmental \nimpact of genetic mutations.\n  Now let's turn to the National Cancer Institute.\n  The National Cancer Institute in fiscal year 1997 can only fund 26 \npercent of grant applications. NCI funded 32 percent in 1992. They are \ndown in 4 years from funding 32 percent to 26 percent of grant \napplications.\n  General Norman Schwarzkopf, a prostate cancer patient, said: ``During \nthe past decade, Federal funding for cancer research has, after \nadjusting for inflation, increased only one percent.''\n  Mr. President, 7.4 million Americans have a history of cancer; 1.3 \nmillion cases will be diagnosed this year and 560,000 Americans will \ndie. But we spend one tenth of one cent of every Federal dollar on \ncancer research.\n  On May 7, NCI Director Dr. Klausner said NCI could use double its \ncurrent funding. How would NCI use additional funds? First, experts say \nthey could increase the testing and search for causes of cancer. \nSecond, more people could participate in cancer trials. We could \nincrease access of eligible adult cancer patients participating in \nclinical trials. Today, only 2 percent of eligible cancer patients can \nparticipate and we could increase that to 20 percent. NIH could \nincrease the number of cancer centers from 55 to 75. Cancer researchers \ncould improve earlier detection of cancer and expand studies of \nenvironmental risk factors for cancer, as was urged by experts at a \nrecent hearing of our Senate Cancer Coalition. NCI could monitor more \npeople to better understand the impact of treatment on cancer patients. \nToday, NCI can monitor only 10 percent of the American population with \ncancer, a sample that is too small. More monitoring can yield more \ninformation about the outcome of treatments.\n  Mr. President, NCI has identified five important new research areas \nthat could realize the large dividends that are described in NCI's \n``bypass budget.'' What is the bypass budget? The Congress requested \nthe National Cancer Institute to annually identify, in their \nprofessional judgment, their promising scientific unmet needs.\n  Here is what they are: First, Cancer genetics: Within 5 years, the \ngoal is to identify every major human gene predisposing to cancer. \nSecond, NCI could increase animal models of human cancers that would \nallow testing in animals of early detection, prevention, and treatment \nstrategies. Third, NCI could improve detection technologies, to sharpen \nthe sensitivity of technologies and smaller numbers of tumor cells. \nFourth, NCI could improve developmental diagnostics to better \nunderstand the difference in and the properties of tumors, how they \nchange, how they respond to treatment and thereby improve the \ntreatments. And fifth, NCI could increase what is called investigator-\ninitiated research by 30 percent, to capitalize on new ideas and talent \nall across the country. This would increase research conducted in \nuniversities and labs.\n  With our aging population growing, our research needs will grow. \nPeople are living longer. By the year 2000, the number of people aged \n75 to 84 will increase by one-third, to 12.3 million people. People \nover 85, the fastest growing segment of our population, will grow 70 \npercent, to 4.9 million. One-third of U.S. health care spending today \ngoes to people over age 65. These costs, left unabated, will grow \nexponentially. The rising aged population will tax Medicare, Medicaid \nand the health system overall.\n  NIH is working on research to delay the diseases and disabilities of \naging. Let me give some examples. Mr. President, 4 million Americans \ntoday have Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative disorder that can leave \npeople unable to function on their own. By delaying the onset of \nAlzheimer's for 5 years, we can save $50 billion annually.\n  Half of all people over age 65 have symptoms of arthritis. \nOsteoarthritis costs $8 billion annually. By delaying the onset by 5 \nyears, we can save $4 billion.\n  Hearing loss: 30 percent of adults age 65 to 75, and 40 percent of \nthose over 75, have some degree of hearing impairment. Delaying the \nonset by just 5 years could save $15 billion annually. What is my \npoint? Research is cost effective.\n  We need more health research because we have diseases and disorders \nfor which there is no cure.\n  AIDS has surpassed accidents as the leading killer of young adults. \nIt is now the leading cause of death among Americans age 25 to 44.\n  The prevalence of diabetes has steadily increased over the past 35 \nyears.\n\n  Just pick up Time magazine and you see that asthma rates jumped 58 \npercent, from 1982 to 1992 for children, and asthma is the leading \ncause of school absences from chronic conditions.\n  40,000 infants die each year from devastating diseases, and 20 \nmillion Americans have rare diseases for which there are few effective \ntreatments. Seven to ten percent of children are learning disabled.\n  The rate of low birth-weight among African-American children is 13 \npercent, compared to 6.2 percent for white Americans. One condition \nthat increases the risk of premature delivery is bacterial vaginosis, \nand African Americans have a higher rate.\n  So we can alleviate suffering, find treatments, cure diseases, if we \nhave the research, if we devote the resources to it. The irony is that \nmost people, 75 percent of the people in America, would pay higher \ntaxes for this kind of research.\n  I contend that increased research will reduce health care costs. Let \nme\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\ngive some examples of annual economic costs. Cancer, $104 billion \nannually; heart disease, $128 billion; Alzheimer's, $100 billion; \ndiabetes, $138 billion; mental disorders, $148 billion; stroke, $30 \nbillion. A 5-year delay in Alzheimer's--again, $50 million savings. \nSavings in delaying the onset of stroke would be $15 billion. And a \ndelay in the onset of Parkinson's disease would save $3 billion \nannually.\n  For every $1 spent on measles/mumps/rubella vaccine, $21 is saved. \nFor diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine, $29 is saved. This is \nprevention. And research can bring us prevention.\n  Hip fractures, common among the elderly, are a leading cause of \nnursing home admissions. They account for one in every 5 admissions. \nNIH research found that estrogen therapy reduces osteoporosis and hip \nfractures. In 1991, 1 year alone, the reduction in fractures in women \ntaking estrogen replacement saved $333 million in these nursing home \nadmission costs.\n  Medicaid and Medicare: 56 percent of nursing home costs are paid by \nthese programs. They total over $44 billion annually. These costs are \nrising. We all know this from our budget deficit debate. By delaying \nthe onset of chronic aging-related illnesses, spending for nursing home \ncare could be cut by $35 billion.\n  What is my point? My point is health research makes sense for many \nreasons, but we are not doing as well as we could. The scientific \ncommunity has repeatedly pointed out that we are neglecting research. \nThe Institute of Medicine has described U.S. clinical health research \nas, ``in a state of crisis.'' Without adequate support, we will see a \nserious deficiency of clinical expertise, a reduction in effective \nclinical interventions, increases in human suffering and disability, \nand increases in the costs of health care.\n  A June 1995 national survey by Research America found, as I said, \nthat 75 percent of the public would pay more for medical research. This \nis one of the reasons why Senator Mack, Senator D'Amato, Senator Reid, \nSenator Johnson and I will be proposing a tax checkoff for the IRS \nform, giving Americans the opportunity to use a checkoff to contribute \nto cancer research. This could be an effective public-private \npartnership. It is one of the reasons why we are also for a breast \ncancer stamp, which would have 1 additional cent, and that 1 cent would \ngo to breast cancer research.\n  Mr. President, 94 percent of Americans believe it is important for \nthe United States to maintain its role as a world leader in medical \nresearch. We cannot do it if health research is less than 1 percent of \nour budget. We cannot do it when good grants are turned down because \nthe funding isn't there. Only 3 cents of every health care dollar spent \nin this country is used for research--3 cents. NIH's budget is less \nthan 1 percent.\n  I made my case. Medical science is on the cutting edge of many \nimportant discoveries. It is a time when we should be nourishing \nresearch. This is not the time to backslide. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Mack-Feinstein amendment. I yield the floor and I thank the \nChair.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by my colleague from Florida, \ncalling for a doubling of our investment in biomedical research at the \nNational Institutes of Health over the next 5 years. Now, some may \nquestion why we are calling for such a significant increase in spending \nas part of a balanced budget agreement. However, I believe that our \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution is entirely consistent with the goal of \na balanced budget, because there is no investment that would yield \ngreater returns for the American taxpayer than an investment in \nbiomedical research.\n  Our nation currently spends billions of dollars each year, both \ndirectly and indirectly, to treat and care for chronic diseases. For \nexample, cardiovascular disease costs us $138 billion each year. \nAlzheimer's disease costs about $100 billion each year, primarily in \nnursing home and other long-term care costs. Strokes result in health \ncare costs of almost $30 billion annually. And Parkinson's disease \ncosts our society about $6 billion annually. We basically have two \nchoices. We can sit back and continue to pay the bills and endure the \nsuffering, or we can aggressively pursue a national strategy aimed at \npreventing, delaying, and even curing these devastating and \ndebilitating diseases and conditions.\n  While we are spending billions of dollars each year on patient care, \nas the Senator from California has pointed out, only 3 cents--3 cents \nof each health care dollar are currently invested in medical research. \nOpportunities for progress in biomedical and related health science \nresearch have never been better, but currently, we are only funding a \nfraction of the promising grant applications submitted to NIH. \nMoreover, not only are the investments in research disproportionately \nlow compared to the cost of patient care, but the potential of research \nto reduce health care costs is vastly under realized.\n  The work of Dr. Jonas Salk and his colleagues to produce a vaccine \nfor polio serves as a dramatic example of research as a high-yield \ninvestment. The lifetime costs of maintaining just two children \nstricken with polio is greater than all of the money --all of the \nmoney--ever spent on the research that virtually eliminated the \ndisease.\n  The potential for achieving even greater savings from health care \nresearch is enormous. For example, the Alliance for Aging Research has \nestimated that a 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer's disease could \ncut health care spending by much as $50 billion annually and that a 5-\nyear delay in the onset of stroke could save our Nation $15 billion a \nyear.\n  This is no time to put the brakes on research spending. Rather, we \nshould accelerate our efforts and increase our commitment to medical \nresearch that can cure, prevent or delay disease. This strategy is \nespecially important as we move into the next century when our public \nhealth and disability programs will be increasingly strained by the \naging of our population.\n  Finally, the cost of disease and disability cannot be measured in \ndollars alone. Only those who have had to care for a father or a \nhusband whose quality of life has been cut short by a stroke can \nappreciate how devastating it can be. Or think of the family whose \nmother or grandmother no longer recognizes her own children or \ngrandchildren because of Alzheimer's disease.\n  These diseases take their toll emotionally as well as financially. \nThey can dramatically and irretrievably alter the lives of the affected \nindividuals and their families, as Senator Mack has so eloquently \ntestified. Therefore, I am very pleased to be joining Senator Mack in \noffering this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join us in passing it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Florida for \nyielding.\n  I am honored to be a cosponsor on this resolution. There are so many \nthings that we vote for in the Chambers of the Senate and House, and I \noften wonder what the average person in the street would do if they \nwere faced with casting a yes-or-no vote on issues we face in the \nChamber.\n  I think I know what they would do when it comes to this resolution. \nIf we are talking about a substantial increase in medical research as a \nmajor budget priority, I think I know where the American people would \nend up on that. They would be supportive. They understand, as we do, \nwhat is at stake.\n  There have been a lot of things said in the Chamber, and I stand \nbehind the statement of the Senator from California, the Senator from \nMaine and others, and they have recounted the work that has been done \nby NIH. I will not go on to repeat all those things, the breakthroughs \nthat the National Institutes of Health has initiated. There are so many \nin the area of hip fractures, as the Senator from California said, \nbreast cancer. The No. 1 leading cancer cause of death among women is \nlung cancer from smoking, but No. 2 and very serious is breast cancer.\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\n  What is happening at the National Institutes of Health in \nbreakthrough research on bone marrow transplant is giving new hope to \nwomen who have learned that they have been diagnosed with breast \ncancer. That is something that every single husband, every father, \neveryone can identify with in a family as an important breakthrough.\n\n  Diabetes, heart disease, stroke, the list goes on and on. But I would \nlike to ask my colleagues to think about this in a different and more \npersonal context. I would daresay that in the next 12 months some \nMember of this Senate, someone sitting in the gallery, or someone \nlistening to this debate will be seated in a doctor's office or a \nhospital when a doctor walks in the room and says that either myself or \nyou or a loved one has been diagnosed with a serious illness. It takes \nyour breath away to even think that it might happen, and yet we know it \nhappens every day. You and I and everyone listening pray to God that \nthe next words out of the doctor's mouth are, ``But I have good news. \nThere is a promising new therapy. There is a new surgery. There is a \nnew medicine. We think that we can conquer this.'' And your heart \nstarts beating and you realize you have hope.\n  That is what this is all about. This is not about a budget \nresolution. This is not about numbers on a page. It is about the hope \nthat every family wants to have when faced with this threat of a \nserious illness. This investment in the National Institutes of Health \nis money well spent, not just because it can lead to new cures and lead \nto people having longer lives and less suffering, but let me mention \none other element that I do not know has been spotlighted.\n  Across America today young men and women are deciding what to do with \ntheir lives. We hope that a substantial number of them will dedicate \ntheir lives to science, to medical science, and to research. But if \nthey fear that their education is not going to lead to a position where \nthey can get involved in research, they are less likely to do so. When \nwe make a commitment to medical research at the National Institutes of \nHealth, we say to that class of young scientists, men and women, we \nhave a job waiting for you. We need you and we need your talent and we \nneed you to stick with it so that you can live through the satisfaction \nof finding a breakthrough in the field of medicine and in science.\n  So it is not just a matter of saving those who are ill. It is a \nmatter of encouraging young people to dedicate their lives to medical \nresearch. And that is why the sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by \nthe Senator from Florida is so critically important.\n  The National Institutes of Health in 1995 funded approximately 2,140 \nresearch institutions and over 18,000 investigators. And yet, if I am \nnot mistaken--and I stand to be corrected by my colleagues here--we are \nfunding about one out of four or one out of five eligible research \ngrants. In other words, there are three or four grants there that are \nvery promising in medical research that we cannot fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This resolution offered by the Senator from Florida, \nwhich I am happy to cosponsor, will provide the resources for that \nabsolutely essential research.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I rise to support the Mack amendment which recognizes the \nimportance of funds for the National Institutes of Health [NIH] \nresearch programs.\n  The investment that the American public has made in medical research \nfunded by the NIH has been the foundation of this Nation's medical \nresearch enterprise--one of the leading sectors of our economy.\n  The NIH supports research at 2,000 colleges, universities, and other \nscientific institutions, including the efforts of more than 50,000 \nresearchers and their staff throughout the country.\n  An NIH appropriations increase of 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal \nyears and a $2 billion increase by 1998 will save millions of lives.\n  In 1991, NIH launched the Women's Health Initiative, a 15-year study \nto examine hormone replacement therapy and its impact on cardiovascular \ndisease--the leading cause of death in the U.S.; dietary intervention \nin the prevention of breast and colonrectal cancer; and vitamin D and \ncalcium in the prevention of osteoporosis and colonrectal cancer.\n  Breast Cancer--the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second \nleading cancer killer of American women--affects one in eight women in \ntheir lifetimes. Federal funding for breast cancer research and \nprograms has continued to increase, but this year alone over 180,000 \nAmerican women will be diagnosed with breast cancer.\n  I want to see the death rate from more diseases drop. I want to see a \ncommitment in research funds for ovarian cancer--the silent killer--\nabout which there is so little known.\n  I want to see eradication of diseases like Scleroderma, a disease \nmost can't pronounce--but there are more cases of scleroderma than \nmultiple sclerosis or muscular dystrophy.\n  In the 25 years since the National Cancer Act was signed into law, \nthe toll taken by cancer continues to rise. In 1996, over 1.5 million \nAmericans were diagnosed with some form of cancer and over 550,000 \npeople lost their lives to cancer. This year, the numbers will continue \nto climb.\n  In 1997, approximately 131,920 Californians will be diagnosed as \nhaving cancer. This is the equivalent of almost 15 new cases every hour \nof every day. Approximately, 53,610 Californians will die from cancer.\n  Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men and has \nbecome the most common cancer in California. (American Cancer Society, \n1997 California Cancer Facts and Figures). Based on current U.S. rates, \nabout 19 of every 100 men born today will be diagnosed with prostate \ncancer during their lifetime, while approximately 4 of every 100 men \nwill die from this disease.\n  In 1997, approximately 24,000 Californians will be diagnosed with \nprostate cancer and an estimated 3,500 deaths will occur.\n  More funding for cancer research will make a difference. While there \nis no shortage of good research ideas in the cancer field overall, the \nchances for funding these research opportunities keeps getting worse.\n  The overall percentage of approved but unfunded investigator-\ninitiated grants steadily increased from 40 percent in the 1970's to 85 \npercent in 1995. This trend needs to be reversed.\n  This amendment is a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment and make sure that appropriate levels of \nfunding are invested in research which saves lives.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gorton \nand Senator Hutchison of Texas be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. If I could just make a couple of brief comments and then we \nwill be through.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. MACK. As I listened to the discussion, and most of you heard me \ngo through some of my experiences, I will never forget the moment that \nmy wife told me she had discovered a lump in her breast and the doctor \nhad told her that she had cancer. The sense of terror that gripped both \nof us, the sense of fear that we experienced--and I must say to you, \nthere were a lot of selfish feelings going on inside me. I thought that \nI was going to lose my wife, that she would die of cancer. That is the \nreaction most people have when they are told they have cancer. I \nthought I was going to lose her. And so I wonder to myself, knowing \nwhat we know today, the breakthroughs that have already taken place in \nresearch, what keeps us from doubling the investment at NIH? Why will \npeople accept the notion that we cannot do more?\n  I just cannot comprehend that. And so I would ask my colleagues \ntonight to support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, recognizing \nthat it is only the first step in a long, hard fight to find the \ndollars to double the investment in the National Institutes of Health.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, do I understand we are finished with the \ndebate except Senator Kennedy?\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\n  Mr. MACK. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Mack for introducing \nthis amendment. He has consistently fought for the increases at NIH \nover a long period of time. This makes eminent sense for the reasons he \nand others have outlined. I hope that his amendment will be accepted \nand that we could move ahead on this extraordinary opportunity to \nsupport breakthroughs in health care, in so many different areas \naffecting so many different families in America. He deserves great \ncredit, and I am proud and privileged to cosponsor the amendment.\n  Our amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \ncommitment to the National Institutes of Health should be doubled over \nthe next 5 years, increasing the current NIH budget of $13 billion to \n$26 billion by the year 2002.\n  This increase is critical to fulfilling our hope for healthy lives \nfor all Americans. Every family is touched by the scourge of disease. \nThis amendment will be a step toward reducing that burden. It is vital \nto maintaining the investment we've already made and to moving forward \nto improve the health of the American people. It can also be a key \nstrategy in our efforts to save Medicare.\n  NIH began in 1887 as a one-room Laboratory of Hygiene. It has grown \nin the past century into the premier biomedical research facility in \nthe world, for the benefit of literally billions of citizens in this \ncountry and of many other lands.\n  In the 1950's, NIH research found that fluoridated drinking water \ncould prevent dental cavities in children. In the 1960's, NIH \nscientists helped crack the genetic code, beginning the studies that \nwould lead to recombinant DNA technology and gene therapy. In the \n1970's, NIH-sponsored research began to unravel the mysteries of the \ngenetic origin of cancer.\n  The promise of new medical research is boundless. As impressive as \nthe progress of the past has been, it pales in comparison to the \nopportunities for the future. We stand on the threshold of stunning \nadvances in medicine through deeper understanding of the fundamental \nmechanisms of the cell, through mapping of human genes, through \nbiotechnology, and through a host of advances that are already on the \nhorizon.\n  But instead of moving toward that horizon, we are in danger of \nstanding still. The proportion of worthwhile projects that NIH is able \nto fund has declined steadily over the past 15 years. Today, they can \nfund only about one in four such projects. That means, for example, \nthat in 1996 the NIH had to turn away about 18,000 applications.\n  Every unfunded application represents a missed opportunity. As \nfunding sources dry up, the best young minds are discouraged from \nentering the field of biomedical research. The situation is growing \ndire. In 1994, the National Academy of Sciences warned that we have too \nfew clinical investigators to conduct the research that is most needed.\n  In recent years, medical research has changed the world we live in, \nrevising much of what we know about life, about diseases afflicting \ncitizens of all ages. It has led to a breathtaking array of new \ntechnologies and therapies which have improved the health of Americans \nof all ages and walks of life.\n  From vaccines against childhood diseases, to treatments for spinal \ncord injury, from chemotherapy for cancer to medication for mental \nillness, medical research is improving the lives, and health of people \neverywhere.\n  Since we began to immunize small children with the Hib vaccine, which \nwas developed by NIH scientists in the 1970's and 1980's, cases of \ndeadly spinal meningitis have dropped by more than 98 percent. Diseases \nlike mumps, whooping cough, and chickenpox, all common in the past, \nhave dropped to their lowest levels in history. We are on the verge of \neradicating polio from the world.\n  Spinal cord injury affects thousands of Americans, often striking in \nthe prime of active lives. A recent NIH study found that a new drug, \ngiven within 8 hours of the injury, improves recovery by 20 percent, \nand gives patients greater independence and better health.\n  Chemotherapy for testicular cancer, the most common form of cancer in \nmen aged 15 to 35, can bring a cure rate of 60 to 65 percent.\n  Researchers have identified genes linked to certain forms of breast \ncancer, and have developed new treatments for colon cancer. Improved \ndetection and treatment methods like these have increased the 5-year \nsurvival rate for cancer victims to 52 percent. The gain since the \n1960's represents over 80,000 additional cancer survivors each year.\n  For the first time, we have effective prescription drug treatments \nfor series mental health conditions, such as major depression, bipolar \ndisorder, and schizophrenia. Many of these medications were developed \nby NIH-supported research.\n  We are also making progress against other intractable and \ndebilitating diseases. Diabetes affects more than 16 million Americans. \nRecent research has improved treatment and offers the possibility of a \ncure.\n  Research on heart disease has made important advances. Since 1971, \ndeaths from heart disease have dropped by 41 percent. NIH-funded \nresearch showed that one aspirin a day can reduce early mortality from \nheart attacks by 23 percent, and reduce subsequent nonfatal heart \nattacks by almost 50 percent.\n  Estrogen therapy in women has been shown to have a wide range of \nbenefits, including reduced heart disease, osteoporosis, and \nAlzheimer's disease.\n  Dramatic progress is taking place in the treatment of stroke, which \naffects 3 million Americans each year. Victims who receive a new clot-\ndissolving drug in the first hours after a stroke recover more fully \nand more quickly than other patients. Half of the patients receiving \nthis treatment recover completely. Other advances have reduced death \nfrom stroke by 59 percent since 1971.\n  Parkinson's disease affects more than half a million Americans. \nDoctors can now identify the area of the brain causing the tremor, and \ndestroy it with a procedure that has been successful in over a thousand \npatients. Patients require fewer physician visits and less medication. \nThe treatment reduces the number of falls leading to hip fracture and \nthe need for hospitalization, nursing homes, and physical therapy.\n  Recent research on Alzheimer's disease suggests that preventing \nsmall, silent strokes can help those at risk delay the onset of the \ndisease.\n  Research on the cutting edge of molecular biology, immunology, and \nneuroscience are making advances. In the early 1980's, AIDS was \nvirtually untreatable. Today, new drugs are maintaining health in \npeople with HIV for longer and longer periods.\n  Biomedical research is cost-effective. Research costs for the Hib \nvaccine were about $30 million. Today, the vaccine saves $70 to $150 \nmillion a year in direct medical costs. The spinal cord injury study \ncost very little. If the medication comes into widespread use, the \npotential savings are in the billions of dollars. Estrogen therapy \ncosts less than a dollar a day; cost savings in money and human \nsuffering are huge.\n  We all know that Medicare is one of the most successful social \nprograms ever enacted, but it is threatened today by demographic \nchanges and the retirement of the baby boomers that lie ahead. Rather \nthan saving the program by raised premiums of cutting reimbursements, \nthere may be a better way.\n  A Duke University study earlier this year suggests that a small \nimprovement in the disability rate among older Americans can bring \nlarge cost savings for Medicare. The decline in disability that is \nalready occurring is attributable to research on the diseases of aging. \nIf we take sensible steps to fix Medicare for the short-term, the most \neffective way to keep it solvent for the long term may well be to \nmaintain and strengthen the existing trend toward better health for \nolder Americans. The key step in that strategy is support for medical \nresearch.\n  Continued and expanding investment in such research will also provide \nbenefits to the larger economy. As advances move from the laboratory \ninto the commercial sector, new businesses and jobs will follow.\n  A recent study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found \nthat the licensing of university inventions--including biomedical \ntechnologies--adds $21 billion to the economy and supports 200,000 jobs \neach year.\n  Doubling the NIH budget will build on this progress and help to \nensure\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\nthat its potential is achieved. It will provide funds to strengthen the \nresearch community, encouraging the best, and brightest of America's \ncollege graduates to make their careers in scientific research. This \nincreased support will be tangible evidence of Congress' commitment to \nthe health of all Americans.\n  Some will ask if we can afford to double the NIH budget. I would turn \nthe question around to ask if we can afford not to do so. President \nCharles Vest, of M.I.T. has written, ``Modern medicine is born of \nscientific research and delivered by advanced technology. Its human \nbenefits can be realized only through the wise and caring public policy \nof a nation willing to invest in the future.'' If we can't afford to do \nthis, we can't afford the future. The fundamental issue is priorities, \nand I urge the Senate to give its strong support to this bipartisan \nproposal.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Mack's \namendment to double the research budget of the National Institutes of \nHealth over the next 5 years and to add $2 billion to NIH funding now \nfor fiscal year 1998. I want to thank the Senator for bringing this \namendment to the floor today and this issue to the attention of our \ncolleagues.\n  This level of funding is critical. It's clearly needed if we're going \nto tackle the serious medical problems that America faces--including \ncancer, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, AIDS, and the need for additional \ninformation about the special medical needs of children.\n  Research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health has a proven \ntrack record that has touched the lives of many Americans. The broad \nscope of its achievements is truly impressive. It includes the \ndevelopment of new treatments for disease; identification of genetic \nmutations for a varied set of diseases; identification of genetic \nmutations for a varied set of diseases; and contributions to the \ndevelopment of new scanning technologies. These spectacular advances in \nhealth could not have been achieved but for the commitment of Federal \ndollars we make to the NIH.\n  And let us be clear on this. The returns on the public investment in \nbiomedical research have been impressive. Not only have we won Nobel \nprizes and built on decades of basic research, we have contributed to \nour national economic growth. Our investments have given life to \nAmerica's biotechnology industry. Some have estimated that revenues in \nthis industry will approach $50 billion annually by the year 2000 and \ncreate as many as 500,000 new jobs.\n  I am supporting this effort because I believe it reflects a \ncommitment to substantially strengthen our priorities toward biomedical \nresearch. We cannot rest on our laurels. We must work to improve the \nhealth of our citizens. I also want to make a personal commitment to \nwork with my colleagues there in Congress and with the NIH to make \nadvantage of the important opportunity this amendment presents to \nadvance research that benefits all of us--and especially, all of our \nchildren.\n  Let me highlight just one example of the type of activity that \nadditional NIH research could support. Children under the age of 21 \nrepresent 30 percent of the population--and yet the NIH devotes only \nsomewhere between 5 and 14 percent of its budget to their needs. Just \nas there has been a recognition in recent years that women and \nminorities have been neglected in research efforts nationwide, there's \na growing consensus that children deserve more attention than they are \ngetting.\n  Children are not small adults. They go through different \ndevelopmental stages, they metabolize drugs differently, and they \nrespond to illnesses and treatments differently. Children's health \nneeds are not only different--they're often ignored by the private \nsector.\n  Federal funding for research--especially medical research--is a \nfundamental responsibility of Government. Today, the Senate must \nacknowledge that responsibility and act to enhance the ability of NIH \nto improve the health of all Americans.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nDomenici, Senator Gramm, and Senator Thurmond as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. MACK. Yes, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wanted to just alert the Senate, we \nwere not quite sure when this vote was going to occur, and I have just \nspoken to our leadership office and they would like to give Senators a \nlittle bit of time to get in here. So I wonder if we could start this \nvote at a quarter of.\n  Mr. President, I think what we will do, I have a couple of comments, \nand then I think what we will do is go ahead and have the up-or-down \nvote and just keep it open for 20 minutes or more, and that will give \nSenators who are en route a chance to get here. I think that will be \nall right.\n  Mr. President, I compliment Senator Mack on the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, but I would be remiss if I did not congratulate the \nCongress on what it has already done for the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  Yes, we should do more. But last year we gave the National Institutes \nof Health a 7 percent increase. This year, if all goes as planned, they \nwill get a 3\\1/2\\ percent increase.\n  Now, the National Institutes of Health this year under the new plan \nwill be a $13.1 billion enterprise, so it is not like we are not doing \nsomething significant. And while I believe that a sense-of-the-Senate \nsaying we should do more, if we can, makes good sense, let me suggest \nthat the greatest health science in the world is going on at the \nNational Institutes Of health of the United States, the biggest \nbreakthroughs are being made there along with the business investment, \npharmaceutical investment in America. We are truly at the cutting edge \nof some very significant wellness events.\n  Sometime when I have time in the Chamber, we will talk a little more \nabout how the Human Genome Project got started, for it is an \ninteresting kind of story. I do not intend to do it tonight. It is one \nof the greatest programs we have going, and I thank Senator Frist for \nmentioning my name in conjunction with its inception. I had a bit to do \nwith that.\n  Now, if we had any time in opposition, we yield it back.\n  Has the Senator asked for the yeas and nays? The yeas and nays have \nbeen requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. There was \na sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 315 offered by the \nSenator from Florida. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. \nGregg] and the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina [Mr. Helms] would each vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Feinstein, and others. I believe the amendment is a \ngood amendment. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment regarding the \nelderly disabled and the SSI program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mrs. \n     Feinstein, for herself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. DeWine and Mr. \n     Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 341.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CERTAIN ELDERLY LEGAL \n                   ALIENS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that:\n       (1) the Committee on Finance will include in its \n     recommendations to the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     changes in laws within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     Finance that allow certain elderly, legal immigrants who will \n     cease to receive benefits under the supplemental security \n     income program as a result of the Personal Responsibility and \n     Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-\n     193; 110 stat. 2105) to continue to receive benefits during a \n     redetermination or reapplication period to determine if such \n     aliens would qualify for such benefits on the basis of being \n     disabled.\n       (2) the Committee on Finance in developing these \n     recommendations should offset the additional cost of this \n     proposal out of other programs within the jurisdiction of \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Domenici, \nLautenberg, Boxer, Chafee, DeWine, D'Amato, and Kennedy am offering the \nsense of the Senate that would require the Finance Committee to allow \nelderly legal immigrants to continue receiving SSI during their \nredetermination period. Under the current budget agreement, all elderly \nwould be cut off of SSI as of October 1, 1997.\n  I want to acknowledge the leadership of the bill managers on both \nsides for their recognition of the devastating impact this budget \nagreement has on over 400,000 elderly legal immigrants, and encouraging \nthe Senate to provide an important interim provision.\n  While I support the budget resolution's broad budget balancing \nframework, I have expressed over and over again, my deep concerns over \nits failure to restore SSI for over 400,000 elderly legal immigrants, \n30 percent of which are over the age of 75 and who will be cut off from \nSSI as of October 1, 1997.\n  The current budget agreement, falls short of what is needed to keep \nthe elderly immigrants from losing their life supporting benefits.\n  The Budget Agreement provides:\n  SSI benefits for disabled legal immigrants who are disabled and were \nin the country as of August 22, 1996.\n  SSI benefits for those who became disabled and got on the rolls \nbetween August 22, 1996 to June 1, 1997.\n  The budget agreement bans:\n  SSI for most elderly legal immigrants, even those elderly immigrants \nwho rely on SSI for survival.\n  Food Stamps for most legal immigrants.\n  Although restoring SSI for the disabled is an important first step to \na major flaw in the Welfare Reform bill passed by Congress last year, \nthe elderly legal immigrants who depend on SSI will still lose their \nbenefits under the agreement.\n  Under the current agreement, an 83-year-old woman with no family, who \nspeaks little or no English, will be just as homeless as one who is \ndisabled when she loses her SSI benefits. What is she supposed to do, \nget a job?\n  Under Welfare Reform, approximately 725,000 elderly, blind, and \ndisabled legal immigrants could lose SSI benefits on August 22 of this \nyear. Under the budget agreement: 42.5 percent or 307,630 disabled \nlegal immigrants who were receiving SSI as of the date of enactment of \nthe Welfare Bill would continue receiving SSI. However, for 417,360 or \n57.5 percent of elderly legal immigrants who are currently receiving \nSSI would be cut off as of October 1, 1997.\n  The President estimates that 66 percent of the elderly legal \nimmigrants who will be cut off from SSI initially could be recertified \nunder the disabled category.\n  However, due to what I believe is an unintended mistake, even those \nelderly legal immigrants who are also disabled would be cut off from \nSSI on October 1, 1997. The elderly would become eligible for SSI only \nif they requalify after the cutoff.\n\n  CBO estimates that it would take 6 months or longer to rectify all \nthe elderly legal immigrants currently on the rolls. During the \nrecertification period, no elderly legal immigrant would be receiving \nSSI. How will they survive for 6 months? They will mostly become \nhomeless or fall onto County General Assistance rolls.\n  The impact of the SSI ban for elderly legal immigrants will be \ndevastating and immediate, especially in the high immigrant States.\n  In California, 163,900 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  In New York, 65,340 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  In Texas, 32,640 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  In Florida, 44,310 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  In Illinois, 13,360 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  In Massachusetts, 13,410 elderly legal immigrants may lose their SSI.\n  Come October 1, 1997, we will see hundreds of thousands of elderly \nlegal immigrants, of which 30 percent are over 75 years old, and who \nmay also be disabled, thrown out into the streets and homeless.\n  Under the Budget Agreement, 137,728 or 34 percent of elderly legal \nimmigrants nationwide will lose their SSI permanently because they will \nnot be able to qualify as disabled; 55,726 elderly legal immigrants in \nCalifornia will lose their SSI; 22,215 elderly legal immigrants in New \nYork will lose their SSI; 11,076 elderly legal immigrants in Texas will \nlose their SSI; 15,065 elderly legal immigrants in Florida will lose \ntheir SSI; 4,542 elderly legal immigrants in Illinois will lose their \nSSI; and 4,425 elderly legal immigrants in Massachusetts will lose \ntheir SSI.\n  The alternatives for these elderly legal immigrants are bleak--if \nthey do not have family who can care for them, they either end up in a \nhomeless shelter or end up on County General Assistance rolls.\n  Senator John Chafee and I have previously introduced a bill that \nwould restore SSI benefits to all elderly, blind or disabled legal \nimmigrants who were receiving SSI prior to the passage of the welfare \nreform bill. We propose that no current recipient should be thrown off \nfrom their SSI benefits. We agree that for those coming into the \ncountry after the enactment date, we ban SSI and require instead, the \nsponsors to be responsible for their family members.\n  I believe that this is a responsible action that must be taken by \nCongress to correct a serious flaw in the welfare bill.\n  Allowing the elderly to continue receiving their SSI until they can \nbe recertified is the first step but not the final solution. The final \nsolution is to provide for all elderly and disabled legal immigrants \nwho were on SSI as of August 22, 1996, to continue receiving their SSI.\n  As we go forward in the budget reconciliation process and final \npassage of the fiscal year 1998 budget, I urge my\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\ncolleagues to support the Chafee-Feinstein provision that protects the \nelderly legal immigrants who were getting SSI at the date of enactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an SSA table be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n    TABLE 3.--NUMBER OF ALIENS RECEIVING SSI PAYMENTS BY ELIGIBILITY\n                    CATEGORY AND STATE, DECEMBER 1996\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 State                     Total       Aged     Disabled\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total............................    724,990    417,360    307,630\n                                        --------------------------------\nAlabama................................        480        370        110\nAlaska.................................        750        390        360\nArizona................................      7,650      3,900      3,750\nArkansas...............................        340        190        150\nCalifornia.............................    293,180    163,900    129,280\nColorado...............................      5,140      2,740      2,400\nConnecticut............................      4,370      2,700      1,670\nDelaware...............................        330        200        130\nDistrict of Columbia...................        860        530        330\nFlorida................................     69,710     44,310     25,400\nGeorgia................................      4,570      3,930      1,640\nHawaii.................................      3,770      2,850        920\nIdaho..................................        410        220        190\nIllinois...............................     23,980     13,360      9,620\nIndiana................................      1,080        730        350\nIowa...................................      1,170        600        570\nKansas.................................      1,500        700        800\nKentucky...............................        720        380        340\nLouisiana..............................      2,500      1,430       1070\nMaine..................................        540        200        340\nMaryland...............................      7,800      5,970      1,830\nMassachusetts..........................     23,980     13,410     10,570\nMichigan...............................      7,350      4,060      3,290\nMinnesota..............................      6,640      2,340      4,300\nMississippi............................        440        230        220\nMissouri...............................      1,900      1,030        770\nMontana................................        150      (\\1\\)      (\\1\\)\nNebraska...............................        720        340        380\nNevada.................................      2,370      1,590        780\nNew Hampshire..........................        350        200        150\nNew Jersey.............................     22,140     14,580      7,560\nNew Mexico.............................      3,350      1,530      1,820\nNew York...............................    113,900     65,340     48,560\nNorth Carolina.........................      2,600      1,590      1,010\nNorth Dakota...........................        180      (\\1\\)      (\\1\\)\nOhio...................................      5,340      3,380      1,960\nOklahoma...............................      1,340        880        460\nOregon.................................      4,260      2,200      2,060\nPennsylvania...........................     11,340      6,470      4,870\nRhode Island...........................      3,440      1,700      1,740\nSouth Carolina.........................        580        420        160\nSouth Dakota...........................        200      (\\1\\)      (\\1\\)\nTennessee..............................      1,380        850        530\nTexas..................................     54,760     32,640     22,120\nUtah...................................      1,420        700        720\nVermont................................        150      (\\1\\)      (\\1\\)\nVirginia...............................      6,780      5,150      1,630\nWashington.............................     13,160      5,920      7,240\nWest Virginia..........................        190      (\\1\\)      (\\1\\)\nWisconsin..............................      4,790      1,800      2,990\nWyoming................................

Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member of the Budget Committee for their help on this \namendment.\n  The amendment before the Senate addresses the treatment of poor, \nelderly legal immigrants who are dependent on SSI benefits. SSI is a \nFederal program that provides cash assistance to those who are either \nelderly or disabled, and of very low income.\n  Pursuant to last year's welfare law, legal immigrants may no longer \nreceive SSI benefits. Those who were receiving SSI on the date the law \nwas enacted therefore are scheduled to lose that assistance beginning \non August 1 of this year, although thanks to an amendment I offered \nwith Senator D'Amato and others to the disaster relief bill, that \ncutoff date likely will be pushed back to October 1.\n  In my view, the welfare law's SSI restrictions were not only harsh, \nbut unfair, particularly to those elderly or disabled legal immigrants \nwho were relying on those critical benefits at the time. It seems an \nincreasing number of Senators and Representatives agree. Therefore, \nthis year Congress is considering proposals to revise the legal \nimmigrant SSI restrictions.\n  The particular proposal suggested by the budget resolution addresses \nimmigrants' plight by exempting from the SSI ban those who are disabled \nand who were in the country when the bill was signed. While that is an \nimportant step toward fairness, it would mean that legal immigrants who \nare elderly, but not disabled, would be left out, and would lose their \nSSI benefits.\n  If this proposal were enacted, the Social Security Administration \nwould need to re-evaluate all the elderly SSI recipients to determine \nhow many would requalify as disabled. That process would take perhaps 6 \nmonths. The question then would become the fate of these elderly \nrecipients during the redetermination time. Would they be dropped from \nthe program during those six months, and then be reinstated later if \nthey requalified? Or would they be allowed to continue on the program \nuntil it was clear whether or not they would requalify?\n  Senators Feinstein, D'Amato, DeWine, and I believe that in that \nsituation, it makes absolutely no sense to kick elderly recipients off \nof SSI during the redetermination period, only to reinstate many of \nthem at a later date. However, as written, the budget resolution is \nsilent on this point. Therefore, we worked with Senator Domenici to \nclarify this issue. The amendment before us would ensure that elderly \nrecipients would be allowed to continue to receive this critical SSI \nassistance during the time it would take to redetermine their status.\n  This clarification makes sure that should the proposal in the budget \nresolution be enacted, elderly legal immigrants will be treated with \ncompassion and not subjected to the sudden and perhaps unwarranted loss \nof basic assistance.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that the proposal suggested by the \nbudget resolution is an important one, but it is just one of the many \nthat the Finance Committee may consider during the upcoming \nreconciliation process. As I mentioned, I believe that the budget \nresolution approach, as clarified by our amendment, goes a long way \ntoward restoring fairness for vulnerable legal immigrants who were in \nthe country and playing by the rules when the welfare law was enacted. \nBut I must say that I am sorely disappointed that the budget resolution \nproposal leaves elderly legal immigrants--those who by definition have \nno other source of income and are too old and frail to work--out in the \ncold. To my view, then, the budget resolution proposal therefore \naddresses only part of the problem, and I intend to work with my \ncolleagues here and in the Finance Committee toward a more \ncomprehensive solution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment \nand commend my colleagues for bringing this important issue before the \nSenate.\n  We have discovered an unintended gap in the budget agreement with \nregard to SSI coverage for disabled immigrants. If this budget \nagreement is adopted, elderly immigrants dependent on SSI assistance \nwho are also disabled will continue to receive that assistance. \nHowever, the Social Security Administration states that it may take 6 \nmonths for the agency to review the current SSI caseload and make that \ndetermination. In the meantime, many elderly immigrants will lose their \nassistance, only to requalify later on the basis of their disability.\n  Clearly, this was not intended under the budget agreement, and I \ncommend Senator Domenici, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Chafee, Senator \nFeinstein, and my other colleagues for their commitment to resolve this \nproblem and cover this gap.\n  I also join many of my colleagues in expressing my hope that more can \nbe done. As we proceed with legislation to implement this agreement, I \nhope that we can find ways to ensure that immigrants who fall on hard \ntimes and have no sponsors to fall back on can still get help. I am \nparticularly concerned about elderly immigrants and immigrant children.\n  So I commend my colleagues for their leaderhip in bringing this \namendment before the Senate. We have made progress in restoring \nassistance to immigrants under this budget agreement, and I look \nforward to working with them on this important issue in the days ahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have no objection here, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nWithout objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 341) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 342\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding retroactive \n                                 taxes)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING RETROACTIVE TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in general, the practice of increasing a tax \n     retroactively is fundamentally unfair to taxpayers;\n       (2) retroactive taxation is disruptive to families and \n     small business in their ability to plan and budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this budget resolution assume that--\n       (1) except for closing tax loopholes, no revenues should be \n     generated from any retroactively increased tax; and\n       (2) the Congress and the President should work together to \n     ensure that any revenue generating proposal contained within \n     reconciliation legislation pursuant to this concurrent \n     resolution proposal, except those proposals closing tax \n     loopholes, should take effect prospectively.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a sense of the \nSenate amendment to the concurrent budget resolution before us that \nsets our nation on the path to budgetary balance. This amendment \naddresses a practice that I believe is one of the most reprehensible \nburdens government can place on its taxpayers, retroactive taxation.\n  My conviction for putting a stop to retroactive taxation dates back \nto just months after I began my service representing Georgia in the \nUnited States Senate and occurred as a result of one of the most \negregious examples of retroactive taxation in our history. I am \nspeaking of the retroactive tax rate increases enacted as part of the \nAdministration's 1993 tax package whose passage in the Senate required \nthe Vice President to cast the deciding vote.\n  At the time, estimates of the price tag to taxpayers of these \nretroactive tax increases were over $10 billion! In other words, with \nmore than two-thirds of the year having been gone, the federal \ngovernment effectively told the American people, ``All your planning \nwas for naught, and we don't care.''\n  To bring an end to this practice, I introduced legislation in the \n103rd Congress, the 104th Congress, and now in the 105th Congress. This \nis not an issue which I intend to drop, and I'll tell my colleagues \nwhy.\n  Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to share with you the \nstory of Mrs. Joanne Dixon, a retired farmer from Girard, Georgia, who \nsuffered personally from the 1993 retroactive tax increases. In her \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, \nFederalism, and Property Rights, she described herself and her family \nas a simple farming family that, like many of their neighbors, farmed \ntheir land, attended church, contributed to their community and paid \ntheir taxes. They were proud to be farmers and still believe it to be a \ngood life.\n  Tragically, in February of 1993, her husband suffered a life-\nthreatening illness brought on by the rigors of running a farm, which \nthey had done together for 38 years. In light of the circumstances, it \nsoon became clear they would have to leave farming and auction off \neverything they had worked for all their lives. In her testimony Mrs. \nDixon said, ``I could never put our feelings into words to adequately \nexpress what we went through. I will never forget the day of the \nauction itself. Looking back, I don't know how we stood it, but we \nmanaged.''\n  After living with a very painful decision, the Dixons dutifully paid \ntheir taxes. Imagine if you would, Mr. President, their surprise when \nthey learned they owed still more in federal taxes because of the 1993 \nretroactive increases.\n\n  Let me again refer to Mrs. Dixon's own words, ``The amount of money \nitself was not a large amount, but we still had to pay the retroactive \ntax out of funds we had planned for retirement. However, for me that is \nnot the issue. After what we had been through to know that the federal \ngovernment can tax you simply because it chooses was a real shock. \nFurthermore, our situation also left us with no way to recover the \nmoney we had to pay in this additional retroactive tax. We were out of \nbusiness. The retroactive tax was a shameful tax.''\n  Mr. President, it was clear to Thomas Jefferson that the only way to \npreserve freedom was to protect its citizen from oppressive taxation. I \nbelieve he would agree that the retroactive imposition of massive taxes \nis the ultimate slap in the face of the American citizen. Even the \nRussian Constitution does not allow you to tax retroactively.\n  American families, businesses, and communities must know what the \nrules of the road are and that those rules will not change. They have \nto be able to plan their lives, plan for their families, and plan their \ntax burdens in advance.\n  We have before us an historic opportunity to bring the Federal budget \ninto balance. This is a goal I have worked long and hard to achieve \nsince coming to the Senate. In the march to a balanced Federal budget, \nI believe we need to do so in a way that is fair to American families \nand small businesses.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection here, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nWithout objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 342) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FAMILY VIOLENCE OPTION \n                   CLARIFYING AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Domestic violence is the leading cause of physical \n     injury to women. The Department of Justice estimates that \n     over 1,000,000 violent crimes against women are committed by \n     intimate partners annually.\n       (2) Domestic violence dramatically affects the victim's \n     ability to participate in the workforce. A University of \n     Minnesota survey reported that \\1/4\\ of battered women \n     surveyed had lost a job partly because of being abused and \n     that over \\1/2\\ of these women had been harassed by their \n     abuser at work.\n       (3) Domestic violence is often intensified as women seek to \n     gain economic independence through attending school or \n     training programs. Batterers have been reported to prevent \n     women from attending these programs or sabotage their efforts \n     at self-improvement.\n       (4) Nationwide surveys of service providers prepared by the \n     Taylor Institute of Chicago, Illinois, document, for the \n     first time, the interrelationship between domestic violence \n     and welfare by showing that from 34 percent to 65 percent of \n     AFDC recipients are current or past victims of domestic \n     violence.\n       (5) Over \\1/2\\ of the women surveyed stayed with their \n     batterers because they lacked the resources to support \n     themselves and their children. The surveys also found that \n     the availability of economic support is a critical factor in \n     poor women's ability to leave abusive situations that \n     threaten them and their children.\n       (6) The restructuring of the welfare programs may impact \n     the availability of the economic support and the safety net \n     necessary to enable poor women to flee abuse without risking \n     homelessness and starvation for their families.\n       (7) In recognition of this finding, the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate in considering the 1997 Resolution on \n     the budget of the United States unanimously adopted a sense \n     of the Congress amendment concerning domestic violence and \n     Federal assistance. Subsequently, Congress adopted the family \n     violence option amendment as part of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996.\n       (8) The family violence option gives States the flexibility \n     to grant temporary waivers from time limits and work \n     requirements for domestic violence victims who would suffer \n     extreme hardship from the application of these provisions. \n     These waivers were not intended to be included as part of the \n     permanent 20 percent hardship exemption.\n       (9) The Department of Health and Human Services has been \n     slow to issue regulations regarding the provision. As a \n     result, States are hesitant to fully implement the family \n     violence option fearing that it will interfere with the 20 \n     percent hardship exemption.\n       (10) Currently 15 States have opted to include the family \n     violence option in their welfare plans, and 13 other States \n     have included some type of domestic violence provisions in \n     their plans.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the provisions of this \n     Resolution assume that--\n       (1) States should not be subject to any numerical limits in \n     granting domestic violence good cause waivers under section \n     402(a)(7)(A)(iii) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     602(a)(7)(A)(iii)) to individuals receiving assistance, for \n     all requirements where compliance with such requirements \n     would make it more difficult for individuals receiving \n     assistance to escape domestic violence; and\n       (2) any individual who is granted a domestic violence good \n     cause waiver by a State shall not be included in the States' \n     20 percent hardship exemption under section 408(a)(7) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 608(a)(7)).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN \n                   PREVENTION OF DRUG USE BY CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) 2,000,000 more children are using drugs in 1997 than \n     were doing so in 1993. For the first time in the 1990's, over \n     half of our Nation's graduating high school seniors have \n     experimented with drugs and approximately 1 out of every 4 of \n     the students have used drugs in the past month.\n       (2) After 11 years of declining marijuana use among \n     children aged 12 to 17, such use doubled between 1992 and \n     1995. The number of 8th graders who have used marijuana in \n     the past month has more than tripled since 1991.\n       (3) More of our Nation's school children are becoming \n     involved with hard core drugs at earlier ages, as use of \n     heroin and cocaine by 8th graders has more than doubled since \n     1991.\n       (4) Substance abuse is at the core of other problems, such \n     as rising violent teenage and violent gang crime, increasing \n     health care costs, HIV infections, teenage pregnancy, high \n     school dropouts, and lower economic productivity.\n       (5) Increases in substance abuse among youth are due in \n     large part to an erosion of understanding by youth of the \n     high risks associated with substance abuse, and to the \n     softening of peer norms against use.\n       (6) Nearly 1 in every 10 students who received a diploma \n     last June is a daily user of illicit drugs.\n       (7) A 1995-96 school year survey of drug usage by students \n     revealed that 25 percent of children using drugs are doing so \n     at home or at the home of a friend. Despite these alarming \n     statistics, less than 30 percent of students stated that \n     their parents talked to them about the problem of alcohol and \n     drugs.\n       (8) In the 1990-91 school year survey, over 40 percent of \n     the students reported that their parent regularly talked to \n     them about drugs. The 1995-96 survey reported an 11 percent \n     decrease in parental involvement and a corresponding 10 \n     percent increase in the number of students in the 6th through \n     8th grades, who use drugs, and a 17 percent increase in the \n     number of students in the 9th through 12th grades who use \n     drugs.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the provisions of this resolution assume that, from resources \n     available in this budget resolution, a portion should be set \n     aside for a national grassroots volunteer effort to encourage \n     parental education and involvement in youth drug prevention \n     and to create a drug-intolerant culture for our children.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, recently the Senate has made strong \nstatements promoting efforts to fight against teenage drug use. \nPrograms to mobilize America's parents are desperately needed in these \nefforts as we struggle to deal with a rising epidemic of teenage drug \nuse.\n  Survey after survey has shown a shocking rise in teenage drug use. \nSince 1992, drug use among teens has more than doubled. We recently \nlearned that for the first time since the 1980's over half of all \ngraduating high school seniors will have been involved with illegal \ndrugs and the use of heroine and marijuana by high schoolers has \nreached levels unprecedented in the 1990's. The number of 8th graders \nwho have used marijuana in the past month has exploded since 1991, \ngrowing by over 350%, and heroine use in our high schools has doubled. \nThe fact that 35.8% (or more than one out of every three high school \nseniors) used marijuana in the past year should be a wake up call to us \nall, as marijuana serves as a gateway to the use of cocaine, LSD, \nheroin and other highly addictive drugs. Overall, this is a complete \nreversal from the previous 12 years when teen drug use was cut in half \nbetween 1980 and 1992. A decade of progress has been destroyed.\n  Yet in spite of these alarming statistics, research conducted by the \nNational Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education [PRIDE] shows \nthat 7 out of 10 American parents are not talking to their children \nabout the dangers of drug use. These numbers are especially alarming in \nlight of the fact that PRIDE's research indicates that mobilizing \nparents is one of our most effective ways of fighting this rising \nepidemic. For example, among students who said they never hear from \ntheir parents on the subject of drugs, 35.5% reported using illicit \ndrugs in the last year. Yet this number falls to 26.6%--a relative \ndecrease of 25% for students whose parent often discuss this issue with \nthem. In response to the rise of teenage drug use in the 1980's, \nparents across the country became active in the anti-drug movement. \nTheir efforts played a key role in reducing drug use by teenagers from \nthe all-time high of 54 percent in 1979 to just 27 percent by 1992.\n  Over the past several years, PRIDE has devoted a great deal of \nattention to the question of how we, as a nation, can again capture the \nlevel of parental involvement that helped drive down teen drug use in \nthe previous two decades. PRIDE has proposed a grassroots plan focused \non a renewed parent movement in the fight against illegal drug use. The \ngoal of this initiative is to educate parents and involve them in \nprograms that will prevent and reduce drug abuse by their children. \nThis volunteer-based approach will allow parents to create a drug \nprevention program most suitable to their community.\n  My experience with PRIDE has convinced me that grassroots efforts by \nAmerica's parents are essential in order to reverse the skyrocketing \nrates of teenage drug use. I hope that the Senate will build on the \namendment I have offered today and fully support programs such as PRIDE \nwhich enlist our parents in the war on drugs.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 348\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the budget resolution \n   agreement does not foreclose the possibility of Congress adopting \n    additional tax cuts in the future, so long as they are paid for)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ADDITIONAL TAX CUTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that nothing in this \n     resolution shall be construed as prohibiting Congress from \n     providing additional tax relief in future years if the cost \n     of such tax relief is offset by reductions in discretionary \n     or mandatory spending, or increases in revenue from \n     alternative sources.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendments Nos. 346, \n347, and 348 are now set aside.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--and this has \nbeen cleared but I want to read it--I ask unanimous consent that during \nthe consideration of the legislation and any conference report thereon \npursuant to the reconciliation instructions set forth in the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998, for the purposes of \nsection 313(b)(1)(E) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \nlegislation which reduces revenues pursuant to reconciliation \ninstruction contained in the fiscal year 1998 resolution, the second \nreconciliation bill, shall be taken together with all other legislation \npassed in the Senate pursuant to the reconciliation instructions \ncontained in that resolution, the first reconciliation bill, when \ndetermining whether any provision of the second reconciliation bill is \nextraneous; further, it is clearly understood that the unanimous \nconsent is contingent upon the Senate considering two reconciliation \nbills pursuant to this budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 349\n\n(Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate that higher education tax \n cuts should encourage parents and students to save for the costs of a \nhigher education, and to provide relief from the debt burden associated \n         with borrowing to pay for a post-secondary education)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When I was sending amendments to the desk that had been \napproved on both sides we failed to introduce one on behalf of Senator \nSnowe. This is another sense of the Senate regarding education, tax \ndeductions, and credits. It has been accepted on both sides. This is \nbeing sent to the desk on behalf of Senator Snowe to qualify under the \nrequirement that it be in by closing time tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Ms. Snowe, \n     for herself and Mr. Coverdell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     349.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the budget agreement reached between Congressional \n     leaders and President Clinton provides for $85 billion in net \n     tax relief over five years.\n       (2) in a May 15, 1997, letter to President Clinton, the \n     Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader agreed \n     that the tax package must include tax relief of roughly $35 \n     billion over five years for post-secondary education, \n     including a deduction and a tax credit.\n       (3) the letter further stipulated that the education tax \n     package should be consistent with the objectives put forward \n     in the HOPE Scholarship and tuition tax proposals contained \n     in the Administration's FY 1998 budget proposal\n       (4) as outlined in the Administration's FY 1998 budget \n     summary, the objective of the education tax credits and \n     deductions is to ensure that financial barriers to higher \n     education continue to fall for all Americans, and to \n     encourage Americans to pursue higher education and to promote \n     lifelong learning.\n       (5) students at the undergraduate level have seen tuition \n     increases outpace inflation for more than a decade, which has \n     led to an increased demand for student aid, including student \n     loans.\n       (6) the typical student loan borrower--including \n     undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students--now \n     accumulates more than $10,000 in educational debt. This \n     rising debt burden poses a serious threat to students and may \n     lead to some students no longer pursuing a higher education.\n       (7) post-secondary education tax cuts that encourage \n     savings and that address this rising debt burden would \n     encourage Americans to pursue a higher education and promote \n     lifelong learning, and would, therefore, be consistent with \n     the objectives sought by President Clinton in his budget \n     proposal.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels of this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume--\n       (1) that higher education tax relief should encourage \n     Americans to pursue a post-secondary education and promote \n     lifelong learning.\n       (2) tax incentives that encourage parents and students to \n     save for higher education expenses, and that provide relief \n     from the debt burden associated with borrowing to pay for a \n     post-secondary education, are consistent with the objectives \n     set forth in this resolution, and should be included in any \n     post-secondary education tax cut package.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, and 355\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have a group of amendments that will be sent to the \ndesk to be considered, and I ask unanimous consent they be considered \nas offered by the appropriate sponsor and qualify under the previous \norder, and further they be considered as having been set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments by \nnumbers.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes \n     amendments numbered 350, 351, 352, 253, 354, and 355.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment No. 350\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate supporting an increase in \n funding for defense 050 account funds dedicated for medical research)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MEDICAL RESEARCH.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the funds in the defense \n     050 account that are assumed to be dedicated for medical \n     research should be increased by $900,000,000 for fiscal year \n     1998.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 351\n\n      (Purpose: To reduce the incentives to use tax gimmicks that \nartificially increase revenues in 2002 in ways that make balancing the \n                   deficit more difficult after 2002)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ANTIGIMMICK TAX SCORING.\n\n       For purposes of scoring any revenue provision of a \n     reconciliation bill enacted pursuant to this resolution, a \n     provision that increases revenue in fiscal year 2002 by an \n     amount $1,000,000,000 or more in excess of the amount that \n     the provision increases revenue in either fiscal year 2001 or \n     2003 shall be scored by--\n       (1) subtracting the amount of the excess from the revenue \n     amount for fiscal year 2002; and\n       (2) dividing the amount of excess by 4 and adding the \n     quotient to the revenue score for the provision for each of \n     the fiscal years 2002 through 2005.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 352\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on early childhood \n                               education)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Scientific research on the development of the brain has \n     confirmed that the early childhood years, particularly from \n     birth to the age of 3, are critical to children's \n     development.\n       (2) Studies repeatedly have shown that good quality child \n     care helps children develop well, enter school ready to \n     succeed, improve their skills, cognitive abilities and \n     socioemotional development, improve classroom learning \n     behavior, and stay safe while their parents work. Further, \n     quality early childhood programs can positively affect \n     children's long-term success in school achievement, higher \n     earnings as adults, decrease reliance on public assistance \n     and decrease involvement with the criminal justice system.\n       (3) The first of the National Education Goals, endorsed by \n     the Nation's governors, passed by Congress and signed into \n     law by President Bush, stated that by the year 2000, every \n     child should enter school ready to learn and that access to a \n     high quality early childhood education program was integral \n     to meeting this goal.\n       (4) According to data compiled by the RAND Corporation, \n     while 90 percent of human brain growth occurs by the age of \n     3, public spending on children in that age range equals only \n     8 percent of spending on all children. A vast majority of \n     public spending on children occurs after the brain has gone \n     through its most dramatic changes, often to correct problems \n     that should have been addressed during early childhood \n     development.\n       (5) According to the Department of Education, of \n     $29,400,000,000 in current estimated education expenditures, \n     only $1,500,000,000, or 5 percent, is spent on children from \n     birth to age 5. The vast majority is spent on children over \n     age 5.\n       (6) A new commitment to quality child care and early \n     childhood education is a necessary response to the fact that \n     children from birth to the age of 3 are spending more time in \n     care away from their homes. Almost 60 percent of women in the \n     workforce have children under the age of 3 requiring care.\n       (7) Many States and communities are currently experimenting \n     with innovative programs directed at early childhood care and \n     education in a variety of care settings, including the home. \n     States and local communities are best able to deliver \n     efficient, cost-effective services, but while such programs \n     are long on demand, they are short on resources.Additional \n     Federal resources should not create new bureaucracy, but \n     build on successful locally driven efforts.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budget totals and levels in this resolution assume \n     that funds ought to be directed toward increasing the supply \n     of quality child care, early childhood education, and teacher \n     and parent training for children from birth through age 3.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 353\n\n  (Purpose: To expand opportunities to access funding in the High way \n                             Reserve fund)\n\n       On page 56, line 7, strike the word ``enacted'' and insert: \n     ``reported or an amendment is adopted''.\n       On page 56, line 15, strike the words ``enactment of \n     legislation'' and insert: ``reporting of legislation or upon \n     the adoption of an amendment''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 354\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the extension of \n    the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund through fiscal year 2002)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SUPPORT FOR FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Our Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedoms and security, and with the support of Federal \n     assistance, State and local law enforcement officers have \n     succeeded in reducing the national scourge of violent crime, \n     as illustrated by a murder rate in 1996 that is projected to \n     be the lowest since 1971 and a violent crime total in 1996 \n     that is the lowest since 1990.\n       (2) Through a comprehensive effort to attack violence \n     against women mounted by State and local law enforcement, and \n     dedicated volunteers and professionals who provide victim \n     services, shelter, counseling, and advocacy to battered women \n     and their children, important strides have been made against \n     the national scourge of violence against women, illustrated \n     by the decline in the murder rate for wives, ex-wives, and \n     girlfriends at the hands of their ``intimates'' fell to a 19-\n     year low in 1995.\n       (3) Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts need \n     continued financial commitment from the Federal Government \n     for\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\n     funding and financial assistance to continue their efforts to \n     combat violent crime and violence against women.\n       (4) Federal, state and local law enforcement also face \n     other challenges which require continued financial commitment \n     from the Federal Government, including regaining control over \n     the Southwest Border, where drug trafficking and illegal \n     immigration continue to threaten public safety and menace \n     residents on the border and throughout the nation.\n       (5) The Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund established in \n     section 310001 the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement \n     Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14211) fully funds the Violent Crime \n     Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, including the \n     Violence Against Women Act, without adding to the Federal \n     budget deficit.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions and the functional totals underlying this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Federal Government's commitment to fund Federal law \n     enforcement programs and programs to assist State and local \n     efforts to combat violent crime, including violence against \n     women, will be maintained; and\n       (2) funding for the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund will \n     continue in its current form at least through fiscal year \n     2002.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 355\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TAX CUTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget assumes that--\n       (1) A substantial majority of the tax cut benefits provided \n     in the tax reconciliation bill will go to middle class \n     working families earning less than approximately $100,000 per \n     year; and\n       (2) The tax cuts in the tax reconciliation bill will not \n     cause revenue losses to increase significantly in years after \n     2007.\n                                  ____\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendments \nnumbered 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, and 355 will now be set aside.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I voted for an amendment offered \nby Senator Hollings. I would like to take a brief moment to explain my \nvote.\n  Senator Hollings is absolutely right in his contention about this \nbudget agreement. The so-called balanced budget agreement that has been \nhammered out by the White House and the Congress does not, in fact, \nbalance the budget.\n  While the agreement purports to balance the budget, I would urge my \ncolleagues to look at page 4 of the budget resolution, which will put \nthe agreement into effect. It says, in section 101(4) of the \nresolution, that the budget will be $108 billion in deficit in the year \n2002. Why is that the case? Because they are claiming a balanced budget \nusing a ``unified budget,'' which means they can count the Social \nSecurity surpluses to offset other deficits.\n  However, as I have said in previous debates, using the Social \nSecurity surplus creates a deficit for our future. The surplus that is \naccrued in the year 2002 in the Social Security accounts is needed in \nthe following decades to fund the retirement needs of the baby boom \ngeneration. If that money is now used as an offset against other \nspending to balance the budget, it will not be there when it is needed \nto meet Social Security needs in future years.\n  The way to balance the budget in a real and honest way is to do as \nSenator Hollings suggests. We must make spending cuts that are \nnecessary and delay both the tax cuts and the spending increases in \nspecific accounts until there is room in the budget to accomplish them \nwhile still balancing the budget in a real way.\n  Robust economic growth is driving the budget deficit down \nsubstantially. I think there will ultimately be room for some tax cuts \nand for some targeted investment increases in certain areas, such as \neducation, health care and the environment. But the priority ought to \nbe to balance the budget first and do it fully and completely by \nreaching a budget deficit of zero in 2002 without using the Social \nSecurity trust funds. Then, as the economy continues to grow, added \nrevenue will allow us to both provide needed tax cuts as well as \ntargeted investments in critical accounts. Not many Members of the \nSenate voted for the Hollings amendment, because most want to rush to \nprovide tax cuts now and to provide spending increases in certain \naccounts now. But if we do that there is no guarantee that we will \ntruly reach an honest balanced budget in the near term.\n  Unfortunately, the Hollings amendment failed. It failed by a large \nmargin. However, as the budget process continues, I intend to work as \nbest I can to advance deficit reduction. The resolution we are debating \ndoes move in the right direction. While it is not a balanced budget \nplan, it is a deficit reduction plan. It does achieve $204 billion of \ndeficit reduction. And for that reason, I think it's better to support \nthis negotiated agreement. At least this agreement makes some progress.\n  To sum up, I would have felt better if this agreement had delayed \nboth the tax cuts and spending increases until the budget is truly \nbalanced. While this agreement provides hope for those of us who want \nthe deficit cut, and who want the budget balanced, it also serves up \nthe dessert before the main course. It requires less discipline than we \nneed. I still believe that we should continue to work to do more than \njust balance the unified budget. Balancing the unified budget will \nstill leave this country with a budget deficit.\n\n\n                           nuclear waste fund\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to inquire of the managers regarding the \nimpact of the resolution now being considered by the Senate.\n  My question relates to the legislative intent of the resolution as it \nrelates to the nuclear waste fund and specifically regarding its impact \non S. 104 passed by the Senate on April 15, 1997. What is the impact of \nthe budget resolution on the provisions of S. 104 and the Nuclear Waste \nFund?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The budget resolution does not prejudge the outcome of \nthe debate concerning the nuclear waste issue. However, S. 104, as \npassed by the Senate, does not violate the Budget Act. If S. 104 is \nenacted into law, there is sufficient funding in the offsetting \ncollections and the budget could accommodate full funding of both the \npermanent repository and the interim storage at Yucca Mountain within \nthe statutory schedules mandated.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his response.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent when the Senate resumes Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 27 on Thursday, there be 13 hours remaining to be \nequally divided under the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent when the Senate resumes Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 27 on Thursday, that time remaining on the \namendment numbered 336 be limited to 50 minutes under the control of \nSenator Moseley-Braun, 10 minutes under the control of Senator \nDomenici, and following the conclusion or yielding back, Senator \nDomenici be recognized to move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I further ask that no other amendments be in order \nprior to the motion to table the amendment of Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. From what I understand, Senator Boxer wants to speak \nfor 3 minutes and then I want to put the Senate into morning business \nwith speeches up to 10 minutes. I am assuming you will be recognized at \nthat point and Senator Stevens will be here to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Stevens has 5 minutes. It is fine if he goes \nbefore me.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have a series of matters for the leader to perform \nbefore that time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And I have 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia for up to 3 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 355\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member. I \nunderstand that after our brief conversation they will accept an \namendment that Senator Durbin and I will be introducing tomorrow that \nhas already been sent to the desk.\n  Mr. President, because the economy is so strong and the Clinton \nbudget plan in 1993 was so right, we can now finish the job of \nbalancing the budget in a fair and responsible way. The plan before us, \nfor the most part, I believe is fair and reasonable. No more \ndestruction of Medicare and Medicaid, gone are the $270 billion cuts \nproposed by\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\nRepublicans last year, gone are the $88 billion cuts they wanted to do \nto Medicaid, no more talk about doing away with the Department of \nEducation, the Department of Commerce, no more suggestion that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency should be stripped of its power and its \nfunds.\n  Now, I believe this radical revolution is over with this budget deal. \nCould this budget deal be better? Yes, of course, it could. One way, \nMr. President, it could be better is if we kept our tax cuts moderate \nand targeted them to the middle-class. We could reach balance sooner. \nWe would still have resources left to do more for our children and our \ncommunities.\n  What Senator Durbin and I--and it is cosponsored by Senators Daschle, \nHarkin, and Bumpers--what we say in our amendment, and I am very \npleased it will be accepted, is that a substantial majority of the tax \ncut benefits provided in the reconciliation bill will go to middle-\nclass working families earning less than approximately $100,000 per \nyear and that the tax cuts in the reconciliation bill will not cause \nrevenue losses to increase significantly in the years after 2007.\n  In other words, we have two points to our amendment. One is tax cut \nbenefits go to the middle-class; and two, we do not want to see an \nexplosion of deficits in the outyears.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the chairman is accepting this. I am \npleased we are walking down this path together. I really will watch \nthis because we have no assurance that this amendment will be kept in \nthe conference, but we will keep our eye on it because I suspect if we \ninsisted on a vote we would get a near unanimous vote.\n  I am hopeful we can keep this language in the bill itself. If it is \nstripped out, Mr. President, I will be back once we get to the \nreconciliation bill, to make sure that tax cuts are not going to the \npeople who are earning $1 million but are, in fact, going to our hard-\nworking families who earn approximately $100,000 a year.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. Again, my thanks to the Members \nof the Budget Committee. This has been a long time in coming. It is not \nthe perfect budget but I think it puts an end to the radical revolution \nthat was threatened a couple years ago and it will bring us to balance. \nIt is good for our children, and overall I am pleased with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4851-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending May 16, the U.S. imported 7,834,000 barrels of \noil each day, 52,000 barrels more than the 7,782,000 imported each day \nduring the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.8 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder \nthe economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,834,000 barrels a \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4876-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, every year the respected U.S. Committee \nfor Refugees issues a review of the state of the world's refugees. This \nyearly review has earned worldwide respect as the most authoritative \ncompilation of analyses, data, and thought-provoking information on \nrefugees. The 1997 World Refugee Survey, released yesterday is \nespecially troubling. The Committee finds that many countries which \nwere once considered safe havens for refugees and asylum seekers are \nbeginning to turn their backs on persons fleeing persecution.\n  The report estimates that the number of refugees and asylum-seekers \ndecreased last year to about 14.5 million worldwide. But this apparent \ndecrease is misleading. The Committee attributes it in part to the \nhigher barriers to asylum erected in many countries last year, \nincluding the United States. In addition, some countries have begun to \nforcibly repatriate refugees back to their home countries, even if \nconditions in those countries have not improved. For example, Thailand \nhas recently begun to forcibly return Burmese refugees to their \npersecutors in Burma.\n  There is some good news. Several countries, including Guatemala, \nHaiti, Mozambique, and Cambodia, have improved their human rights \nsituations, so that some refugees have been able to return to their \nhomes.\n  Sadly, the overall message of the report is that basic long-standing \ninternational principles of asylum and refugee protection are in \ntrouble. As this report points out, the United States bears a share of \nresponsibility for this problem. The summary exclusion provisions of \nlast year's immigration law, and the continued detention of asylum-\nseekers sets a poor example for other countries which look to the \nUnited States for guidance on asylum and refugee protection.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a U.S. Committee for \nRefugees press release be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Asylum Eroding in More Countries, Report Finds; Refugees' Lives, \n                    Protection Principles Endangered\n\n       Washington, DC.--Asylum for refugees around the world is \n     eroding in more countries than ever before, as governments, \n     including those traditionally friendly to refugees, either \n     close their borders completely or offer ``pseudo-asylum'' \n     that lacks adequate protection, the U.S. Committee for \n     Refugees (USCR) said today.\n       ``We are seeing a continuing deterioration in the quality \n     of protection and assistance countries are willing to offer \n     to those fleeing persecution and violence,'' said USCR \n     Director Roger Winter in releasing USCR's 1997 World Refugee \n     Survey. ``This pseudo-asylum not only endangers the lives and \n     well-being of refugees, but threatens to kill the principle \n     of asylum itself,'' Winter said.\n       USCR's World Refugee Survey is considered the preeminent \n     source for information on the worldwide refugee situation, \n     and this year's Survey includes 120 detailed country reports, \n     12 statistical tables, and essays on deteriorating asylum \n     standards.\n       The 1997 World Refugee Survey provides examples of \n     countries either shutting their doors to asylum seekers or \n     offering pseudo-asylum in the past year:\n       The international community deprived Rwandan refugees of \n     true asylum by ignoring serious protection problems in \n     refugee\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\n     camps in Zaire. The lack of proper asylum for legitimate \n     Rwandan refugees became one trigger for the current civil war \n     in Zaire, which in turn triggered attacks on Zaire's refugee \n     camps. Significant numbers of Rwandan refugees continue to \n     die in central Zaire.\n       The Bulk Challenge--a freighter packed with Liberian \n     refugees fleeing violence and chaos in their country--was \n     turned away from one West African port after another last \n     May.\n       Burmese refugees in Thailand suffered cross-border attacks \n     on their camps in 1996, while Thai authorities offered little \n     security. In recent months, there have been instances of Thai \n     authorities preventing New Burmese asylum seekers from \n     entering Thailand and forcibly returning those who have \n     managed to cross the border.\n       Iraq Curds who fled to Iran last September returned to Iraq \n     by the end of the year because the quality of asylum offered \n     by Iranian authorities was so poor. The close proximity of \n     the camps to the border allowed them to be shelled from Iraq, \n     while basic services were lacking. When the Iraqis began \n     returning to their country under questionable circumstances, \n     UNHCR was not permitted access to the camps.\n       ``The deterioration of asylum is not only an African \n     phenomenon,'' said Winter. ``The problem can be found in \n     every corner of the world and even in our own backyards as \n     the recent changes in U.S. asylum law shows,'' he said. The \n     new U.S. asylum law, which went into effect in April, makes \n     it harder for asylum seekers to apply for asylum, in part \n     through a summary removal procedure for persons arriving with \n     false documents, the only way many asylum seekers can flee \n     repressive governments.\n       Other Western governments are also taking a more \n     restrictive approach. In Germany, authorities are seeking to \n     withdraw asylum for Bosnians prematurely. Authorities there \n     recently ended temporary protected status for Bosnians and \n     are beginning to send them back to an unstable situation in \n     Bosnia, which is short on housing, landmine sweeping, jobs, \n     freedom of movement, and tolerance.\n       The 1997 World Refugee Survey reports that although the \n     total number of refugees, internally displaced people, and \n     asylum seekers is at a seven-year low of roughly 34 million \n     people, the reasons are complex. While human rights \n     conditions have sufficiently improved for refugees to \n     repatriate to Guatemala, Haiti, Mozambique, and Cambodia, \n     refugees elsewhere have been forcibly repatriated to unsafe \n     conditions. At least 18 countries, including the United \n     States, forcibly expelled refugees or insufficiently screened \n     asylum seekers in 1996.\n       Founded in 1958, the U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR) is \n     a private humanitarian agency which defends the rights of \n     refugees, asylum seekers, and displaced persons worldwide.\n\n\n            Countries that damaged asylum principles in 1996\n\n       (This is a selected list and should not be viewed as \n     comprehensive)\n       The Bahamas (denied asylum to Cubans)\n       Bangladesh (denied asylum to and forcibly repatriated \n     Burmese)\n       Cote d'Ivoire (denied asylum to Liberians)\n       Germany (announced intention to forcibly repatriate \n     Bosnians)\n       Ghana (denied asylum to Liberians)\n       Hong Kong (forcibly repatriated Vietnamese)\n       Iran (provided inadequate asylum for Iraqi Kurds and \n     expelled Afghans)\n       Lebanon (provided inadequate asylum to Palestinians)\n       Tanzania (forcibly repatriated Burundians and some Rwandans \n     and denied asylum to Burundians)\n       Togo (denied asylum to Liberians)\n       Turkey (denied asylum to Iraqi Kurds, expelled Iraqis and \n     Iranians)\n       United States (provided inadequate asylum procedures for \n     Cubans)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4876-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJ. (P). RANDY O'BOYLE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, when people think of special operations \nforces, the image that immediately comes to mind is that of the Army's \nGreen Berets and Rangers, or the Navy's SEAL's. Few realize that the \nAir Force has a special operations element which is robust and \nimpressive. Air Commandos, Combat Controllers, and ParaRescue personnel \nhave all made important contributions to military operations and \nNational Security over the past five decades, and today, I rise to pay \ntribute to one member of that community, Major Randy O'Boyle, who is \nabout to assume command of the 551st Flight Training Squadron.\n  For the past several years, Major O'Boyle has been a tireless and \ndiligent advocate as the Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs for the \nUnited States Special Operations Command. In that capacity, he has \nworked closely with Senators, Representatives, and their staffers in \norder to explain the missions and needs of this unique, joint-service \nCommand. In the process he has helped to give Members of Congress a \nbetter understanding of the capabilities of our Nation's special \noperators and has provided us with the information necessary for us to \nhelp shape policy and the future of our special warfare elements.\n  Major O'Boyle was particularly effective in his job as he brought \nwith him to Washington both extensive experience as an Air Force \nOfficer and as a special operator. An accomplished pilot, Randy O'Boyle \nhas literally thousands of hours behind the stick of the Air Force's \nPave Low helicopter, an aircraft specifically modified to support \nspecial operations. During Operation Just Cause, Randy demonstrated his \nabilities as a pilot and his coolness under pressure as he flew combat \noperations in support of Army, Navy, and Air Force special forces \npersonnel as they fought to liberate Panama from the grasp of the \ndictator Manuel Noriega. Major O'Boyle's experience and expertise was \nput to good use a little more than a year later during the Gulf War, \nwhere he played an instrumental role in helping to plan the coalition \nforces' first strike into Iraq, kicking off Operation Desert Storm. His \nintimate knowledge of what is required of both a successful tactical \nand planning officer provided Major O'Boyle with an unusual insight to \nhow the Special Operations Command functions. His understanding of what \nthe needs of Special Operations personnel are, from the newest member \non a Special Forces or SEAL Team to the Commander of one of the SOCOM \nTheater Commands, assured that he was able to speak knowledgeably and \neloquently on literally every aspect of special operations. In \naddition, his easy-going Midwestern demeanor, engaging personality, and \nquick-witted sense of humor all assured that he established a bond with \nthose he worked with both in the Department of Defense and in the halls \nof Congress.\n  As Major O'Boyle leaves Washington and heads west to the famed \npainted landscapes of New Mexico, he leaves many friends who have \nenjoyed working with him during his assignments here. Though the ranks \nof the Special Operations Command are filled with nothing but capable \nindividuals, I am certain that SOCOM Legislative Affairs will miss \nMajor O'Boyle's positive and determined attitude and his effective \nrepresentation of the Command. Without a doubt though, the young Air \nCommandos who will come under his command at the 551st Training \nSquadron will benefit greatly from his tutelage. I am especially \npleased to note that Randy will pin on the silver oak leaf of a \nLieutenant Colonel on June 1, I hope that he continues to enjoy great \nsuccess in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4877-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4877-S4878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:42 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to regulate the transmission of unsolicited commercial \nelectronic mail, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n     The Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Choice Act of 1977\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will address one of the major complaints of Internet users--the \nproliferation of unsolicited e-mail advertisements, junk e-mail, or so-\ncalled spam.\n  Mr. President, in the span of 5 years, an entirely new method of \ncommerce and communication--electronic mail on the Internet--has spread \naround the world. Along with the benefits of this revolutionary \ntechnology, there are some negative byproducts that can only damage the \nintegrity of this new communications medium.\n  Because of technological advances, Internet e-mail has also become a \nvery inexpensive means of distributing endless e-mails solicitations \nthat not only annoy but can also defraud recipients. Moreover, the \ngrowth of junk e-mail can clog e-mail distribution networks and overtax \nthe ability of service providers to distribute legitimate \ncommunications.\n  With a minimal equipment investment, any individual or business has \nthe capability to transmit unsolicited advertisements to thousands of \npeople nationwide each hour with the click of a mouse. As technology \nadvances, thousands will turn into millions, and junk e-mail could \noverwhelm cyberspace.\n  Junk e-mail is known in the trade by the derisive term of ``spam.'' \nBased upon the content of many of these e-mails, I'd be insulted if I \nwere an employee of Hormel, the creator of the real Spam.\n  Mr. President, not only is junk e-mail an annoyance, but for many \nAmericans, especially citizens living in rural States like Alaska, \nthere is a real out-of-pocket cost they must pay to receive these \nunsolicited advertisements. When an on-line subscriber in rural Alaska \nor Montana, logs on to a network server, such as America OnLine, to \ncheck to see if there is e-mail, the subscriber often must pay a long \ndistance charge. If there is no e-mail in his on-line mailbox, the \nsubscriber's long distance charge may only cover 1 minute. However, if \nthere are 25 messages in his mailbox, 24 of which are unsolicited e-\nmail ads, his long distance charges could triple or quadruple.\n  So what the rural on-line user is forced to do is to pay for the \nprivilege of receiving junk e-mail and then having to waste his time \nhitting his delete button to empty this junk out of his mail box.\n  Mr. President, we ought to do something to end this practice. In \n1991, Congress passed the Automated Telephone Consumer Protection Act \nthat contained a provision which banned unsolicited fax transmissions. \nIn the bill I am introducing today, the Unsolicited Commercial \nElectronic Mail Choice Act of 1997, I have not chosen to take such a \nsweeping and unilateral approach because the Internet is about choices, \nnot outright bans.\n\n  What my bill does is to require the use of the word ``Advertisement'' \nin the subject line of any unsolicited commercial e-mail, along with \nthe sender's real address, real e-mail address, and telephone number in \nthe body of the message. This requirement will empower Internet users \nto filter out messages that they do not want to receive.\n  Spam generators who refuse to abide by this requirement could face \nlegal action from private citizens, state attorneys general, and/or the \nFederal Trade Commission. FTC or state action could result in civil \npenalties of up to $11,000 per incident and, more importantly, cease \nand desist orders. Private citizens bringing suit could recover $5,000 \nplus reasonable attorney's fees.\n  Internet users can also choose not to unilaterally block all \nunsolicited commercial e-mails. Instead, they can send removal requests \nto specific mailing lists with further transmissions required to end \nwithin 48 hours.\n  Moreover, Internet Service Providers, such as America Online or \nMicrosoft Network, would be required to filter out all e-mails with the \nword ``Advertisement'' in the subject line when a consumer so requests. \nLarge service providers would have 1 year, from the date of enactment, \nto implement this requirement. Smaller Internet Service Providers would \nhave 2 years to meet this requirement. Internet Service Providers would \nalso be required to cut off service to those who use their services to \nsend out unsolicited commercial e-mails in violation of the provisions \nof the act.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out what this bill does not attempt to \ndo. It does not ban unsolicited commercial e-mails as some have \nsuggested. I have not chosen an outright ban because I support the \nbusiness practices of those who flood inboxes with sales pitches for \nworthless vitamin products and multilevel marketing schemes. Quite the \ncontrary, I abhor such solicitations.\n  But I do not want to set a precedent in banning commercial speech on \nthe Internet. Although these unsolicited advertisements are annoying, I \ndo not believe that is a basis for an outright ban. A better approach \nis to simply ignore them by filtering them out. If enough Americans \nchoose to filter out such e-mail messages, I seriously doubt that \nanyone will bother to send out such e-mails in the future since the \ncyberspace market will no longer be there.\n  I would also note that this bill does not impact automated mailing \nlists, e-mails between friends, or e-mails between businesses and their \ncustomers when there is a preexisting business relationship.\n  Mr. President, the Internet is about choices, not bans. The \nUnsolicited\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\nCommercial Electronic Mail Message Choice Act of 1997 should restore to \nconsumers and businesses the right to be free from endless e-mail \nsolicitations. It will be up to the consumer to decide if he or she \nwants to receive such messages. That is the way I believe Americans \nwant it. They don't want government telling them what they can receive, \nbut they want right to decide for themselves.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, this is a very new technology and \nit is not my intention to hinder it's development nor interfere with \nlegitimate commerce transacted on the Internet. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to pass legislation that resolves this \nproblem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 771\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Unsolicited Commercial \n     Electronic Mail Choice Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Internet is a worldwide network of information that \n     growing numbers of Americans use on a regular basis for \n     educational and personal activities.\n       (2) Electronic mail messages transmitted on the Internet \n     constitute an increasing percentage of communications in the \n     United States.\n       (3) Solicited commercial electronic mail is a useful and \n     cost-effective means for Americans to receive information \n     about a business and its products.\n       (4) The number of transmissions of unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail advertisements has grown exponentially over \n     the past several years as the technology for creating and \n     transmitting such advertisements in bulk has made the costs \n     of distribution of such advertisements minimal.\n       (5) Individuals have available no effective means of \n     differentiating between unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail advertisements and other Internet communications.\n       (6) The transmitters of unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail advertisements can easily move from State to State.\n       (7) Individuals and businesses that receive unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail advertisements often pay for the \n     costs of such receipt, including the costs of Internet access \n     and long distance telephone charges.\n       (8) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail can be used to \n     advertise legitimate services and goods but is also used for \n     fraudulent and deceptive purposes in violation of Federal and \n     State law.\n       (9) Individuals and companies that use unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail for fraudulent and deceptive \n     purposes often use fraudulent identification information in \n     such electronic mail, making it impossible for a recipient to \n     request to be removed from the mailing list or for law \n     enforcement authorities to identify the sender.\n       (10) The inability of recipients of unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail to identify the senders of such electronic \n     mail or to prevent its receipt impedes the flow of commerce \n     and communication on the Internet and threatens the integrity \n     of commerce on the Internet.\n       (11) Internet service providers are burdened by the cost of \n     equipment necessary to process unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail.\n       (12) To facilitate the development of commerce and \n     communication on the Internet, unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail should be readily identifiable and filterable \n     by individuals and Internet service providers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish an Office of Religious Persecution \nMonitoring, to provide for the imposition of sanctions against \ncountries engaged in a pattern of religious persecution, and for other\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n           The Freedom from Religious Persecution Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to once \nagain address the subject of religious persecution. I have stood here \nbefore describing the horrible tragedies occurring in many parts of the \nworld. Sadly, very little has been done to combat the problem. That is \nwhy I am introducing the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act of \n1997.\n  Religious persecution is a subject of great personal interest. Both \nof my parents, my father from the Ukraine, my mother from a small town \non the Polish-Russian border, came to this country to avoid religious \npersecution. Freedom from religious persecution is a concept \nfundamental to the ideals of this country and to peoples everywhere.\n  Christians and other religious minorities have been and continue to \nbe the victims of discrimination, rape, torture, enslavement, \nimprisonment, and even murder, because of their religious beliefs. This \npersecution continues today, often without diplomatic or other \nconsequences for the offending regime. Christians are not the only ones \nbeing persecuted. Muslims and followers of other religions are also \nsingled out for their beliefs.\n  In January 1996, the White House promised that a new senior advisor \nposition would be created in the Office of the President dedicated \nspecifically to the issue of religious persecution overseas. No such \nposition was ever created. Instead, President Clinton established a \ncommittee in the State Department that will report to the Secretary of \nState and will advise the Secretary on violations of religious freedoms \nabroad. The committee has since met, months have gone by, but still no \naction has been taken. Mr. President, I and many of my colleagues agree \nthat the time for action is now. We do not need more reviews and \nstudies or more advice on the subject. The instances of religious \npersecution are well documented. We need action.\n\n  At the end of the 104th Congress, I introduced Senate Resolution 283, \nwhich discussed the need for quick, decisive action and called upon the \nPresident to appoint a White House advisor on religious persecution. \nAfter that, I worked with Senators Nickles, Nunn, and Coats on a \nbroader Senate Concurrent Resolution, 71, which included my provisions \non a White House Senior Advisor on religious persecution. Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 71, which I cosponsored, passed the Senate by \nvoice vote but there was insufficient time remaining in the 104th \nCongress to secure passage in the House.\n  So today, the persecution of Christians and other religious \nminorities continues to grow, often without diplomatic or other \nconsequences for the offending regime. In countries such as Saudi \nArabia, Sudan, China, and Ethiopia, Christians are systematically \ndenied their religious liberties. Muslims have also been singled out \nfor persecution in countries such as Burma, where Muslims are forced to \nrelocate to undesirable areas and where Muslims are often denied \neducational opportunities.\n  Several examples illustrate the gravity of the problem. The Sudanese \nGovernment continues to essentially wage a war against its Christian \npopulation. Reports detail the forced enslavement and conversion of the \nChristian populations from the southern regions of Sudan. The \nGovernment bombs and burns Christians villages, has taken more than \n30,000 Christian children as slaves in the last 6 years, and tortures \nChristian worshipers and their priests.\n  In Pakistan in February of this year, thousands of Christians were \nattacked, many houses and six churches were set on fire. Nearly 1,000 \nfamilies were living in tents after being driven from their homes by \nrioters. Where was the Government to stop this terror? Where were the \npolice?\n  Persecution of Christians is by no means limited to the Islamic \nworld. China continues to be one of the worst offenders. At least 75 \nmillion Christians live in China but cannot practice their religion. \nRoman Catholics and Protestant Chinese are imprisoned and tortured for \nholding worship, preaching, or distributing bibles without permission.\n  This past August 1996, I traveled to China and met with Chinese Vice-\nPremier Qian Qichen to express my strong concerns about religious \npersecution in his country. On September 12, 1996, however, Chinese \nPremier Li Ping released a statement warning the Chinese people that \nthe free exercise of their religious faith could result in harsh \nretribution.\n  In August 1996 I also visited Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince \nAbdullah to discuss the restrictions that country has on religious \npractices. I was deeply troubled by the fact that United States troops \nstationed in Saudi Arabia are not permitted to exercise their religious \nbeliefs or even fly the American flag. According to the Pueblo Program \non Religious Freedom of Freedom House, the Saudi Government has even \ninsisted that the United States Government restrict Christian worship \nby American citizens on United States Embassy grounds in Saudi Arabia. \nAmerican officials have apparently acquiesced to some of these demands \nby, for example, restricting Christian services at the Embassy in \nRiyadh and prohibiting Christmas services for United States troops \ndefending Saudi interests during the gulf war.\n  Other examples of such persecution of Christians and other religious \nminorities abound. Earlier this year, I discussed the broad issue of \nreligious persecution on the ``Capitol Enlightenment'' radio show in \nVirginia with host Bill Fenton and Jim Jacobson, president of Christian \nSolidarity International, and on ``The Diner'' cable television show in \nPittsburgh, hosted by Tom Hinkling. The public response to these \nprograms and my legislative efforts to combat religious persecution has \nbeen overwhelming. People from across the country have contacted me to \nurge me to continue the fight until Christians, Muslims, Jews, and \nothers can practice their faith in any country without fear of \nreprisal.\n\n  The time has come for the United States to stand up for the right of \nall people to enjoy the fundamental freedom of religious faith. That is \nwhy I am introducing legislation with Congressman Wolf that will \nestablish the position of Senior Advisor to the President dedicated to \ncombating religious persecution overseas.\n  This legislation will also define degrees of religious persecution \nand will impose sanctions on offending entities. Degrees of religious \npersecution are defined by two categories of activity. The first is \nwhen religious persecution is ongoing and widespread and is carried out \nby the government or with the government's support. The second is when \nthere is religious persecution that is not carried out with government \nsupport, but where the government fails to take serious efforts to \neliminate the persecution.\n  The legislation will ban exports to the specific foreign government \nentity that carries out the persecution. These sanctions would take \neffect immediately upon the identification of the relevant entities and \nproducts. Additional sanctions would take effect after 90 days or 1 \nyear depending on the level of persecution. In addition, the \nlegislation includes immediate sanctions against Sudan, a country where \nreligious persecution is particularly egregious.\n  This legislation requests more than just another report by the State \nDepartment. It is serious and it is tough. This legislation commits the \nUnited States to real action. There is no more time for talk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 772\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Freedom From Religious \n     Persecution Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Governments have a primary responsibility to promote, \n     encourage, and protect respect for the fundamental and \n     internationally recognized right to freedom of religion.\n       (2) The right to freedom of religion is recognized by \n     numerous international agreements and covenants, including \n     the following:\n       (A) Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n     states that ``Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, \n     conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\n     change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or \n     in community with others and in public or private, to \n     manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, \n     worship and observance''.\n       (B) Article 18 of the Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights declares that ``Everyone shall have the right to \n     freedom of thought, conscience, and religion . . .'' and \n     further delineates the privileges under this right.\n       (3) Persecution of religious believers, particularly Roman \n     Catholic and evangelical Protestant Christians, in Communist \n     countries, such as Cuba, Laos, the People's Republic of \n     China, North Korea, and Vietnam, persists and in some cases \n     is increasing.\n       (4) In many Islamic countries and regions thereof, \n     governments persecute non-Muslims and religious converts from \n     Islam using means such as ``blasphemy'' and ``apostasy'' \n     laws, and militant movements seek to corrupt a historically \n     tolerant Islamic faith and culture through the persecution of \n     Baha'is, Christians, and other religious minorities.\n       (5) The militant, Islamic Government of Sudan is waging a \n     self-described religious war against Christian, non-Muslim, \n     and moderate Muslim persons by using torture, starvation, \n     enslavement, and murder.\n       (6) In Tibet, where Tibetan Buddhism is inextricably linked \n     to the Tibetan identity, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China has intensified its control over the \n     Tibetan people by perverting the selection of the Panchen \n     Lama, propagandizing against the religious authority of the \n     Dalai Lama, restricting religious study and traditional \n     religious practices, and increasing the persecution of monks \n     and nuns.\n       (7) The United States Government is committed to the right \n     to freedom of religion and its policies and relations with \n     foreign governments should be consistent with the commitment \n     to this principle.\n       (8) The 104th Congress recognized the facts set forth in \n     this section and stated clearly the sense of the Senate and \n     the House of Representatives regarding these matters in \n     approving--\n       (A) H. Res. 515, expressing the sense of the House of \n     Representatives with respect to the persecution of Christians \n     worldwide;\n       (B) S. Con.

A bill to designate certain Federal lands in the State of \nUtah as wilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   America's Red Rock Wilderness Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act to protect an important part of our Nation's natural \nheritage. America's Red Rock Wilderness Act designates 5.7 million \nacres of the 22 million acres of public, Bureau of Land Management \n(BLM) lands in Southern Utah as wilderness.\n  Passage of America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is essential to protect \na national treasure for future generations of Americans. A companion \nbill, H.R. 1500, has been introduced in the House by Representative \nMaurice Hinchey with over 100 original cosponsors.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act will protect 5.7 million acres of \nmagnificent canyons, red rock cliffs and rock formations which are \nunlike any on Earth. The lands included in this legislation contain \nsteep slick rock canyons, high cliffs offering spectacular vistas of \nrare rock formations, important archeological sites and rare plant and \nanimal species. Each year, almost 8 million people from across the \nUnited States and the world visit these lands to see a part of their \nnatural heritage and experience the beauty and solitude of this \nwilderness area.\n  However, these fragile, scenic lands are threatened by oil, gas and \nmining interests which are willing to sacrifice these lands for short-\nterm economic gain. These wilderness areas are also threatened by off-\nroad vehicle use and proposals to construct roads, communication \ntowers, transmission lines, and dams.\n  Because of flaws in the original wilderness inventory conducted by \nBLM during the Reagan administration, only 3.2 million acres in \nsouthern Utah are currently protected as wilderness study areas. The \nwilderness areas included in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act are \nbased on a careful assessment of BLM lands which meet the criteria for \nwilderness designation by citizen groups that form the Utah Wilderness \nCoalition. Unlike other proposals, this legislation does not include \nspecial interest exemptions that would undermine the integrity of the \n1964 Wilderness Act.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is supported by a broad coalition \nof environmental organizations and citizen groups. In a national survey \nconducted by USA Today, over 90 percent of the respondents supported \nthe designation of 5.7 million acres in southern Utah as wilderness. \nNewspapers across the Nation have also editorialized in support of \nprotecting America's Red Rock Wilderness Area.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once stated that, ``The Nation behaves well if it \ntreats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the \nnext generation increased and not impaired in value.'' Because of the \nforesight of leaders like Theodore Roosevelt, national treasures such \nas the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone were preserved for all Americans. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in this effort to protect America's Red \nRock Wilderness Area in southern Utah for future generations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining the \njunior Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation to designate 5.7 million acres of Federal lands in Utah as \nwilderness.\n  Though this is the first time this particular measure has been \nintroduced in this body, it is not the first time that the protection \nof Utah's public lands has been before the Senate. During the last \nCongress, I joined with the former Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nBradley, in opposing the Omnibus Parks legislation because it contained \nprovisions, which were eventually removed, that many in my home State \nof Wisconsin believed not only designated as wilderness too little of \nthe Bureau of Land Management's holding in Utah deserving of such \nprotection, but also substantively changed the protections afforded \ndesignated lands under the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n  Wallace Stegner wrote ``No place is a place until things that have \nhappened there are remembered in history, ballads, yarns, legends, or \nmonuments.''\n  The lands of southern Utah are legendary, alive, and well remembered \nin\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\nthe minds and hearts of the people of Wisconsin. In writing to me last \nCongress, my constituents described these lands as places of special \nfamily moments, healing silence, and incredible beauty. In March 1996, \nduring debate on the omnibus parks bill, Ed Culhane of the Appleton \nPost-Crescent wrote:\n\n       This is some of the most beautiful landscape in the world \n     and each year hundreds of thousands of people hike into these \n     canyons, into this hard, dry land of varnished cliffs and \n     blasted mesas.\n       Aldo Leopold once asked if a still higher standard of \n     living was worth its cost in things natural, wild, and free. \n     If we lose the Redrock Wilderness, we will get precious \n     little in return.\n\n  Some may say, Mr. President, that this legislation is unnecessary and \nUtah already has the ``monument'' that Wallace Stegner wrote about, \ndesignated by President Clinton on September 18, 1997. However, it is \nimportant to note, the land of the Grand Staircase Escalante National \nMonument, included among the lands to be given wilderness protection in \nthis bill, is less than one third of the lands this bill protects.\n  I supported the President's actions to designate the Grand Staircase \nEscalante National Monument. On September 17, 1997, amid reports of the \npending designation, I authored a letter to President Clinton, cosigned \nby six other members of the Senate, supporting that action. That letter \nconcluded with the following statement ``We remain interested in \nworking with the Administration on appropriate legislation to evaluate \nand protect the full extent of public lands in Utah that meet the \ncriteria of the 1964 Wilderness Act.''\n\n  I believe that the measure being introduced today accomplishes that \ngoal. Identical in its designations to H.R. 1500 sponsored in the other \nbody by Representative Maurice Hinchey of New York, it is the \nculmination of more than 10 years and four Congresses of effort in the \nother body beginning with the legislative work of the former \nCongressman from Utah, Mr. Owens.\n  The measure protects wild lands that really are not done justice in \nwords. Truly remarkable American resources of red rock cliff walls, \ndesert, canyons and gorges are found on these BLM lands which encompass \nthe canyon country of the Colorado Plateau, the Mojave Desert and \nportions of the Great Basin. They include mountain ranges in western \nUtah, stark areas like the new National Monument, and wildlife \nintensive areas like the Deep Creek and Stansbury Mountains, that \nsupport habitat for deer, elk, cougars, bobcats, bighorn sheep, \ncoyotes, birds, reptiles, and other wildlife. These regions appeal to \nall types of American outdoor interests from hikers and sightseers to \nhunters.\n  Phil Haslanger of the Capital Times, a paper in Madison, answered an \nimportant question I am often asked when people want to know why a \nSenator from Wisconsin would cosponsor legislation to protect lands in \nUtah. He wrote on September 13, 1995 simply that ``These are not scenes \nthat you could see in Wisconsin. That's part of what makes them \nspecial.'' He continues, and adds what I think is an even more \nimportant reason to act to protect these lands than the landscape's \nuniqueness, ``the fight over wilderness lands in Utah is a test case of \nsorts. The anti-environmental factions in Congress are trying hard to \nremove restrictions on development in some of the Nation's most \nsplendid areas.''\n  Wisconsinites are watching this test case closely. I believe, Mr. \nPresident, that Wisconsinites view the outcome of this fight to save \nUtah's lands as a sign of where the Nation is headed with respect to \nits stewardship of natural resources in Wisconsin. For example, some in \nmy home State believe that among Federal lands that comprise the \nApostle Islands National Lakeshore and the Nicolet and Chequamegon \nNational Forests there are lands that are deserving of wilderness \nprotection. I know first hand what spectacular and special places these \nFederal properties are, and what they mean to the people of Wisconsin. \nWisconsinites want to know that, should additional lands in Wisconsin \nbe brought forward for wilderness designation, the type of protection \nthey expect from Federal law is still available to be extended because \nit had been properly extended to other places of national significance.\n  What Haslanger's Capital Times comments make clear is that while some \nin Congress may express concern about creating new wilderness in Utah, \nwilderness, as Wisconsinites know, is not created by legislation. \nLegislation to protect existing wilderness insures that future \ngenerations may have an experience on public lands equal to that which \nis available today. The action of Congress to preserve wild lands by \nextending the protections of the Wilderness Act of 1964 publicly \ncodifies that expectation and promise.\n  Finally, and perhaps the most important reason why this legislation \nis receiving my support, and deserves the support of others in this \nbody, is that all of the 5.7 million acres that will be protected under \nthis bill are already public lands held in trust by the Federal \nGovernment. Thus, while they are physically located in Utah, their \npreservation is important to the citizens of Wisconsin as it is for \nothers.\n  I am eager to work with my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, to \nprotect these lands. I commend him for introducing this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 774. A bill to provide for the stabilization, enhancement, \nrestoration, and management of the Coeur d'Alene River basin watershed; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n  the coeur d'alene river basin environmental restoration act of 1997\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing, with the \ncosponsorship of Senator Kempthorne, the Coeur d'Alene River Basin \nEnvironmental Restoration Act of 1997. This legislation would allow for \na workable solution to clean up the historic effects of mining on the \nCoeur d'Alene Basin in North Idaho. This bill is similar to a bill (S. \n1614) I introduced in the last Congress.\n  This legislation establishes a process that is centered around an \naction plan developed between the Governor of the State of Idaho and a \nCitizens Advisory Commission comprised of fourteen representatives of \naffected State and Federal government agencies, private citizens, the \nCoeur d'Alene Indian Tribe; and affected industries. The \nresponsibilities of this Commission are very important to the ultimate \nsuccess of cleaning up the Basin. I would like to note that a \nCommission that mirrors the one in this legislation was created by the \nIdaho legislature and that legislation was signed into law by Governor \nPhil Batt. I am indeed pleased that Idaho has put in place the citizen \ncommittee that is the crux of this plan to clean up the Silver Valley.\n  The Silver Valley of North Idaho has made contributions to the \nnational economy and to all of our country's war efforts for well over \na century. The federal government has been involved in every phase of \nmineral production over the history of the Valley. It is, therefore, \nappropriate that Congress specifically legislate a resolution of \nnatural resources damages in the Coeur d'Alene Basin and participate in \nfunding such a plan.\n  I want to make clear this legislation does not interfere with the \nongoing Superfund cleanup within the 21-square mile Bunker Hill site. \nThis legislation sets up a framework for voluntary cleanup of affected \nareas outside this 21-square mile area. In drafting this legislation, I \nhave worked with the mining industry, the Coeur d'Alene tribe, local \ngovernments, the Governor of Idaho, and citizens in North Idaho. It is \nonly through the involvement of all these parties that a solution will \nbe reached.\n  Throughout this effort it has been clear that all parties want the \nBasin cleaned up, and they want the cleanup done with the concerns of \nlocal citizens and entities addressed and with controls and cleanup \ndecisions made in Idaho, not in Washington, DC. These are the guiding \nprinciples that I have applied in developing this legislation.\n  Local cleanup has already begun in the headwaters of the Basin's \ndrainage. Nine Mile Creek and Canyon Creek have had proven engineering \ndesigns implemented within their drainages. The Coeur d'Alene River \nBasin Environmental Restoration Act of 1997 would assure this type of \nmeaningful restoration could continue. However, the actions needed in \neach part of the Basin are not clear. That is why my bill calls for the \nGovernor of Idaho and the Citizens Advisory Commission to develop an \nAction Plan that can address the varying conditions within the\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\nBasin. For example, engineering solutions will certainly work in \nportions of the Basin--but not every place. The steeper gradient \nstreams in the upper Basin respond well to engineering fixes, but these \ntypes of fixes may only exacerbate problems in the lower, flatter \nportions of the Basin. Local input and control through the action plan \ncan address such diversity and the need for varying environmental \nfixes.\n  The Department of Justice is currently pursuing a lawsuit for alleged \nnatural resources damages in the area addressed by this legislation. \nFor the federal government to follow such a course is folly. When the \nfederal government litigates under Superfund, the members of the legal \nprofession benefit, as litigation eats away at whatever resources are \navailable for a cleanup. Litigation does not benefit the citizens \naffected by a cleanup and certainly does not benefit the resources that \nare purported to be the primary consideration when such a suit is \npursued. I do not intend to see cleanup resources in North Idaho \nsquandered in litigation. It is my goal to see that Coeur d'Alene Basin \ncleanup is not litigated away. That is the reason we have introduced \nthis legislation. it will clean up the Basin, not litigiously waste the \nBasin's resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Grams, Mr. D'Amato, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, Mr. Grassley and Ms. Snowe):\n\n  S. 775. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \ngain or loss from the sale of livestock from the computation of capital \ngain net income for purposes of the earned-income credit; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             The Earned-Income Credit Fairness Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill along with \nSenator Kohl and several of my colleagues which will amend the earned-\nincome credit to restore fairness to low-income dairy farmers across \nthe country.\n  Last year during the debate over welfare reform, Congress tightened \nup on the requirements for eligibility for the EIC. The law was amended \nto prevent taxpayers with investment assets from claiming the EIC, our \nrationale being that taxpayers with substantial investment assets \nshould sell those assets rather than rely on the EIC to supplement \ntheir income. Specifically, the law now reads that if you have over \n$2,200 in disqualified income, you cannot claim the EIC.\n  The earned-income credit (EIC) is a credit against tax available to \nlow-income working taxpayers. The credit is refundable; in other words, \neven if you don't owe any income tax, the Government may still give you \na refund. In this way, the credit is a kind of income assistance to \nlow-income taxpayers, encouraging them to keep working.\n  Mr. President, the problem lies in that the IRS has interpreted the \nterm disqualified income to include gains realized by dairy farmers \nwhen they cull and sell cows no longer suitable for dairy farming. I \ndisagree with the IRS' interpretation, as do many of my colleagues. In \nmy view, culled dairy cows are not investment assets. When farmers cull \nand sell cows no longer fit for dairy farming, they're not cashing in \non their investments. To the contrary, they're cutting their losses. \nAnd we should not automatically expect proceeds from these sales to be \navailable to support the farmer's day-to-day living expenses. Farmers \nmay not be able to use this money to put food on his or her family's \ntable or clothing on his family's back. He or she may have to pump \nthese funds back into the dairy operation. If the farmer intends to \nmaintain a viable dairy farm, he or she may use proceeds from the sale \nof a culled cow to acquire another cow suitable for dairy farming. So, \nI think it is wrong that these sale proceeds should make the low-income \ndairy farmer ineligible for the EIC.\n  The IRS' interpretation will result in the loss of income from \nthousands of struggling dairy farmers across the country. Dairy farmers \nhave experienced a 25-percent decline in milk prices in recent months \nand for years have been faced with unstable and low milk prices. Based \non the Farm Credit's analysis, the current IRS position would cost \nVermont dairy farmers nearly $1 million in refunds and/or increased tax \nbills. Dairy farmers across the country will be adversely impacted by \nthe current position of the IRS. The greatest impact will be in States \nthat have a high number of small- and mid-sized family dairy \noperations. Losses to the Nation's dairy farmers have been estimated to \nbe as much as $76 million.\n  In short, in my view, when the income generated by a farmer's dairy \noperations is otherwise modest, he or she should not become ineligible \nfor the EIC when he or she has the misfortune to discover that some of \nhis or her dairy cows are nonproductive and disposes of those \nnonproductive assets at a profit.\n  Because I disagree with the IRS interpretation, I, together with 16 \ncolleagues, wrote to IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson on March 13, \n1997, to challenge the IRS interpretation of the EIC. Unfortunately, \nthe IRS has maintained that its interpretation is correct. Accordingly, \ntoday I am introducing this bill, along with several of my colleagues, \nto overturn what we believe is an unwise and unwarranted interpretation \nby the IRS. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 1997.\n     Hon. Margaret Milner Richardson,\n     Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Commissioner Richardson: We are writing because some \n     of our constituent dairy farmers have brought to our \n     attention their concern about a potentially adverse impact to \n     them that may result from an IRS interpretation of the earned \n     income credit (26 U.S.C. Sec. 32). Our constituents have \n     informed us that in conversations with taxpayers, IRS \n     personnel have indicated that a low-income dairy farmer may \n     become ineligible to claim the EIC if he decides to cull from \n     his herd a cow no longer suitable for dairy farming, and \n     subsequently sells the cow, realizing a gain of $2,200 or \n     more.\n       We believe that this interpretation is incorrect. Section \n     32 of the Internal Revenue Code allows low-income taxpayers a \n     refundable credit against tax. Under Sec. 32(i)(1), this \n     earned income credit (EIC) is not available to taxpayers with \n     more than $2,200 in disqualified income. ``Disqualified \n     income'' is defined to include ``capital gain net income'' \n     for the taxable year.\n       According to our constituents, the IRS has characterized \n     gains from the sale of culled cows as ``capital gain net \n     income.'' For the definition of ``capital gain net income,'' \n     Sec. 32(i)(1)(D) specifically references the definition of \n     that term in Sec. 1222. Section 1222(9) defines ``capital \n     gain net income'' as the excess of gains from sales of \n     ``capital assets'' over such losses from such sales.\n       We do not believe that culled cows are ``capital assets.'' \n     As defined in Sec. 1221(2), the term ``capital asset'' does \n     not include ``property used in the trade or business.'' \n     Section 1231(b) defines the term ``property used in the trade \n     or business,'' and subsection (b)(3) specifically defines \n     cattle held by a taxpayer for 24 months or more for dairy \n     purposes as ``property used in the trade or business.'' It \n     would follow, then, that any gains resulting from the sale of \n     such cattle are not gains from sales of capital assets giving \n     rise to ``capital gain net income.'' Accordingly, we do not \n     believe that Sec. 32(i)(1)(D) disqualifies a dairy farmer \n     from claiming the EIC because of gains realized from sales of \n     culled cows.\n       We request that the IRS review and summarize the \n     applicability of Sec. 32(i)(1)(D) to low-income dairy farmers \n     who realize gains of $2,200 or more upon the sale of culled \n     cows that they have held for more than two years. We also \n     request that you summarize what tax treatment would result if \n     the culled cows had not been held for two years. We look \n     forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jim Jeffords, Alfonse D'Amato, Jeff Sessions, Bob Smith, \n           Patrick Leahy, Chris Dodd, Susan M. Collins, Jack Reed, \n           Joe Biden, Mike DeWine, Chuck Grassley, Rick Santorum, \n           Herb Kohl, Rob Grams, Olympia Snowe, Russ Feingold, \n           Judd Gregg.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-author of this \nimportant legislation, which Senator Jeffords and I, and many others, \nintroduce today on behalf of all of our nation's farmers.\n  Let me begin by thanking my colleague from Vermont for his help and \nleadership on this issue. The economic health of our agricultural \neconomy is paramount to both of our regions, and to the country at \nlarge. And tax provisions related to agriculture, whether it be the \nearned income credit [EIC] or other provisions, have repercussions \nthroughout our agricultural economy.\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\n In the two regions that Senator Jeffords and I represent, dairy \nfarming is of particular importance. And it is with our dairy farmers \nin mind that we feel an urgency in introducing this legislation. \nBecause while the tax policy change that we are seeking to undo affects \nmany livestock producers, it is the dairy farmers who are the hardest \nhit.\n  Mr. President, our legislation will clarify that the sale of \nlivestock should not be treated as capital gain net income for purposes \nof the EIC. As you may know, in last year's welfare bill, we took steps \nto tighten eligibility to the EIC, a refundable tax credit available \nonly to lower income, working Americans. We did so to ensure further \nthat, in a time of limited Federal resources, the EIC was benefiting \nthose that it was intended to benefit--the working poor--those who have \njobs but who often need extra help to avoid turning to public \nassistance. For many facing tough financial times and struggling to \nsupport their families, the EIC has been the difference between hard \nwork and a hand out, between self-worth and self-doubt. And for many \ndairy farmers in Wisconsin, the EIC has helped pay seed bills and farm \noperating expenses and put food on kitchen tables.\n  One of several EIC provisions approved by Congress last year expanded \nthe category of disqualified income to include capital gain net income. \nAs such, under current law, if a taxpayer reports more than $2,200 in \ncapital gain net income, he or she is automatically disqualified from \ncollecting the EIC.\n  On its face, this tax policy adjustment seems reasonable. Most \npolicymakers would agree that an individual who realizes substantial \ncapital gain income from the sale of capital assets in any given year \nshould not be eligible for a tax credit for the working poor. The House \nCommittee report confirms as much.\n\n  That said, however, we are here today because a subsequent IRS \ninterpretation of that adjustment has restricted EIC eligibility in \nsuch a way that we believe goes far beyond congressional intent--\ndistorting the purpose of last year's reforms and denying the credit to \na population of hard working Americans that the EIC was designed to \nhelp--small- and mid-sized family farmers.\n  Specifically, the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] has interpreted \ncapital gain income to include income generated by the sale of culled \ncows for purposes of the EIC. Further, the IRS argues that dairy cows \nrepresent the type of assets Congress would expect a taxpayer to sell \nto cover living expenses in lieu of claiming the credit.\n  Mr. President, though I do not question their good intentions, I \nbelieve the IRS is misguided.\n  As you may know, farmers sell cows no longer suited for dairy farming \nas a matter of course. It is a standard part of a farmer's business. \nAnd in times of low prices or economic stress, it can play an even more \nimportant role when some farmers are driven to cull cows more quickly \nthan they otherwise would. In addition, the Tax Code defines dairy \ncattle held by a taxpayer for a certain period of time as property used \nin a trade or business, specifying that such property is excluded from \nthe definition of capital assets. Since dairy cattle are not capital \nassets, it follows that sales of cattle should not give rise to capital \ngain income for EIC purposes.\n  For our Nation's dairy farmers, this unfair policy change has come at \na particularly cruel time, when milk prices have declined \nprecipitously, and many have been forced to cull cows to make ends \nmeet. Yet instead of stretching the family budget, they learn that \ntheir actions have actually resulted in thousands of dollars in extra \ntaxes, leaving them worse off than before.\n  The consequences for my home State have been devastating. In a sample \nof cases from a seven-county area in the eastern part of the State, the \naverage loss of Federal and State EIC benefits to farmers has been \n$2,111 per family. And these are families with between one and seven \nchildren. The total loss to the approximately 12,000 Wisconsin dairy \nfarms eligible for the EIC is estimated at $15.5 million.\n  Denying the EIC to family farmers on the basis of culled cows sales \nis wrong. It is wrong, unfair, and Congress should act swiftly to \ncorrect it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation of \nnational significance and help ensure the EIC continues to benefit \nthose for whom Congress intended.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am proud to be a leading co-sponsor of \nlegislation introduced today with my friend and colleague, Senator Jim \nJeffords of Vermont. The Earned Income Credit (EIC) Fairness Act of \n1997 is a direct response to back-door efforts by the Internal Revenue \nService to raise revenue on the backs of family farmers. This \nlegislation simply clarifies the intent of Congress by preserving this \nimportant tax credit for our Nation's dairy farmers.\n  I want to thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership on this issue. My \ncolleague from Vermont and I have differed from time to time on what is \nbest for the Nation's dairy industry in the way of federal dairy \npolicy. However, I have always had a profound respect for his hard work \nand genuine commitment to Vermont's dairy farmers. They have in Senator \nJeffords a tireless advocate in the U.S. Senate.\n  I also want to commend Mike Foley, a teacher and dairy farmer from \nMelrose, MN for bringing this issue to my attention. Like other \nproblems created by IRS misinterpretations of Congressional intent--\nincluding the alternative minimum tax [AMT] and the self-employment tax \nproblems--few knew of the EIC problem and the hardship it would \nultimately cause. Thanks to Mike, we now have the opportunity to \nrestore the IRS to its proper role of carrying out current laws instead \nof creating new ones.\n  Mr. President, unless Congress acts on this legislation, the Nation's \ndairy farmers will be forced to pay $76 million in taxes they were \nnever intended to pay. In effect, this is an agency-created $76 million \ntax hike on hard working, generally low-income, dairy producers. For \ndairy farmers in Minnesota, the tax hike would amount to about $6 \nmillion. As a boy who grew up on a dairy farm, I know all too well how \nhard dairy farmers must work to make ends meet. Long hours. Early \nmornings. Late nights. The vacations--even for a day--which a lot of us \ntake for granted are unthinkable for most of our dairy producers. This \nis especially true for the dairy producers who would be hit hardest by \nthe new IRS-imposed tax hike. This is wrong. Wrong because the IRS has \nno business raising taxes by agency fiat. And, wrong because of the \nsevere hardship the tax hike would impose on our Nation's dairy \nproducers.\n  During consideration of the 1996 Farm Bill, we promised our farmers \nlong overdue tax relief, regulatory relief, improved risk management \nand research, and free and fair trade. My request of the \nadministration, particularly the IRS, is simple. If you don't want to \nhelp keep this promise to America's farmers, simply step aside and at \nleast don't hinder those of us who do.\n  I urge my colleagues to give the EIC Fairness Act of 1997 speedy \nconsideration and passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \n        Grams, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 777. A bill to authorize the construction of the Lewis and Clark \nRural Water System and to authorize assistance to the Lewis and Clark \nRural Water System, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, for planning and \nconstruction of the water supply system, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I am proud to be introducing \nlegislation, along with my colleagues, the Minority Leader Senator \nDaschle of South Dakota, Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley of Iowa, \nand Senator Wellstone and Senator Grams of Minnesota, to authorize the \nLewis and Clark Rural Water System. I introduced similar legislation \nlast year as a Member of the House of Representatives during the 104th \nCongress. I look forward to again working closely with my colleagues \nfor timely consideration of this important measure.\n  The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System is made up of 22 rural water \nsystems and communities in southeastern South Dakota, northwestern \nIowa,\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\nand southwestern Minnesota who have joined together in an effort to \ncooperatively address the dual problems facing the delivery of drinking \nwater in this region--inadequate quantities of water and poor quality \nwater.\n  This region has seen substantial growth and development in recent \nyears, and studies have shown that future water needs will be \nsignificantly greater than the current available supply. Most of the \npeople who are served by 10 of the water utilities in the proposed \nLewis and Clark project area currently enforce water restrictions on a \nseasonal basis. Almost half of the membership has water of such poor \nquality it does not meet present or proposed standards for drinking \nwater. More than two-thirds rely on shallow aquifers as their primary \nsource of drinking water, aquifers which are very vulnerable to \ncontamination by surface activities.\n  The Lewis and Clark system will be a supplemental supply of drinking \nwater for its 22 members, acting as a treated, bulk delivery system. \nThe distribution to deliver water to individual users will continue \nthrough the existing systems used by each member utility. This \nregionalization approach to solving these water supply and quality \nproblems enables the Missouri River to provide a source of clean, safe \ndrinking water to more than 180,000 individuals. A source of water \nwhich none of the members of Lewis and Clark could afford on their own.\n  The proposed system would help to stabilize the regional rural \neconomy by providing water to Sioux Falls, the hub city in the region, \nas well as numerous small communities and individual farms in South \nDakota and portions of Iowa and Minnesota.\n  The States of South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota have all authorized \nthe project and local sponsors have demonstrated a financial commitment \nto this project through State grants, local water development district \ngrants, and membership dues. The State of South Dakota has already \ncontributed more than $400,000.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe our needs get any more basic than \ngood quality, reliable drinking water, and I appreciate the fact that \nCongress has shown support for efforts to improve drinking water \nsupplies in South Dakota. I look forward to continue working with my \ncolleagues to have that support extended to the Lewis and Clark Rural \nWater System.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join my colleagues from South \nDakota, Iowa, and Minnesota in co-sponsoring Lewis and Clark Rural \nWater System Act of 1977, and I do so with great enthusiasm for what \nthis project could mean to the people in southwestern Minnesota, as \nwell as those in Iowa and South Dakota who have serious problems \nfinding adequate drinking water supplies.\n  Many of us never really have to think about where our water comes \nfrom, but for the people in Luverne and Worthington, Minnesota, it is a \nconstantly nagging question, Helping provide for this sort of basic \nneed is what I think government ought to be doing.\n  In a project like Lewis and Clark, governments at all levels have to \nwork together. Municipalities, states, and the federal government each \nwill have important roles to play, and each will have to carry a \nsignificant burden. And that is as it should be--in tough situations \nlike this, not only is there no free lunch, but there is also no free \nwater.\n  So today I am pleased to formally state my support for the Lewis and \nClark project by cosponsoring its authorization legislation. The Lewis \nand Clark Rural Water System project is sorely needed to provide safe \ndrinking water on a consistent basis for citizens in the tri-state \nregion of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa. For far too long \ncommunities in this region have faced great and sometimes overwhelming \nchallenges in finding safe and reliable sources of water for their \ncitizens. While many communities in our country have ample supplies of \ndrinking water, twenty-two communities in this tri-state area are not \nso lucky. Shallow aquifers and high water tables have left many water \nsystems in the region constantly searching for potable water. Even when \nthese communities have managed to find sources of water, many times the \nwater has been contaminated with unsafe levels of nitrates and \nbacteria, as well as high levels of naturally occurring iron and \nmanganese.\n  While the lack of water, reliable water sources affects the health of \nthese citizens in the short-term, the economic vitality of these \ncommunities is adversely affected in the long-term. Rural communities \ncannot plan economic growth when they do not possess long-term sources \nof safe drinking water. Businesses are reluctant to locate in an area \nwhere such necessities are not guaranteed. Therefore, as a strong \nsupporter of rural economic development. I believe that this project \nwill benefit the economic welfare of citizens who live in this region.\n  I recognize that some concerns still exist about the impacts of this \nproject. I intend to work to improve the bill as it makes its way \nthrough the legislative process, and believe the concerns which some \nhave raised regarding the environmental impacts of this project will be \naddressed as the project moves forward. Work on this important bill \nwill likely be going on for some time, and I look forward to helping \nshape the final legislation and making the project a reality.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Daschle, \nJohnson, Grassley, Harkin, and Wellstone as a proud cosponsor of \nlegislation authorizing the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System. This \nmuch-needed legislation will help provide a long-term, high-quality \nwater supply from the Missouri River to over 180,000 individuals in \nportions of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa.\n  For too long, and to the detriment of community development, \nresidents of this region have been deprived of a sustainable water \nresource. In light of Minnesota's reputation as the ``land of 10,000 \nlakes,'' it might come as a surprise to hear my home state described as \nbeing desperately short on water supplies. The southwestern corner of \nthe state, however, is geographically very different from the rest of \nMinnesota. Rock County, which would be served by the Lewis and Clark \nsystem, is the only county in Minnesota without a natural lake.\n  Communities within the proposed water system are now served by \nshallow aquifers highly susceptible to drought, leading most of these \ncommunities to impose severe watering restrictions. The constant \ndeterioration of these aquifers is evidenced through the detection of \never-increasing nitrate levels that threaten the safety of current \ndrinking water. Moreover, increasing federal regulations have imposed \nexpensive, unfunded mandates on communities seeking to deliver clean \nand healthy water to their residents.\n  This situation has forced communities throughout the region to \naggressively explore alternative water supplies. Since 1989, the \ncommunity of Worthington, Minnesota has spent between $50,000 to \n$75,000 annually searching for another source of water, all without \nsuccess. The nearby community of Luverne, Minnesota has experienced the \nsame disappointing results despite its significant expenditures. It is \nlittle wonder struggling communities across this region have joined \ntogether to strongly support the Lewis and Clark proposal.\n  Bill Weber, the distinguished mayor of Luverne, Minnesota stated: \n``It made sense to us to combine our financial assets in building one \nsystem that can provide an alternative supply of drinking water for 22 \nsystems. The only other alternative was for each of us to continue as \nwe have in the past, exploring more costly alternatives that only \nhelped one at a time and alternatives, which in the case of Luverne \nappear to be nonexistent.''\n  Greg Degroot, President of Worthington Public Utilities, wrote that \nthe system ``will provide our community\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\nwith an alternative source of water that will give us some protection \nin the event of the loss of our existing water source and will also \nprovide the additional water that is necessary for our community to \ncontinue to prosper and grow.''\n  Mr. President, under our legislation, local communities will come \ntogether with the affected states and the federal government to form a \nstrong, financial partnership, thereby ensuring an adequate, safe water \nsupply while reducing the costs to the American taxpayers. In fact, \nwith our revised proposal, the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota--by \nfar the largest user of the proposed system--will pay 50% of the \nconstruction costs for its share of Lewis and Clark water.\n  Mr. President, providing healthy water to our communities is one of \nthe most basic functions of the government. It is not a partisan issue, \nand therefore I am proud to join with a bipartisan group of my \ncolleagues and the Governors of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa in \nsupporting this bill. We believe our legislation to be the best, most \ncost-effective answer to a severe and growing problem.\n  The time to enact this bipartisan legislation is now. As a member of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I look forward to working \nwith the distinguished Chairman, Senator Murkowski; Senator Johnson, \nthe primary sponsor of this legislation and a Committee member; the \nrest of our colleagues; and the Clinton Administration in providing \nmuch-needed relief to our communities. They deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nLewis and Clark Water System Act of 1997. This legislation will \nauthorize the construction of Lewis and Clark, along with a federal \ncommitment of assistance for construction. Lewis and Clark is designed \nto be a treated, bulk water delivery system for 22 communities and \nrural water systems located in northwest Iowa, southeast South Dakota, \nand southwest Minnesota. Within this tri-state area, over 200,000 \npersons will be assured of clean and safe drinking water from Lewis and \nClark.\n  Lewis and Clark is necessary to address poor water quality sources, \ninadequate water supplies, population growth, and increasing federal \nregulations that the member water systems are trying to deal with. In \nmany cases the drinking water currently delivered by Lewis and Clark's \nmembership exceeds secondary drinking water standards for iron, \nmanganese, sulfate, and total dissolved solids. Water of this quality \nis very difficult and expensive to treat. In Iowa, most of the involved \ndrinking water systems are at, or near, their capacity, and have \nserious water quality problems. An engineering feasibility study \ncompleted by the Bureau of Reclamation in September 1993 concluded the \nproject is technically feasible.\n  However, this project will not be economically viable without federal \nassistance. Because many rural areas and small communities are involved \nwith the project, the necessary financial resources do not exist to \nbring Lewis and Clark to completion. Through the Bureau of Reclamation \nstudy, each utility member determined that Lewis and Clark was the most \nfeasible and least costly alternative for meeting future drinking water \nneeds. It is estimated that this project will provide quality water at \na reasonable cost, an estimated 75 cents per 1,000 gallons.\n  Mr. President, this project represents a unique opportunity to bring \nsafe, clean, and affordable drinking water to hundreds of thousands of \npersons in a tri-state area. It is not often Congress has the \nopportunity to assist in a project that has the joint cooperation of \npersons from three states, and twenty-two communities and local water \nsystems. In an era when we see states and communities fighting for \nwater resources, Lewis and Clark represents a grass-roots effort of \nconcerned citizens, businesses, and government officials.\n  Lastly, I would like to add that this is a project that clearly fits \nthe characteristics of projects traditionally funded by the Bureau of \nReclamation. Given its broad support, critical needs, and clear merits, \nI urge the passage of this important legislation.\n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 778. A bill to authorize a new trade and investment policy for \nsub-Saharan African; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 The African Growth and Opportunity Act\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act. A similar bill has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives and is now cosponsored by nearly 50 Members. It enjoys \nthe support of many in the House leadership. I applaud the hard work of \nthose Members of the House who have toiled to draft proactive \nlegislation that would, if enacted, help re-shape our relationship with \ncountries in sub-Sahara Africa.\n  The bill I am introducing contains a range of trade, investment and \nreform incentives for economic growth that require little or no new \nspending. It reflects much of the administration's ``Partnership for \nEconomic Growth and Opportunity in Africa'' initiative which proposes \ngreater U.S. attention and priority to Africa. This bill proposes \nimportant trade and investment initiatives that would be available to \neligible African countries which pursue meaningful internal reforms--\nboth economic and political reform.\n  The bill would seek to provide a range of trade preferences and \nconcessions, including GSP and lower trade barriers, to eligible \ncountries embarking on economic and political liberalization. It seeks \nto encourage increased private sector investment flows by engaging OPIC \nand other government guarantees to create private equity and \ninfrastructure funds targeted on Africa. It proposes certain personnel \nchanges in various government agencies to give greater attention to \nAfrica and to facilitate U.S. trade and investment. It seeks the \ncooperation of international financial institutions to ease the heavy \ndebt burden of the poorest countries in Africa. And, it seeks the \ncooperation of other developed countries to join us in granting trade \nconcessions and other preferences to Africa.\n  To achieve sustained economic growth and political stability in \nAfrica, the private sector must be more fully engaged. They have the \ninvestment capital, they have the knowhow, and they have the will to \ntake calculated risks abroad. The private sector, however, will be more \ninterested in investment, trade and the technical assistance that \naccompany them, if countries make the hard decisions to liberalize \ntheir economies and open their political system to participation and \ngood governance. That process is underway in Africa, but much more \nneeds to be done.\n  This bill intends to increase our commercial and official contacts \nand interactions in recognition of the enormous potential for economic \ngrowth and development in Africa. It reflects the vast diversity of \npeople, cultures, economies, and potential among the forty-eight \ncountries and the more than 600 million people. It provides incentives \nand rewards to the growing number of countries embarking on a host of \neconomic and political reforms. These are reforms we should encourage \nand support. These changes are not only in the interests of African \nsocieties, they are in our interest as well. A stable and economically \nprosperous Africa will contribute to our commercial and security \ninterests.\n  The ``African Growth and Opportunity Act'', therefore, includes a \nrange of incentives and policy tools that would begin the long-overdue \nprocess of linking U.S. ties with Africa on trade and investment, not \nsolely on foreign assistance. We should be basing our relations with \nAfricans as partners, not just as aid recipients. For too long, \nAmerican policy towards Africa has concentrated on our foreign \nassistance programs which have resulted in little more than a series of \nbi-lateral donor-recipient relationships.\n  While helpful in promoting economic and political development, and in \nalleviating humanitarian crises and other social ills, our assistance \nprograms were never large enough to be effective in stimulating or \nsustaining real economic growth. They are still important and needed. \nBut, bilateral assistance, even when coupled with assistance from other \ndonor countries and from international banks and lending institutions, \nare insufficient by themselves to kick-start and sustain the economies \nof Africa. They have not been sufficient in eradicating contagious \ndiseases, in eliminating chronic poverty, or in ending the cycle of \nunder-development and recurring political turmoil.\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\n  Mr. President, we have neglected Africa's economic growth potential \nfor too many years. For too long, American interest in sub-Sahara \nAfrica was largely a function of our strategic considerations and \ntrade-offs during the Cold War period. Most Americans paid attention to \nAfrica only when there was a natural or man-made calamity or disaster. \nRegrettably, this has led to distortion and mis-information about the \nreal Africa. It has retarded interest in exploring opportunities in \nthis rich and diverse continent.\n  But, economic growth, political stability or the protection of human \nrights in Africa won't happen by themselves or by the actions of the \nU.S. The leadership in Africa must make it happen by their actions and \ndecisions. We should encourage and respond to those countries and those \nleaders who are making the difficult decisions to implement economic \nand political reform.\n  There is little doubt that those African countries which have \nembarked on the road to economic and political reform are beginning to \nreap the kind of benefits known in other regions of the world, such as \nEast Asia. Several countries already enjoy multi-year economic growth \nin the five, six to ten percent range. Uganda, for example, had a \ngrowth rate of 10% in l995 and Ethiopia exceeded that level last year. \nMore than 30 countries in sub-Sahara Africa have already initiated \neconomic reform programs and some twenty-five countries have conducted \nopen elections.\n\n  Many countries have begun to liberalize their exchange rates and \nprices, privatize state-owned enterprises, reduce expensive state \nsubsidies and cut back on impediments to trade and investment. These \nsteps and others will help African economies grow.\n  African trade barriers are more onerous than those in the faster \ngrowing economies in the developing world. Import tariffs are three and \na half times higher than those in faster growing countries in the \ndeveloping world. Along with non-tariff restrictions and assorted \nprotectionist practices, these practices have hurt the competitiveness \nof Africa exports. They inflict trade losses that match or exceed the \ntotal levels of aid to Africa. As these barriers to trade and \ninvestment are eased and eliminated, they will open the way for \neconomic growth and assist American entrepreneurs by opening their \nmarkets to our goods and services.\n  It may interest members to know that U.S. trade with sub-Saharan \nAfrica grew by more than 18% last year. For the second consecutive \nyear, the growth in U.S. trade in sub-Sahara Africa outdistanced \nAmerica's overall growth in world trade. No one who has sought to \ninvest or trade in Africa will deny that doing so has been difficult, \nbut few would deny that the many opportunities exist.\n  U.S. trade with Africa amounts to only about one percent of total \nU.S. trade and U.S. investment there totals less than one percent of \nall U.S. direct investment overseas. This, despite the fact that \nroughly forty per cent of all America exports now go to developing \ncountries where the greatest growth in U.S. trade and exports in recent \nyears has taken place.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I am \nintroducing this bill to stimulate interest and to encourage serious \ndebate in the Senate on re-orienting U.S. policy towards Africa. \nWithout question, we have a genuine interest in Africa that is only now \nbeing recognized. Enactment of this bill will help create an \nenvironment in which the private sector will become more fully engaged \nin the economic development and growth and political modernization of \nAfrica. If that happens, it will be very much in the interest of the \nUnited States.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take note of this bill, \nconsider its merits, explore the growing potential for U.S. exports and \ninvestment and consider the prospects for revising and broadening our \noverall relationship with sub-Sahara Africa.\n  If we do so, our country will be a major economic and security \nbeneficiary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act be printed in full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 778\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``African Growth and \n     Opportunity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that it is in the mutual economic \n     interest of the United States and sub-Saharan Africa to \n     promote stable and sustainable economic growth and \n     development in sub-Saharan Africa. To that end, the United \n     States seeks to facilitate the social and economic \n     development of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa in a \n     manner which strengthens and expands market-led economic \n     growth consistent with equitable and efficient development \n     and which reduces poverty and increases employment among the \n     poor. In particular, the United States seeks to assist sub-\n     Saharan African countries to achieve economic self-reliance \n     by--\n       (1) strengthening and expanding the private sector in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, especially women-owned businesses;\n       (2) encouraging increased trade and investment between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) reducing tariff and nontariff barriers and other trade \n     obstacles;\n       (4) expanding United States assistance to sub-Saharan \n     Africa's regional integration efforts;\n       (5) negotiating free trade areas;\n       (6) establishing a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade \n     and Investment Partnership;\n       (7) focusing on countries committed to accountable \n     government, economic reform, and the eradication of poverty;\n       (8) establishing a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa \n     Economic Cooperation Forum; and\n       (9) continuing to support development assistance for those \n     countries in sub-Saharan Africa attempting to build civil \n     societies.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress supports economic self-reliance for sub-\n     Saharan African countries, particularly those committed to--\n       (1) economic and political reform;\n       (2) market incentives and private sector growth;\n       (3) the eradication of poverty; and\n       (4) the importance of women to economic growth and \n     development.\n\n     SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A sub-Saharan African country shall be \n     eligible to participate in programs, projects, or activities, \n     or receive assistance or other benefits under this Act for a \n     fiscal year only if the President determines that the country \n     has established, or is making continual progress toward \n     establishing, a market-based economy, such as the \n     establishment and enforcement of appropriate policies \n     relating to--\n       (1) promoting free movement of goods and services and \n     factors of production between the United States and sub-\n     Saharan Africa;\n       (2) promoting the expansion of the production base and the \n     transformation of commodities and nontraditional products for \n     exports through joint venture projects between African and \n     United States companies;\n       (3) trade issues, such as protection of intellectual \n     property rights, improvements in standards, testing, labeling \n     and certification, and government procurement;\n       (4) the protection of property rights, such as protection \n     against expropriation and a functioning and fair judicial \n     system;\n       (5) tax issues, such as reducing high import and corporate \n     taxes, controlling government consumption, participation in \n     bilateral investment treaties, and the harmonization of such \n     treaties to avoid double taxation;\n       (6) foreign investment issues, such as the provision of \n     national treatment for foreign investors and other measures \n     to attract foreign investors;\n       (7) supporting the growth of regional markets within a free \n     trade area framework;\n       (8) regulatory issues, such as eliminating government \n     corruption, minimizing government intervention in the market, \n     monitoring the fiscal and monetary policies of the \n     government, and supporting the growth of the private sector, \n     in particular by promoting the emergence of a new generation \n     of African entrepreneurs;\n       (9) encouraging the private ownership of government-\n     controlled economic enterprises through divestiture programs;\n       (10) removing restrictions on investment; and\n       (11) the reduction of poverty, such as the provision of \n     basic health and education for poor citizens, the expansion \n     of physical infrastructure in a manner designed to maximize \n     accessibility, increased access to market and credit \n     facilities for small farmers and producers, and improved \n     economic opportunities for women as entrepreneurs and \n     employees.\n       (b) Additional Factors.--In determining whether a sub-\n     Saharan African country is eligible under subsection (a), the \n     President shall take into account the following factors:\n       (1) An expression by such country of its desire to be an \n     eligible country under subsection (a).\n       (2) The extent to which such country has made substantial \n     progress toward--\n       (A) reducing tariff levels;\n       (B) binding its tariffs in the World Trade Organization and \n     assuming meaningful binding obligations in other sectors of \n     trade; and\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\n       (C) eliminating nontariff barriers to trade.\n       (3) Whether such country, if not already a member of the \n     World Trade Organization, is actively pursuing membership in \n     that Organization.\n       (4) The extent to which such country is in material \n     compliance with its programs with and its obligation to the \n     International Monetary Fund and other international financial \n     institutions.\n       (c) Continuing Compliance.--\n       (1) Monitoring and review of certain countries.--The \n     President shall monitor and review the progress of those sub-\n     Saharan African countries that have been determined to be \n     eligible under subsection (a) but are in need of making \n     continual progress in meeting one or more of the requirements \n     of such subsection.\n       (2) Ineligibility of certain countries.--A sub-Saharan \n     African country described in paragraph (1) that has not made \n     continual progress in meeting the requirements with which it \n     is not in compliance shall be ineligible to participate in \n     programs, projects, or activities, or receive assistance or \n     other benefits, under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES AND INCREASED FLEXIBILITY TO \n                   PROVIDE ASSISTANCE UNDER THE DEVELOPMENT FUND \n                   FOR AFRICA.\n\n       (a) Use of Sustainable Development Assistance To Support \n     Further Economic Growth.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that sustained economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa depends \n     in large measure upon the development of a receptive \n     environment for trade and investment, and that to achieve \n     this objective the United States Agency for International \n     Development should continue to support programs which help to \n     create this environment. Investments in human resources, \n     development, and implementation of free market policies, \n     including policies to liberalize agricultural markets and \n     improve food security, and the support for the rule of law \n     and democratic governance should continue to be encouraged \n     and enhanced on a bilateral and regional basis.\n       (b) Declarations of Policy.--The Congress makes the \n     following declarations:\n       (1) The Development Fund for Africa established under \n     chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2293 et seq.) has been an effective tool in \n     providing development assistance to sub-Saharan Africa since \n     1988.\n       (2) The Development Fund for Africa will complement the \n     other provisions of this Act and lay a foundation for \n     increased trade and investment opportunities between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (3) Assistance provided through the Development Fund for \n     Africa will continue to support programs and activities that \n     promote the long term economic development of sub-Saharan \n     Africa, such as programs and activities relating to the \n     following:\n       (A) Strengthening primary and vocational education systems, \n     especially the acquisition of middle-level technical skills \n     for operating modern private businesses and the introduction \n     of college level business education, including the study of \n     international business, finance, and stock exchanges.\n       (B) Strengthening health care systems.\n       (C) Strengthening family planning service delivery systems.\n       (D) Supporting democratization, good governance and civil \n     society and conflict resolution efforts.\n       (E) Increasing food security by promoting the expansion of \n     agricultural and agriculture-based industrial production and \n     productivity and increasing real incomes for poor \n     individuals.\n       (F) Promoting an enabling environment for private sector-\n     led growth through sustained economic reform, privatization \n     programs, and market-led economic activities.\n       (G) Promoting decentralization and local participation in \n     the development process, especially linking the rural \n     production sectors and the industrial and market centers \n     throughout Africa.\n       (H) Increasing the technical and managerial capacity of \n     sub-Saharan African individuals to manage the economy of sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       (I) Ensuring sustainable economic growth through \n     environmental protection.\n       (4) The African Development Foundation has a unique \n     congressional mandate to empower the poor to participate \n     fully in development and to increase opportunities for \n     gainful employment, poverty alleviation, and more equitable \n     income distribution in sub-Saharan Africa. The African \n     Development Foundation has worked successfully to enhance the \n     role of women as agents of change, strengthen the informal \n     sector with an emphasis on supporting micro and small sized \n     enterprises, indigenous technologies, and mobilizing local \n     financing. The African Development Foundation should develop \n     and implement strategies for promoting participation in the \n     socioeconomic development process of grassroots and informal \n     sector groups such as nongovernmental organizations, \n     cooperatives, artisans, and traders into the programs and \n     initiatives established under this Act.\n       (c) Additional Authorities.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 496(h) of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2293(h)) is amended--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and\n       (B) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n       ``(3) Democratization and conflict resolution \n     capabilities.--Assistance under this section may also include \n     program assistance--\n       ``(A) to promote democratization, good governance, and \n     strong civil societies in sub-Saharan Africa; and\n       ``(B) to strengthen conflict resolution capabilities of \n     governmental, intergovernmental, and nongovernmental entities \n     in sub-Saharan \n     Africa.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 496(h)(4) of such Act, \n     as amended by paragraph (1), is further amended by striking \n     ``paragraphs (1) and (2)'' in the first sentence and \n     inserting ``paragraphs (1), (2), and (3)''.\n       (d) Waiver Authority.--Section 496 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2293) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Waiver Authority.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     President may waive any provision of law that earmarks, for a \n     specified country, organization, or purpose, funds made \n     available to carry out this chapter if the President \n     determines that the waiver of such provision of law would \n     provide increased flexibility in carrying out this chapter.\n       ``(2) Exceptions.--\n       ``(A) Child survival activities.--The authority contained \n     in paragraph (1) may not be used to waive a provision of law \n     that earmarks funds made available to carry out this chapter \n     for the following purposes:\n       ``(i) Immunization programs.\n       ``(ii) Oral rehydration programs.\n       ``(iii) Health and nutrition programs, and related \n     education programs, which address the needs of mothers and \n     children.\n       ``(iv) Water and sanitation programs.\n       ``(v) Assistance for displaced and orphaned children.\n       ``(vi) Programs for the prevention, treatment, and control \n     of, and research on, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, polio, malaria, \n     and other diseases.\n       ``(vii) Basic education programs for children.\n       ``(viii) Contribution on a grant basis to the United \n     Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) pursuant to section 301 of \n     this Act.\n       ``(B) Requirement to supersede waiver authority.--The \n     provisions of this subsection shall not be superseded except \n     by a provision of law enacted after the date of the enactment \n     of the African Growth and Opportunity Act which specifically \n     repeals, modifies, or supersedes such provisions.''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

UNITED STATES-SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA FREE TRADE AREA.\n\n       (a) Declaration of Policy.--The Congress declares that a \n     United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Free Trade Area should be \n     established, or free trade agreements should be entered into, \n     in order to serve as the catalyst for increasing trade \n     between the United\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\n     States and sub-Saharan Africa and increasing private sector \n     development in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (b) Plan Requirement.--\n       (1) In general.--The President, taking into account the \n     provisions of the treaty establishing the African Economic \n     Community and the willingness of the governments of Sub-\n     Saharan African countries to engage in negotiations to enter \n     into free trade agreements, shall develop a plan for the \n     purpose of entering into one or more trade agreements with \n     sub-Saharan African countries eligible under section 4 in \n     order to establish a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Free \n     Trade Area (hereafter in this section referred to as the \n     ``Free Trade Area'').\n       (2) Elements of plan.--The plan shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) The specific objectives of the United States with \n     respect to the establishment of the Free Trade Area and a \n     suggested timetable for achieving those objectives.\n       (B) The benefits to both the United States and sub-Saharan \n     Africa with respect to the Free Trade Area.\n       (C) A mutually agreed-upon timetable for establishing the \n     Free Trade Area.\n       (D) The implications for and the role of regional and sub-\n     regional organizations in sub-Saharan Africa with respect to \n     the Free Trade Area.\n       (E) Subject matter anticipated to be covered by the \n     agreement for establishing the Free Trade Area and United \n     States laws, programs, and policies, as well as the laws of \n     participating eligible African countries and existing \n     bilateral and multilateral and economic cooperation and trade \n     agreements, that may be affected by the agreement or \n     agreements.\n       (F) Procedures to ensure the following:\n       (i) Adequate consultation with the Congress and the private \n     sector during the negotiation of the agreement or agreements \n     for establishing the Free Trade Area.\n       (ii) Consultation with the Congress regarding all matters \n     relating to implementation of the agreement or agreements.\n       (iii) Approval by the Congress of the agreement or \n     agreements.\n       (iv) Adequate consultations with the relevant African \n     governments and African regional and subregional \n     intergovernmental organizations during the negotiations of \n     the agreement or agreements.\n       (c) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than 12 months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall \n     prepare and transmit to the Congress a report containing the \n     plan developed pursuant to subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 8. ELIMINATING TRADE BARRIERS AND ENCOURAGING EXPORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The lack of competitiveness of sub-Saharan Africa in \n     the global market, especially in the manufacturing sector, \n     make it a limited threat to market disruption and no threat \n     to United States jobs.\n       (2) Annual textile and apparel exports to the United States \n     from sub-Saharan Africa represent less than 1 percent of all \n     textile and apparel exports to the United States, which \n     totaled $45,932,000,000 in 1996.\n       (3) Sub-Saharan Africa has limited textile manufacturing \n     capacity. During 1998 and the succeeding 4 years, this \n     limited capacity to manufacture textiles and apparel is \n     projected to grow at a modest rate. Given this limited \n     capacity to export textiles and apparel, it will be very \n     difficult for these exports from sub-Saharan Africa, during \n     1998 and the succeeding 9 years, to exceed 3 percent annually \n     of total imports of textile and apparel to the United States. \n     If these exports from sub-Saharan Africa remain around 3 \n     percent of total imports, they will not represent a threat to \n     United States workers, consumers, or manufacturers.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) it would be to the mutual benefit of the countries in \n     sub-Saharan Africa and the United States to ensure that the \n     commitments of the World Trade Organization and associated \n     agreements are faithfully implemented in each of the member \n     countries, so as to lay the groundwork for sustained growth \n     in textile and apparel exports and trade under agreed rules \n     and disciplines;\n       (2) reform of trade policies in sub-Saharan Africa with the \n     objective of removing structural impediments to trade, \n     consistent with obligations under the World Trade \n     Organization, can assist the countries of the region in \n     achieving greater and greater diversification of textile and \n     apparel export commodities and products and export markets; \n     and\n       (3) the President should support textile and apparel trade \n     reform in sub-Saharan Africa by, among other measures, \n     providing technical assistance, sharing of information to \n     expand basic knowledge of how to trade with the United \n     States, and encouraging business-to-business contacts with \n     the region.\n       (c) Treatment of Quotas.--\n       (1) Kenya and mauritius.--Pursuant to the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing, the United States shall eliminate the \n     existing quotas on textile and apparel exports to the United \n     States--\n       (A) from Kenya within 30 days after that country adopts a \n     cost-effective and efficient visa system to guard against \n     unlawful transshipment of textile and apparel goods; and\n       (B) from Mauritius within 30 days after that country adopts \n     such a visa system.\n     The Customs Service shall provide the necessary assistance to \n     Kenya and Mauritius in the development and implementation of \n     those visa systems. The Customs Service shall monitor and the \n     Commissioner of Customs shall submit to the Congress, not \n     later than March 31 of each year, a report on the \n     effectiveness of those visa systems during the preceding \n     calendar year.\n       (2) Other sub-saharan countries.--The President shall \n     continue the existing no quota policy for countries in sub-\n     Saharan Africa. The President shall submit to the Congress, \n     not later than March 31 of each year, a report on the growth \n     in textiles and apparel exports to the United States from \n     countries in sub-Saharan Africa in order to protect United \n     States consumers, workers, and textile manufacturers from \n     economic injury on account of the no quota policy. The \n     President should ensure that any country in sub-Saharan \n     Africa that intends to export substantial textile and apparel \n     goods to the United States has in place a functioning and \n     efficient visa system to guard against unlawful transshipment \n     of textile and apparel goods.\n       (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``Agreement on Textiles and Clothing'' means the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing referred to in section 101(d)(4) of the \n     Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(4)).\n\n     SEC. 9.

Res. 88\n\n       Whereas at a time when more consumers are using credit than \n     ever before, the financial skills of young adults are not \n     adequate to cope with the rapid, technologically driven \n     development of new financial products and new ways to deliver \n     those products;\n       Whereas lack of financial management skills is a major \n     cause of rising consumer bankruptcies and family crises, and \n     generally impairs the health and welfare of the general \n     public;\n       Whereas it is critical that students and young adults \n     develop functional skills in money management, including \n     basic budgeting, savings, investing, spending, and income;\n       Whereas the Senate commends the Jump$tart Coalition for \n     Personal Financial Literacy for its effort to promote \n     personal financial literacy; and\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\n       Whereas the Senate supports the Coalition's objective of \n     promoting education to ensure that basic personal management \n     skills are attained during the kindergarten through 12th \n     grade educational experience: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the goal \n     of having young adults who can enter the mainstream of an \n     increasingly complex financial world with confidence and \n     prudence is one which can be advanced through coordinated \n     efforts such as the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal \n     Financial Literacy.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on a subject of profound importance for the youth of \nour Nation and the future economic well-being of our citizens and our \ncountry. It is a subject that every single adult in our country must \ndeal with on a day-to-day basis and whose fortune depends on its \nsuccessful application. And yet, no matter how vital this subject is, \nwe often don't realize what scant energy and resources are devoted to \nmastering it. What is this subject that is woven throughout our lives, \ntouching everyone but which is frequently ignored? Simply put, it is \nfinancial literacy; the ability to manage money.\n  Modern American life offers us a world of almost limitless financial \npossibilities. Marshalling all the knowledge and resources of the \nmodern marketplace, people today are provided with a tremendous variety \nof choices about how to earn a living, invest for the future, and \nprovide security for their families. The benefits of such financial \ndiversity are obviously great, but only if coupled with the knowledge \nof how to apply basic economic reasoning. For all too many of our \nfellow citizens, this knowledge was never imparted to them in all their \nyears of schooling.\n  The consequences of such financial ignorance are obvious and \nextremely costly, not only on a personal level, but also to the \ncountry's economy. Extraordinarily high consumer debt, bankruptcy, low \nsavings rates, the inability of many to make sound and reasonable \nbudgets and financial plans--these are the symptoms of a disease that \nsap our Nation's strength, Mr. President. A disease of financial \nignorance and apathy. But fortunately one with a cure, if we just make \nthe effort to teach our children the basic financial management skills \nwe've always assumed that they had.\n  Our schools teach reading, writing, history, languages, mathematics, \nand science, among other subjects. But do we teach our children how to \nbalance a checkbook? Do we instruct them on the beauty of compounding \ninterest, which allows one to save vast amounts of money over the long \nterm for an education, or retirement, or to buy a home? Do we instruct \nthem in avoiding the credit card trap of easy financing, only to be hit \nlater with high finance charges? Do we train students to understand how \nto budget their money, and do they realize the relationship of taxes, \nspending, and investing? Too often, Mr. President, we do not.\n  The resolution I place before the Senate today recognizes the danger \nto our Nation's continued economic vitality by its support of an \ninnovative public-private partnership, called the Jump$tart Coalition \nfor Personal Financial Literacy. Jump$tart's primary goal is to improve \nthe financial literacy of our children from kindergarten through \ntwelfth grade by strengthening curriculums across the country in their \nteaching of basic financial management skills, such as budgeting, \nsaving, investing, and borrowing.\n  Additionally, Jump$tart puts into place mechanisms to survey high \nschool seniors every other year to monitor the understanding of the \nstudents toward financial literacy. With the data provided by the \nsurveys, we will be able to track the progress of schools as they \nimprove their teaching of financial literacy.\n  Mr. President, the Jump$tart Coalition will also create a national \ndata base to hold an annotated listing of information in personal \nfinance education. I believe this will be an invaluable clearinghouse \nof knowledge, giving our teachers and school districts a wide range of \nteaching materials which they can choose from to suit their particular \nsituation.\n  Recognizing how important financial literacy is to the future success \nof our country, an impressive roster of participating organizations has \nlined up in support of the Jump$tart Coalition. From the Federal \nReserve, to the American Financial Services Association to the Consumer \nBankers Association to institutions of higher learning, including one \nfrom my home State, the State University of New York (SUNY) at Oneonta; \nthey know the keys to personal success lie with teaching kids financial \nsmarts. The Wall Street Journal has signed on as well, utilizing their \ninnovative Classroom Edition to reach out directly to students, \noffering instruction in money management.\n  Mr. President, on Thursday, May 22, the Jump$tart Coalition will \nannounce the results of a national survey conducted to gage the \nfinancial literacy of today's high school seniors. Preliminary results \nhighlight the urgent need for work in this area. The Jump$tart \nCoalition initiatives are voluntary, but through public awareness and \naccess to curriculum information, I am confident we can make great \nstrides in ending the ignorance. The children of today will be the \neconomic decision makers of tomorrow; they need dollars and sense savvy \nto make the right decisions for themselves and their families, and with \na little extra effort, we can teach them. The Jump$tart Coalition is a \nworthy effort at teaching our youth the money management skill \nnecessary to prosper in the years to come, and should appeal to members \nfrom both sides of the aisle. I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4898-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 89--RELATIVE TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS \n                         FOR THE 105TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                               S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL \n                   INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) heart disease was the leading cause of death for both \n     men and women in every year from 1970 to 1993;\n       (2) mortality rates for individuals suffering from prostate \n     cancer, skin cancer, and kidney cancer continue to rise;\n       (3) the mortality rate for African American women suffering \n     from diabetes is 134 percent higher than the mortality rate \n     of Caucasian women suffering from diabetes;\n       (4) asthma rates for children increased 58 percent from \n     1982 to 1992;\n       (5) nearly half of all American women between the ages of \n     65 and 75 reported having arthritis;\n       (6) AIDS is the leading cause of death for Americans \n     between the ages of 24 and 44;\n       (7) the Institute of Medicine has described United States \n     clinical research to be ``in a state of crisis'' and the \n     National Academy of Sciences concluded in 1994 that ``the \n     present cohort of clinical investigators is not adequate'';\n       (8) biomedical research has been shown to be effective in \n     saving lives and reducing health care expenditures;\n       (9) research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health \n     has contributed significantly to the first overall reduction \n     in cancer death rates since recordkeeping was instituted;\n       (10) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has resulted in the identification of genetic \n     mutations for osteoporosis; Lou Gehrig's Disease, cystic \n     fibrosis, and Huntington's Disease; breast, skin and prostate \n     cancer; and a variety of other illnesses;\n       (11) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has been key to the development of Magnetic Resonance \n     Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning \n     technologies;\n       (12) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has developed effective treatments for Acute \n     Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Today, 80 percent of children \n     diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia are alive and \n     free of the disease after 5 years; and\n       (13) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health contributed to the development of a new, cost-saving \n     cure for peptic ulcers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this Resolution assumes that--\n       (1) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal \n     years; and\n       (2) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by $2,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1998 \n     over the amount appropriated in fiscal year 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 ABRAHAM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 316\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. \nSessions, and Mr. Coverdell) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF SENATE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH DIVIDEND \n                   PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       The Senate finds that with respect to the revenue levels \n     established under this resolution.--\n       (A) According to the President's own economists, the tax \n     burden on Americans is the highest ever at 31.7 percent;\n       (B) According to the National Taxpayer Union, the average \n     American family now pays almost 40 percent of their income in \n     state, local, and federal taxes;\n       (C) Between 1978 and 1985, while the top marginal rate in \n     capital gains was cut almost in half--from 35 to 20 percent--\n     total annual federal receipts from the tax almost tripled \n     from $9.1 billion annually to $26.5 billion annually.\n       (D) Conversely, when Congress raised the rate in 1986, \n     revenues actually fell well below what was anticipated.\n       (E) Economists across-the-board predict that cutting the \n     capital gains rate will result in a revenue windfall for the \n     Treasury; and\n       (F) While a USA Today poll from this March found 70 percent \n     of the American people believe that they need a tax cut, \n     under this resolution federal spending will grow 17 percent \n     over five years while the net tax cuts are less than 1 \n     percent of the total tax burden.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that with respect to the \n     revenue levels established under this resolution, to the \n     extent that actual revenues exceed the revenues projected \n     under this resolution due to higher than anticipated economic \n     growth, that revenue windfall should be reserved exclusively \n     for additional tax cuts and/or deficit reduction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     GRAMM AMENDMENTS NOS. 317-320\n\n  Mr. GRAMM proposed four amendments to the concurrent resolution, \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 317\n\n       At the end of title III insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DISASTER ASSISTANCE FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) emergency spending adds to the deficit and total \n     spending;\n       (2) the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 exempts emergency \n     spending from the discretionary spending caps and pay-go \n     requirements;\n       (3) the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 expires in 1998 and \n     needs to be extended;\n       (4) since the enactment of the Budget Enforcement Act, \n     Congress and the President have approved an average of $5.8 \n     billion per year in emergency spending;\n       (5) a natural disaster in any particular State is \n     unpredictable, but the United States is likely to experience \n     a natural disaster almost every year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assume that--\n       (1) the Congress should consider in the extension of the \n     Budget Enforcement Act provisions that budget for emergencies \n     or that require emergency spending to be offset;\n       (2) such provisions should also provide flexibility to meet \n     emergency funding requirements associated with natural \n     disasters;\n       (3) Congress and the President should appropriate at least \n     $5 billion every year within discretionary limits to provide \n     natural disaster relief;\n       (4) Congress and the President should not designate any \n     emergency spending for natural disaster relief until amounts \n     provided in regular appropriations are exhausted.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 318\n\n       On page 3, decrease the amount on

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF \n                   CHILDREN'S HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--the Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today's children and the next generation of children \n     are the prime beneficiaries of a balanced Federal budget. \n     Without a balanced budget, today's children will bear the \n     increasing burden of the Federal debt. Continued deficit \n     spending would doom future generations to slower economic \n     growth, higher taxes, and lower living standards.\n       (2) The health of children is essential to the future \n     economic and social well-being of the Nation.\n       (3) The medicaid program provides health coverage for over \n     17,000,000 children, or 1 out of every 4 children.\n       (4) While children represent \\1/2\\ of all individuals \n     eligible for medicaid, children account for less than 25 \n     percent of expenditures under the medicaid program.\n       (5) Disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funding under the \n     medicaid program has allowed States to expand health care \n     coverage to thousands of uninsured pregnant women and \n     children. DSH funding under the medicaid program is essential \n     for current and future coverage of these uninsured \n     populations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the health \n     care needs of\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\n     low-income pregnant women and children should be a top \n     priority. Careful study must be made of the impact of \n     medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) reform \n     proposals on children's health and on vital sources of care, \n     including children's hospitals. Any restrictions on DSH \n     funding under the medicaid program should not devastate \n     current State medicaid coverage of children and pregnant \n     women, or hinder health care coverage expansion opportunities \n     for these uninsured populations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BOND (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 325\n\n  Mr. BONDS (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Graham, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Sessions) proposed an amendment \nto the concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; \nas follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING HIGHWAY TRUST FUND.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) there is no direct linkage between the fuel taxes \n     deposited in the Highway Trust Fund and the transportation \n     spending from the Highway Trust Fund;\n       (2) the Federal budget process has severed this linkage by \n     dividing revenues and spending into separate budget \n     categories with--\n       (A) fuel taxes deposited in the Highway Trust Fund as \n     revenues; and\n       (B) most spending from the Highway Trust Fund in the \n     discretionary category;\n       (3) each budget category referred to in paragraph (2) has \n     its own rules and procedures; and\n       (4) under budget rules in effect prior to the date of \n     adoption of this resolution, an increase in fuel taxes \n     permits increased spending to be included in the budget, but \n     not for increased Highway Trust Fund spending.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) in this session of Congress, Congress should, within a \n     unified budget, change the Federal budget process to \n     establish a linkage between the fuel taxes deposited in the \n     Highway Trust Fund, including any fuel tax increases that may \n     be enacted into law after the date of adoption of the \n     resolution, and the spending from the Highway Trust Fund; and\n       (2) Changes to the budgetary treatment of the Highway Trust \n     Fund should not result in total program levels for highways \n     or mass transit that is inconsistent with those assumed under \n     the resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                McCAIN (AND HOLLINGS) AMENDMENT NO. 326\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Hollings) proposed an amendment to \nthe concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution, insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC.  .

Today, 13 percent of the \n     population is 65 or older and by 2030, 20 percent of the \n     population will be 65 or older. More than \\1/2\\ of the \n     elderly do not receive private pensions and more than \\1/3\\ \n     have no income from assets.\n       (2) For 60 percent of all senior citizens, social security \n     benefits provide almost 80 percent of their retirement \n     income. For 80 percent of all senior citizens, social \n     security benefits provide over 50 percent of their retirement \n     income.\n       (3) Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest level \n     since the United States began to keep poverty statistics, due \n     in large part to the social security system.\n       (4) Seventy-eight percent of Americans pay more in payroll \n     taxes than they do in income taxes.\n       (5) According to the 1997 report of the Managing Trustee \n     for the social security trust funds, the accumulated balance \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is \n     estimated to fall to zero by 2029, and the estimated payroll \n     tax at that time will be sufficient to cover only 75 percent \n     of the benefits owed to retirees at that time.\n       (6) The average American retiring in the year 2015 will pay \n     $250,000 in payroll taxes over the course of his or her \n     working career.\n       (7) Future generations of Americans must be guaranteed the \n     same value from the social security system as past covered \n     recipients.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that no change \n     in the social security system should be made that would \n     reduce the value of the social security system for future \n     generations of retirees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         DODD AMENDMENT NO. 335\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Dodd) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra;

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FAMILY VIOLENCE OPTION \n                   CLARIFYING AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Domestic violence is the leading cause of physical \n     injury to women. The Department of Justice estimates that \n     over 1,000,000 violent crimes against women are committed by \n     intimate partners annually.\n       (2) Domestic violence dramatically affects the victim's \n     ability to participate in the workforce. A University of \n     Minnesota survey reported that one-fourth of battered women \n     surveyed had lost a job partly because of being abused and \n     that over one-half of these women had been harassed by their \n     abuser at work.\n       (3) Domestic violence is often intensified as women seek to \n     gain economic independence through attending school or \n     training programs. Batterers have been reported to prevent \n     women from attending these programs or sabotage their efforts \n     at self-improvement.\n       (4) Nationwide surveys of service providers prepared by the \n     Taylor Institute of Chicago, Illinois, document, for the \n     first time, the interrelationship between domestic violence \n     and welfare by showing that from 34 percent to 65 percent of \n     AFDC recipients are current or past victims of domestic \n     violence.\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\n       (5) Over one-half of the women surveyed stayed with their \n     batterers because they lacked the resources to support \n     themselves and their children. The surveys also found that \n     the availability of economic support is a critical factor in \n     poor women's ability to leave abusive situations that \n     threaten them and their children.\n       (6) The restructuring of the welfare programs may impact \n     the availability of the economic support and the safety net \n     necessary to enable poor women to flee abuse without risking \n     homelessness and starvation for their families.\n       (7) In recognition of this finding, the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate in considering the 1997 Resolution on \n     the budget of the United States unanimously adopted a sense \n     of the Congress amendment concerning domestic violence and \n     Federal assistance. Subsequently, Congress adopted the family \n     violence option amendment as part of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996.\n       (8) The family violence option gives States the flexibility \n     to grant temporary waivers from time limits and work \n     requirements for domestic violence victims who would suffer \n     extreme hardship from the application of these provisions. \n     These waivers were not intended to be included as part of the \n     permanent 20 percent hardship exemption.\n       (9) The Department of Health and Human Services has been \n     slow to issue regulations regarding this provision. As a \n     result, States are hesitant to fully implement the family \n     violence option fearing that it will interfere with the 20 \n     percent hardship exemption.\n       (10) Currently 15 States have opted to include the family \n     violence option in their welfare plans, and 13 other States \n     have included some type of domestic violence provisions in \n     their plans.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the provisions of this \n     Resolution assume that--\n       (1) States should not be subject to any numerical limits in \n     granting domestic violence good cause waivers under section \n     402(a)(7)(A)(iii) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     602(a)(7)(A)(iii)) to individuals receiving assistance, for \n     all requirements where compliance with such requirements \n     would make it more difficult for individuals receiving \n     assistance to escape domestic violence; and\n       (2) any individual who is granted a domestic violence good \n     cause waiver by a State shall not be included in the States' \n     20 percent hardship exemption under section 408(a)(7) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 608(a)(7)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        GRAMS AMENDMENT NO. 346\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Grams) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 3, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 3, line 4, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 3, line 5, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 3, line 6, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 3, line 7, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 4, line 4, decrease the amount by $13.7 billion.\n       On page 4, line 5, decrease the amount by $23.4 billion.\n       On page 4, line 6, decrease the amount by $33.2 billion.\n       On page 4, line 7, decrease the amount by $42.9 billion.\n       On page 4, line 8, decrease the amount by $52.7 billion.\n       On page 4, line 12, decrease the amount by $6.3 billion.\n       On page 4, line 13, decrease the amount by $16.9 billion.\n       On page 4, line 14, decrease the amount by $26.7 billion.\n       On page 4, line 15, decrease the amount by $36.6 billion.\n       On page 4, line 16, decrease the amount by $46.8 billion.\n       On page 4, line 19, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 4, line 20, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 4, line 21, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 4, line 22, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 4, line 23, decrease the amount by $22.5 billion.\n       On page 35, line 9, decrease the amount by $13.7 billion.\n       On page 35, line 10, decrease the amount by $6.3 billion.\n       On page 35, line 15, decrease the amount by $23.4 billion.\n       On page 35, line 16, decrease the amount by $16.9 billion.\n       On page 35, line 21, decrease the amount by $33.2 billion.\n       On page 35, line 22, decrease the amount by $26.7 billion.\n       On page 36, line 2, decrease the amount by $42.9 billion.\n       On page 36, line 3, decrease the amount by $36.6 billion.\n       On page 36, line 8, decrease the amount by $52.7 billion.\n       On page 36, line 9, decrease the amount by $46.8 billion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      COVERDELL AMENDMENT NO. 347\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Coverdell) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN \n                   PREVENTION OF DRUG USE BY CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) 2,000,000 more children are using drugs in 1997 than \n     were doing so in 1993. For the first time in the 1990s, over \n     half of our Nation's graduating high school seniors have \n     experimented with drugs and approximately 1 out of every 4 of \n     the students have used drugs in the past month.\n       (2) After 11 years of declining marijuana use among \n     children aged 12 to 17, such use doubled between 1992 and \n     1995. The number of 8th graders who have used marijuana in \n     the past month has more than tripled since 1991.\n       (3) More of our Nation's school children are becoming \n     involved with hard core drugs at earlier ages, as use of \n     heroin and cocaine by 8th graders has more than doubled since \n     1991.\n       (4) Substance abuse is at the core of other problems, such \n     as rising violent teenage and violent gang crime, increasing \n     health care costs, HIV infections, teenage pregnancy, high \n     school dropouts, and lower economic productivity.\n       (5) Increases in substance abuse among youth are due in \n     large part to an erosion of understanding by youth of the \n     high risks associated with substance abuse, and to the \n     softening of peer norms against use.\n       (6) Nearly 1 in every 10 students who received a diploma \n     last June is a daily user of illicit drugs.\n       (7) A 1995-96 school year survey of drug usage by students \n     revealed that 25 percent of children using drugs are doing so \n     at home or at the home of a friend. Despite these alarming \n     statistics, less than 30 percent of students stated that \n     their parents talked to them about the problem of alcohol and \n     drugs.\n       (8) In the 1990-91 school year survey, over 40 percent of \n     the students reported that their parent regularly talked to \n     them about drugs.

This \n     rising debt burden poses a serious threat to students and may \n     lead to some students no longer pursuing a higher education.\n       (7) post-secondary education tax cuts that encourage \n     savings and that address this rising debt burden would \n     encourage Americans to pursue a higher education and promote \n     lifelong learning, and would, therefore, be consistent with \n     the objectives sought by President Clinton in his budget \n     proposal.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume--\n       (1) that higher education tax relief should encourage \n     Americans to pursue a post-secondary education and promote \n     lifelong learning.\n       (2) tax incentives that encourage parents and students to \n     save for higher education expenses, and that provide relief \n     from the debt burden associated with borrowing to pay for a \n     post-secondary education, are consistent with the objectives \n     set forth in this resolution, and should be included in any \n     post-secondary education tax cut package.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HARKIN AMENDMENTS NOS. 350-351\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Harkin) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 350\n\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   .

SENSE OF THE SENATE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Scientific research on the development of the brain has \n     confirmed that the early childhood years, particularly from \n     birth to the age of 3, are critical to children's \n     development.\n       (2) Studies repeatedly have shown that good quality child \n     care helps children develop well, enter school ready to \n     succeed, improve their skills, cognitive abilities and \n     socioemotional development, improve classroom learning \n     behavior, and stay safe while their parents work. Further, \n     quality early childhood programs can positively affect \n     children's long-term success in school achievement, higher \n     earnings as adults, decrease reliance on public assistance \n     and decrease involvement with the criminal justice system.\n       (3) The first of the National Education Goals, endorsed by \n     the Nation's governors, passed by Congress and signed into \n     law by President Bush, stated that by the year 2000, every \n     child should enter school ready to learn and that access to a \n     high quality early childhood education program was integral \n     to meeting this goal.\n       (4) According to data compiled by the RAND Corporation, \n     while 90 percent of human brain growth occurs by the age of \n     3, public spending on children in that age range equals only \n     8 percent of spending on all children. A vast majority of \n     public spending on children occurs after the brain has gone \n     through its most dramatic changes, often to correct problems \n     that should have been addressed during early childhood \n     development.\n       (5) According to the Department of Education, of \n     $29,400,000,000 in current estimated education expenditures, \n     only $1,500,000,000, or 5 percent, is spent on children from \n     birth to age 5. The vast majority is spent on children over \n     age 5.\n       (6) A new commitment to quality child care and early \n     childhood education is a necessary response to the fact that \n     children from birth to the age of 3 are spending more time in \n     care away from their homes. Almost 60 percent of women in the \n     workforce have children under the age of 3 requiring care.\n       (7) Many States and communities are currently experimenting \n     with innovative programs directed at early childhood care and \n     education in a variety of care settings, including the home. \n     States and local communities are best able to deliver \n     efficient, cost-effective services, but while such programs \n     are long on demand, they are short on resources. Additional \n     Federal resources should not create new bureaucracy, but \n     build on successful locally driven efforts.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budget totals and levels in this resolution assume \n     that funds ought to be directed toward increasing the supply \n     of quality child care, early childhood education, and teacher \n     and parent training for children from birth through age 3.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         BYRD AMENDMENT NO. 353\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Byrd) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 56, line 7, strike the word ``enacted'' and insert: \n     ``reported or an amendment is adopted''.\n       On page 56, line 15, strike the words ``enactment of \n     legislation'' and insert: ``reporting of legislation or upon \n     the adoption of an amendment''.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BIDEN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 354\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Biden for himself, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Gramm) \nproposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent \nResolution 27, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SUPPORT FOR FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Our Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedoms and security, and with the support of Federal \n     assistance, State and local law enforcement officers have \n     succeeded in reducing the national scourge of violent crime, \n     as illustrated by a murder rate in 1996 that is projected to \n     be the lowest since 1971 and a violent crime total in 1996 \n     that is the lowest since 1990.\n       (2) Through a comprehensive effort to attack violence \n     against women mounted by State and local law enforcement, and \n     dedicated volunteers and professionals who provide victim \n     services, shelter, counseling, and advocacy to battered women \n     and their children, important strides have been made against \n     the national scourge of violence against women, illustrated \n     by the decline in the murder rate for wives, ex-wives, and \n     girlfriends at the hands of their ``intimates'' fell to a 19-\n     year low in 1995.\n       (3) Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts need \n     continued financial commitment from the Federal Government \n     for funding and financial assistance to continue their \n     efforts to combat violent crime and violence against women.\n       (4) Federal, state and local law enforcement also face \n     other challenges which require continued financial commitment \n     from the Federal Government, including regaining control over \n     the Southwest Border, where drug trafficking and illegal \n     immigration continue to threaten public safety and menace \n     residents on the border and throughout the nation.\n       (5) The Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund established in \n     section 310001 the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement \n     Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14211) fully funds the Violent Crime \n     Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, including the \n     Violence Against Women Act, without adding to the Federal \n     budget deficit.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions and the functional totals underlying this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Federal Government's commitment to fund Federal law \n     enforcement programs and programs to assist State and local \n     efforts to combat violent crime, including violence against \n     women, will be maintained; and\n       (2) funding for the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund will \n     continue in its current form at least through fiscal year \n     2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BOXER (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 355\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mrs. Boxer, for herself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Daschle, \nMr. Harkin, and Mr. Bumpers) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nSenator Hagel's legislation commemorating the 15th anniversary of the \nVietnam Veterans Memorial, Senate Resolution 87. His resolution is a \nfitting tribute not only to the wall itself, but to the 58,196 American \nmen and women who gave their lives for this country in Southeast Asia \nor who are still missing nearly 20 years after the conclusion of the \nwar.\n  The memorial, the names of Americans killed and missing engraved in \nits marble edifice, is an eery reminder of the sacrifice made by so \nmany young men and women for a cause many here at home disputed. Nearly \n9 million Americans served in Vietnam. Their valor in war was too often \ngreeted with disrespect upon their return home. That is why the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial plays such an important role in honoring the bravery \nand sacrifice of the soldiers who served in an unpopular war at a \ntumultuous time in American history.\n  While the memorial's design was at first controversial, it has become \nan important aspect of the National Mall in Washington, DC, visited by \ntens of thousands of tourists every year. For those whose loved ones \nperished in Vietnam, it is an opportunity to see firsthand, that their \nfriends or relatives will be revered and remembered for a long time to \ncome. For those who were not touched personally by the war, the \nmemorial is a chance to understand and experience Vietnam. And for all \nAmericans, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a lesson about the dangers \nof war and the bravery, character, and patriotism of the men and women \nof our Armed Forces.\n  On this, the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, \nSenator Hagel's resolution is a timely and appropriate way to honor all \nthose who served in Vietnam. I am proud, Mr. President, to be an \noriginal cosponsor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4910-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4910-S4911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          LOBBYING DISCLOSURE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1997\n\n   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to add to the statement I \noffered last week when I introduced S. 758, the Lobbying Disclosure \nTechnical Amendments Act of 1997. In my statement, I noted that a \nsimilar piece of legislation that Congressmen Charles Canady and Barney \nFrank sponsored last year and moved through the House of \nRepresentatives, was unable to gain passage in the Senate because of a \nprovision that some Members of the Senate found problematic. I \nemphasized that the bill I have introduced omits that provision.\n  Although that revision is, in my view, the key difference between the \nbill I have introduced and last year's version, I should also point out \na second change. S. 758 omits a provision that would alter the language \nin those sections of the Lobbying Disclosure Act (the ``LDA'') \nrequiring LDA registrants to identify certain foreign entities that \nhave an interest in the outcome of their lobbying activities. As it \nstands now, the LDA provides that registrants need to identify foreign \nentities that have a direct interest in their lobbying. The provision \nin last year's House-passed bill and which is not included in S. 758 \nwould have added the word ``significant'' to that phrase. Under that \nprovision, registrants\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\nwould have to disclose foreign subsidiaries only if they have a \nsignificant direct interest in the lobbying.\n  In my view, changing direct interest to significant direct interest \nwould be counterproductive, especially since the provision in question \ndoes not define what the word ``significant'' means in this context. At \nwhat point does a direct interest become a significant direct interest? \nIf foreign entities have a direct interest in the lobbying of a \nregistrant, but the registrant insists that interest is not \nsignificant, how can we judge that contention? In the absence of clear \nanswers to those questions, I believe the provision I have omitted \ncould weaken the LDA. By introducing an element of vagueness into the \nact's language, it could undercut the act's ability to fulfill the \ninformation-gathering function that we had in mind when we passed it.\n  As I emphasized in my initial statement, my purpose in introducing \nthis technical amendments bill is to make the LDA even more useful than \nit is now. I do not want to do anything to weaken the act, and S. 758 \nis shaped in accordance with that guiding principle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4910-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LAMENTATION\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, last week a bipartisan budget \nagreement was successfully reached between the Administration and \nCongressional leaders of both parties.\n  This is a seminal achievement that will lead us to a balanced budget \nfor the first time in 28 years.\n  I would like to congratulate the budget negotiators on this important \naccomplishment.\n  I would like to call particular attention to their leadership in \nfunding international affairs.\n  In February, I wrote the Budget Committee asking that the President's \nbudget request of $19.45 billion for international affairs spending be \nregarded as the absolute minimum essential to effectively carry out the \nnational interests of the United States.\n  Yesterday, the Budget Committee reported a resolution establishing \nthese enhanced levels of funding as a priority for fiscal year 1998.\n  I commend the Budget Committee for recognizing the importance of \nfunding this year the full amount of the President's request for \nforeign affairs.\n  This was an important first step.\n  I look forward to continue working with Chairman Helms on the Foreign \nRelations Committee and with the Appropriations Committee to insure \nthat sufficient funds are authorized and appropriated to restore our \nresources for diplomatic readiness abroad.\n  But it was only the first step. In recent years, funding for \ninternational affairs has plummeted in real terms to its lowest level \nsince World War II.\n  Yet all the while, due to the downsizing of U.S. overseas military \nforces, diplomacy has become more important than ever as a vital front-\nline defense of American interests.\n  Although the cold war has ended, challenges to our security remain.\n  We live in an age in which international threats such as terrorism, \nnarcotics trafficking, and nuclear proliferation continue to imperil \nour Nation's security and prosperity.\n  American diplomats in the field and on the ground are essential to \nunderstanding complex political and economic forces affecting our \nallies and adversaries alike.\n  Despite the reduction in our military readiness abroad, the increased \nimportance of diplomatic readiness to our Nation's security has not \nbeen reflected in the Federal budget in recent years.\n  To the contrary, international affairs funding has suffered drastic \nbudget cuts, a point which I will demonstrate today. These cuts have \nalready begun to have noticeable effects on our Nation's diplomatic \nreadiness.\n  Thus, this year's budget agreement must be seen as only the first \nstep toward restoring and enhancing America's diplomatic preparedness.\n  Before discussing the decline in resources for foreign affairs, it is \nworth pausing to address a threshold question: What kind of foreign \npolicy do we want to have?\n  Stated more bluntly--are we prepared to remain engaged in the world, \nor are we headed down the path of isolationism?\n  For it is only after we answer this fundamental question should we \nmake decisions about the budgetary resources for foreign affairs.\n  Mr. President, how we fund our diplomatic resources abroad presents \nanother test for American leadership--whether the growing forces of \nneoisolationism or those favoring engagement are going to prevail in \nthis congress.\n  It is commonly asserted these days that the American people are weary \nof international involvement, and want us to cut back from our \ncommitments abroad.\n  Over the course of the last 50 years we have seen an enormous \ntechnological revolution take place in the areas of information, \ncommunication, transportation, medicine, manufacturing, and world \ntrade.\n  For better or worse, this revolution--at least for large segments of \nthe world--has fundamentally transformed the way we live.\n  Within and among nations, people today are more closely connected \nthan ever by fast and affordable travel, instant electronic \ncommunication, and standardized products.\n  For americans, who for much of our history enjoyed a sense of \nseparateness from the world, global interdependence is no longer an \nacademic abstraction; we experience it daily. The lesson of the two \nworld wars in this century--that we cannot preserve our own well-being \nin isolation from the world's problems--has now been compounded by \ntechnology.\n\n  For the last 50 years, the major threat to our Nation's security was \nthe global spread of communism. Today, a host of other threats--no less \ndangerous--to our future security and prosperity exist: the \nproliferation of dangerous weapons; the threat of terrorism, narcotics, \nand international crime; the spread of deadly diseases; the degradation \nof the environment; and increasing economic competition.\n  On every continent, we face many challenges, new and old:\n  In Europe, we work to reinvigorate the NATO alliance by engaging in \nnew missions and expanding to the east;\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\n  In Eurasia, we seek to build a constructive relationship with a newly \ndemocratic Russia still armed with thousands of nuclear weapons, and to \nnourish democracy there and elsewhere in the New Independent States;\n  In the Middle East, we endeavor to sustain a peace process that has \nbrought Israel and her neighbors within sight of a final agreement that \ncould end decades of conflict;\n  In Asia, we seek to strengthen the bonds of cooperation with old \nallies in Japan and Korea, and to build a cooperative relationship with \na growing economic and military power in China;\n  In Latin America, we seek to sustain and strengthen our ties to the \nnew democracies which are enjoying unprecedented economic success, and \nto help them contain the threat of the narcotics trade;\n  In Africa, we are helping the new South Africa take its rightful \nplace as a leader of the world community, and we seek to encourage the \nspread of democracy across the continent, where the seeds of freedom \nand free markets are slowly taking root.\n  These multiple challenges may not call for a single construct--as the \nchallenge of communism yielded the policy of containment--but they \nclearly affect American interests, and cry out for active American \nleadership.\n  I believe that the American people understand this reality; and \nprecisely for that reason, they expect to see the strong hand of the \nUnited States in world affairs.\n  It is often stated, sometimes with excessive triumphalism, that we \nare the world's lone remaining superpower. Unfortunately, when it comes \nto devoting adequate resources for our diplomatic efforts, we rarely \nact the part.\n  Indeed, our ability to continue our leadership role is threatened by \nthe severe decline in funding for international affairs.\n  And although some members of this body may contest the need for such \nfunding, there can be no dispute that spending for international \naffairs has fallen significantly in recent years.\n  Allow me to elaborate. In budgetary terms, nearly all funding for \ninternational affairs programs are found in the category known as \nfunction 150. In this category are all major foreign affairs \nactivities: diplomacy conducted by the Department of State, foreign aid \nadministered by the Agency for International Development; information \nand exchange activities carried out by the U.S. Information Agency; The \nwork of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; U.S. contributions to \ninternational financial institutions such as the World Bank; and \nsupport for the United Nations and related agencies ranging from the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to the Children's Fund.\n  By every measure, spending for these activities has been cut to the \nbone in the last few years.\n  According to a study of the Congressional Research Service prepared \nat my request, foreign policy spending is now at its lowest level in 20 \nyears.\n  Stated in fiscal 1998 dollars, the budget in the current fiscal year \nis $18.77 billion, which is 25 percent below the annual average of $25 \nbillion over the past two decades, and 30 percent below the level of 10 \nyears ago, near the end of the Reagan administration.\n  This is a recent phenomenon. The decline commenced at the beginning \nof the decade. But the most significant reductions came in the past few \nyears.\n  Spending dropped by 3.8 percent in fiscal 1994, by 5.6 percent in \nfiscal 1995, by 10.2 percent in fiscal 1996, and finally by 3.7 percent \nin fiscal 1997. In short, the reductions in this decade began with a \ntrickle and have turned into a hemorrhage.\n  Taken together, let me repeat, these budget cuts brought spending in \n1997 to the lowest level in the past 20 years, and a full 25 percent \nbelow the average for that period.\n  These reductions are also historic in two other respects. For the \npast two decades, international affairs spending, as measured against \nthe rest of the discretionary budget, held reasonably steady. The \naverage was 4.1 percent, but it rarely deviated much from that average.\n  In fact, the trend, from 1987 to 1995, was virtually a straight line. \nBut then the line started to take a dive in 1996, dropping to 3.7 \npercent; and in 1997, it fell still further to 3.6 percent.\n  The story is largely the same when foreign affairs funding is \ncompared to the total budget, including mandatory spending programs.\n  Over the past two decades, international affairs funding comprised, \non average, 1.7 percent of the entire Federal budget. In fiscal 1997, \nsuch funding was just 1.1 percent of the Federal budget, the lowest \nlevel in the past 20 years and about one-third below the historical \naverage.\n  It should be pointed out here that I am not using fiscal year 1985 as \na base year for comparison. That was an extraordinary year because \nthere were two special supplemental appropriations to meet foreign \npolicy crises: a special aid package for the Middle East, and a relief \nbill for famine in Africa.\n  Spending that year, in constant fiscal 1998 dollars, was $36.3 \nbillion, or nearly twice current funding.\n  I recognize that such an anomalous year would skew the comparison, \nand instead I have chosen to look at current funding based against a \n20-year time period.\n  This period, I might add, embraces the tenure of both Presidents \nCarter and Clinton--that is, the two most recent Democratic \nadministrations--as well as those of Presidents Reagan and Bush.\n  In sum, Mr. President, the data do not lie. No matter how you slice \nit, spending for foreign affairs has been severely cut.\n  There's another part of the story that needs to be told, however, and \nthat's how these cuts in international affairs spending, on both \nprograms and people, have impacted American interests.\n  Let us start with the State Department. Since President Clinton \nassumed office, funding for the Department's core activities has fallen \nby 17 percent in real terms.\n  Although the current level is slightly higher than the historical \naverage of the past 20 years, the cuts in the last few years have had a \ndramatic effect on the Department.\n  First, we have closed 36 missions overseas, in locations such as \nZurich, Switzerland, Stuttgart, Germany, and Lubumbashi, Zaire.\n  At the same time, 24 new posts have been opened, 15 of which are in \nthe nations that once comprised the Soviet empire. We now have 249 \noverseas posts, the lowest level since 1980.\n  Now, I am not objecting to cuts made in the interest of efficiency. I \nagree that we should eliminate duplication and waste.\n  What I am concerned about, however, is whether these reductions may \nhave left our interests unevenly protected overseas.\n  Just as one example, the closing last year of the American Consulate \nin Medan, Indonesia, has left us with no American diplomatic presence \nin the second most important commercial center in that country.\n  Unlike Britain, Russia, Japan, Germany, and a host of other countries \nwhich all have diplomats in Medan, our presence is limited to the \nAmerican Embassy some 800 miles away in Jakarta.\n  Medan is located in a part of Indonesia that is a key entry-way for \narms smuggling into the country, and historically has been a hotbed of \npro-independence political activity. Moreover, there are significant \nprivate American economic interests in Medan. However, instead of \nprotecting our interests in the region--both economic and security--we \nhave been reduced to sending someone from the Embassy up to Medan about \nonce every 4 months.\n  Second, the Department is suffering from what might be called an \ninfrastructure deficit. Replacement and modernization of basic \nequipment has been long deferred, and renovation and repair of overseas \nbuildings has been delayed. Let me state it at the most basic level: \nMany diplomats, both here and abroad, still use Wang computers. When \npurchased in the early 1980's, the Wang was state-of-the-art, and the \nState Department was the envy of the Federal Government; today, the \nobsolete computers that pervade the Department make it the laughing-\nstock of Washington. Similarly, over 40 percent of the Department's \noverseas telephone switchboards are obsolete, so old in fact, that \nspare parts are unavailable, and to keep the older systems working, we \ncannibalize ones that have\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\nbeen replaced to fix those still in operation. The same is true for \nover 80 percent of all our radio equipment overseas.\n  In the same vein, thousands of repairs to embassies and other \nfacilities remain unmet because of the lack of funds. Our embassy in \nBeijing--one of our most important posts--is literally falling apart. \nNumerous other facilities, on every continent, require extensive repair \nwork.\n  At other foreign affairs agencies, the story is much the same. At the \nU.S. Information Agency, funding is 13 percent below the average in the \npast 20 years. Two programs which are among our cheapest and most cost-\neffective foreign policy tools--exchanges and international \nbroadcasting--have been particularly affected.\n  For example, budget cuts and a consolidation of all international \nbroadcasting have forced reductions in programming on the Voice of \nAmerica and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. During the Cold War, \nservices like Radio Free Europe provided a steady breath of truth to \nthose trapped behind the Iron Curtain.\n  Today, their mission, and the mission of the new Radio Free Asia, is \nno less important. During my recent visit to Moscow, a leading member \nof the Russian legislature pleaded for the continuation of Radio \nLiberty, which is regarded as a critical tool in a country where the \nmedia remains under strong influence of the government and the ruling \nclasses.\n  The steepest reductions in our foreign policy budget have come in \nforeign assistance, which at $11.5 billion last year--again, using \nfiscal 1998 dollars--is lower, in real terms, than any year of the last \n20, and some 36 percent below the historical average of that period.\n  Foreign aid spending has been steadily falling since the early \n1990's. Reductions of this magnitude have undermined American influence \nand interests around the globe.\n  It is popular to assert that foreign aid is merely the foreign policy \nequivalent of welfare, a supposed giveaway of massive dimensions that \nyields few benefits to American interests, and that if we merely ended \nthe program, our problems with the budget deficit would be over. Wrong \non both counts.\n  Through our foreign assistance programs we help to combat the \nscourges of drug trafficking, international crime, terrorism, and arms \nproliferation. For example, our contributions to the International Law \nEnforcement Academy in Budapest, Hungary, has helped to train nearly \n3,000 foreign law enforcement personnel in fighting organized crime, \ndrugs, and international money laundering. American contributions to \nthese efforts is an important way in which we protect our interests \nabroad.\n  To state the obvious, if we ended all foreign aid--both economic and \nmilitary assistance--we would not end our deficit problem. And the \nprograms are far from a giveaway; they are an investment in our \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I am not the only one who feels that reductions in \nforeign affairs spending have put American interests at risk.\n  A recent independent, bipartisan blue ribbon panel jointly sponsored \nby the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations came \nto the same conclusion.\n  They concluded that ``the cuts already made in the international \naffairs discretionary account have adversely affected, to a significant \ndegree, the ability of the United States to protect and promote its \neconomic, diplomatic and strategic agendas abroad.\n  ``Unless this trend is reversed, American vital interests will be \njeopardized.''\n  Mr. President, we cannot let this trend continue. It is a delusion to \nbelieve that America can remain actively engaged in the world if we \ncontinue to deny the President and the Secretary of State the resources \nnecessary for the conduct of American foreign policy.\n  An important first step in the right direction has been taken by \nfunding in full President Clinton's international affairs budget \nrequest for fiscal 1998.\n  Yet, as I have demonstrated here today, after several years of \ndrastic cuts, continued funding is critical to restoring and enhancing \nAmerica's vital diplomatic capacity.\n  As it has been reported, the President has decided to reorganize the \nmany foreign affairs agencies of the Federal Government.\n  I support the President's reorganization plan, and believe that we \nshould eliminate duplication and waste in our foreign policy programs.\n  However, we in the Congress must keep in mind the needs of the next \ncentury and the importance of our diplomatic presence abroad.\n  I also want to make clear that our reform efforts should be driven \nnot by the imperative of budgetary savings--as important as that is--\nbut by the need to ensure that we have a robust diplomatic presence \naround the globe in order to protect the gains of our cold war victory.\n  Let me also unequivocally state that any savings realized from \nreorganization of our foreign policy agencies should not be diverted \nelsewhere but re-allocated to enhance our diplomatic readiness.\n  Moreover, in acting to ensure adequate funding for American foreign \npolicy, we should also end the false distinction--in both our thinking \nand our budgeting--between foreign policy and national defense.\n  For years, we have distinguished between the two as if they were \nseparate and unrelated aspects of our national budget.\n  But that is hardly the case. Quite the opposite: The two are closely \nlinked, and should be similarly conceived as part of a broader national \nsecurity budget.\n  This is far from a radical concept. More than most Americans, members \nof the U.S. military well understand that diplomacy is the front-line \nof our national defense.\n  Both our diplomats and our soldiers work on a daily basis to protect \nour national security, and their missions overlap frequently.\n  When American aircraft carriers are deployed to the Taiwan Straits, \nthey are not only showing American military power, they are \ndemonstrating the United States commitment to security and stability in \nEast Asia.\n  When American diplomats negotiate nuclear and conventional arms \ncontrol agreements in Europe and Eurasia, they are strengthening \nEuropean security, a vital national interest which has long been \ncentral to our defense planning.\n  In short, just as the projection of military power is a diplomatic \ntool, diplomacy is a weapon in the arsenal of our national defense. \nBoth are vital to our national interest; both should be protected.\n  Mr. President, the debate over the form and substance of our Nation's \nforeign policy comes down to this--will America lead?\n  I believe our interests call for it. The sacrifices of our \ngrandparents and parents require it. The future of this great country \ndemands it.\n  Mr. President, the end of the cold war and the approach of a new \ncentury provides a historic moment for the United States to play a \ndecisive role in world affairs--to bend the course of history slightly. \nSuch moments are rare.\n  The last such time, after the conflagration of the Second World War, \nsaw an active American leadership role in shaping the institutions that \nwere central to world history in the last half of this century--\ninstitutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the \nWorld Bank.\n  Like the choices made by Presidents named Roosevelt and Truman and \nSenators named Connolly and Vandenburg a half century ago, the \ndecisions we make now could affect the course of world history for \ngenerations to come.\n  Congress needs to reinforce America's leadership in the world, and \nprovide the resources necessary to protect our interests overseas.\n  We bear a responsibility to the American people to make the case and \nshow the benefits for these investments, as well as the costs of not \npursuing them.\n  I, for one, will do everything I can as ranking minority member on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee to make sure that we do.\n  Rather than resting on our laurels after winning the cold war, we \nmust be even more resolute, lest we squander an opportunity to bring \npeace and democracy to even more people across the globe.\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4911-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4911-S4914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ENHANCING OUR DIPLOMATIC READINESS--A CRITICAL TEST OF AMERICAN \n                               LEADERSHIP\n\n   Mr. BIDEN.

In this category are all major foreign affairs \nactivities: diplomacy conducted by the Department of State, foreign aid \nadministered by the Agency for International Development; information \nand exchange activities carried out by the U.S. Information Agency; The \nwork of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; U.S. contributions to \ninternational financial institutions such as the World Bank; and \nsupport for the United Nations and related agencies ranging from the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to the Children's Fund.\n  By every measure, spending for these activities has been cut to the \nbone in the last few years.\n  According to a study of the Congressional Research Service prepared \nat my request, foreign policy spending is now at its lowest level in 20 \nyears.\n  Stated in fiscal 1998 dollars, the budget in the current fiscal year \nis $18.77 billion, which is 25 percent below the annual average of $25 \nbillion over the past two decades, and 30 percent below the level of 10 \nyears ago, near the end of the Reagan administration.\n  This is a recent phenomenon. The decline commenced at the beginning \nof the decade. But the most significant reductions came in the past few \nyears.\n  Spending dropped by 3.8 percent in fiscal 1994, by 5.6 percent in \nfiscal 1995, by 10.2 percent in fiscal 1996, and finally by 3.7 percent \nin fiscal 1997. In short, the reductions in this decade began with a \ntrickle and have turned into a hemorrhage.\n  Taken together, let me repeat, these budget cuts brought spending in \n1997 to the lowest level in the past 20 years, and a full 25 percent \nbelow the average for that period.\n  These reductions are also historic in two other respects. For the \npast two decades, international affairs spending, as measured against \nthe rest of the discretionary budget, held reasonably steady. The \naverage was 4.1 percent, but it rarely deviated much from that average.\n  In fact, the trend, from 1987 to 1995, was virtually a straight line. \nBut then the line started to take a dive in 1996, dropping to 3.7 \npercent; and in 1997, it fell still further to 3.6 percent.\n  The story is largely the same when foreign affairs funding is \ncompared to the total budget, including mandatory spending programs.\n  Over the past two decades, international affairs funding comprised, \non average, 1.7 percent of the entire Federal budget. In fiscal 1997, \nsuch funding was just 1.1 percent of the Federal budget, the lowest \nlevel in the past 20 years and about one-third below the historical \naverage.\n  It should be pointed out here that I am not using fiscal year 1985 as \na base year for comparison. That was an extraordinary year because \nthere were two special supplemental appropriations to meet foreign \npolicy crises: a special aid package for the Middle East, and a relief \nbill for famine in Africa.\n  Spending that year, in constant fiscal 1998 dollars, was $36.3 \nbillion, or nearly twice current funding.\n  I recognize that such an anomalous year would skew the comparison, \nand instead I have chosen to look at current funding based against a \n20-year time period.\n  This period, I might add, embraces the tenure of both Presidents \nCarter and Clinton--that is, the two most recent Democratic \nadministrations--as well as those of Presidents Reagan and Bush.\n  In sum, Mr. President, the data do not lie. No matter how you slice \nit, spending for foreign affairs has been severely cut.\n  There's another part of the story that needs to be told, however, and \nthat's how these cuts in international affairs spending, on both \nprograms and people, have impacted American interests.\n  Let us start with the State Department. Since President Clinton \nassumed office, funding for the Department's core activities has fallen \nby 17 percent in real terms.\n  Although the current level is slightly higher than the historical \naverage of the past 20 years, the cuts in the last few years have had a \ndramatic effect on the Department.\n  First, we have closed 36 missions overseas, in locations such as \nZurich, Switzerland, Stuttgart, Germany, and Lubumbashi, Zaire.\n  At the same time, 24 new posts have been opened, 15 of which are in \nthe nations that once comprised the Soviet empire. We now have 249 \noverseas posts, the lowest level since 1980.\n  Now, I am not objecting to cuts made in the interest of efficiency. I \nagree that we should eliminate duplication and waste.\n  What I am concerned about, however, is whether these reductions may \nhave left our interests unevenly protected overseas.\n  Just as one example, the closing last year of the American Consulate \nin Medan, Indonesia, has left us with no American diplomatic presence \nin the second most important commercial center in that country.\n  Unlike Britain, Russia, Japan, Germany, and a host of other countries \nwhich all have diplomats in Medan, our presence is limited to the \nAmerican Embassy some 800 miles away in Jakarta.\n  Medan is located in a part of Indonesia that is a key entry-way for \narms smuggling into the country, and historically has been a hotbed of \npro-independence political activity. Moreover, there are significant \nprivate American economic interests in Medan. However, instead of \nprotecting our interests in the region--both economic and security--we \nhave been reduced to sending someone from the Embassy up to Medan about \nonce every 4 months.\n  Second, the Department is suffering from what might be called an \ninfrastructure deficit. Replacement and modernization of basic \nequipment has been long deferred, and renovation and repair of overseas \nbuildings has been delayed. Let me state it at the most basic level: \nMany diplomats, both here and abroad, still use Wang computers. When \npurchased in the early 1980's, the Wang was state-of-the-art, and the \nState Department was the envy of the Federal Government; today, the \nobsolete computers that pervade the Department make it the laughing-\nstock of Washington. Similarly, over 40 percent of the Department's \noverseas telephone switchboards are obsolete, so old in fact, that \nspare parts are unavailable, and to keep the older systems working, we \ncannibalize ones that have\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\nbeen replaced to fix those still in operation. The same is true for \nover 80 percent of all our radio equipment overseas.\n  In the same vein, thousands of repairs to embassies and other \nfacilities remain unmet because of the lack of funds. Our embassy in \nBeijing--one of our most important posts--is literally falling apart. \nNumerous other facilities, on every continent, require extensive repair \nwork.\n  At other foreign affairs agencies, the story is much the same. At the \nU.S. Information Agency, funding is 13 percent below the average in the \npast 20 years. Two programs which are among our cheapest and most cost-\neffective foreign policy tools--exchanges and international \nbroadcasting--have been particularly affected.\n  For example, budget cuts and a consolidation of all international \nbroadcasting have forced reductions in programming on the Voice of \nAmerica and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. During the Cold War, \nservices like Radio Free Europe provided a steady breath of truth to \nthose trapped behind the Iron Curtain.\n  Today, their mission, and the mission of the new Radio Free Asia, is \nno less important. During my recent visit to Moscow, a leading member \nof the Russian legislature pleaded for the continuation of Radio \nLiberty, which is regarded as a critical tool in a country where the \nmedia remains under strong influence of the government and the ruling \nclasses.\n  The steepest reductions in our foreign policy budget have come in \nforeign assistance, which at $11.5 billion last year--again, using \nfiscal 1998 dollars--is lower, in real terms, than any year of the last \n20, and some 36 percent below the historical average of that period.\n  Foreign aid spending has been steadily falling since the early \n1990's. Reductions of this magnitude have undermined American influence \nand interests around the globe.\n  It is popular to assert that foreign aid is merely the foreign policy \nequivalent of welfare, a supposed giveaway of massive dimensions that \nyields few benefits to American interests, and that if we merely ended \nthe program, our problems with the budget deficit would be over. Wrong \non both counts.\n  Through our foreign assistance programs we help to combat the \nscourges of drug trafficking, international crime, terrorism, and arms \nproliferation. For example, our contributions to the International Law \nEnforcement Academy in Budapest, Hungary, has helped to train nearly \n3,000 foreign law enforcement personnel in fighting organized crime, \ndrugs, and international money laundering. American contributions to \nthese efforts is an important way in which we protect our interests \nabroad.\n  To state the obvious, if we ended all foreign aid--both economic and \nmilitary assistance--we would not end our deficit problem. And the \nprograms are far from a giveaway; they are an investment in our \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I am not the only one who feels that reductions in \nforeign affairs spending have put American interests at risk.\n  A recent independent, bipartisan blue ribbon panel jointly sponsored \nby the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations came \nto the same conclusion.\n  They concluded that ``the cuts already made in the international \naffairs discretionary account have adversely affected, to a significant \ndegree, the ability of the United States to protect and promote its \neconomic, diplomatic and strategic agendas abroad.\n  ``Unless this trend is reversed, American vital interests will be \njeopardized.''\n  Mr. President, we cannot let this trend continue. It is a delusion to \nbelieve that America can remain actively engaged in the world if we \ncontinue to deny the President and the Secretary of State the resources \nnecessary for the conduct of American foreign policy.\n  An important first step in the right direction has been taken by \nfunding in full President Clinton's international affairs budget \nrequest for fiscal 1998.\n  Yet, as I have demonstrated here today, after several years of \ndrastic cuts, continued funding is critical to restoring and enhancing \nAmerica's vital diplomatic capacity.\n  As it has been reported, the President has decided to reorganize the \nmany foreign affairs agencies of the Federal Government.\n  I support the President's reorganization plan, and believe that we \nshould eliminate duplication and waste in our foreign policy programs.\n  However, we in the Congress must keep in mind the needs of the next \ncentury and the importance of our diplomatic presence abroad.\n  I also want to make clear that our reform efforts should be driven \nnot by the imperative of budgetary savings--as important as that is--\nbut by the need to ensure that we have a robust diplomatic presence \naround the globe in order to protect the gains of our cold war victory.\n  Let me also unequivocally state that any savings realized from \nreorganization of our foreign policy agencies should not be diverted \nelsewhere but re-allocated to enhance our diplomatic readiness.\n  Moreover, in acting to ensure adequate funding for American foreign \npolicy, we should also end the false distinction--in both our thinking \nand our budgeting--between foreign policy and national defense.\n  For years, we have distinguished between the two as if they were \nseparate and unrelated aspects of our national budget.\n  But that is hardly the case. Quite the opposite: The two are closely \nlinked, and should be similarly conceived as part of a broader national \nsecurity budget.\n  This is far from a radical concept. More than most Americans, members \nof the U.S. military well understand that diplomacy is the front-line \nof our national defense.\n  Both our diplomats and our soldiers work on a daily basis to protect \nour national security, and their missions overlap frequently.\n  When American aircraft carriers are deployed to the Taiwan Straits, \nthey are not only showing American military power, they are \ndemonstrating the United States commitment to security and stability in \nEast Asia.\n  When American diplomats negotiate nuclear and conventional arms \ncontrol agreements in Europe and Eurasia, they are strengthening \nEuropean security, a vital national interest which has long been \ncentral to our defense planning.\n  In short, just as the projection of military power is a diplomatic \ntool, diplomacy is a weapon in the arsenal of our national defense. \nBoth are vital to our national interest; both should be protected.\n  Mr. President, the debate over the form and substance of our Nation's \nforeign policy comes down to this--will America lead?\n  I believe our interests call for it. The sacrifices of our \ngrandparents and parents require it. The future of this great country \ndemands it.\n  Mr. President, the end of the cold war and the approach of a new \ncentury provides a historic moment for the United States to play a \ndecisive role in world affairs--to bend the course of history slightly. \nSuch moments are rare.\n  The last such time, after the conflagration of the Second World War, \nsaw an active American leadership role in shaping the institutions that \nwere central to world history in the last half of this century--\ninstitutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the \nWorld Bank.\n  Like the choices made by Presidents named Roosevelt and Truman and \nSenators named Connolly and Vandenburg a half century ago, the \ndecisions we make now could affect the course of world history for \ngenerations to come.\n  Congress needs to reinforce America's leadership in the world, and \nprovide the resources necessary to protect our interests overseas.\n  We bear a responsibility to the American people to make the case and \nshow the benefits for these investments, as well as the costs of not \npursuing them.\n  I, for one, will do everything I can as ranking minority member on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee to make sure that we do.\n  Rather than resting on our laurels after winning the cold war, we \nmust be even more resolute, lest we squander an opportunity to bring \npeace and democracy to even more people across the globe.\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4911-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 E. DONNALL THOMAS MEDAL OF ACHIEVEMENT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to pay special tribute to George \nand Jane Russell, two individuals who have made remarkable \ncontributions within their business and local communities. The Russells \nwill be presented with the E. Donnall Thomas Medal of Achievement Award \nat a special celebration to be held on June 14 in Seattle.\n  The E. Donnall Thomas Award is named after Dr. E. Donnall Thomas, \nDirector Emeritus of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's \nClinical Division and recipient of the 1990 Nobel Prize in Medicine, \nwho pioneered bone marrow transplantation as a form of treatment for \ncancer. The guidance of Dr. Thomas and the work of his colleagues \nenables the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to save thousands of \nlives each year.\n  George and Jane Russell truly represent the spirit of the E. Donnall \nThomas Medal of Achievement: inspirational leadership in their company \nand community; a force for positive change; and dedication to service \nthat puts their highest humanitarian principles into action. Together, \nthe Russells have inspired a corporate culture of integrity, earning \ntheir company, the Frank Russell Co., the distinction of ``Best Large \nCompany to Work for in Washington State'' by ``Washington CEO'' in 1994 \nand the Better Workplace award from the Association of Washington \nBusiness in 1995.\n  George Russell is a dynamic industry pioneer who has made an \nindelible mark on the investment world. As the founder of both the \npension consulting business and Russell 20-20, a group providing \ninvestment opportunities for countries making the transition from \ncommand to market economies, George Russell has truly revolutionized \nthe investment world. Jane Russell is credited as the visionary behind \nthe Frank Russell Company's award winning success. As the director of \ncorporate and community relations, Jane promotes a business environment \nbased on mutual trust and respect.\n  The Russells' community involvement and dedication to humanitarian \nefforts is unmatched. Jane has been the recipient of the Tacoma/Pierce \nCounty's Community Service Award and serves on the boards of the \nNational Center for Nonprofit Boards, Washington, DC, the American \nLeadership Forum and the campaign cabinet of the Washington State \nHistory Museum. George is a founding member of the Executive Council \nfor Greater Tacoma, a group of corporate and community leaders \ndedicated to the revitalization of Tacoma. Together, they cochair the \neffort to build the $38.8 million International Museum of Modern Glass \non Tacoma's waterfront.\n  I commend the efforts and the inspiration provided by George and Jane \nRussell. By awarding the Russells with the E. Donnall Thomas Medal of \nAchievement, the Hutchinson Center guarantees that their exemplary \nefforts are not overlooked and reaffirm our commitment to provide the \nFred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center the vital support it needs to \ncontinue its battle against cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4914-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RELIEF OF CHRISTOPH MEILI\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to explain my reasons for \nbeing an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Christoph Meili was until recently a security guard at the Union Bank \nof Switzerland. At about 6 p.m. on January 8 of this year Mr. Meili was \nmaking his nightly rounds, when he stumbled upon a number of crates \ncontaining bank documents. Surprised, Mr. Meili examined the documents \nand found them to be ledgers, letters, and statements of account dating \nback to the 1930's and 1940's, and pertaining mostly to Jewish clients.\n  Mr. Meili knew that historical documents relating to the relationship \nbetween Swiss banks and Jews during the Holocaust were an issue of \ninternational importance. For some time now my colleague from New York, \nSenator D'Amato, has been investigating the role of Swiss banks in \nlaundering money for the Nazis during World War II, and in particular \nthe possibility that those banks reaped huge profits from property and \ngold confiscated from Jewish victims of the Holocaust.\n  In answer to the firestorm of protest over these allegations, the \nSwiss Parliament only 3 weeks before had passed, with great fanfare, a \nlaw specifically prohibiting the destruction of documents that might \nassist in the search for assets properly belonging to victims of \nHitler's concentration camps. Yet here were exactly the kind of \ndocuments the Swiss Parliament presumably wanted to protect.\n  At this point, Christoph Meili could have looked the other way. \nInstead he remembered his responsibility as a civilized human being. He \nspent 20 minutes going through the documents, put what seemed the most \nimportant in his jacket, and took them out to his car.\n\n  We owe Mr. Meili a debt of immense gratitude for this act of \nconscience. But not everyone is thankful to him. He has lost his job. \nHe has received death threats. He is uncertain of his own future and \nthe future of his wife and two young children. His future does not look \nbright in Switzerland.\n  Yet here in America he is welcomed with open arms everywhere he goes, \nas he should be. In early May he was flown to New York under the \nauspices of the World Jewish Congress. He has been warmly received at \nreceptions in both New York and Washington. And Mr. Edgar Bronfman, the \nchairman of the World Jewish Congress and president of the Seagram Co., \nhas offered him a fulltime job.\n  Which brings us to this bill. Mr. Meili and his family seek permanent \nresidency in this country. This is an unusual case, in that he requires \naction on the part of Congress to achieve this status. But this is \nnecessary because Mr. Meili does not meet the necessary criteria for \npermanent residency under any of the existing categories.\n  Mr. Meili has done a great service to the Jewish people, to this \ncountry and to the civilized world. Without thought for his own future \nor well-being he did what his conscience demanded, and saved valuable \nevidence concerning the relationship between Swiss banks and the \nvictims of Hitler's death camps.\n  It seems equally clear to me that Mr. Meili has two possible futures \nahead of him. In the first, we abandon him. The United States turns its \nback on this man of conscience and sends him back to Switzerland. There \nhe faces unemployment, a dark blotch on his record for informing on his \nemployer, and possibly worse. While the vast majority of the Swiss \npeople are decent and law-abiding, some of them already have made \nthreats against him. He would be literally a man without a country.\n  Alternatively, we could welcome Mr. Meili into our Nation, as so many \nof our people already have welcomed him into their hearts. We have the \nchoice. We could open our doors to this man of conscience, giving him \nthe chance to make for himself and his family a brighter future in a \nland that treasures the kind of bravery he has displayed.\n  His circumstances do not fit any of our set categories for \nimmigration. But I am convinced that they present us with the \nopportunity to demonstrate our ability and willingness to recognize \nwhen noble acts render the particulars of bureaucratic regulation less \nimportant than the will to do what is right.\n  Mr. Meili is the kind of man I want for a neighbor. His is a family I \nfeel would benefit any community. Our country can only be made better \nby his permanent residence here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4914-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4914-S4915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GOOD SAMARITAN EXEMPTION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that we have \nmade progress in our efforts to protect Atlantic large whales. As you \nmay recall, on May 8th of this year, several of my colleagues joined \nwith me in introducing the ``Good Samaritan Exemption'' to the Marine \nMammal Protection Act. The Good Samaritan Exemption provides that the \ndisentanglement of a marine mammal from fishing gear does not violate \nthe ``take'' provisions of the MMPA. We were able to have the exemption \naccepted as an amendment to S. 672, and, due to the broad support for \nthis noncontroversial amendment, I am hopeful that it will be included \nin the conference report.\n  However, during the drafting of the amendment a concern emerged that \nthis exemption alone would not provide full protection for citizens \ninvolved in whale disentanglement efforts. On May 20th, I was notified \nby the administration that the necessary steps will be taken to ensure \nthat fishermen and others who act as Good Samaritans\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\nwill not be subject to prosecution under the nation's environmental \nstatutes. I would ask to have printed in the Record a letter from Dr. \nD. James Baker, Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmospheres, which \naddresses this issue.\n  I am pleased that the administration was able to provide this \nassurance so that fishermen acting as Good Samaritans will not be \ntreated unfairly by our laws. With this commitment from the \nadministration, whale disentanglement efforts will be able to expand, \nimproving the welfare and survival of these marine mammal populations.\n  The letter follows:\n         U.S. Department of Commerce,\n\n\n                The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: I am aware of the recent proposals to \n     amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) with a so-\n     called ``Good Samaritan'' exemption, to allow the taking of a \n     marine mammal if the taking is necessary to avoid injury or \n     death to an animal entangled in fishing gear or debris.\n       I am also aware that such a taking could be a violation of \n     the Endangered Species Act (ESA), if the animal is listed as \n     endangered or threatened under that statute. The National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) believes that \n     Section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act authorizes \n     the Secretary to permit the taking of an endangered marine \n     mammal in accordance with the conditions contained in the \n     Snowe-Kerry ``Good Samaritan'' amendment. I am writing to you \n     to express the commitment of NOAA to take the most \n     appropriate administrative action under Section 10(a)(1)(A) \n     of the ESA, to allow a ``Good Samaritan'' taking of an \n     entangled marine mammal in the circumstances specified in the \n     proposed MMPA amendment, specifically with regard to large \n     whales.\n       Thank you for your efforts to rationalize interactions \n     between the fishing industry and marine mammals.\n           Sincerely,\n     D. James Baker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4914-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House of Representatives on (S. 543) a bill to provide \ncertain protections to volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and \ngovernmental entities in lawsuits based on the activities of \nvolunteers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 543) entitled \n     ``An Act to provide certain protections to volunteers, \n     nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities in \n     lawsuits based on the activities of volunteers'', do pass \n     with the following amendment:\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer Protection Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n     is deterred by the potential for liability actions against \n     them;\n       (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n     organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n     associations, social service agencies, educational \n     institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely \n     affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of \n     directors and service in other capacities;\n       (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n     is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n     programs than would be obtainable if volunteers were \n     participating;\n       (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n     effective social service programs, many of which are national \n     in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and \n     represent some of the most successful public-private \n     partnerships, protection of volunteerism through \n     clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks \n     assumed by the volunteer in connection with such \n     participation is an appropriate subject for Federal \n     legislation;\n       (5) services and goods provided by volunteers and nonprofit \n     organizations would often otherwise be provided by private \n     entities that operate in interstate commerce;\n       (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n     costs, volunteers and nonprofit organizations face higher \n     costs in purchasing insurance, through interstate insurance \n     markets, to cover their activities; and\n       (7) clarifying and limiting the liability risk assumed by \n     volunteers is an appropriate subject for Federal legislation \n     because--\n       (A) of the national scope of the problems created by the \n     legitimate fears of volunteers about frivolous, arbitrary, or \n     capricious lawsuits;\n       (B) the citizens of the United States depend on, and the \n     Federal Government expends funds on, and provides tax \n     exemptions and other consideration to, numerous social \n     programs that depend on the services of volunteers;\n       (C) it is in the interest of the Federal Government to \n     encourage the continued operation of volunteer service \n     organizations and contributions of volunteers because the \n     Federal Government lacks the capacity to carry out all of the \n     services provided by such organizations and volunteers; and\n       (D)(i) liability reform for volunteers, will promote the \n     free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate \n     commerce and uphold constitutionally protected due process \n     rights; and\n       (ii) therefore, liability reform is an appropriate use of \n     the powers contained in article 1, section 8, clause 3 of the \n     United States Constitution, and the fourteenth amendment to \n     the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the \n     interests of social service program beneficiaries and \n     taxpayers and to sustain the availability of programs, \n     nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities that \n     depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws to \n     provide certain protections from liability abuses related to \n     volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental \n     entities.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--This Act preempts the laws of any State to \n     the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act, \n     except that this Act shall not preempt any State law that \n     provides additional protection from liability relating to \n     volunteers or to any category of volunteers in the \n     performance of services for a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This Act \n     shall not apply to any civil action in a State court against \n     a volunteer in which all parties are citizens of the State if \n     such State enacts a statute in accordance with State \n     requirements for enacting legislation--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that this Act \n     shall not apply, as of a date certain, to such civil action \n     in the State; and\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\n       (3) containing no other provisions.\n\n     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n       (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as \n     provided in subsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a \n     nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable \n     for harm caused by an act or omission of the volunteer on \n     behalf of the organization or entity if--\n       (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;\n       (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly \n     licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate \n     authorities for the activities or practice in the State in \n     which the harm occurred, where the activities were or \n     practice was undertaken within the scope of the volunteer's \n     responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity;\n       (3) the harm was not caused by willful or criminal \n     misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a \n     conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of \n     the individual harmed by the volunteer; and\n       (4) the harm was not caused by the volunteer operating a \n     motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which \n     the State requires the operator or the owner of the vehicle, \n     craft, or vessel to--\n       (A) possess an operator's license; or\n       (B) maintain insurance.\n       (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers to \n     Organizations and Entities.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect any civil action brought by any nonprofit \n     organization or any governmental entity against any volunteer \n     of such organization or entity.\n       (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization or Entity.--\n     Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the \n     liability of any nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity with respect to harm caused to any person.\n       (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the \n     laws of a State limit volunteer liability subject to one or \n     more of the following conditions, such conditions shall not \n     be construed as inconsistent with this section:\n       (1) A State law that requires a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity to adhere to risk management procedures, \n     including mandatory training of volunteers.\n       (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity \n     liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the \n     same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or \n     omissions of its employees.\n       (3) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of \n     a State or local government pursuant to State or local law.\n       (4) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     applicable only if the nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity provides a financially secure source of recovery for \n     individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a \n     volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. A \n     financially secure source of recovery may be an insurance \n     policy within specified limits, comparable coverage from a \n     risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative \n     arrangements that satisfy the State that the organization or \n     entity will be able to pay for losses up to a specified \n     amount. Separate standards for different types of liability \n     exposure may be specified.\n       (e) Limitation on Punitive Damages Based on the Actions of \n     Volunteers.--\n       (1) General rule.--Punitive damages may not be awarded \n     against a volunteer in an action brought for harm based on \n     the action of a volunteer acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity unless the claimant establishes by clear \n     and convincing evidence that the harm was proximately caused \n     by an action of such volunteer which constitutes willful or \n     criminal misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to \n     the rights or safety of the individual harmed.\n       (2) Construction.--Paragraph (1) does not create a cause of \n     action for punitive damages and does not preempt or supersede \n     any Federal or State law to the extent that such law would \n     further limit the award of punitive damages.\n       (f) Exceptions to Limitations on Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--The limitations on the liability of a \n     volunteer under this Act shall not apply to any misconduct \n     that--\n       (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is \n     defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) or act \n     of international terrorism (as that term is defined in \n     section 2331 of title 18) for which the defendant has been \n     convicted in any court;\n       (B) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the \n     Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note));\n       (C) involves a sexual offense, as defined by applicable \n     State law, for which the defendant has been convicted in any \n     court;\n       (D) involves misconduct for which the defendant has been \n     found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law; \n     or\n       (E) where the defendant was under the influence (as \n     determined pursuant to applicable State law) of intoxicating \n     alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.\n       (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     be construed to effect subsection (a)(3) or (e).\n\n     SEC. 5. LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--In any civil action against a volunteer, \n     based on an action of a volunteer acting within the scope of \n     the volunteer's responsibilities to a nonprofit organization \n     or governmental entity, the liability of the volunteer for \n     noneconomic loss shall be determined in accordance with \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant who is a volunteer, shall \n     be liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss allocated \n     to that defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant (determined in accordance \n     with paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect \n     to which that defendant is liable. The court shall render a \n     separate judgment against each defendant in an amount \n     determined pursuant to the preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant who is a volunteer under this section, the trier of \n     fact shall determine the percentage of responsibility of that \n     defendant for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Economic loss.--The term ``economic loss'' means any \n     pecuniary loss resulting from harm (including the loss of \n     earnings or other benefits related to employment, medical \n     expense loss, replacement services loss, loss due to death, \n     burial costs, and loss of business or employment \n     opportunities) to the extent recovery for such loss is \n     allowed under applicable State law.\n       (2) Harm.--The term ``harm'' includes physical, \n     nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses.\n       (3) Noneconomic losses.--The term ``noneconomic losses'' \n     means losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, \n     inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, \n     disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and \n     companionship, loss of consortium (other than loss of \n     domestic service), hedonic damages, injury to reputation and \n     all other nonpecuniary losses of any kind or nature.\n       (4) Nonprofit organization.--The term ``nonprofit \n     organization'' means--\n       (A) any organization which is described in section \n     501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt \n     from tax under section 501(a) of such Code and which does not \n     practice any action which constitutes a hate crime referred \n     to in subsection (b)(1) of the first section of the Hate \n     Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note); or\n       (B) any not-for-profit organization which is organized and \n     conducted for public benefit and operated primarily for \n     charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health \n     purposes and which does not practice any action which \n     constitutes a hate crime referred to in subsection (b)(1) of \n     the first section of the Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. \n     534 note).\n       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, any other territory or possession of the \n     United States, or any political subdivision of any such \n     State, territory, or possession.\n       (6) Volunteer.--The term ``volunteer'' means an individual \n     performing services for a nonprofit organization or a \n     governmental entity who does not receive--\n       (A) compensation (other than reasonable reimbursement or \n     allowance for expenses actually incurred); or\n       (B) any other thing of value in lieu of compensation,\n\n     in excess of $500 per year, and such term includes a \n     volunteer serving as a director, officer, trustee, or direct \n     service volunteer.\n\n     SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act shall take effect 90 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Application.--This Act applies to any claim for harm \n     caused by an act or omission of a volunteer where that claim \n     is filed on or after the effective date of this Act but only \n     if the harm that is the subject of the claim or the conduct \n     that caused such harm occurred after such effective date.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the House Judiciary Committee and \nthe House of Representatives for their consideration and passage of \nH.R. 911, the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997.\n  At the beginning of this month, the senior Senator from Georgia and I \nworked out a compromise version of the Volunteer Protection Act, S. \n543. Our bipartisan legislation extended reasonable liability \nprotection to individual volunteers for honest mistakes with no effect \non liability of nonprofit organizations and governmental entities. The \nCoverdell-Leahy substitute offered liability protection for individuals \nwho are volunteering to help others and acting in good faith and passed \nthe Senate by a 99-1 vote.\n  I am pleased that the House Judiciary Committee adopted the \nCoverdell-Leahy substitute version of the Volunteer Protection Act at \nits mark-up of H.R. 911. During its consideration of H.R. 911, the \nHouse Judiciary Committee adopted two amendments that improve our \nlegislation.\n  First, the House Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment by \nRepresentative Scott that applies the act's protection to conduct after \nthe act's effective date. Prospective application makes sense since the \nact's passage will give notice to all parties of their new legal \nrights.\n  Second, House Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment by \nRepresentative Jackson-Lee that exempts members of hate groups from the \nliability protections in the bill. Although I am\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\nnot completely comfortable with the language of this amendment, its \npurpose is clear--to make sure that this legislation provides no \nprotection whatsoever to anyone who is involved in a hate crime. I know \nthat every one of my colleagues opposes hate groups and would not \nsupport liability protection for them and this amendment makes that \nexplicitly clear.\n  I recommend that my colleagues review the House Judiciary Committee \nreport on H.R. 911, House Report 105-101, for a section-by-section \nanalysis and summary of the bill.\n  Although I support the Volunteer Protection Act, I realize that it is \nnot perfect. I am troubled by its possible preemption of existing state \nlaw. While the bill's preemption provision has been significantly \nnarrowed from the original version of S. 543, this legislation still \npreempts state laws that do not provide more protection for volunteers. \nIf preemption occurs, State legislatures may pass legislation to opt \nout of the bill's coverage.\n  Rather than preempting some State laws, I would prefer that Congress \noffer Federal incentives to States to enact model language for limiting \nvolunteer liability. Many States have already acted on this issue with \nat least 44 States having passed some protection for volunteers. If we \ncan achieve the shared objective of protecting individual volunteers \nwithout preempting State tort law, I think we should be pursuing that \nroute. That approach, however, was not acceptable to the majority.\n  I am also troubled by the manner that the Senate considered the \nVolunteer Protection Act. S. 543 was brought to the Senate floor \nwithout notice, without hearings and without a committee report. \nAlthough Senator Coverdell and I were able to work together to fashion \na bipartisan bill, I believe that process would have been much easier \nhad we gone through the normal process of considering the Volunteer \nProtection Act through the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I share a profound sense of gratitude and appreciation \nfor the thousands of Vermonters and millions of volunteers nationwide \nwhose selfless acts make the world a better place for us all. The \npeople who spend their weekends preparing dinners for the homeless and \npoor, the parents who organize a carwash to raise money for the local \nPTA, the neighbors who donate to those displaced by flood, fire and \nother disasters--these generous acts of voluntarism and countless \nothers are an essential element of the American social fabric.\n  The Presidents' Summit on America's Future last month in Philadelphia \nwas a tribute to the spirit of American voluntarism and a magnifying \nglass that will help spark intensified efforts by all Americans to be \nbetter citizens and better neighbors; citizens who will be more willing \nto give of ourselves to make life better in our communities and nation. \nThe events in Philadelphia were nonpartisan and inclusive of the \ninterests of all. I am pleased that we in the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives were able to work in that spirit to craft bipartisan \nlegislation that promotes the worthy goals of voluntarism in America.\n  I believe we are building on the success of the Presidents' Summit on \nAmerica's Future by working together to pass a good bill that provides \nvolunteers involved in the delivery of needed services with reasonable \nliability protection. I urge my colleagues to support S. 543, the \nVolunteer Protection Act.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have today taken an important step \nto encourage more people to step forward and serve their communities as \nvolunteers by removing the fear of unwarranted lawsuits against \nvolunteers. Our adoption of S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act of \n1997, will grant immunity from personal civil liability, under certain \ncircumstances, to volunteers working for nonprofit organizations and \ngovernmental entities.\n  This legislation has enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in both \nbodies. I want to thank all of those members who supported this bill to \nhelp our volunteers all across America. In particular, I would like to \nrecognize the leadership of Senator McConnell, who has been a strong \nadvocate of reform in this area, and the other cosponsors of the bill: \nSenator Abraham, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Enzi, Senator Gramm, Senator \nGregg, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, Senator Kyl, Senator Santorum, \nand Senator Sessions. All of them were extremely helpful during the \noriginal Senate debate and in many other ways as we moved this \nlegislation forward.\n  I thank also Senator Leahy for his cooperation and leadership in \nstriking a compromise that both sides of the aisle, and indeed both \nChambers, could support.\n  From the other body, I thank Congressman John Porter of Illinois, who \nhas been promoting the issue of volunteer protection since 1986 and \ntruly laid the foundation for today's success. Henry Hyde, Chairman of \nthe House Judiciary Committee, was instrumental in holding hearings on \nvolunteer protection legislation. I should also thank Congressman Bob \nInglis for his leadership on this issue. And Speaker Gingrich lent his \nstrong support to our effort. We worked in close coordination with our \ncolleagues in the other body and I appreciate their cooperation and \nhard work to make this victory possible for volunteers.\n  We now send the Volunteer Protection Act to the White House with the \nexpectation that the President will enthusiastically sign it. This \nlegislation bears directly on the mission of the Philadelphia Summit \nheld last month at which President Clinton, and former Presidents Bush, \nCarter, and Ford joined with Gen. Colin Powell and other leaders to ask \nAmericans to make a commitment to volunteerism.\n  Congress has now said to would-be volunteers that you don't have to \nbe afraid of being named in a frivolous lawsuit based on your volunteer \nservice. If you make a simple, honest mistake, we are not going to put \nall your assets on the block in a lawsuit lottery. Don't be afraid to \nstep forward, get involved, and take an active part in the affairs of \nyour community.\n  We hope the President will join with the overwhelming majorities in \nboth houses of Congress and sign the Volunteer Protection Act into law.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the House passed \nvolunteer protection legislation this week and that the Senate is now \nvoting on final passage of the Volunteer Protection Act. I look forward \nto our sending this important legislation to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Thanks to the tireless efforts of my distinguished colleagues, \nparticularly Senators Coverdell and McConnell, but also Senators \nSantorum, Ashcroft and others, including Representatives Porter and \nInglis in the House, we were able to pass this legislation, which will \ngrant meaningful relief from unwarranted litigation to volunteers.\n  I have heard from my constituents in Michigan and others time and \nagain about baseless lawsuits that have plagued volunteers and about \nhow some have declined to volunteer or have limited their voluntary \nactivities out of concern for being sued. Volunteers with the Boy \nScouts, Little League, the Red Cross, and many other fine organizations \nhave been subject to frivolous and baseless litigation. They have had \nto spend considerable time and money defending lawsuits. That time and \nmoney could be going to charitable activities, instead of going to \nincreased legal fees and liability insurance costs.\n  We heard many examples of frivolous lawsuits and their costs during \nfloor debate on this legislation, and I am pleased that Congress is \ntaking action to address these significant problems that have hindered \ncharitable activities. While many other sectors of our society and our \neconomy continue to face equally harmful lawsuit abuses and while we \nneed broader litigation reforms to address those abuses, this \nlegislation represents a significant step forward in reintroducing some \nmeasure of fairness and justice in our civil justice system. In the \ncoming weeks, I plan to introduce a bill that would provide relief from \nabusive lawsuits to small businesses, and I also plan to join Senator \nMcConnell in introducing a broad civil justice reform bill similar to \nthe bill on which he and I collaborated last Congress. Those efforts \nare no less needed, but voluntary activity does provide some very \nspecial benefits that justify kicking off legal reform efforts this \nCongress by focussing on volunteers.\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\n  Charitable activity in particular provides a unique link between us \nas members of the same community. Through volunteer work and efforts, \neach of us think of our neighbors, and even strangers, as our brothers \nand sisters, deserving of our care and help. All too often, abusive \nlitigation has broken down that community spirit and made us look at \neach other as potential plaintiffs and defendants, rather than as \nneighbors and friends.\n\n  The Volunteer Protection Act will help rebuild that spirit by \nreducing litigation excesses. The bill provides relief from punitive \ndamages for volunteers by providing that punitive damages may only be \nawarded against a volunteer in cases in which the claimant proves by \nclear and convincing evidence that the harm was caused by the defendant \nthrough criminal or willful misconduct or through a conscious, flagrant \nindifference to the rights and safety of the claimant.\n  The act also reintroduces some fairness into the system by reforming \njoint and several liability rules so that, where a volunteer is a \ndefendant in an action, the volunteer will be liable for noneconomic \ndamages only in proportion to the volunteer's responsibility for \ncausing the harm. That is only fair. In addition, where a volunteer is \nnot acting with gross negligence, recklessness, or in a more egregious \nfashion, that volunteer will not be liable for harm caused in the scope \nof the voluntary activity.\n  This legislation also includes a State opt-out provision, under which \na State may opt out of the bill's provisions for cases in State court \nin which all parties are citizens of the State. No State is expected to \nelect out of the coverage of this bill's worthy provisions, but it was \nimportant to include such a provision out of respect for principles of \nfederalism.\n  These reforms can help create a system in which plaintiffs sue only \nwhen they have good reason--and only those who are responsible for \ntheir damages--and in which only those who are responsible must pay. \nSuch reforms will create an atmosphere in which our fear of one another \nwill be lessened, and our ability to join associations in which we \nlearn to care for one another will be significantly greater.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting this \nlegislation, I look forward to continuing to work to achieve broader \nlegal reforms, and I hope that the President will demonstrate his \nsupport for voluntarism by signing the Volunteer Protection Act into \nlaw.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am proud tonight to see that we are \none small step away from providing protections for one of our most \ncherished resources--that is, the men and women who serve as volunteers \nthroughout our communities. The Senate is prepared to pass this bill \ntonight, and we anxiously await the President's signature.\n  This country's long line of volunteerism is built upon the principle \nof loving your neighbor as yourself--of being a ``Good Samaritan'' and \nstopping along side the road to lend a helping hand. People from my \nhome state of Kentucky understand and live this simple, yet powerful \nprinciple.\n  Unfortunately, this volunteer spirit has become another victim to our \nnational epidemic of litigation. William Cople, former pro bono General \nCounsel for the National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica has written that, ``volunteer service is under assault from an \nunlikely quarter--the civil justice system. Like so many others, \nvolunteers and their service organizations have been swept into the \ncourts to face potential liability in civil suits.''\n  Moreover, even the Little League faces major league liabilities. As \nDr. Creighton Hale, former CEO of Little League Baseball, has noted, \nthe Little League has become the ``Litigation League.'' For example, \none woman won a cash settlement when she was struck by a ball that a \nplayer failed to catch. Incidentally, the player was her daughter.\n  The chilling effect of even one settlement or judgment is astounding. \nAgain, I quote the Boy Scouts' former General Counsel who has \nexplained: ``a legal judgment entered in a single case can have a \nmultitude of consequences extending far beyond that case itself. This \nsurely is a reason for concern in the case of volunteers to service \norganizations.''\n\n  It is precisely this type of reasoning and this type of horror \nstories-come-to-life that prompted me to introduce legislation to \nprotect volunteers. I have introduced such legislation in 1990, 1993, \nand 1995. In this Congress, I have been proud to work with Senator \nCoverdell to bring this bill to final passage, and I greatly appreciate \nhis leadership.\n  Specifically, our bill protects volunteers: First, who act within the \nscope of their responsibilities, second, who are properly licensed or \ncertified, where necessary, and third, who do not act in a willful, \ncriminal or grossly negligent fashion.\n  The organizations whose volunteers will receive protection are both \nbroad and worthy. Our bill not only covers 501(c)(3) organizations, but \nit also covers volunteers of the organizations which do good work, but \ndo not have a tax exemption under 501(c)(3). For example, our bill \ncovers volunteers of local charities, volunteer fire departments, \nlittle leagues, veterans groups, trade associations, chambers of \ncommerce, and other nonprofit entities that exist for charitable, \nreligious, educational, and civic purposes.\n  Finally, this bill is significant because it provides a national \nsolution for a national problem. Bob Goodwin, president and CEO of The \nPoints of Light Foundation, testified recently that a national solution \nis necessary because ``there is no consistency among our states with \nregard to volunteer liability statutes.'' Moreover, Mr. Goodwin \nexplained that ``the lack of consistency has led to confusion in the \nvolunteer community.'' The Volunteer Protection Act responds to this \nneed and provides a uniform minimum standard to protect our volunteers.\n  In closing, let me say a deep word of thanks to all the volunteers \nand leaders who have helped me push for this legislation over the past \n7 years. In particular, I want to offer a special and heartfelt thank \nyou to my wife, Elaine Chao, who has kept me focused on this issue, and \nbeen such a steady and constant voice for the men and women who serve \nin our communities.\n  I also thank the President for his efforts in joining with Gen. Colin \nPowell and with President Bush to promote volunteerism throughout our \ncountry. I encourage President Clinton to sign this legislation and \nprovide much-needed protection for our volunteers.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the Senate concur in the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4915-5", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4918-S4919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AUTHORIZING AWARDING A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO MOTHER TERESA\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to immediate consideration of H.R. 1650 which has been received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1650) to authorize the President to award a \n     gold medal on behalf of the Congress to Mother Teresa of \n     Calcutta in recognition of her outstanding and enduring \n     contributions through humanitarian and charitable activities.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise in order to urge the Senate to \npass and send to the President, H.R. 1650, a bill to award Mother \nTeresa a Congressional Gold Medal.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to commend our colleague, the \nhonorable Senator from Kansas, Sam Brownback, for his tireless efforts \nto pass this legislation. Senator Brownback first introduced a Senate \nversion of this legislation, S. 689, earlier this month with \noverwhelming bipartisan support and cosponsorship.\n  That this legislation has moved quickly and easily through both \nHouses of Congress is a testament not only to Mother Teresa's \nhumanitarian and charitable activities over a lifetime, but also to \nSenator Brownback's hard work and commitment to honoring this \noutstanding human being.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor Congress can bestow \non someone for acts and dedication to a cause that exceeds even the \nhighest\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\nstandards. This bill honors Mother Teresa for her lifelong devotion to \nthe sick and the needy in the most impoverished areas of the world. It \nalso recognizes her work to build and sustain the Missionaries of \nCharities in 25 countries. Under her direction and following her \nexample of selflessness, over 3,000 members of the Missionaries of \nCharities stand ready to continue her work.\n  Mr. President, Mother Teresa has already been awarded the Nobel Peace \nPrize and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is time for Congress \nitself to honor Mother Teresa and I commend Senator Brownback for \ninitiating this legislation. I offer my personal thanks and \ncongratulations to my colleague.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, we are fortunate when our working \nassociates are knowledgeable, efficient, responsible and willing to go \nthe extra mile.\n  But none of those attributes mean much over the long haul until you \nadd loyalty to the mix.\n  For half of my life--and two-thirds of hers--Barbara Andrews-Mee has \nbeen my boss--as a lawyer, a member of our state legislature and as a \nU.S. Senator.\n  Her talents are many. But, when I've been asked, ``What is Barb's \nbest characteristic?'' I say, ``loyalty.''\n  That means more to me than any of the help she's given me and the \npeople of Alaska over more than three decades: work above and beyond \nthe call of duty.\n  Through our 36 years of working together, Barb has solved problems \nfor countless Alaskans.\n  She's been to hundreds--maybe even thousands--of meetings of civic \nand community groups to keep her finger on the pulse, to help keep me \ninformed.\n  A tireless supporter of our military men and women, she has attended \nceremonies on bases and posts, on submarines and on her own ship, the \nU.S.S. Zephyr, a PC8 coastal patrol craft, which she christened.\n  Barb has watched parades and air shows and presentations of colors \nand speeches of all types, and worked to ensure that military people \nwho serve in Alaska are treated with respect as our neighbors and \nconstituents.\n  Barb, can on request, put a file in my hand that is sometimes decades \nold. She can always locate them.\n  She's been the institutional memory for the young Alaskans who come \nto work with us, fresh out of school.\n  And, after they've served on the Senate payroll and move on, they \ncome back to see Barb.\n  My grandmother always told me, ``Just remember, dynamite comes in \nsmall packages.''\n  That's Barb.\n  She knows when to use her Norwegian stubbornness or her Alaskan \ntoughness to get a job done.\n  She also knows how to set me straight, and has done it many times.\n  Many a morning Barb has risen long before dawn, or many a dark night, \nwell after others in Anchorage have gone to bed, she has traveled to \nElmendorf Air Force Base to greet, in my name, dignitaries whose planes \nare making a brief stopover.\n  She gives our visitors an Alaskan gift package--some smoked salmon, \ncrackers, and candy. And every time afterward, the visitors say, \n``Remember me to Barb.''\n  She's met my planes every hour of the day and night when I come home.\n  And she's made sure I made my flights back to Washington, DC, no \nmatter how tight the time frame, possibly testing the speed limits \nalong the way, but always getting me there.\n  One year I came home 36 times. She met me every time but one. When I \ngot there that night, having left the Senate at 4 p.m., battled traffic \nand got the 5:30 plane and arrived in Anchorage about 11:30 p.m., there \nwas no one there.\n\n  I waited, then called Barb. ``What's up?'' I said to my sleepy \nfriend. ``What's my schedule?''\n  ``You aren't here, chief,'' Barb said. ``I won't tell anyone you're \nhere if you won't tell anyone I'm not there!\"\n  I went fishing and then went back to DC.\n  We've shared much more than a working relationship through the years, \nMr. President. Barb's friendship has meant much to me and my family.\n  In our worst days, when I lost my wife Ann who was Barb's good \nfriend, Barb did everything possible to ease our pain, despite her own \nsense of loss.\n  Barb's quick with the quip, and usually has a great joke to share \nwhen it looks like our spirits are low.\n  Along with her job, and her sons, her daughter-in-law, and \ngrandchildren, and her husband, Vince, Barb has another special love.\n  It's golf.\n  The snow has hardly disappeared from our Alaska golf courses before \nBarb is on the links.\n  With Vince, she packs up her clubs and heads for sunny climes \nwhenever there's an opportunity.\n\n[[Page S4921]]\n\n  Like everything else she's worked on, Barb continues to perfect her \ngolf game.\n  We may not see her on the L.P.G.A. circuit, but she's going to give \nthose other lady golfers a run for their money.\n  Mr. President, it's impossible to sum up 36 years of association in \none small tribute.\n  Mike Doogan, a columnist for the Anchorage Daily News, in a farewell \ncolumn about Barb's years with us, quoted her as saying, ``It's been a \ngreat ride.''\n  You bet it has.\n  But more than all of her other great attributes, Barb's loyalty has \nsustained me, comforted me, inspired me, and helped me to overcome \ntough situations.\n  She may not be coming into my Anchorage office every day, anymore. \nShe may be soaking up sunshine at her Arizona getaway, or on a Hawaiian \nIsland or a Florida Key.\n  But no matter where Barb is, she knows she can count on me to be her \nfriend for all time.\n  There is no way to thank Barb, Mr. President. The words ``Thank you'' \nare too small to convey the depth and breadth and length of the \ngratitude I have for all of the wonderful years Barb Andrews-Mee has \nshared with me, with my family, and with Alaskans.\n  We'll miss our day-to-day contact, but we'll always know we have a \nloyal friend.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record Mike Doogan's Anchorage Daily \nNews column of Sunday, May 18.\n  The column follows:\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, May 18, 1997]\n\n      Andrews-Mee Leaves'em Laughing, and Grateful After 35 Years\n\n                            (By Mike Doogan)\n\n       You have to say this for Barbara Andrews--Mee: She's no \n     quitter. She's worked for the same fellow for 35 years.\n       ``I have been with Ted Stevens longer than I have been with \n     three husbands,'' she said last week with a characteristic \n     laugh. ``It's been a great ride.''\n       The ride end this month, when Andrews-Mee retires as \n     manager of U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens' Anchorage office.\n       Resplendent in a red plaid blazer, Andrews-Mee sat in \n     Stevens' big office in the federal building and talked about \n     her time with Alaska's senator-for-life. Her own office, next \n     door, was stacked with files she's trying to clean out. Her \n     desk, which once belonged to Stevens' predecessor, Bob \n     Bartlett, was a jumble of notes and letters. Propped atop a \n     filing cabinet was a big, black-and-white photo of a younger \n     Stevens, looking like his dog had just died, with a hand-\n     lettered caption that read: Whoever said it would be easy?\n       Maybe it hasn't all been easy, but for Andrews-Mee it seems \n     to have been fun. The woman is a pistol. Here's just a \n     sample:\n       On her height (she's 5 feet tall): ``I tell people used to \n     be 6-foot-2, and then I went to work for Stevens.''\n       On her age (she's 59): ``Jeez, that's hell, when you to \n     have to admit your kid's going to turn 40.''\n       On why she never ran for office herself: ``Oh, no, my skin \n     is too think. Like the fellow who goes to a football game and \n     when they go into a huddle, he thinks they're talking about \n     him?''\n       On the fancy new computer she has at home: ``We've got the \n     whole thing. Don't get off at Chicago if you're going to New \n     York.''\n       On her plans for retirement: ``My god, I am my mother. You \n     know how you just become your parents? My mother was a holy \n     terror 89 when she died and still dying her hair red. I'm not \n     going to sit home and watch soaps.''\n       Instead, she said, she's going to play golf--she's still \n     trying to break 100--serve on the Defense Advisory Commission \n     on Women in the Services, and do volunteer work.\n       ``It's payback time,'' she said, ``my country and my state \n     and my community.''\n       Andrews-Mee went to work for Stevens when he was just \n     another lawyer with political ambitions. He was first elected \n     to the state Legislature in 1962, before there was the oil \n     money to pay legislative staff.\n       ``In those days, Ted would find somebody going to Anchorage \n     and give them three, four Dictaphone belts, and I'd type them \n     up and send them back,'' she said. ``And that's how we did \n     legislative mail.''\n       Stevens' political success since then owes a lot to \n     Andrews-Mee. His office has a long-standing reputation for \n     solving constituents' problems, whether or not the \n     constituent is a Stevens supporter.\n       ``When somebody tells me, `I voted for Ted,' I say, ``That \n     great, but we represent everybody,'' she said.\n       That attitude is a big part of the reason so many Democrats \n     enter the voting booth every six years and quietly cast a \n     ballot for the Republican. One way or another, Andrews-Mee \n     has made her boss a lot of friends.\n       So it seems appropriate, out of respect for the job she's \n     done, to let Andrews-Mee say she's been happy to do that for \n     Stevens, to let her sneak in one last plug for her boss.\n       ``He's done a great job.'' she said. ``Why else would I \n     stay with somebody for 35 years.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4920-5", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

I thank the Chair. I especially thank the Chair for his \ncourtesy of remaining behind to listen as I present my remarks on the \nbudget agreement. I apologize to him because I have been seeking to do \nthis as we have gone through the afternoon and evening. But other \nbusiness intervened, and it was in the best interest of the body that \nwe allow those amendments to be taken up and considered. But I do \nappreciate the Chair's indulgence.\n  Mr. President, as a Member of the Finance and Budget Committees, I \nrise to support the budget agreement. I believe it is a modest step--I \nwant to emphasize ``modest''--step in the right direction. Before I \ndiscuss its provisions I would like to remind my colleagues of why we \nare in a position to consider such a budget agreement. We are here \nbecause Democrats made very tough choices in 1993. In 1993, we were in \nthe majority and we had the burden of coming up with a budget \nresolution. We made a series of decisions, including the need to move \ntoward a balanced budget and to do it as quickly as possible. And as a \nresult of that agreement, the deficit has been reduced and reduced \ndramatically. I remind my colleagues that in 1992 the deficit was $290 \nbillion. This year CBO is now telling us the deficit will be $67 \nbillion, a 77 percent reduction.\n  If we look at the deficit in a different way, as a percentage of the \nsize of our economy, we can see that the deficit has also declined even \nmore dramatically. In this case, we look at the deficit in terms of a \npercentage of our gross domestic product, or the size of our national \neconomy, and we can see that we have gone from a deficit of just under \n5 percent to a deficit of just under 1 percent.\n  These reductions in the deficit took pressure off interest rates and \nkicked off four years of strong economic growth. The results are that \nthe United States economy has created 12 million new jobs since that \n1993 budget deal. We are the biggest job generator in the \nindustrialized world.\n  But the good news doesn't end there. Not only have we seen tremendous \njob generation in the United States and strong economic growth, but we \nhave also seen remarkable results in terms of inflation. As you can \nsee, inflation is now at its lowest level in 31 years. Inflation is now \ndramatically reduced in this country--we have an inflation rate of \nunder three percent. Unemployment has similarly seen a dramatic \ndecline. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 24 years. This chart \nshows what has happened to the unemployment rate. It indicates that we \nhave got the lowest level since 1973; again dramatic economic results \nin part because of that 1993 budget agreement. That 1993 budget \nagreement cut spending, and also raised income taxes on the wealthiest \none percent in this country.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle said if we passed that \nagreement it would increase unemployment, it would increase the \ndeficit, and it would crater the economy. They were wrong. That \neconomic plan has worked and worked remarkably well. Not only have we \nseen terrific results in terms of unemployment and inflation, look at \nwhat has happened to real business fixed investment. Real business \nfixed investment has been growing at an annual rate of 9 percent for \nthe last four years.\n  You can see that since the 1993 agreement real business fixed \ninvestment has taken off. Not only do we see good results there--let's \nlook at the misery index--we used to talk a lot about the misery index. \nThat is the combined rate of unemployment and inflation. The misery \nindex is now at its lowest\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n\nlevel since 1968. That is the lowest level in almost 30 years.\n  Mr. President, incomes are going up, and poverty is going down.\n  This chart speaks to some of the really remarkable economic results \nthat we have gotten ever since the 1993 budget agreement. At that time \nwe put in place a new economic plan. Since that time we have seen \nmedian household income up the largest increase in a decade. We have \nseen the largest decline in income inequality in 27 years. We see \nnearly 2 million fewer people in poverty, the largest drop in the \npoverty rate in this country in 27 years. The poverty rate for the \nelderly is at 10.5 percent, its lowest level ever, and we've seen the \nbiggest drop in child poverty in 20 years. Those are remarkable \neconomic results by any standard.\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to put in some context what the 1993 budget \nagreement meant in terms of deficit reduction compared to the agreement \nthat we are working on now. I think it tells quite a story.\n  This chart shows the 1997 budget agreement was possible only with the \n1993 deficit savings. The purple area shows the savings from the 1993 \ndeficit reduction package and the economic growth that it made \npossible. The 1993 budget agreement reduced the deficit from 1994 to \n2002 by $2 trillion. The savings in the 1997 package during that period \nwill be $200 billion, or one-tenth as much.\n  Mr. President, the only reason we are able to have an agreement like \nthe one that is before us is because of what was done in 1993.\n  But when I look at the 1997 agreement I largely see a missed \nopportunity. Eighty percent of the American people in the polls say \nthey don't believe this new agreement is going to balance the budget. I \nregret to say that 80 percent of the American people are right. This \nagreement does not balance the budget.\n  Unfortunately, as this chart shows, if you go out to the year 2002, \nwhat you find is not a zero deficit but a $109 billion deficit. The \nreason for that difference is, of course, that the only way they are \nable to claim balance as a result of this agreement is that they are \ncounting all of the Social Security trust fund surpluses.\n  That is not a balanced budget. That is not a balanced budget by our \nown rules. If you look in the concurrent resolution, the document that \nis before us, and you turn to the page that reports what the deficit \nwill be in the year 2002, what you find is not a zero. What you find on \npage 4--I direct my colleagues to this page. I think it might be a \nrevelation to those who are saying that this is a balanced budget \nagreement. If this is a balanced budget agreement, why does it say on \npage 4 that the deficit in fiscal year 2002 is $108.7 billion? Why does \nit say that? Why does it say there is a deficit if the budget is \nbalanced? Of course, the answer is the budget is not balanced.\n  It is remarkable to me that our colleagues report to the American \npeople that this is a balanced budget agreement and the press reports \nit when the document that we are considering here, the budget \nresolution, shows clearly the budget is not balanced in 2002. There is \nalmost a $109 billion deficit.\n  The other thing that troubles me is, if you look at the budget line, \nas I indicated, the deficit was $290 billion, and the unified deficit \nin 1992 has come down to $67 billion this year, but for the next three \nyears the deficit is going to be higher than it is this year.\n  Here we are in the midst of great economic times and under this \nbudget agreement the deficit is going up. How do we justify that? It \nmakes no sense. In good economic times, we ought to be steadily \nreducing the deficit. We shouldn't let the deficit go up. But that is \nwhat this budget agreement does.\n  And then, of course, on a unified basis they say it is balanced. \nUnified means they are counting all of the trust funds. Of course, that \nis the problem. We should not count the Social Security trust funds. No \ncompany would be able to do that. No company would be able to take the \nretirement funds of its employees and throw them into the pot and call \nit a balanced budget. But that is what we are doing here.\n  I say to the President and those who might be listening, that is a \nmistake. We ought not to be counting these trust fund surpluses. This \nis really not a balanced budget. No company could claim it. If they \ndid, they would be in violation of Federal law, and they would be \nheaded for a Federal institution, but it would not be the United States \nCongress. They would be headed to Federal jail. And yet we blithely \ncall this a balanced budget.\n  Of most concern to me is that budget negotiators failed to correct \nthe upward bias that currently exists in the Consumer Price Index. As \nthe occupant of the Chair knows, we use the Consumer Price Index to \nadjust for the change in the cost of living in our revenue system and \nin all of our spending programs. That is an appropriate thing to do. It \nis appropriate to adjust for the cost of living, but the overwhelming \nscientific evidence is that we are overadjusting.\n  In fact, the Senate Finance Committee appointed a bipartisan \ncommission that was headed by Michael Boskin, who was the head of the \neconomic advisers in the Bush administration. The Boskin Commission \ncame back to us and said the overstatement is about 1 percent a year. \nOne percent does not sound like much but over time it makes a big \ndifference. A 1 percent overstatement in the Consumer Price Index means \n$1 trillion in debt of the United States over the next 12 years. That \nis a mistake we should not allow to continue.\n  I also am concerned that some of the economic assumptions in this \nplan are also highly suspect. CBO's last minute revenue adjustment of \n$45 billion a year may be credible for the first few years, but its \ncredibility from the years 1999 to 2007 is unclear.\n  In addition, the balanced budget fiscal dividend assumes lower \ninterest rates will result from balancing the budget with a credible \ndeficit reduction plan. The problem is that is not what most people are \nconsidering in this country. There is very little debate about whether \ninterest rates are going to be reduced. The question is whether \ninterest rates are going to be increased.\n  Mr. President, ultimately each of us must decide if this plan is \nworthy of support.\n  In deciding how to vote on this package, a key question for me was \nwhether or not passage of this package was better policy than doing \nnothing at all. I believe it is a fairly close call.\n  Despite all of its shortcomings, the 1997 budget deal does contain \nsome good policies, including about $200 billion of net deficit \nreduction. From 1998 on, the deficit declines steadily as a percentage \nof gross domestic product. Unfortunately, it ought to be declining from \nthis year on, not starting only in 1998.\n  In addition, debt subject to limit--and this is the final chart I \nwill show--debt subject to limit as a percentage of GDP also declines \nfrom about 68 percent in 1998 to 66 percent by the year 2002. Federal \ndebt subject to limit declines from 1997 to 2002. Finally, the \nincredible growth of the debt has been stopped. It was stopped largely \nbecause of the 1993 budget agreement, but this budget package will \ncontinue to hold down the growth of the debt, and that is critically \nimportant to our economic future.\n  Finally, the plan protects discretionary investments for programs \nlike education and transportation, provides health insurance for 5 \nmillion insured children and helps people move from welfare to work. \nThe plan also preserves the solvency of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund \nthrough the year 2007. And the plan includes targeted tax relief for \nworking Americans. The education tax cuts in the package will help \nprovide educational opportunity, and reform of the estate tax which has \nbeen unchanged for 10 years will help farm families and small business \nowners keep their businesses and their farming operations.\n  Finally, let me say, even though I favor a far more ambitious deficit \nreduction package, I view this agreement as a step in the right \ndirection. I will support this budget agreement and work to improve it \nthroughout the budget process this year.\n  Mr. President, I thank the indulgence of the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/21/senate-section/article/S4921-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4922-S4923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
