Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Senate Resolution 87, submitted by \nmyself, along with my colleague Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and \nothers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 87) commemorating the 15th \n     anniversary of the construction and dedication of the Vietnam \n     Veterans Memorial.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncommemorating the 15th anniversary of the construction and dedication \nof the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, also known as ``The Wall.'' I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by my distinguished colleague from \nNebraska, my senior Senator, Bob Kerrey, who, incidentally, is the only \nMember of this body who was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his \nservice in Vietnam. I\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\nalso am joined by the other Vietnam combat veterans who serve in this \nbody. In all, 75 Senators have joined in cosponsoring this resolution.\n  The creation of this memorial marked the beginning of a healing \nprocess for the Nation and for veterans divided by the war. I was proud \nto have spoken at the 1982 groundbreaking for the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial, as did two of my colleagues, Senator Robb, who then was \nGovernor of Virginia, and Senator John Warner.\n  I keep in my Senate office, Mr. President, a shovel I used during the \ngroundbreaking ceremony 15 years ago to remind me of that day. While \nthe debate over our involvement in Vietnam and the conduct of the war \nwill continue for years to come, the wall has united Americans in \nhonoring those who served. It honors warriors, not the war. The Vietnam \nwall stands as a stirring reminder that memorials are built not to \nhonor or glorify war. There is no glory in a war, only suffering. \nMemorials are built to honor the commitment and the sacrifice that men \nand women give to their country because they are willing to risk their \nlives in defense of freedom.\n  As we commemorate the 15th anniversary of the groundbreaking for the \nVietnam Veterans Memorial, it is important that we remember those brave \nmen and brave women who fought and died for liberties we take for \ngranted, and it is important we remember their families who also \nsacrificed for this Nation.\n  Recently I was joined in a ceremony to mark the wall's 15th \nanniversary by my friends and colleagues, Senators Bob Kerrey of \nNebraska, John McCain of Arizona, Max Cleland of Georgia, John Kerry of \nMassachusetts, and Chuck Robb of Virginia. We come from different \nStates and different parties, but despite our differences, we six U.S. \nSenators have a common background. We are all Vietnam combat veterans. \nWe attended the ceremony on behalf of every man and woman who served in \nVietnam, every man and woman who gave their life in Vietnam, every \nVietnam veteran who is still missing in that far away land, and every \nfamily in this country who sacrificed to keep this Nation strong.\n  We marked the anniversary of this groundbreaking in order to remind \nus all that the liberties we cherish do not come without great \nsacrifice. One needs only to run a hand over the rough names inscribed \nin the smooth glossy surface of the wall to realize that freedom is not \nfree. As we laid a wreath in honor of the 58,202 men and women whose \nlives are memorialized by the names, each of us realized we could \neasily have been present only in the memories of those who survived. \nWe, too, could have been listed on the wall.\n\n  We also remembered and honored the more than 2,000 Americans still \nmissing in action from this war. Mr. President, this morning I noted \nthat our new Ambassador to Vietnam, Ambassador Pete Petersen, a \nNebraska native, held as a POW in Vietnam for more than 6 years, \nreceived the remains of two of our MIA's yesterday in Vietnam.\n  Each year, more than 3 million people visit the Vietnam Memorial, \nmaking it the most visited monument in Washington. Many visitors are so \nmoved they leave flowers, letters, pictures, and other mementoes to \ntheir fallen comrades, parents, relatives, friends, children, and loved \nones.\n  Next weekend, Memorial Day weekend, the traveling Vietnam memorial \nwill come to Omaha, NE. It is a half-scale replica of the wall that \nstands here in Washington. It has visited cities and States across \nAmerica so Americans who may never visit the Nation's Capital can \nexperience the healing power of the Vietnam wall.\n  The resolution before the Senate today is an important statement by \nthe Senate to mark the 15th year of the wall and all that wall has \nmeant to so many. I am proud to be a sponsor and am grateful for my \ncolleagues' support.\n  Mr. President, I yield time to my distinguished colleague, friend, \nand fellow Vietnam veteran, Senator Bob Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I yield such time as desired to the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I will take a minute to commend my two \ncolleagues from Nebraska for introducing this particular resolution \ntoday. I was pleased to join with them a few weeks ago over at the \nVietnam Memorial.\n  It was my privilege 15 years ago to participate in both the \ngroundbreaking and the dedication. I have had many visits to that \nmemorial since. I think it is very clear that it has served a purpose \neven beyond the expectations of those who created it and those who were \ninitially involved in the dedication ceremonies. It has a healing \neffect for all of those who visit, regardless of what their personal \nfeelings may have been about the conflict itself. They recognize that \nwe come together to honor those warriors who gave the last full measure \nto their country, and the notes that are left behind are the kind of \ncommunication that I would defy anyone to read without feeling some of \nthe emotion that is involved in it.\n  I commend both Senator Hagel and Senator Kerrey for this particular \nresolution this morning, and I commend it to all of our colleagues as \nan appropriate remembrance of those friends and those who wore our \nuniform in terms of service to our country in the conflict in Vietnam.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, along with my colleague, my good friend, \nSenator Chuck Hagel from my home State of Nebraska, we are offering the \nVietnam Veterans Memorial resolution to remember this memorial, but \nalso to remind Americans that the possibility for healing exists in \nthis memorial. There are constant reminders that open the wounds of \nthis war once again.\n  As Senator Hagel mentioned, in today's paper we read that our first \nAmbassador to Vietnam since we left in 1975, Pete Petersen, is coming \nback to the United States of America and bringing with him the remains \nof men who were killed in that war, once again, opening up, for a \nvariety of reasons, a wound that makes it difficult for people to go on \nwith their lives.\n  Mr. President, this wall does a remarkable thing. It does enable an \nindividual to begin to heal from this particular war, or for other \nwars, as well. On this Memorial Day we ask the Senate and we ask the \nAmerican people to take a moment to reflect and remember those who \nserved in Vietnam during this Nation's longest conflict.\n  I served in Vietnam with five of my Senator colleagues, Senator Chuck \nRobb, who was here a few moments ago, Senator John Kerry, Senator John \nMcCain, Senator Max Cleland, and Senator Chuck Hagel, and although we \nmay argue legislation from different sides of the aisle, we share a \nbond beyond politics and beyond party, as do veterans of all conflicts, \nand are firm in the belief that we are all Americans first and \nforemost.\n  As we gather with friends and with family in observance of Memorial \nDay, I urge all Americans to take time to reflect upon the day's true \nmeaning. Whether we attend a public observance, mark a grave, or simply \nbow our heads in quiet reflection, we should remember to honor those \nwho, by serving, put their faith and trust in the ideals for which our \nNation stands.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Nebraska and I offer this resolution \nand feel it especially fitting because this August the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial will be 15 years old, almost as old as the conflict was long. \nOn May 24, 1997, more than 22 years after the last known United States \ncasualty, the Vietnam Moving Memorial will pay a visit to Omaha, NE. \nFor thousands of Vietnam veterans and their families, this memorial \nserves as a place of reconciliation and remembrance. It invites people \nto come and remember the bravery and valor of their fallen friends, \nfamily, and colleagues, while serving as well, Mr. President, as a \npermanent tribute to those who gave their lives.\n  Through this resolution, and in observation of this 15th anniversary, \nI hope the Senate will encourage all Americans to remember to honor the \nmemory of the brave men and women who fought and died in service to our \nNation during the Vietnam war, and indeed all conflicts.\n  Mr. President, at the dedication of the Bunker Hill Memorial on June \n17,\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\n1825, Daniel Webster closed his speech with these words:\n\n       Let our object be our country, our whole country and \n     nothing but our country. And by the blessing of God may that \n     country itself become a vast and splendid monument, not of \n     oppression and terror, but of wisdom, peace, and of liberty, \n     upon which the world may gaze with admiration, forever.\n\n  We honor those who have come before us not just with the memory of \ntheir efforts, but by building upon the freedom and prosperity we enjoy \nbecause of their sacrifice. The men and women we pay tribute to during \nthis and every Memorial Day deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, as I have said, one doesn't have to look very far for \nreminders of the divisive nature of this war, and one doesn't have to \nlook very far for inspiration that enables us to overcome the worst of \nthese memories.\n  Indeed, I had the pleasure of sitting with the Presiding Officer and \nlistening to his presentation to a roomful of young heroes who had been \nrecognized for their service, and recognized in particular for their \nservice at the community level--young men and women who saw something \nin their community they didn't like, saw something in their community \nthat they thought was wrong, and decided on their own to correct that \nwrong.\n  I heard the Senator from Arkansas say that he heard a long time ago a \nyoung girl talking about what it meant to be famous; what it meant to \nacquire fame. She wanted in her lifetime to be a famous person. Then \nshe came to Washington, DC, and while at the Tomb of the Unknown \nSoldier realized that fame by no means is the only object of our lives, \nnor should be the only object of our lives; that one can be a hero \nwithout recognition; that one can serve God and other human beings as a \nconsequence of just believing that something needs to be done without \nregard to whether or not it would be recognized in headlines, or radio \ncommentary, or television broadcasts.\n  It is the most eloquent demonstration of why we as human beings are \nspecial; that we have inside of us a soul, a spirit that recognizes \nthat at some point the greatest thing we can do is to say that somebody \nis more important than we are, that something is out there more \nimportant than just taking care of ourselves.\n  I believe strongly, Mr. President, that we are not free until in \nlove, and recognize that until in love we are willing to give \nourselves. And I hope that this remembrance of the Vietnam Memorial \nwill not just inspire people to say that we have got to get over the \nVietnam war itself but I hope it will allow Americans as individual men \nand women to see that now in this moment heroes are needed more than \never before.\n  This Nation was terribly divided in the Vietnam war, with families \nturning against families, sons against fathers, and neighbors against \nneighbors.\n  On this floor on August 7, 1964, the Senate, by a vote of 88 to 2, \nand the House unanimously, enacted what was called the Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution that resulted in a substantial buildup of forces, of \nincreased drafting, of increased calls going out to young men saying, \n``It is time for you to serve the cause of freedom.'' That cause \ndeteriorated and divided this Nation in a terrible fashion, and caused \nAmericans to say not only do we question the cause of freedom but cause \nus as well to say that we no longer believe our Government; we no \nlonger trust that this is a Government of, by, and for the people. ``We \nfeel as if we have been lied to. And the trust is broken, it has been \nsnapped, it is permanent, and we are not going to put it back \ntogether.''\n  This wall, this remembrance, enables us to see that trust can be put \nback together, if we are willing to forgive; if we are willing to say \nthat we forgive those with whom we disagreed; that we recognize our \ncommon bond. And on this Memorial Day not only do we pay tribute to \nthose who have sacrificed for us, but we rededicate ourselves to the \ntask of sacrificing for others.\n  Mr. President, it is a pleasure and an honor for me to share \ncosponsorship with my friend and colleague from Nebraska, Senator \nHagel, and all the other Members of the Senate who have joined in this \nresolution. I appreciate their support.\n  I call upon Americans not just to see this as another resolution but \nto see this as a Memorial Day, as an opportunity for us to rededicate \nourselves to the cause of freedom.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nNebraska for those inspirational words, and I think words that are \nfocused exactly on the heart of who we are as a people, who we have \nalways been, and hopefully who we will always be.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am grateful to be an original cosponsor \nwith my distinguished colleagues and fellow Vietnam veterans in the \nSenate. It is appropriate that we commemorate the 15th anniversary of \nthe dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC.\n  My fellow Vietnam veterans who are cosponsoring this resolution and I \nwear glasses and have more gray hair than we did when we served in \nVietnam, we come from different walks of life, served in different \nbranches of the military, and were of different ranks. However, we \nshare the experiences of combat that only those who went to Vietnam \nwill ever understand.\n  We also share--and this is harder to explain--the survivors' \nhumility. That's a provocative statement, I know, and the nonveteran \nmay easily mistake its meaning. I am not talking about shame. I know of \nno shame in surviving combat. But every combat veteran remembers those \ncomrades whose sacrifice was eternal. Their loss taught us everything \nabout tragedy and everything about duty.\n  I am grateful, as we all are, to have come home alive. I prayed daily \nfor deliverance from war. No one of my acquaintance ever chose death \nover homecoming. But I witnessed some men choose death over dishonor. \nThe memory of them, of what they bore for country and honor, helped me \nto see the virtue in my own humility.\n  It is a surpassing irony that war, for all its unspeakable horrors, \nprovides the combatant with every conceivable human experience. \nExperiences that usually take a lifetime to know are all felt--and felt \nintensely--in one brief moment of life. Anyone who loses a loved one \nknows what great loss feels like. Anyone who gives life to a child \nknows what great joy feels like. The veteran knows what great joy and \ngreat loss feel like when they occur in the same moment, in the same \nexperience.\n  For my part, I would simply affirm that the sacrifices borne by \nveterans deserve to be memorialized in something more lasting than \nmarble or in the fleeting effect of a politician's speech. The \nveterans' valor and the devotion to duty have earned our country's \nabiding concern for their well-being. I am committed to honoring that \ndebt.\n  I hope this small symbol of remembrance today will encourage all \nAmericans to remember the sacrifices of our veterans.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial resolution, sponsored by my colleagues, Senator Hagel \nand Senator Kerrey of Nebraska. I would like to commend and \ncongratulate them for bringing this issue before the Senate today, so \nthat this body may take a moment to remember those who sacrificed their \nlives in Vietnam for our country.\n  Mr. President, it is not enough for us to use mere words to express \nour deep gratitude to the men and women who fought in Vietnam, \nselflessly giving their lives to protect the interests of the United \nStates. It is not enough for us to provide for the education and well-\nbeing of the sons and daughters who have lost a parent in a country \nthey may never see, for a people they may never know, and in a war they \nmay never understand.\n  Nothing can ever be enough, because nothing can ever bring them back.\n  But here in the Nation's Capital, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial--a \n250-foot wall of polished black granite--will help us to never forget \nthe sacrifice of over 58,000 Americans; 58,209 Americans to be exact.\n  Seventeen more names have recently been added to the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial. Within the past 6 months, the Central Identification \nLaboratory in Hawaii has positively identified the remains of ten more \nAmerican servicemen found in Vietnam by Department\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\nof Defense on-site search teams. And seven other American servicemen \nwho have since died from the complications of injuries suffered during \nthe Vietnam war. It is my hope, Mr. President--no, it is my prayer--\nthat this will be the last time such additions are made to this \nmemorial.\n  How do you thank each of these brave Americans? How do you let them \nknow that as a nation, we are indebted to them for their bravery, their \nvalor, and their courage in fighting a war that was never officially \nrecognized by the country which asked them to put their lives on the \nline? How do you tell them that they are truly American heroes?\n  You do this by keeping their memories alive and by never forgetting \nthem.\n  The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall helps to keep those memorials \nalive, and it helps the human emotional process which includes \nmourning, healing, and remembrance. This visual reminder keeps their \nmemory alive in our hearts where they will never be forgotten. And I \nwould like to add that I know this from first-hand experience.\n  Mr. President, last year I took part in a trade mission to Vietnam \nwith several of my colleagues here in the Senate. Before leaving, one \nof the most important things I did to prepare myself for travel to \nVietnam, was to walk alone along the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, to \nclear my mind of all thoughts, except for those involving the \noverwhelming number of American names etched upon the wall. In that \nmoment, I knew that one of the most important reasons for my visit to \nVietnam was to be a voice for those brave men and women whom I will \nnever be able to thank.\n  On November 11, 1996, Veteran's Day, I was in Hanoi urging top \nVietnamese officials to keep the resolution of the POW/MIA issue a top \npriority, and to cooperate in every way with the United States. As I \nmet with Vietnam Party General Secretary Do Muoi, I told him about my \nwalk along the wall, and presented him with a copy of ``The Wall,'' a \npictorial of veterans and their families who come to pay tribute at the \nVietnam Veteran's Memorial. Inside the cover of that book, I inscribed: \n``We have shared a tragic past together. Now let us work to share a \nbright future together.'' Our discussion then centered on building our \nrelationships as nations on the basis of mutual compassion. General \nSecretary Do Muoi was very animated in his response and said, ``We \ndeserve compassion, it is consistent with our history so full of blood \nand tears. Compassion is the key to our relationship.''\n  Mr. President, compassion is truly the key to honoring those who paid \nthe ultimate sacrifice for our country. I would hope that we, as a \nnation, never lose that compassion for our veterans, and never, ever \nallow their memories to be taken from our hearts.\n  The wall is indeed a beautiful and somber monument which will ever \nremind us of those painful sacrifices made by these brave men and \nwomen.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I have two final comments to make regarding \nthis resolution commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial.\n  First, the recognition of the vision, the heart, the soul, and the \nleadership behind it, a remarkable man, Jan Scruggs. It was Jan Scruggs \nwho many, many years ago came home one night after a movie, sat down \nwith his wife, and said, ``We are going to do something to recognize \nthose who served in the Vietnam.'' It was a great dream, an impossible \ndream.\n  One of the collaborators with Jan Scruggs was one of our colleagues, \nSenator John Warner. Without Senator John Warner's leadership, and \nwithout his force, and without Jan Scruggs' vision and leadership and \nlove, this Wall would never have been built. It is very appropriate to \nrecognize Jan Scruggs and Senator John Warner because those two great \nAmericans led this effort and have given us a magnificent monument and \nmemorial.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution, Senate \nResolution 87, be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that I took the \nfloor yesterday to talk about. It is an amendment that I worked out, \nalong with Senator Frist and Representative Canady in the House, and \nwith the American Medical Association to tighten up some of the \nlanguage to address some of the concerns that the physician community \nhad about the definition of what is partial-birth abortion.\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\n  I believe it is a good amendment, whether it would have gotten the \nAMA endorsement or not. I think it is a good amendment because I think \nit is language that is much tighter, and puts in the requisite mens \nrea, or thought processes that the physician must have been going \nthrough at the time of doing the procedure. I think that is important \nfor a criminal statute.\n  I think it would be a sad state if, in fact, we passed this \nlegislation and overrode the President's veto, or if the President \nwould see otherwise and decide to sign the bill, that, in fact, this \nbill would be thrown out for vagueness of criminality, the criminal \nstatute itself would be considered too vague, and it would be OK on the \nabortion ground but not OK on the criminal statute ground. But I think \nwhat we have done is tighten up the language and have taken care of the \nconcerns mentioned here, both on the House and Senate floors, about the \nvagueness of the statute.\n  I don't think anyone will now look at this as a vague statute. It is \na very precise statute. It is a complete criminal statute now.\n  I am very happy that we were able to work it out, and in working with \nthe AMA I believe we have improved the bill and improved its chances \nwhen we reach the stage of the courts which I am very hopeful that we \nwill do because that means that we will have passed the bill and it \nwould have been signed into law, and the President's veto would have \nbeen overridden.\n  Of the other two provisions in the bill, one clarifies the life of \nthe mother exception and takes out some surplus language which we \nagreed to which didn't add anything, and we agreed that it was, in \nfact, surplus language.\n  The third element of the amendment deals with the issue of a medical \nreview panel; if a medical review panel was asked by the AMA for the \nreason of an intermediary step between the indictment of the physician \nunder the statute and a trial. This would be an opportunity for State \nmedical boards to put together a panel of physicians to look at what \nhappened in the case, to do a peer review determination of the \nprocedures that was done by the physician being charged, and to come up \nwith findings. Those findings would then be admissible in court.\n  I think that is an appropriate step. It gives the professionals in \nthe field who license, in fact, the physician, an opportunity to make a \nreview of what happened in the context of that as well as add medical \nexpertise to be considered at trial. I think that is only helpful. The \nfact of the matter is that we are all aware that, if someone is charged \nunder this statute, they are going to have their medical experts \ntestify as to one set of circumstances and the prosecution will have \ntheir medical experts.\n  So, with having some neutral party, if you will, come up with a more \nobjective standard of review I think helps and provides a professional \nreview of what took place in a case.\n  So I think we are making a step forward.\n  I am not aware of any objections to this amendment. Whether you are \nfor, or against this amendment, it is a technical amendment in most \nrespects. It is one that hopefully will be supported by everyone.\n  I yield the floor at this point to determine whether anyone wants to \nspeak against the amendment.\n  I understand now there is no one to speak against the amendment. So I \nask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the unanimous-consent agreement, \nthe pending amendment is considered agreed to. The motion to reconsider \nis laid on the table.\n  The amendment (No. 290) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I now understand that we are commencing \nthe final 3 hours of debate, that the time is going to be equally \ndivided between the Members who are for the bill and Members who are \nagainst. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Let me first start out by indicating how important I believe the \nendorsement of the AMA is here as we approach final passage of this \nlegislation. We have heard over and over and over again that the \nprincipal reason this procedure needs to be made legal is to protect \nthe health of the mother. We have in the case of the AMA an \norganization that is on record as being for abortion rights. This is \nnot the Christian Coalition. This is not the Catholic Conference of \nBishops. This is an organization of physicians that is on record as \nbeing for a woman's right to choose, if you will, that has come out and \nsaid this procedure is not good medicine, this procedure is not \nnecessary to protect the life or health of a mother. So for all of the \narguments that we have heard that there is a split of opinion out there \nas to whether this is an appropriate procedure, I have put forward \nletter after letter after letter from obstetricians, from \nperinatologists, experts in maternal fetal medicine who have said that \nthis procedure is never medically indicated, that in fact this \nprocedure is more dangerous to the mother. I will discuss those things \ntoday.\n  Now I believe the charade is over. We have the preeminent medical \nauthority, organization in the country saying that this procedure \nshould be outlawed; there is no medical reason to keep this procedure \nlegal.\n  That is a very powerful statement which debunks all of the arguments \npeople might want to hide behind in saying that, yes, they agree this \nprocedure is brutal; yes, they agree this is barbaric and should never \nbe used, but we want to leave open the possibility that in the case of, \nand then they go on with the health concerns.\n  What we know for a fact is that 90 percent of partial-birth abortions \nare not done for any health-related reasons. Let me clarify that. Ron \nFitzsimmons, who heads up an abortion provider organization of some 200 \nabortion clinics, said that 90 percent of partial-birth abortions occur \nin the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy on healthy mothers with \nhealthy babies. They are for birth control purposes. This is fifth- and \nsixth-month abortions for birth control purposes where you take a baby \nout, deliver it all but the head and then take a pair of scissors and \nstab the baby in the base of the skull, suction its brains out and kill \nit for birth control purposes, not for health reasons.\n  Those are what we know as the facts, that information provided to us \nby people who oppose the bill. These are not facts people who oppose \nabortion are putting forward. These are people who are adamantly pro-\nchoice who run the clinics where some of these abortions take place, \nproviding us with the information contrary to what you have heard, \nstatements in the Chamber that these are done for the health of the \nmother, that 90 percent of them are done for birth control purposes, \nlate in pregnancy. The other percentage is done later in pregnancy, and \nthey argue, most of the reasons you hear, because of a fetal \nabnormality. All of the cases that you hear described with the pictures \nof the family are the baby was going to die anyway or the baby had a \nsevere defect and that we should allow abortions in those situations, \nthis kind of brutal abortion in those situations because the baby is \nnot perfect or may not live long.\n  That takes us off into another area that I think has very, very \nsevere consequences for this country, when we start to say that we \nshould be able to kill children because they are not perfect or that \nabortions should be legal up until the time of delivery; that we should \nbe able to do this brutal procedure because the little baby may not \nlive long or may have medical complications.\n  I found it absolutely ironic that the day the partial-birth abortion \nban came to the floor of the Senate, minutes before we passed the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act. What is that? That is an \nact to guarantee civil rights, the right for disabled children to be \neducated so they can maximize their human potential. The very\n\n[[Page S4696]]\n\nsame day 30-some Senators who voted for that legislation and advocated \ngiving rights to the disabled, those same 30-some Senators who are \nagainst the partial-birth abortion ban said we are willing to give you \nrights if you survive the womb, but we are not going to give you any \nrights as a disabled child up until the time you are born. You are \neligible to be killed just because of your disability. You are \ndifferent than any other child. If you are a child that is normal, then \nthey do not believe you have a right to be killed. In fact, that is \nwhat these amendments are that we heard about. Well, if the baby is \nhealthy and the mother is healthy, we need a health exception. If the \nbaby is fine and the mom is fine, then we do not believe the baby \nshould be killed. If the baby is abnormal, we can kill it.\n\n  These are the same people who believe in special civil rights for the \ndisabled. I do not know how you legitimately can stand and argue those \ntwo points. I do not know how you draw the line there with any sense of \nconsistency of care for the disabled. I support IDEA. I support civil \nrights for the disabled because I know that there are challenges out \nthere, but there is no greater challenge to the disabled in this \ncountry today than the challenge of getting born in the first place. \nAnd I will discuss, as I have before, Donna Joy Watts and her family \nand how they had to overcome incredible odds and adversity beyond what \nyou would imagine in this country just to have this little girl born \nand be treated because she was seen as disabled, not viable, not \nimportant to our society.\n  I want to talk in specific about the health issue because I think it \nis important, it is the remaining barrier that many Members hide behind \nin not supporting the partial-birth abortion bill because it does not \nhave a ``health exception.'' Let me explain, No. 1, we have the \nAmerican Medical Association on record now supporting this bill, saying \nthere need not be a health exception to this bill, this bill takes care \nof all the problems that we as physicians see and that there is no \nhealth reason to do this procedure.\n  Let me share with you a statement from Dr. Camilla C. Hersh, who is a \nmember of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. She says, \nand I quote from her statement:\n\n       I think it is obvious that for the baby this is a horrible \n     way to die, brutally and painfully killed by having one's \n     head stabbed open and one's brains suctioned out.\n       But for the woman, this is a mortally dangerous and life \n     threatening act.\n       Partial-birth abortion is a partially blind procedure, done \n     by feel, thereby risking direct scissor injury to the \n     mother's uterus and laceration of the cervix or lower uterine \n     segment. Either the scissors or the bony shards or spickules \n     of the baby's perforated and disrupted skull bones can \n     roughly rip into the large blood vessels which supply the \n     lower part of the lush pregnant uterus, resulting in \n     immediate and massive bleeding and the threat of shock, \n     immediate hysterectomy, blood transfusion and even death to \n     the mother.\n       Portions of the baby's sharp bony skull pieces can remain \n     embedded in the mother's cervix, setting up a complicated \n     infection as the bony fragments decompose.\n       Think of the emotional agony for the woman, both \n     immediately and for years afterward, who endures this process \n     over a period of several days.\n       None of this nauseating risk is ever necessary for any \n     reason. Obstetrician-gynecologists like myself across the \n     U.S. regularly treat women whose unborn children suffer the \n     same conditions as those cited by the proponents of the \n     procedure.\n       Never--\n\n  I underline the word--\n\n     is the partial-birth abortion procedure necessary:\n       Not for polyhydramnios (an excess of amniotic fluid \n     collecting around the baby), . . .\n       Not for anencephaly (an abnormality characterized by the \n     absence of the top portion of the baby's brain and skull),\n       Not for hydrocephaly (excessive cerebrospinal fluid in the \n     head).\n\n  In the case of Donna Joy Watts, I would parenthetically say she had \nhydrocephaly. Her parents were counseled to have an abortion. They \nchose not to. They had the baby delivered and she is now 5\\1/2\\ years \nold.\n\n       Sometimes, as in the case of hydrocephaly, it is first \n     necessary to drain some of the fluid from the baby's head \n     with a special long needle, to allow safe vaginal delivery. \n     In some cases, when vaginal delivery is not possible, a \n     doctor performs a Cesarean section. But in no case is it \n     necessary or medically advisable to partially deliver an \n     infant through the vagina and then to cruelly kill the \n     infant.\n       The legislation proposed clearly distinguishes the \n     procedure being banned from recognized standard obstetric \n     techniques. I must point out, even for those who support \n     abortion for elective or medical reasons at any point in \n     pregnancy, current recognized abortion techniques would be \n     unaffected by the proposed ban.\n       Any proponent of such a dangerous procedure is at the least \n     seriously misinformed about medical reality or at worst so \n     consumed by narrow minded ``abortion-at-any-cost'' \n     activism to be criminally negligent.\n\n       This procedure is blatant and cruel infanticide and must be \n     against the law.\n\n  Again, this is a statement by Camilla C. Hersh, an obstetrician-\ngynecologist practicing here in northern Virginia.\n  And other statements by other medical doctors in cases that were \nmentioned here on this floor as reasons that partial-birth abortion \nmust continue to be legal. And I have this as a note. Senator Feinstein \nbrought up the case of preeclampsia, and I have a letter here from Dr. \nSteve Calvin, MD, who is a specialist in maternal fetal medicine.\n  What does that mean? A specialist in high-risk pregnancies. These are \npeople who deal with the very difficult cases that come up in pregnancy \nwhere the mother's life and health and the baby's life and health are \nin jeopardy during pregnancy.\n  Dr. Calvin responds to Senator Feinstein's claim that preeclampsia is \na reason to do a partial-birth abortion.\n\n       Preeclampsia (with any number of its complications, \n     including renal failure), cardiomyopathy, breast cancer, and \n     lymphoma are all potential maternal medical disorders that \n     may complicate pregnancy. In some situations the pregnancy \n     must be ended to save the life of the mother.\n       The proposed ban on this destructive procedure already \n     includes an exemption for the so far theoretical instance \n     when it may be necessary to save a pregnant woman's life. The \n     opponents of the ban realize that they cannot prevail on the \n     merits of their arguments and are therefore resorting to \n     blowing a virtual blizzard of medical terms during the \n     debate. They hope to overwhelm the media and the public so \n     that the fundamental points are missed. I will not try to \n     answer them point by point on each medical condition. The \n     importance of protecting nearly born fetal life is \n     crucial.\n\n  Especially in light of Lori Watts' and Donna Joy Watts' story.\n  The fact of the matter is that it is never medically necessary, under \nany of these conditions, according to Dr. Calvin and dozens of others \nwho are specialists in maternal fetal medicine. As Dr. Calvin said in \nanother letter, none of these procedures are done by groups that \nspecialize in high-risk pregnancies. They are not done in universities. \nThey are not done in hospitals that specialize in these kinds of \nproblems. They are done in abortion clinics. They are not done by \nexperts in maternal fetal medicine, perinatologists; they are done by \nabortionists at abortion clinics who are not experts in high-risk \npregnancies.\n  In fact, this procedure was developed not by an obstetrician/\ngynecologist, not by someone who is an expert in maternal fetal \nmedicine who is concerned about the life and health of the mother; this \nwas developed by a family practitioner who does abortions at an \nabortion clinic for the convenience of the abortionist.\n  So all of these claims about health are just simply a smokescreen. \nThere is no health reason to do this procedure. In fact, as Dr. Hersh \nsays, and hundreds of other physicians have said, obstetricians and \ngynecologists, including--he is not an obstetrician; that is, C. \nEverett Koop, the former Surgeon General of the United States, is not \nan obstetrician. But what is he? A pediatric surgeon who has done \nsurgery on all these little babies who have had these disabilities and \nsaw high-risk pregnancies firsthand, dealt with the consequences of \nthese pregnancies, so he knows the issue well. He said, as well as \nhundreds of other doctors, that it is never medically necessary. I \nwould like to read the entire quote signed by, I believe, at least a \ndozen experts in maternal fetal medicine, a group of almost 500 \nphysicians, including Dr. Koop, and obstetricians who oppose partial-\nbirth abortion:\n\n       While it may become necessary, in the second or third \n     trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the \n     mother's life or health, abortion is never required--i.e., it \n     is never medically necessary, in order to preserve a women's \n     life, health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an \n     unborn child in the second and third trimester, and certainly \n     not by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her \n     to death. What is required in the circumstances specified \n     by--\n\n\n[[Page S4697]]\n\n\n  Senator Daschle, Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein and others--\n\n     is separation of the child from the mother, not the death of \n     the child.\n\n  Let me just put it simply, for purposes of this particular debate, \nwhile a mother may present herself in a condition that may require \nseparation of the child from the mother, it is not necessary to kill \nthe child in that process, to use partial-birth abortion. I don't know \nwhy any doctor who is practicing good, solid medicine would \ndeliberately reach in and pull the baby out in the breech position to \ndeliver the child while the mother's life is in danger, while you go \nthrough a 3-day process of dilating the cervix over 2 days, risking \ninfection because the cervix is now dilated and the womb is exposed to \ninfection, risking infection, No. 1; No. 2, risking an incompetent \ncervix, which means the inability to carry future children.\n  Unfortunately, one of the reasons cited by President Clinton as \nneeding this procedure to save her health and future fertility was a \nwoman who has had five miscarriages since that procedure was done to \nher. To make the argument this is necessary for that is just not true. \nBut a woman presents herself with a health problem, and for 2 days, to \nsay, ``Here are some pills, we're going to dilate your cervix, go home, \npresent yourself back after 2 days,'' where you risk increased \ninfection and increased complications, ``come back to the abortion \nclinic''--not a hospital, because these are not done at hospitals--\n``come back to the abortion clinic to have this procedure done.'' And \nthen what happens? The baby is pulled out feet first, delivered all but \nthe head.\n  Why would you, even if you decided to go through that procedure for \nthe health of the mother, why would you, as Dr. Hersh suggests, why \nwould you take a blunt instrument in a blind procedure and stab the \nbaby blindly in the base of the skull, causing all of the damage that \ncould occur, as Dr. Hersh has set forth? Why would you do that? Why \nwouldn't you just deliver the head and give the baby a chance to live? \nIt may not live. But at least give it the dignity of being born and \naccepted into our human community without this brutality, this \nunwarranted, unnecessary, unhealthful, dangerous, brutal stabbing and \nkilling of a baby who is this far away, 3 inches away, from its first \nbreath. Yes, its first breath. Even at 20 weeks, babies live. It is \nconsidered a live birth even at 20 weeks. Babies will not be able to \nsurvive long because they don't have sufficient lung development, but \nthat baby will be alive when it is born unless you kill it.\n\n  Why kill the baby when it is more dangerous to the mother to do that, \nwhen it presents more complications to do it? Why does that option have \nto be necessary that is more dangerous to her health? Why would we want \nto keep a procedure legal that threatens a woman's health, that is an \nabsolutely rogue procedure, not done by specialists, not done in \nhospitals, developed by a nonobstetrician? Why do we want to keep this \nlegal? What possible reason do we want to say that we need to endanger \na woman's health to allow this procedure to be legal? The only reason I \ncan think of is what Dr. Hersh said, and I will quote from her again \nbecause I think she said it very, very well:\n\n       Any proponent of such a dangerous procedure is at the least \n     seriously misinformed about medical reality or at worst--\n\n  And I daresay that we may be looking, certainly in the case of the \nabortion rights advocates, we are looking at our ``at worst'' here--\n\n     at worst, so consumed by narrow minded ``abortion-at-any-\n     cost'' activism, to be criminally negligent.\n\n  There is no health reason to do this. Anybody who stands up on the \nfloor in the face of now the AMA, hundreds of obstetricians and \ngynecologists, specialists in maternal fetal medicine, who stand up in \nthe face of overwhelming evidence that this procedure is necessary, \ngiven the characteristics of the procedure, a rogue procedure, not done \nin hospitals, not done by specialists, done by family practitioners or \npeople who have no speciality at all in delivering children, just doing \nabortions, you are defending not the health of the mother when you \nargue that, you are not defending the life of the mother, you are \ndefending, as Dr. Hersh says, abortion at any cost, any time, anywhere \nfor any reason; that the child, no matter how late, no matter how \nhealthy, is not to be considered.\n  That is not where America is. I know where the majority of the Senate \nis. We will find out today whether it is where 67 Senators are, because \nthat is the magic number, 67. We need 67 votes to override the \nPresident's veto.\n  I want to have additional items printed in the Record. I know this \nhas been printed in the Record before, but I want to put it in.\n  This is a letter from C. Everett Koop to Bill Frist, May 13, 1997--\nBill Frist, the only doctor in the U.S. Senate, who has spoken \neloquently, and will again today, on this issue.\n\n       Dear Bill: It is never necessary to destroy a viable fetus \n     in order to preserve the health of the mother. Although I \n     can't think of an example, if it were deemed beneficial for \n     the mother to be without the fetus, it would be delivered by \n     induction--\n\n  Vaginal delivery--\n\n     or C-section. Abortion is truly more traumatic than either \n     and exposes the mother to future problems with an incompetent \n     cervix, miscarriage and infertility.\n\n  Let me get away from the specifics of the partial-birth issue and \ngive you another reason why this is not healthy, and I want to share \nwith you some statistics from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. What is \nthat organization? This is an organization that signed letters last \nyear with NARAL and Planned Parenthood and a whole lot of other \ngroups--NOW, National Organization for Women--in opposition to partial-\nbirth abortion legislation for allowing this procedure to be legal. \nThey are an abortion advocacy group. I guess they are considered a \nthink tank or some short of data collection folks, but they are \nadvocates for abortion. Here is what they say, again, to the extent I \ncan--I am using the other side's information, taking what those who \noppose the bill say as fact, and even with their information, you can't \ndefend this procedure. This is what the Guttmacher Institute says:\n\n       The risk of death associated with abortion increases with \n     the length of pregnancy, from 1 death in every 600,000 \n     abortions at 8 or fewer weeks to 1 per 17,000 at 16-20 weeks, \n     and 1 per 6,000 at 21 weeks or more.\n\n  When, I might add, partial-birth abortions occur. They occur after 20 \nweeks, sometimes at 20 weeks.\n  So you are 10 times more likely, according to their numbers, to die \nas a result of an abortion than in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy.\n  You say, ``Well, OK, that's interesting, a 1-in-6,000 chance of a \nmother dying as the result of an abortion. But what are the chances of \nher dying as a result of delivering the baby by inducing or cesarean \nsection, which would be a `normal' delivery?'' We happen to have those \nnumbers:\n\n       It should be noted that at 21 weeks and after, abortion is \n     twice as risky for the woman as childbirth: The risk of \n     maternal death is 1 in 6,000--\n\n  As you saw before--\n\n     for abortion and 1 in 13,000 for childbirth.\n\n  So let me lay it out again. Set the arguments aside for partial-birth \nabortion as to why that is more dangerous, and it is. Abortion, period, \nis more dangerous to a mother. Abortion, period, is more dangerous to a \nmother than delivery by inducement or by cesarean section. Now why \nwould you get up here on the floor and say we need to keep the more \ndangerous option generally available, compound that with a procedure \nthat is even more dangerous than other abortion techniques, that we \nneed to keep that legal also? If you are truly concerned about the life \nand the health of the mother, you don't come to the Senate floor and \nargue for dangerous procedures to continue to be used that threaten \nhealth, future fertility, life and, at the same time, kill a baby that \nwould otherwise be born alive. There is no argument here.\n  You will hear and see pictures of people: ``Oh, well, they needed \nthis.'' As Dr. Hersh said and said eloquently, these people were \nmisinformed. Look, not every doctor is a great doctor. Not every doctor \nknows everything, but you don't see those doctors on the record here. \nWhere are the doctors who did all the procedures in all these cases, \nwhere have they testified that that was the only thing they could have \ndone. They couldn't stand the light of day here. They couldn't stand \nthe cross-examination here. They would never, never come up here and \ntry to defend that position.\n\n[[Page S4698]]\n\n  It is a sad fact that in thousands of instances every year, women are \ncounseled, encouraged, told they have no choice but to have an abortion \nand do so only to find out later that some doctor either misinformed \nthem or, frankly, was so afraid of malpractice that the doctor took the \neasy way out. That should never be a reason. Using bad medicine should \nnever be a reason to keep the procedure legal. The fact that there are \nsome doctors out there who practice bad medicine should not be a reason \nto keep this procedure legal.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Pennsylvania has \n60 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I do not want to use up all my time. I \ndo not see anyone from the other side. I ask unanimous consent that \nwhen I ask to go into a quorum call the time be deducted from the other \nside's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise briefly to make several comments and \nto review a little bit some of the myth that has surrounded the debate \non our attempts to ban a brutal procedure, a procedure called the \npartial-birth abortion.\n  It has been fascinating to watch where we started really about 2 \nyears ago in the evolution of learning about this procedure, \nrecognizing that it is performed, recognizing that it is as close to \ninfanticide as one can possibly get in our civilization today, and to \ntrack the misinformation, the organized misinformation campaigns that \nhave been carried out, instigated by a number of parties that have made \nit all the way to the Presidency of the United States of America--a \nmisinformation campaign that I think and I hope was the reason he \nvetoed this ban that is so supportive in a bipartisan way by Congress, \nand that is clearly supported by the American people.\n  I give the President the benefit of the doubt because I had the \nopportunity--I will refer back to it shortly, some of the statements he \nmade in his press conference and the people he brought forward. But \nsince that time--I guess that is what I am excited about--people have \ncome forward and said, even the people who are providing this \ninformation, it was a misinformation campaign. People said they lied \nthrough their teeth in giving that information to the American people.\n  But, in spite of all that, the truth has finally bubbled to the \nsurface. It has bubbled to the surface on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nand in the House of Representatives, but also throughout the media. \nDiscussions have taken place in hospitals. Discussions have taken place \namong the organized medical groups. We all recognize that whether it is \nACOG, the group of obstetricians and gynecologists, or the American \nMedical Association, which represents all physicians, that none of \nthese organizations really speak for everybody. But when you put it \naltogether--and it has been put together, mixed up, dissected and \nlooked at--gradually it is beginning to crystallize in a very clear \nway. And I think it is worth talking about a little bit on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate once again.\n  On a momentous occasion yesterday, after 2 years of looking at the \nissue, the American Medical Association essentially said that \nrestricting this procedure is something that should be done by the \nAmerican people and by the U.S. Congress. Again, this is after a lot of \ndebate, a lot of discussion, and a lot of examination of the facts \nwithin the medical community, with the American people, by ethicists \nand by religious communities. There is a mass movement to ban this \nbrutal procedure which offends the sensibilities of every American, \neverybody in our civilization today. This procedure, when described, \noffends their sensibilities.\n  I mentioned the American Medical Association. Again, the American \nMedical Association, the largest physician group in the country, issued \na letter yesterday that said really--let me refer to the letter. This \nis the letter in its entirety. It was written to Senator Santorum, who, \nobviously, has done a wonderful job, an outstanding job, in helping \nAmerica understand what the significance of this ban is.\n  I will go through the letter. The key sentence is the last sentence. \nIt basically says, ``Thank you, for the opportunity''--remember, this \nis from John Seward, from the American Medical Association, \nrepresenting their conclusions.\n  It says: ``Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards \nrestricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine.''\n  I guess a sentence like that does lead me to question how the \nPresident of the United States could continually, every day, hide \nbehind a threat of a veto talking about the health of women, because \nfor health of women we have to look at the American Medical \nAssociation, which represents obstetricians, gynecologists, family \npractitioners, internists, cancer specialists, heart disease--all of \nthese groups of people focus on their No. 1 goal, which is to promote \nthe health of this Nation, the health of individuals.\n  Then to have the President stand up and hide behind this veiled \nthreat of a veto having to do with health is a juxtaposition which I \ndon't understand. I hope the President, after we deliver this bill to \nhim, will recognize what health of individuals really is. I am talking \nabout health, not just of the infant, who, in fact, is being sacrificed \nin this procedure, but also the health of the mother. It requires \nsupport of this ban.\n  The letter says:\n\n       Dear Senator Santorum: The American Medical Association is \n     writing to support H.R. 1122, ``The Partial-Birth Abortion \n     Ban Act of 1997,'' as amended * * * the AMA has \n     supported such legislation * * *\n\n  They go on in the first paragraph to say:\n\n       Although our general policy is to oppose legislation \n     criminalizing medical practice or procedure, the AMA has \n     supported such legislation where the procedure was narrowly \n     defined and not medically indicated.\n\n  Narrowly defined, which this ban is.\n  There was an attempt last week to take this very narrow ban, \ncarefully proscribed--protections for the mother, protections clearly \nfor the child, protections for the medical profession. An attempt was \nmade last week to push that aside with a much broader issue that needs \nto be continually debated. But now we are back on the narrow \ndefinition.\n  The AMA says it is not medically indicated, not medically indicated, \nnot just for the baby but for the mother. It is not medically \nindicated, according to the American Medical Association, the largest \norganization representing more physicians than anyone in the United \nStates of America.\n  The second paragraph outlines the three principles that, after much \ndiscussion and much debate within the AMA, were agreed to:\n\n       First, the bill would allow a legitimate exception where \n     the life of the mother was endangered, thereby preserving the \n     physician's judgment to take any medically necessary steps to \n     save the life of the mother.\n\n  For the life of the mother, any steps can be taken, spelled out very \nclearly in the bill:\n\n       Second, the bill would clearly define the prohibited \n     procedure so that it is clear on the face of the legislation \n     what act is to be banned.\n\n  The attempt was made last week to ban all abortions, and that needs \nto be debated. But this bans a very specific procedure--a procedure, I \nmight add, that is performed quite frequently around the country but \ntends to be performed in abortion clinics, many times outside of peer \nreview of other physicians, very rarely in the hospital where you have \nnurses around to ask questions, and when you have other physicians \naround or hospital administrators asking, ``What is the ethics of a \nprocedure that so brutally sacrifices an infant upon three-fourths \ncompletion of delivery?''\n  No, these are performed with relatively high frequency, when you are\n\n[[Page S4699]]\n\ntalking about hundreds or thousands of infants that are, in fact, \nmurdered. But they are being performed outside the peer review and, I \nwould say, the ethics of the medical profession.\n  In the letter from the American Medical Association endorsing the \nbill, supporting the ban, it said:\n\n       Finally, the bill would give any accused physician the \n     right to have his or her conduct reviewed by the State \n     Medical Board before a criminal trial commenced. In this \n     manner, the bill would provide a formal role for valuable \n     medical peer determination in any enforcement proceeding.\n\n  I think this is important to say because as a physician I have to \nadmit before coming to the Senate the idea that this body or the \nCongress would pass a law to tell me what I could or could not do in \nterms of what I thought was in the best interest of my patient bothered \nme, not this particular ban but just the idea of having somebody in \nWashington, DC, inside the beltway telling me how to practice medicine \nand then making something a criminal procedure.\n  It is easier as a physician to say, no, I don't want any part of \nanything like that, and I think that is what we were hearing from some \nof the medical community, a fear that they would be thrown in jail for \ndoing what they think is right for the patient, and they didn't want \nthis to be set as a precedent. I think this letter and the bill shows \nthat, no, that is not what is being done. Basically, we are banning a \nvery specific procedure that is on the fringe, and you are going to \nhave the opportunity for peer review to know what is accepted medical \npractice even in the event you are accused in this manner.\n  Then the letter goes on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for another 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Then the final sentence, again which really summarizes it, \nand that is why I started with it: ``Thank you for the opportunity of \nworking with you toward restricting a procedure we all agree is not \ngood medicine.''\n  I am proud that as Americans we have not lost our ability to discern \nwhat is right from what is wrong, and despite the vim of the well-worn \nrhetoric that we have heard broadly in the media and on the floor in \nthe past, we now have listened to our hearts and we know that nothing \ncan justify a procedure such as this one that is a mere 3 inches--a \nmere 3 inches--from criminal infanticide.\n  Several myths. Myth No. 1. Partial-birth abortion is necessary to \npreserve the health of the mother. It has been used again and again. \nThe President of the United States continued to use it yesterday; I am \nsure he will say something about it today until this bill is delivered \nto him.\n  December 13, 1996. President Clinton described a hypothetical \nsituation where without a partial-birth abortion a woman could not--and \nI use quotations here--``preserve the ability to have further \nchildren.'' He said that he would not, using his words again, ``tell \nher that I am signing a law which will prevent her from having another \nchild. I am not going to do it,'' said the President.\n  That is heart wrenching. When you see just that clip, we tend to \nempathsize with what the President is saying. But the bottom line is \npartial-birth abortion is never ever necessary to preserve the health \nof a woman. The College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has issued a \nstatement that said they ``could identify no circumstance under which \nthis procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve \nthe health of the mother.'' There are always--always--other procedures \nthat will preserve the health of the mother.\n  The AMA task force convened on this issue also concluded, ``There \ndoes not appear to be any identified situation in which intact D is \nthe only appropriate procedure to induce abortion.''\n  Thus, even if there are health reasons--and health is defined very, \nvery broadly--even if there are health reasons, there are other safer \nprocedures for the mother.\n  Myth No. 2. It goes like this. The D procedure, partial-birth \nabortion, is a rare and difficult medical procedure. It is usually \nperformed only in extreme cases to save the life of the woman or in \ncases of severe fetal abnormalities.\n  Well, again, it is just not true. If we look to what Ronald \nFitzsimmons said, executive director of the National Coalition of \nAbortion Providers, Mr. Fitzsimmons, I think, has shown amazing \nintegrity in coming forward when he said that he admits he--I am using \nhis words--lied through his teeth when he said partial-birth abortion \nwas rarely used or only on women whose lives were in danger.\n  In a recent American Medical News article he explained that he could \nnot justify lying to the American people any longer saying--and \nremember, he was an advocate; he opposed the ban initially. He said, \n``They are primarily done on healthy women and healthy fetuses, and it \nmakes you feel like a dirty little abortionist with a dirty little \nsecret.''\n  It is no longer a secret. It is no longer a secret. We have talked \nabout it in the Chamber. The media understands it. The American people \nunderstand it. It is time to ban this procedure.\n  Dr. James McMahon, another partial-birth abortion practitioner, \ntestified before Congress that 80 percent of the partial-birth \nabortions he performed were for purely elective reasons--purely \nelective reasons. The examples he gave: nine babies because they had a \nlittle cleft lip, which can be easily repaired today. Many others, at \nleast 39, he said, were aborted because of the psychological and \nemotional health of the mother, despite the advanced gestational age \nand health of the child.\n\n  So we can see that if you use a health exception, you have a huge \ndoor through which you can drive a truck and continue to perform this \nprocedure. If you throw in a so-called health exception, as good as it \nsounds, it really goes back to what Doe versus Bolton in 1973, the \nSupreme Court case defined as health. They defined health to include \n``all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the \nwoman's age--relative to the well-being of the patient.''\n  That is the big door through which, if you are an abortionist, if you \ndo not follow the ethics of the American Medical Association or the \nmedical profession today, you can continue to do this brutal, inhumane \nprocedure by saying, oh, it is for the health of the mother. The mother \nis a bit down in the dumps because she feels like this baby must be \nsacrificed, and therefore I can certify and say that is the health of \nthe mother.\n  Again, in Doe versus Bolton, the law of the land, the Supreme Court \ncase in 1973 included ``all factors--physical, emotional, \npsychological, familial, and the woman's age--relative to the well-\nbeing of the patient.'' People in the abortion industry understand that \nthere are many late-term abortions for social reasons as well as health \nreasons. It is recognized; people know it.\n  A 1993 National Abortion Federation internal memorandum said, ``There \nare many reasons why women have later abortions,'' and they include, \n``Lack of money or health insurance, social psychological crisis, lack \nof knowledge about human reproduction.''\n  So when you see legislation in the Chamber allowing this procedure or \neven putting in amendments or supposing it should be allowed for health \nof the mother, just recognize, if that is the case, that anybody--\nanybody--can continue doing this procedure at the same rate as they do \ntoday by providing this huge loophole, which again sounds like it is \nnot a loophole but in practice is a huge loophole. One last myth.\n  Mr. President, can I ask for another 5 minutes?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Five additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is asking for another 5. The \nSenator is recognized for another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. One last myth goes like this. This procedure could \npossibly be the best procedure in a woman's situation for her health. \nIn other words, now people realize and they didn't really a month ago \nor 6 months ago, and the President may not realize it today, there are \na range of procedures when, for example, it is life of the mother. But \nthere are some people who would say this is the best procedure.\n  Let me just say that as a physician, as one who has taken an oath to \ntake\n\n[[Page S4700]]\n\ncare of that individual who comes into the office, who comes into the \nroom, to preserve the life and the health of every patient, I find this \nvery discomforting. I have talked to obstetricians. We have had the \nquotations in the Chamber. We have consulted many. They have basically \ntold us that this is not the best procedure, that there are other \nalternative procedures if there is the indication, for example, of life \nof the mother. Many practitioners had never heard of it. The people in \nTennessee, the high-risk obstetricians whom I have talked to across the \nState of Tennessee, they have not performed this procedure and many \nhave not heard of this procedure.\n  Remember, this procedure was fashioned, described--in fact, the only \narticle in the literature that we can really find describing it so it \ncan be presented among other people is from Dr. Haskell, who is not an \nobstetrician. He is not a board certified obstetrician but, rather, a \nfamily-practice medical doctor. These procedures are being performed \nbut not endorsed, not the procedure. Nothing from the obstetrics and \ngynecologic association has come out and said we support this \nprocedure.\n  Now, when people say, well, it could be the best or it could not be \nthe best, that is that noncommittal approach that some physicians have \ntaken. And why? Because there is this great fear that big brother \nGovernment, the Federal Government is going to come down and jump into \nthat doctor-patient relationship and tell us what we can or cannot do. \nThat is the fear physicians have. Remember, this bill takes one brutal, \nunaccepted procedure in the medical profession and bans it.\n  Let me just recap and then I will close, Mr. President. We have a \nbrutal, basically repulsive procedure that is specifically designed to \nkill a living infant outside the birth canal except for the head, \nspecifically designed to kill a living infant outside of the birth \ncanal with only the head remaining inside. The leading providers of \nwomen's obstetrical and gynecological services condemn it. They \nrecommend that it not be used. They refuse to endorse it. They \nhighlight its risks for the mother and say that there are other safe \nand equally effective alternatives available.\n  I guess I can understand some of the reasons why those practitioners, \nor a few of them, urge us not to ban it. They say it would be violating \nthe sanctity of the physician-patient relationship. Mr. President, as a \nphysician, as one who has taken the same oath to preserve the health \nand the life of others, and I also say as a father, I submit that any \nprovider who performs this partial-birth abortion procedure has already \nviolated that sanctity, that sanctity of the physician-patient \nrelationship. The AMA, in essence, has said that when they say they \nappreciate the opportunity to work with us toward restricting a \nprocedure which all agree is not good medicine. Partial-birth abortions \ncannot and should not be categorized with other medical procedures. \nThey should not be allowed in a civilized country.\n\n  With the reintroduction of the partial-birth abortion ban legislation \nin the Senate, we have the opportunity right now to right a wrong. Now, \nonce again, the American people are calling upon us to listen not to \nour political advisers, not to listen to the various interest groups \nthat come forward but to listen to our conscience. It is going to take \nmoral courage to stop propaganda which is going to continue to come \nforward. It is going to take moral courage to make sure that good \ninformation makes it all the way to the President of the United States \nwhen he has to decide whether or not to veto this piece of good \nlegislation. But we all, including the President, have at our disposal \ntoday the information with which to do the right thing.\n  So for the sake of women, and I think women especially, for the sake \nof their children, and really for the sake of our society, our society \nas a future civilization, we must put a stop once and for all to \npartial-birth abortion. I support the ban and urge all of my colleagues \ntoday, when we vote in several hours, to support the ban, and I urge \nthe President not to veto this very good piece of legislation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis terrific statement, as always. He has been on the floor for the \npast several days debating this issue from a position of authority, I \nmight add, as the only physician in the Senate. But I also thank him \nfor his tremendous work in working with me and Representative Canady \nand the AMA to come up with the language changes that were necessary to \nsecure this very important endorsement of the medical community. He was \nright on the front-lines working to make sure that happened, and he \nmade a great contribution to the debate on this whole issue, whether or \nnot we get enough votes in the Senate today, of consciousness of the \nAmerican public, and I thank him for that.\n  Mr. President, I do not have a speaker here at this point, so I ask \nunanimous consent again that when I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nthe time be deducted from the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. As the recent debate on this \nissue illustrates, this is not simply an issue of a woman's ``right to \nchoose'' whether or not to have a child. It is also an issue of \nprotecting the life of an unborn child. However much we may disagree \nabout whether life begins at conception, when it comes to late term \nabortions, we are clearly talking about a baby. And therefore, it is \nentirely reasonable to place restrictions on such abortions, especially \nwhen the procedure in question is as barbaric--and as unnecessary--as \nthis one.\n  Last September 26, when the Senate was debating whether or not to \noverride President Clinton's veto of this measure, the Wall Street \nJournal made the same point in this way:\n\n       Up till now the abortion debate, if you'll pardon the \n     metaphor, has managed to ignore the 800-pound gorilla in the \n     room. For the first time, people are also talking about the \n     fetus, not about women alone. A fetus may or may not be \n     human, but on the other hand, it's not nothing. At 20 weeks \n     of gestation, when the partial-birth abortion debate begins, \n     a fetus is about nine inches long and is clearly becoming \n     human.\n\n  Opponents of the effort to ban this procedure based their argument \nlargely on claims about the relative safety and medical necessity of \nthis procedure which we now know to be false. We all know by now about \nthe admission by Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National \nCoalition of Abortion Providers, that he lied through [his] teeth about \nthe frequency of and justification for this procedure. And even the \ndoctor who invented the procedure has admitted that 80 percent of these \nprocedures he has performed were purely elective. In other words, they \nwere not performed to preserve either the life or the health of the \nmother.\n  Mr. President, the majority of Americans agree that abortion on \ndemand--at any time during pregnancy, for any reason--is wrong. Even a \nmajority of people who describe themselves as pro-choice believe it is \nreasonable to restrict abortion under some circumstances. It is time we \ndecided where to draw that line. This is certainly a good place to draw \nit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, H.R. 1122 would seek to ban a particular \nmedical procedure, the intact D procedure. I believe we cross a \ndangerous threshold when we seek to legislate which particular medical \nprocedures may be used, and which may not be used, by physicians. \nDedicated doctors and nurses, through official statements of their \nassociations, urge us not to adopt H.R. 1122, and not to politicize \nthis issue.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an \norganization representing 38,000 physicians whose lives are dedicated \nto bringing babies into the world and keeping them and their mothers \nsafe, issued a policy statement on January 12, 1997, relative to the \nbill before us which states that:\n\n       An intact D may be the best or most appropriate procedure \n     in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the \n     health of a woman, and only the doctor, in\n\n[[Page S4701]]\n\n     consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's \n     particular circumstances can make this decision. The \n     potential exists that legislation prohibiting specified \n     medical practices, such as intact D, may outlaw techniques \n     that are critical to the lives and health of American women. \n     The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decision \n     making is inappropriate, ill advised and dangerous.\n\n  Their position was reiterated yesterday. I ask unanimous consent that \ntheir letter dated May 19, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. The president of the American Medical Women's Association, \nInc., in a March 10, 1997, letter, wrote the following on behalf of \nmore than 10,000 women physicians and medical students nationwide,\n\n       I would like to register our strong opposition to . . . [S. \n     6], which seek(s) to outlaw intact D . . .We do not \n     believe that the federal government should dictate the \n     decisions of physicians and feel that passage of this \n     legislation would in effect prescribe the medical procedures \n     to be used by physicians rather than allow physicians to use \n     their medical judgment in determining the most appropriate \n     treatment for their patients. The passage of this legislation \n     would set a dangerous precedent--undermining the ability of \n     physicians to make medical decisions. It is medical \n     professionals, not the President or Congress, who should \n     determine appropriate medical options.\n\n  Their position was reiterated today. I ask unanimous consent that \ntheir letter dated May 20, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Executive Director of the American Nurses Association, \nwrote to me in November, 1995, and stated:\n\n       It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this \n     proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of the \n     federal government into a therapeutic decision that should be \n     left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health care \n     provider. ANA has long supported freedom of choice and \n     equitable access of all women to basic health services, \n     including services related to reproductive health. This \n     legislation would impose a significant barrier to those \n     principles.\n       It is inappropriate for Congress to mandate a course of \n     action for a woman who is already faced with an intensely \n     personal and difficult decision. This procedure can mean the \n     difference between life and death for a woman.\n\n  The American Nurses Association is the only full-service professional \norganization representing the nation's 2.2 million Registered Nurses \nthrough its 53 constituent associations. ANA advances the nursing \nprofession by fostering high standards of nursing practice, promoting \nthe economic and general welfare of nurses in the workplace, projecting \na positive and realistic view of nursing, and by lobbying the Congress \nand regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting nurses and the \npublic.\n  Their position was reiterated today. I ask unanimous consent that \ntheir letter dated May 20, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have other concerns with this bill as well. For example, \nwhile banning one abortion procedure, this bill leaves legal other \nabortion procedures which can be used, procedures which are just as \ndestructive to the fetus but which could be less safe for the mother.\n  The Supreme Court has held that States may not ban pre-viability \nabortions but may ban post-viability abortions except when necessary to \nprotect a woman's life or health. The bill under consideration would \nban certain pre-viability abortions, and it does not allow for an \nexception required by the Supreme Court to preserve a woman's health \nrelative to post-viability abortions.\n  Mr. President, in summary, the bill before us ignores the strong \nadvice of the specialists and nurses acting officially through their \nassociations. The bill before us violates Supreme Court opinions. The \nbill would risk the health of a mother while not preventing one \nabortion. We are usurping in this bill medical judgments relative to \nindividual women, in perhaps the most dire and tragic circumstances \nthey will ever face. This is not the way legislators should create \ncrimes.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Lott: In light of the slight modifications \n     being proposed to HR 1122, the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban \n     Act of 1997,'' we wanted to take this opportunity to \n     reiterate our opposition to this legislation. Our statement \n     on this issue is attached.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                          American Medical Women's\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: On behalf of the American Medical \n     Women's Association (AMWA), I would like to reiterate our \n     opposition to H.R. 1122, the so-called ``Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act of 1997,'' as amended. AMWA does not endorse \n     legislation which interferes with medical decisionmaking, \n     particularly when it fails to consider the health of the \n     woman patient.\n       Our opposition to this legislation is based on the \n     following issues. First, we are gravely concerned that this \n     legislation does not protect a women's physical and mental \n     health, including future fertility, or consider other \n     pertinent issues such as fetal abnormalities. Second, this \n     legislation would further erode physician-patient autonomy \n     forcing physicians to always avoid legislatively prohibited \n     procedures in medical decisionmaking, including in emergency \n     situations when physicians and patients must base their \n     decisions on the best available information available to \n     them. Third, medical care decisions must be left to the \n     judgment of a woman and her physician without fear of civil \n     action or criminal prosecution. We do not support the levying \n     of civil and criminal penalties for care provided in the best \n     interest of the women patient.\n       AMWA remains committed to ensuring that physicians retain \n     authority to make medical and surgical care decisions that \n     are in the best interest of their patients given the \n     information available to them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Debra R. Judelson, MD,\n                                                        President.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to reiterate the \n     opposition of the American Nurses Association to H.R. 1122, \n     the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997'', which is \n     being considered by the Senate this week. This legislation \n     would impose Federal criminal penalties and provide for civil \n     actions against health care providers who perform certain \n     late-term abortions.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Geri Marullo, MSN, RN,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Santorum \nbill. I oppose this bill for three reasons. First of all, it will not \nstop a single abortion from occurring. Second, it is unconstitutional. \nFinally, it does not provide any protection for a woman whose health is \ngrievously threatened by the pregnancy.\n  I want to ban all post-viability abortions, not a particular \nprocedure. I believe the only time an abortion should be allowed after \nthe point of viability is when the woman's life is threatened or her \nhealth is at serious risk of substantial impairment.\n  I supported the Daschle alternative. The Daschle alternative would \nhave meant fewer abortions. It banned all abortions once a fetus had \nachieved viability. In other words, once a fetus could survive outside \nthe womb--with or without life support--a woman could not obtain an \nabortion.\n  It provided only two exceptions: first, when the woman's life was \nthreatened by continuing the pregnancy, and second, when she was at \nrisk of grievous injury to her health. If the Daschle alternative had \nbeen adopted there would be fewer abortions.\n  The bill before us bans one procedure. It does not ban one single \nabortion. It bans a method of abortion. It enables a doctor to choose \nany other abortion procedure--even ones that might cause a greater \nhealth risk to the woman. So no abortions would be stopped by this \nbill.\n  I want to support a bill that is constitutionally acceptable. The \nbill before us fails the test of constitutionality. The Supreme Court \nhas always insisted that prior to the point of viability, the woman's \nright to abortion is constitutionally protected. This bill infringes on \nthat right by banning a procedure even before viability.\n\n[[Page S4702]]\n\n  The Supreme Court has also held that in any legislation restricting \nabortion, the woman's life and health must be protected. A physician \nmust place the woman's health as the paramount concern. There can be no \ntrade off of the woman's life and health for that of the fetus.\n  By refusing to include any exception for instances where the woman's \nhealth is at risk, H.R. 1122 is constitutionally unacceptable. The \nDaschle alternative, on the other hand, was respectful of the \nrequirements of the Constitution. It focused only on abortion \nprocedures after the point of viability. And it ensured that a woman's \nhealth could be protected.\n  I want to support legislation that provides for the health of the \nwoman. I know that health of the woman is viewed by some as merely a \nloophole. But even those who hold that view must acknowledge that there \nare medical crises that arise during pregnancy that could cause \nprofound harm to a woman's health.\n  Conditions like severe hypertension or peripartal cardiomyopathy are \ncaused by the pregnancy itself. These can lead to organ failure or put \na woman at risk of cardiac failure. Other conditions, like leukemia or \nbreast cancer, cannot receive the aggressive treatment they require so \nlong as the pregnancy continues.\n  I don't believe that anyone would argue that these are minor health \nproblems. Yet the Santorum bill does not allow any health exception for \nwomen facing these major health threats.\n  The Daschle alternative, on the other hand, did provide a carefully \ncrafted exception for the woman's health. It said that a physician \ncould abort a viable fetus when the pregnancy would ``threaten the \nmother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.'' \nGrievous injury was narrowly defined to include only the most \ndebilitating problems caused by the pregnancy itself and cases where \nthe pregnancy caused an inability to treat a life-threatening \ncondition. It required that such conditions be medically diagnosable, \nand ruled out any condition for which termination of the pregnancy was \nnot medically indicated.\n  This was not loophole shopping. This was a serious, careful, \nintellectually rigorous effort to deal with the realities of women's \nhealth and women's lives.\n  I was proud to support the Daschle alternative. I was disappointed \nthat it did not receive broader support. It would have prevented \nabortions. It was respectful of the Constitution. It safeguarded \nwomen's health.\n  I am disappointed that the American Medical Association has chosen to \nendorse this bill. I am particularly troubled that their decision seems \nto be based not on what is best for women's health but on what is best \nfor doctors. The changes they sought in the bill were designed only to \nprotect a physician from legal endangerment.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, on the other \nhand, endorsed the Daschle alternative. They represent 38,000 \nphysicians who are experts in women's health and issues related to \npregnancy. They endorsed the Daschle alternative because it would have \nprovided a meaningful ban while assuring women's health is protected.\n  Let me say that I do not for one moment question the sincerity of \nthose who have called and written me in support of H.R. 1122. They want \nto stop abortions, and I respect the depth of their convictions.\n  But let me also say that if this bill is enacted, it will be a hollow \nvictory. I believe the Supreme Court will reject this bill as \nunconstitutional. In the end, even if it were somehow to pass \nconstitutional muster, it will not stop a single abortion. It will \nmerely divert physicians to other abortion procedures.\n  So this bill will not save lives. It will not save the lives and \nhealth of women. And it will not save the lives of fetuses. It is a \nhollow victory indeed.\n  I will oppose this measure.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we will vote on the legislation \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] to ban the \ndilation and extraction, or D, procedure used by doctors. I will be \nvoting against this ban for the third time in as many years.\n  My reasons for opposing this legislation are many. Most have been \ndiscussed on the floor since the debate began last week. First, and \nmost importantly I believe that this bill undermines the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Roe versus Wade to leave these critical matters in \nthe hands of a woman, her family, and their doctor. The pending \nlegislation is an effort to chip away at these reproductive rights \nestablished in that 1973 decision and upheld by court cases since 1973. \nI understand many people disagree with my position. This issue has been \ncontentious since I came to Congress in 1975.\n  Second, with the Roe decision, the Supreme Court wisely gave States \nthe responsibility to restrict third-trimester abortions, so long as \nthe life or health of the mother were not jeopardized. As of 1997, all \nbut nine States have done so. To me, the rights of States to regulate \nabortions, when the life or health of the mother are not in danger, is \nan adequate safeguard. In the event the States pass unconstitutional \nregulations on this point, the appropriate remedy is with the courts. I \nrealize that this policy leads to differences in law from State to \nState, but just as families differ, so too do States. As I said during \ndebate on this topic in 1995:\n\n       When the Roe versus Wade decision acknowledged a state \n     interest in fetuses after viability, the Court wisely left \n     restrictions on post-viability abortions up to states. There \n     are expert professional licensing boards, accreditation \n     councils and medical associations that guide doctors' \n     decision-making in the complicated and difficult matters of \n     life and death.\n\n  Nothing has changed since then. My reasons for voting against Senator \nDaschle's substitute amendment last week included this very principle: \nThat Congress should not restrict those reproductive health decisions \nmade by a woman and her doctor.\n  Third, the legislation before us would prevent doctors from using the \nD procedure where it is necessary to save the life of the mother. \nThis clearly goes against the holding of the Supreme Court in Roe, as \nit required the health of the mother be safeguarded when States \nregulate late-term abortions. I will not vote for a bill that is \nneither constitutional, nor takes into account those situations where \ncarrying a fetus to term would cause serious health risk for the \nmother. This is simply unacceptable. My vote in favor of the Feinstein \nsubstitute amendment underscored my commitment to safeguarding a \ndoctor's options to protect the health of the mother in cases where a \nlate-term procedure is necessary.\n  Finally, I believe that women who choose to undergo a D procedure \ndo so for grave reasons. If there are women who abort to fit into their \nprom dress, I trust the States to regulate these incidents--if they do, \nin fact, occur. We have established a delicate legal framework in which \nto address late-term abortions and we should not shift the \ndecisionmaking to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong support \nof H.R. 1122, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, it has been nearly 2 years since I first introduced \nthe Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in the Senate. At that time, only my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Gramm of Texas, joined me as an \noriginal cosponsor. We have come a long, long way since that time. We \nare not there yet, but we have made tremendous progress.\n  When the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act first passed the Senate on \nDecember 7, 1995, it did so with the support of 54 Senators. When the \nSenate voted on whether to override President Clinton's veto of the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act on September 26, 1996, 57 Senators voted \nin favor of the bill.\n  Today, we believe that we have at least 62 Senators who are prepared \nto vote for this legislation. We remain several votes short of the 67 \nvotes that we will need to override President Clinton's promised veto \nof this bill, but we are getting closer. I am hopeful that in the wake \nof yesterday's dramatic announcement that the American Medical \nAssociation has endorsed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997, we \nwill get there.\n  Mr. President, one of the principal reasons why we are making so much \nprogress in the Senate toward our goal of outlawing partial-birth \nabortion is\n\n[[Page S4703]]\n\nthat more and more Senators are realizing that the opposition to this \nbill in the last Congress was built on a foundation of lies. When I use \nthe word ``lies,'' Mr. President, I am using the very word that one of \nthe Nation's leading abortion industry lobbyists--Ron Fitzsimmons--used \nwhen he publicly admitted earlier this year that he ``lied through \n[his] teeth'' when he helped orchestrate the campaign against the \npartial-birth abortion ban legislation in the last Congress.\n  In an interview published in the New York Times on February 27, 1997, \nand in an article published in the American Medical News on March 3, \n1997, Mr. Fitzsimmons made the surprisingly candid admission that he \nhad ``lied'' when he claimed that partial-birth abortions are rare. In \nthose same interviews, Mr. Fitzsimmons also conceded that he ``lied'' \nwhen he claimed that partial-birth abortions are performed only on \nwomen whose lives are endangered or whose unborn children are severely \ndisabled. ``It made me physically ill,'' Mr. Fitzsimmons told his \ninterviewer. ``I told my wife the next day, `I can't do this again.'''\n  In seeking to justify his veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act \nlast year, the New York Times points out, ``President Clinton echoed \nthe argument of Mr. Fitzsimmons.'' In other words, in justifying his \nveto, Mr. Clinton relied on the same statements of ``fact'' that have \nnow been conceded by a key leader of the abortion industry to be \n``lies.''\n  The truth, Mr. Fitzsimmons told the New York Times, is that ``[i]n \nthe vast majority of cases, the [partial-birth abortion] procedure is \nperformed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 or more \nweeks along.'' And, as Mr. Fitzsimmons told the American Medical News, \n``[t]he abortion-rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, \nand so, probably, does everybody else.'' Except, Mr. Fitzsimmons might \nhave added, for President Clinton, who still promises to veto this bill \neven though the reasons he gave to justify his previous veto have \nturned out to be ``lies.''\n  Mr. President, following Mr. Fitzsimmons's startling revelations, on \nMarch 4, 1997, the Washington Post ran an unusually blunt editorial \nentitled ``Lies and Late-Term Abortions.'' After recounting Mr. \nFitzsimmons' lies and his candid admissions that he lied, the Post \neditorial drew the following conclusion:\n\n       Mr. Fitzsimmons's revelation is a sharp blow to the \n     credibility of his allies. These late-term abortions are \n     extremely difficult to justify, if they can be justified at \n     all. Usually pro-choice legislators such as Sen. Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan and Representatives Richard Gephardt and \n     Susan Molinari voted for the ban last year. Opponents of the \n     ban fought hard, even demanding a roll call vote on their \n     motion to ban charts describing the procedure from the House \n     floor. They lost. And they lost by wide margins when the \n     House and Senate voted for the ban. They probably will lose \n     again this year when the ban is reconsidered. And this time, \n     Mr. Clinton will be hard-pressed to justify a veto on the \n     basis of the misinformation on which he rested his case last \n     time.\n\n  There you have it, Mr. President. One of the abortion industry's most \nprominent leaders has admitted that the case against the partial-birth \nabortion ban was based on ``lies.'' Not my word, his word--``lies.'' \nThe New York Times points out that in attempting to justify his veto of \nthe Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, President Clinton ``echoed'' those \nlies. And the Washington Post points out, in a great understatement, \nthat President Clinton will be ``hard-pressed'' to base another veto on \nMr. Fitzsimmons's and his friends' ``misinformation.''\n  Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist George Will drew the following \nconclusion in an opinion article published on April 24, 1997, in the \nWashington Post:\n\n       The accusation that President Clinton cares deeply about \n     nothing is refuted by his tenacious and guileful battle to \n     prevent any meaningful limits on the form of infanticide \n     known as partial-birth abortion. However, that battle proves \n     that his professed desire to make abortion ``rare'' applies \n     only to the fourth trimester of pregnancies.\n\n  Mr. President, even though President Clinton seems bound and \ndetermined not to take another look at his stand on partial-birth \nabortion even in the face of Mr. Fitzsimmons's stunning admissions, I \nurge my colleagues who voted against this bill in the last Congress to \ndo just that--take another look. Many, if not most, of you voted \nagainst this bill because you believed Mr. Fitzsimmons and his friends \nwhen they told you that partial-birth abortions are rare and they are \nonly done on women facing grave physical threats or whose unborn \nchildren are hopelessly deformed. I urge you to take another look, \nreconsider your position, and on reconsideration, support us. Partial-\nbirth abortions aren't ``rare''--they're common--and they are done, in \nthe overwhelming majority of cases, on perfectly healthy women with \nperfectly healthy unborn children.\n\n  Mr. President, aside from the Fitzsimmons revelations, I believe that \nanother reason why the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act continues to \nattract greater and greater support in the Senate is that Senators are \ncoming to realize that this issue really transcends abortion. Indeed, \nas one Senator who did not vote for this bill the first time, but \nsupported us on the veto override last year, Senator Moynihan, put it, \npartial-birth abortion is ``too close to infanticide.'' That was a \nstarkly truthful way to put it, Mr. President, and it took courage for \nSenator Moynihan to say it. I commend him for it.\n  Mr. President, another Senator who did not support this bill the \nfirst time around, but who also joined us on the veto override vote, \nSenator Specter, also believes that partial-birth abortion is more like \ninfanticide than it is abortion. Listen to what Senator Specter had to \nsay on the Senate floor on September 26, 1996. ``In my legal \njudgment,'' Senator Specter said, ``the medical act or acts of \ncommission or omission in interfering with, or not facilitating the \ncompletion of a live birth after a child is partially out of the \nmother's womb constitute infanticide.'' ``The line of the law is drawn, \nin my legal judgment,'' Senator Specter concluded, ``when the child is \npartially out of the womb of the mother. It is no longer abortion; it \nis infanticide.''\n  Once again, Mr. President, those are strong words and they are \ntruthful words. Senator Specter is a pro-choice Senator, and it took \ncourage for him to support this bill. But he did so, again, Mr. \nPresident, because he recognized that partial-birth abortion is more \nlike infanticide than it is abortion.\n  So, Mr. President, we are steadily picking up more and more support \nin the Senate because, as I have argued here today, more and more \nSenators are realizing that the case against this bill was built on a \nfoundation of what are now conceded to have been ``lies.'' We are also \npicking up greater and greater support because more and more Senators \nare realizing that this issue transcends abortion--that the tiny little \nhuman being whom we are talking about is a partially born baby who is \njust inches from drawing her first breath.\n  To those Senators who are still considering joining the ever-\nincreasing majority of Senators who support the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act, let me address a few more comments to you. Perhaps the \nNation's most respected and revered doctor--``America's Doctor''--is \nthe former Surgeon General of the United States, C. Everett Koop. I am \nparticularly proud of Dr. Koop because he is a part-time resident of my \nhome State of New Hampshire.\n  This is what Dr. Koop has to say: ``Partial-birth abortion is never \nmedically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility. \nOn the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both \nher immediate health and future fertility.'' We all know that Dr. Koop \nis not a man who uses words lightly. On the contrary, Dr. Koop is a \ndoctor who chooses his words with care and precision. Listen to those \nwords again: ``Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to \nprotect a mother's health or future fertility.''\n  Now, of course, Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, even the \nAmerican Medical Association, which is pro-choice on abortion, has \nendorsed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. So, my colleagues, if you \nare worried about protecting women, listen to the words of Dr. Koop and \nlisten to the American Medical Association. They are for the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act because partial-birth abortion is never \nnecessary to protect a woman's health.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who are still undecided \nabout this bill to look at it in light of our beloved Nation's history. \nWe all know those beautiful and majestic words\n\n[[Page S4704]]\n\nthat Thomas Jefferson wrote for our Declaration of Independence: ``We \nhold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, \nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, \nthat among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''\n  Mr. President, one does not have to agree with my view that human \nlife begins at conception to see that a living baby who is in the \nprocess of being born has, in Jefferson's words, been endowed by her \ncreator with the unalienable right to life. Can anyone seriously doubt \nwhere that great American, Thomas Jefferson, would stand on that \nquestion?\n  Mr. President, another of America's greatest leaders, Abraham \nLincoln, made one of the most dramatic and prophetic statements of his \nlife in a speech that he delivered on June 16, 1858. In that speech, \nAbraham Lincoln said ``I believe this government cannot endure \npermanently, half slave and half free.'' Today, Mr. President, as we \ndebate this Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in this great Capitol of the \nUnion that Lincoln saved, I would say this: The moral foundation of \nthis Government cannot endure permanently when even the half born are \nnot free to live. Can anyone, Mr. President, really doubt where that \nmoral giant, Abraham Lincoln, would have stood on the question before \nus here today?\n  Mr. President, let us rise to the moral level to which our Nation's \nhistory calls us. Let us recognize the unalienable, God-given right to \nlife of the partially born. Let us protect the partially born from a \nbrutal death. Let us be worthy of the Nation that Jefferson helped \ncreate and that Lincoln surely saved. Let us pass the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act with a two-thirds' majority in the Senate and then \ndare President Clinton to turn his back on the moral legacy of \nJefferson and Lincoln.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, from the time that I first became involved \nin national politics, it has seemed to me that, for mature adults, \nunder most circumstances, the law was not an appropriate method of \ndetermining what are ultimately moral choices for the people most \nintimately involved with those choices. I believe that my views \nprobably reflect those of a majority of the American people who believe \nthat this should be a matter of an individual woman's choice and that \nof close family--under most cases.\n  But, Mr. President, when we talk about late-term abortion and when we \nspeak specifically about partial-birth abortion, we are not dealing \nwith most cases. I think it is clear that the majority of the American \npeople, as they have come increasingly to understand exactly what this \nprocedure is, are horrified by it.\n  I have been disturbed by the nature of this debate, by the \nintentional deceit and misinformation about the frequency and necessity \nof this practice. Only recently, have the opponents of this ban have \nadmitted ``lying through their teeth'' about the facts on the number of \npartial-birth abortions performed and grounds for this horrific \nprocedure.\n  It is clear, Mr. President that this practice is not necessary. Just \nlast week, the American Medical Association Board of Trustees said \nthere is ``no identified situation'' that requires the use of this \nprocedure and as of yesterday, endorsed this bill. The American College \nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists state that there are ``no \ncircumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to \nsave the life of the mother''.\n  This is a practice that is not compassionate, nor is it within the \nbounds of civilized or humane behavior. My colleagues have described it \nin detail, and I don't need to repeat that detail. But I do think that \nit is significant that those who oppose this bill generally speaking, \ntalk in circumlocution, disguise the language, resist and object not \nonly to a description of the procedure itself, but even to the title-\npartial-birth abortion. They speak about slippery slopes rather than \nthe procedure itself and attempt to avoid the true brutality and \nextreme nature of the procedure.\n  It is simple, this procedure is brutal, inhumane and clearly \nunnecessary. This vote will be a defining issue about our own society, \nabout our feelings for indifference to brutality, about violence, about \nuncivilized, inhumane behavior. For all of those reasons, Mr. \nPresident, I am convinced that we should pass the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act, and I deeply hope that a sufficient majority of my \ncolleagues will vote to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, once again we find ourselves addressing the \nvery difficult and emotional issue of partial-birth abortion. The bill \nthe Senate is considering today would criminalize the performance of \nthe partial-birth abortion procedure, unless it is necessary to save \nthe life of the mother. I still have many unanswered questions about \nthis matter, and, as I have indicated in the past, I am extremely \nhesitant to thrust the Congress into the role of the physician. I am \nconcerned that this measure seemingly ignores the Supreme Court's \ndeterminations regarding the role of the state in banning abortions \npre- and post-viability and with regard to the health of the mother. I \nhave also noted concerns that this might be the first step in a process \nwhich may lead Congress to play the role of doctor again and again and \nagain on specific medical procedures.\n  As in the past, I have given this issue a great deal of thought and I \nhave particularly considered the new information brought to light by \nRon Fitzsimmons of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. His \nremarks made clear that this particular procedure is performed far more \noften than originally thought and not just under certain extreme \ncircumstances which severely threaten the life and the health of the \nmother. In addition, an endorsement of the ban by the American Medical \nAssociation (AMA), which represents a large number of our Nation's \ndoctors, certainly allays some of my earlier concerns about this \nmeasure. In previous votes, I had opposed banning this specific \nprocedure; however, in light of the fact that it is not as rare as some \nclaimed and that there appear to be other alternatives, I cannot, in \ngood conscience, continue to oppose a ban on this specific procedure.\n  Due to my concern about the serious health risk to the mother that \ncan, unfortunately, occur during pregnancy, I voted in support of the \nalternative measure offered by Senator Daschle. I believe that the \nDaschle amendment would have been more effective in addressing \nwarranted concerns about post-viability abortions while ensuring that \nsevere, serious health risks to the mother are taken into account. \nHowever, that amendment was rejected by the Senate.\n  Like so many West Virginians and Americans who have heard about this \nspecific procedure, I find it extremely disturbing. Mr. President, I \nwill cast my vote in support of H.R. 1122 to ban the partial-birth \nabortion procedure that is done in too many questionable circumstances.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act of 1997. Let me first begin by stating that an \nabundance of misinformation has characterized the debate on the \npartial-birth abortion procedure. I am deeply troubled at how abortion \nactivists have misled the American public, Members of Congress, and \nespecially the President, on the number of partial-birth abortions \nperformed each year and the reasons for them.\n  The debate on this issue reminds me of a variation of the old \ncourtroom saying: If you have the facts, then argue the facts. If you \nhave the law, then argue the law. If you have neither the law or the \nfacts, then don't tell the truth.\n  The proponents of the partial-birth abortion have neither the facts \nnor the law, so they argue with lies.\n  Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of \nAbortion Providers, which represents approximately 200 independently \nowned abortion clinics across the country, recently admitted in \nFebruary of this year, that he ``lied'' through his teeth when he said \nthat the procedure was used rarely and only on women whose lives were \nin danger or whose fetuses were damaged. According to Mr. Fitzsimmons, \nhe ``spouted the party line'' about the procedure--even though he \nbelieved his statements were wrong.\n  In debating a procedure as grotesque as the partial-birth abortion, \nthe facts regarding its use and necessity are important. Because the \nfacts about this\n\n[[Page S4705]]\n\nprocedure are so damaging, pro-abortionists like Mr. Fitzsimmons, have \ntried to distort or withhold facts from the American people. Let me \nhighlight some of the mistruths that have surrounded this issue.\n  Proponents of the partial-birth abortion claim that the procedure is \nrare--only occurring about 500 to 600 times a year. However this is not \ntrue. The number of partial-birth abortions is closer to 4,000 to 5,000 \na year. In New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 procedures are done each \nyear.\n  Proponents of the partial-birth abortion also claim that the \nprocedure is necessary to save the life or health of the mother. This \nis not true. According to the more than 600 doctors nationwide who make \nup the Physicians' Ad-hoc Coalition for Truth, it is never medically \nnecessary to kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester of \npregnancy in order to protect the life, health, or future fertility of \nthe mother. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has stated that the \n``partial-birth abortion is never necessary to protect a mother's \nhealth or her future fertility.'' Even the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists has admitted that there are ``no \ncircumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to \nsave the life of the mother and preserve the health of the woman.''\n  The fact is that partial-birth abortions are elective and not \nperformed for medical reasons. As one abortion doctor stated most of \nthe abortions were performed on women who didn't realize, or didn't \ncare how far along they were.\n  Proponents of partial-birth abortion fail to mention that the 3-day-\nlong procedure actually increases the risk of harm to the mother. After \n21 weeks, an abortion is two times as risky for the mother as \nchildbirth.\n  Finally, proponents of the partial-birth abortion claim it is used \nonly in extreme cases of fetal abnormality. This is not true. Mr. \nFitzsimmons admitted that the majority of these procedures are \nperformed on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. In a March 3, 1997, \narticle in American Medical News, Mr. Fitzsimmons admitted that he \ncalled around to doctors who performed the procedure. According to Mr. \nFitzsimmons, ``I learned right away that this was being done for the \nmost part in cases that did not involve those extreme circumstances.''\n  It is disheartening that the debate on this issue has been so clouded \nby misinformation. The simple truth is that partial-birth abortions are \ncommon and the majority of the procedures are performed on healthy \nmothers and babies.\n  On an issue as emotionally charged and divisive as abortion, elected \nofficials have a heightened responsibility to carefully gather the \nfacts and to vote their consciences.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against H.R. 1122, the so-\ncalled partial-birth abortion bill that would outlaw a particular \nabortion procedure, the intact dilation and extraction, sometimes \ncalled intact D I do support a ban on post-viability abortions, if \nit contains important and constitutionally required exceptions to \nprotect the life and health of the woman. I am disappointed that the \nproponents of H.R. 1122 have steadfastly refused to accept any \namendment, no matter how tightly crafted, which would include \nprovisions to protect women's health.\n  I have said repeatedly here on the floor of the Senate, during \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee, and at listening sessions held \nacross the State of Wisconsin that I believe that a law to ban this \ncontroversial procedure could have been enacted last year with one \nsimple addition--an exception that would allow physicians to perform \nthe procedure on women whose health is at risk. Such an exception, in \ncombination with the bill's existing exception to save the life of the \nwoman, is an important and necessary provision. I am sensitive to the \nfears of the bill's proponents that such an exception could prove to be \na major loophole, and I agree that the health exception should be \nnarrow. But it needs to be there.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Supreme Court has clearly ruled \nthat, although States have the right to restrict post-viability \nabortions, exceptions must always be made to protect the life and \nhealth of the mother. Women cannot be required to trade off their well-\nbeing in order to increase the likelihood of fetal survival.\n  Last Thursday, I voted for the bipartisan alternative amendment to \nH.R. 1122 introduced by Senator Daschle and others. I voted for this \namendment because it took a comprehensive approach to banning abortions \non viable fetuses, rather than merely banning a single procedure. In \naddition, Mr. President, this amendment contained the critical, \nconstitutionally necessary exception to protect the life and health of \nthe woman.\n  I believe that the health exception in the Daschle amendment was \nsufficiently narrow to satisfy most reasonable people's concerns about \ncreating a loophole in the law. It would have required a physician to \ncertify that continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the woman's \nlife or risk grievous injury to her physical health. Grievous injury \nwas defined in the amendment as a severely debilitating disease or \nimpairment specifically caused by the pregnancy, or an inability to \nprovide necessary treatment for a life threatening condition.\n  The other side claims that abortion is never necessary to protect a \nwoman's health. But Mr. President, I have met women whose doctors \nbelieved differently. The American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists supports them, and has stated that although the intact \nD procedure is never the only option to save a woman's life or \npreserve her health, it sometimes may be the best or most appropriate \nprocedure, depending on the woman's particular circumstances.\n\n  Members on both sides of this debate can cite respected physicians \nwho will support their positions. But precisely because I am not a \ndoctor, I say again that it is essential to include a health exception \nin any bill we pass. The point is, Mr. President, that there is a \ndispute within the medical community about the necessity for and the \nrisk associated with intact D And that is where it should be \nresolved. It should be women and their doctors, not politicians, who \ndecide which medical procedure is appropriate in those circumstances \nwhere an abortion is performed.\n  If some doctors believe that it is never necessary to perform an \nintact D & E on a viable fetus to protect a woman's health, then they \nwould not recommend such an intervention. But for those physicians who \ndisagree, I do not think it is the place for this Senator or any other \ngovernment entity to override that judgment. A decision regarding which \nmedical intervention is necessary is best decided on by individual \nwomen and their physicians, in light of their individual circumstances.\n  Another equally important aspect of the Daschle alternative amendment \nwas its comprehensive ban on post-viability abortions. Rather than \ntaking the approach of H.R. 1122, which would prohibit a single \nprocedure, regardless of the stage of pregnancy, this amendment took a \nbroader approach. It would have protected women's constitutional right \nto choose an abortion before the fetus is viable. But once the fetus is \ndetermined by a physician to be viable, usually around the 24th week of \npregnancy, this amendment would have outlawed abortion, except in the \nsituations I have already addressed, in which the woman's life is \nthreatened or her health is at risk of grievous injury.\n  This bipartisan alternative amendment struck the right balance \nbetween protecting women's constitutional right to choose abortion and \nthe right of the State to protect future life. It would have protected \na woman's physical health throughout her pregnancy, while insisting \nthat only grievous, medically diagnoseable conditions could justify \naborting a viable fetus. Both fetal viability and women's health would \nhave been determined by the physician's best medical judgment, as they \nmust be. It was a sensible and responsible amendment.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Daschle amendment was rejected. \nThis is particularly disappointing, because if the underlying bill were \nto become law, it would not prevent a single abortion. It would merely \ndeny physicians the right to exercise their best medical judgment, and \nit would force women in critical health situations who would have opted \nto have an intact D to use different, and perhaps less safe, options.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me address a related topic. We all know \nthat\n\n[[Page S4706]]\n\nthis debate has unfortunately been characterized by a great deal of \nmisinformation and distortion of the facts. One particular piece of \nmisinformation has been widely circulated by the proponents of this \nlegislation, and I frankly don't think it is helpful to a truthful \ndebate. It involves the deliberate misinterpretation of a conversation \nthat I had with the junior Senator from Pennsylvania last year.\n  During last year's floor debate over the veto override, Senator \nSantorum and I had a brief exchange on the Senate floor which \nproponents of this legislation have used to suggest that I support \ninfanticide--that is, killing an infant after it has been fully \ndelivered. Obviously, that is untrue. I was answering the question I \nthought I had been asked. I was addressing the issue of who should \ndecide whether the life or health of a woman was at risk.\n  Let me be clear, for the record. Once a child has been born, there is \nno conceivable argument that would suggest a woman's life or health \nwould be at risk any longer. The distortion of our exchange by the \nNational Right to Life Committee and others is the kind of tactic which \nundermines efforts to reach an agreement that would ban late term \nabortions except in the most narrow of circumstances where a woman's \nlife or health is at stake.\n  We are near the end of Senate debate on this issue for the time \nbeing, but I suspect that this issue will arise again when this body \nattempts to override another Presidential veto. As we continue to \nengage in this volatile and emotional debate, both on the Senate floor \nand in the media, I hope we will make an effort to recognize that there \nare strong feelings about this issue on all sides. We should respect \nthese differences, avoid efforts to confuse or trick each other and the \npublic, and maintain a level of debate that reflects the importance of \nascertaining the truth about this issue and finding responses that are \nsensitive and constitutionally sound.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we are now down to 36 minutes of debate \non both sides. And I agreed with the other side that I would take up \nsome of the time to bring down some of our time.\n  I want to bring up a point, discuss a point that I believe is very \nimportant for two reasons: No. 1, I think it is important that Members \nunderstand the issues of constitutionality that have been raised by \nsome about this legislation and whether it is constitutional in light \nof Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton and other decisions on the \nsubject of abortion; and, No. 2, I want to put down a marker for this \npiece of legislation when it does, if it does, any time in the near \nfuture go before the courts.\n  I hope that by the actions of the Senate today, and hopefully the \nactions of the President later on, that he will now decide to sign this \nlegislation in light of all the new evidence that has been presented \nsince his initial veto.\n  I wanted to discuss some of the elements of constitutionality, and in \nso discussing, I would like to read a letter that was sent to Senator \nOrrin Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, by 62 law \nprofessors from universities all over the country, to state to Senator \nHatch their opinion on the constitutionality of the statute.\n  I will remark that this letter was written May 8, prior to the \namendment that we adopted here on the bill today which I believe \ntightens the language up even more and makes it more impregnable to \nconstitutional overruling by the courts.\n  I will read the letter sent to Senator Hatch:\n       Dear Senator: We write to you as law professors in support \n     of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. S 6. We do not write \n     as partisans. We are both Democrats and Republicans, and we \n     are of different minds of various aspects of the abortion \n     issue. We are concerned, however, that baseless legal \n     arguments are being offered to oppose a ban on partial-birth \n     abortions, and we are unanimous in concluding that such a ban \n     is constitutional.\n       We have learned that some Senators are concerned about \n     claims that a ban on second trimester partial-birth \n     abortions, or a ban on third trimester procedures without a \n     ``health'' exception, would be unconstitutional under Roe v. \n     Wade and later abortion decisions.\n       The destruction of human beings who are partially born is, \n     in our judgment, entirely, outside the legal framework \n     established in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. \n     No Supreme Court decision, including these, ever addressed \n     the constitutionally of forbidding the killing of partially \n     born children. In fact. Roe noted explicitly that it did not \n     decide the constitutionality of that part of the Texas law \n     which forbade--and still forbids--killing a child in the \n     process of delivery.\n\n  Continuing on.\n\n       Even should a court in the future decide that a law banning \n     the partial-birth procedure is to be evaluated within the Roe \n     Casey ``abortion'' framework, we believe such a ban would \n     survive legal scrutiny thereunder. The partial-birth \n     procedure entails mechanical cervical dilation, forcing a \n     breech delivery, and exposing a mother to severe bleeding \n     from exposure to shards of her child's crushed skill. Before \n     viability, an abortion restriction is unconstitutional only \n     if it creates a ``undue burden'' on the judicially \n     established right to have an abortion. A targeted ban of a \n     single, maternal-health-endangering procedure cannot \n     constitute such a burden.\n       To the extent of its constitutionally delegated authority, \n     Congress may also ban all forms of abortion after viability, \n     subject to the health and life interests of the mother. Under \n     the most recent Supreme Court decision concerning abortion. \n     Planned Parenthood v. Casey, there is no reason to assume \n     that the Supreme Court would interpret a post-viability \n     health exception to require the government to tolerate a \n     procedure which gives zero weight to the life of a partially-\n     born child an which itself poses severe maternal health \n     risks. Furthermore, according to published medical testimony, \n     including that of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop \n     ``Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to \n     protect a mother's health or future fertility. On the \n     contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to \n     both her immediate health and future fertility.'' Even the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--which \n     opposes the bill--acknolwedges that partial-birth abortion is \n     never the ``only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman.'' Banning this procedure does not \n     compromise a mother's health interests. It protects those \n     interests.\n       In short, while individuals may have ideological or \n     political reasons to oppose banning the partial-birth \n     procedure, those objections should not, in good conscience, \n     be disguised as legal or constitutional in nature.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 8, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: We write to you as law professors in support \n     of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, S. 6.

Those arguments were that because Members \nof Congress were not themselves physicians somehow we were not the \nappropriate people to be addressing issues with respect to partial-\nbirth abortion that fall within the area of medical procedures.\n  As I said at that time, Members of Congress--many of us are not \nfarmers, yet we deal with agriculture issues here on this Senate floor. \nVirtually none of us are nuclear physicists, and yet we deal with \nnuclear issues pertaining to nuclear weapons and issues pertaining to \nthe disposal of nuclear waste, a variety of other highly scientific \nissues. Only a few of us, such as the Presiding Officer, have served in \nthe military in combat, and yet we are asked to be experts with regard \nto issues pertaining to national security.\n  So with this issue as well we are called upon to get the best \ninformation possible and seek to make the best decisions as a result.\n  However, now we actually have some additional information that comes \nfrom the experts who have been referenced in previous debates. The \nendorsement of the American Medical Association of the partial-birth \nabortion bill, combined with the endorsement and strong support of that \nlegislation by the one Member among us who is a physician, I think \nbuttresses better than virtually anything else said during this debate \nthe case that this procedure is never needed for the medical reasons \nthat its advocates have claimed to protect the health of the mother.\n  So in my judgment, Mr. President, we now have an overwhelming case in \nfavor of the passage of this legislation, legislation which will I \nthink help us move in the right direction as we consider a variety of \nother issues that pertain to abortion in the months and years ahead.\n  So I just wanted to once again come to the floor to express my \nsupport for the bill, and to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis many efforts in furtherance of its passage.\n  I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his statement and \nbeing here on the floor to add to the debate and for his terrific work \nthat he has done on this issue in the past now 2 years. I thank the \nSenator very much.\n  Mr. President, I do not have a speaker at this point.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when I suggest the absence of a quorum \nthe time come off the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask what the time situation is between \nSenator Santorum's side and this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania controls 27 \nminutes, 13 seconds, and the Senator on the other side of this argument \ncontrols 27 minutes and 25 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, throughout this debate we have heard both\n\n[[Page S4708]]\n\nsides accuse each other of misstatement and worse. We have heard \ncharges and countercharges. Today, as we close down this argument, I am \nnot going to engage in any of those charges and countercharges. I am \ngoing to talk about what both sides know to be fact.\n  Fact: This Santorum bill will outlaw a procedure known as an intact \ndilation and extraction.\n  Fact: This procedure is used by obstetricians and gynecologists in \ncircumstances where they believe it is in the best interests of the \nwoman, to save her life or to save her health.\n  Fact: Those very same physicians who use this procedure oppose this \nbill. The American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians confirmed \ntoday that they oppose this bill.\n  Fact: This bill is opposed by the California Medical Association.\n  Fact: This bill is opposed by the American Medical Women's \nAssociation, an organization of women physicians.\n  Fact: This bill is opposed by the American Nurses Association.\n  Fact: This bill is opposed by the Society of Physicians for \nReproductive Health.\n  Fact: The American Medical Association endorsed this bill in a 4-day \nreversal of opinion. Having done that, they have taken a position \nagainst the very doctors who handle these procedures.\n  Fact: We have a series of women who have come forward to testify, \nabout their pain, their grief, that this procedure--that would be \noutlawed in the pending Santorum bill saved their lives and their \nhealth, retained their fertility in many cases, and in the opinion of \ntheir doctors was the humane procedure to use for all concerned.\n  Fact: Most of these women, whose photographs I have behind me, most \nof these women who came forward to share their stories are very \nreligious, and many say they are opposed to all abortions, but they \ndecided after all the facts were on the table and after consulting \ntheir families and many doctors--many went to several doctors, in many \ncases five or six, to try and come up with another solution to a \ntragedy--they decided this was their only choice after they consulted \nwith these many doctors, with their families, with their clergy, and \nwith their God.\n  Several went on to have healthy pregnancies. Coreen Costello was \namong them. You can see little Tucker in this photograph, who was born \nafter Coreen underwent the procedure.\n  I will quote from some of the letters we have received from doctors \norganizations against the Santorum bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have all these letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: In light of the slight modifications \n     being proposed to HR 1122, the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban \n     Act of 1997,'' we wanted to take this opportunity to \n     reiterate our opposition to this legislation. Our statement \n     on this issue is attached.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Statement on Intact Dilatation and Extraction\n\n       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit a method of \n     abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth \n     abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has prompted \n     questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to \n     respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague \n     and do not delineate a specific procedure recognized in the \n     medical literature. Moreover, the definitions could be \n     interpreted to include elements of many recognized abortion \n     and operative obstetric techniques.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) believes the intent of such legislative proposals is \n     to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation \n     and Extraction'' (Intact D & X). This procedure has been \n     described as containing all of the following four elements:\n       (1) Deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a \n     sequence of days;\n       (2) Instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling \n     breech;\n       (3) Breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and\n       (4) Partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a \n     living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but \n     otherwise intact fetus.\n       Becuse these elements are part of established obstetric \n     techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four \n     elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an \n     intact D & X.\n       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving \n     the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed \n     after 16 weeks, intact D & X is one method of terminating a \n     pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient, \n     must choose the most appropriate method based upon the \n     patient's individual circumstances.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), only 5.3% of abortions performed in the United States \n     in 1993, the most recent data available, were performed after \n     the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary figure published by \n     the CDC for 1994 is 5.6%. The CDC does not collect data on \n     the specific method of abortion, so it is unknown how many of \n     these were performed using intact D & X. Other data show that \n     second trimester transvaginal instrumental abortion is a safe \n     procedure.\n       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances \n     to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact \n     D & X is one of the methods available in some of these \n     situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no \n     circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above, \n     would be the only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman. An intact D & X, however, may be the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting \n     specific medical practices, such as intact D & X, may outlaw \n     techniques that are critical to the lives and health of \n     American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into \n     medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised, and \n     dangerous.\n       Approved by the Executive Board, January 12, 1997.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  American Medical\n\n\n                                    Women's Association, Inc.,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: On behalf of the American Medical \n     Women's Association (AMWA), I would like to reiterate our \n     opposition to H.R. 1122, the so-called ``Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act of 1997,'' as amended. AMWA does not endorse \n     legislation which interferes with medical decisionmaking, \n     particularly when it fails to consider the health of the \n     woman patient.\n       Our opposition to this legislation is based on the \n     following issues. First, we are gravely concerned that this \n     legislation does not protect a woman's physical and mental \n     health, including future fertility, or consider other \n     pertinent issues such as fetal abnormalities. Second, this \n     legislation would further erode physician-patient autonomy \n     forcing physicians to always avoid legislatively prohibited \n     procedures in medical decisionmaking, including in emergency \n     situations when physicians and patients must base their \n     decisions on the best available information available to \n     them. Third, medical care decisions must be left to the \n     judgment of a woman and her physician without fear of civil \n     action or criminal prosecution. We do not support the levying \n     of civil and criminal penalties for care provided in the best \n     interest of the woman patient.\n       AMWA remains committed to ensuring that physicians retain \n     authority to make medical and surgical care decisions that \n     are in the best interest of their patients given the \n     information available to them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Debra R. Judelson, MD,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to reiterate the \n     opposition of the American Nurses Association to H.R. 1122, \n     the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997'', which is \n     being considered by the Senate this week. This legislation \n     would impose Federal criminal penalties and provide for civil \n     actions against health care providers who perform certain \n     late-term abortions.\n       It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this \n     proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of the \n     federal government into a therapeutic decision that should be \n     left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health care \n     provider. ANA has long supported freedom of choice and \n     equitable access of all women to basic health services, \n     including services related to reproductive health. This \n     legislation would impose a significant barrier to those \n     principles. It is inappropriate for Congress to mandate a \n     course of action for a woman who is already faced with an \n     intensely personal and difficult decision.\n       The American Nurses Association is the only full-service \n     professional organization representing the nation's 2.2 \n     million Registered Nurses through its 53 constituent \n     associations. ANA advances the nursing profession by \n     fostering high standards of nursing\n\n[[Page S4709]]\n\n     practice, promoting the economic and general welfare of \n     nurses in the workplace, projecting a positive and realistic \n     view of nursing, and by lobbying the Congress and regulatory \n     agencies on health care issues affecting nurses and the \n     public.\n       The American Nurses Association appreciates your work in \n     safeguarding women's access to reproductive health care and \n     respectfully urges members of the Senate to vote against H.R. \n     1122.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Geri Marullo, MSN, RN,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The American Medical Women's Association says, in part, \nin a letter to Senator Santorum, ``On behalf of the American Medical \nWomen's Association, I would like to reiterate our opposition to H.R. \n1122.'' This letter is dated today.\n  The organization does not endorse legislation which interferes with \nmedical decisionmaking, particularly when it fails to consider the \nhealth of the woman patient.\n\n       Our opposition is based on the following issues. First, we \n     are gravely concerned that this legislation does not protect \n     a woman's physical and mental health, including future \n     fertility, or consider other pertinent issues such as fetal \n     abnormalities. Second, this legislation would further erode \n     physician-patient autonomy forcing physicians to always avoid \n     legislatively prohibited procedures in medical \n     decisionmaking, including in emergency situations when \n     physicians and patients must base their decisions on the best \n     available information * * *\n\n  That is the American Medical Women's Association letter, in part.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, after \nlearning of the opposition of the AMA, wrote a letter to Senator Lott \ndated yesterday.\n\n       In light of the slight modifications being proposed to H.R. \n     1122, we wanted to take this opportunity to reiterate our \n     opposition to this legislation.\n\n  They attach their statement in which they say:\n\n       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in such circumstances \n     to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact \n     D is one of the methods available in some of these \n     situations * * * and only the doctor, in consultation with \n     the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances \n     can make this decision.\n\n  Is it not interesting, an organization of obstetricians and \ngynecologists oppose this bill and have to plead the case that they are \nthe ones who should make this decision--not Senator Santorum, not \nSenator Boxer, not Senator Coats, not Senator Feinstein, not Senator \nHelms. This is not our job. Our job is tough enough. We do not come \nclose to being doctors. We have one physician in this body, but he is \nnot an obstetrician and gynecologist.\n  A letter dated today from the American Nurses Association:\n\n       I am writing to reiterate the opposition of the American \n     Nurses Association to H.R. 1122 * * *\n       It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this \n     proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of the \n     federal Government into a therapeutic decision that should be \n     left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health-care \n     provider * * *\n\n  The American Nurses Association is the only full-service professional \norganization representing the Nation's 2.2 million registered nurses \nthroughout its 53 constituent associations.\n  Now I want to tell you some of the real life stories that have been \npresented to us by some of the women who have undergone the procedure \nthat this bill would ban. Many have heard these stories before, but \nthey are worth repeating because not every woman who has had this \nprocedure has come forward. These stories are representative of those \nwomen.\n  I talked to you about Coreen Costello pictured here with her newborn \nson, Tucker. She was able to have Tucker because it saved her fertility \nto undergo the procedure that is banned in the Santorum bill. She is a \nregistered Republican, describes herself as very religious. She is \nclear that she and her family do not believe in abortion. When she was \npregnant, she was rushed to the emergency room because her baby was \nhaving seizures, and found out something was seriously wrong with her \nbaby.\n  She named the baby Katherine Grace. This is a woman and family who \nwanted that child desperately. And to hear women like this referred to \nas women who kill their babies to me is an absolute disgrace.\n  The baby had not been able to move for months--not her eyelids, \ntongue, nor her lips. Her chest cavity was unable to rise and fall for \nair, and her lungs and chest were left severely undeveloped almost to \nthe point of nonexisting. Her vital organs were atrophied. The doctor \ntold Coreen and her husband that the baby would not survive, and they \nrecommended terminating the pregnancy. To Coreen and to Jim, this was \nnot an option. Coreen wanted to go into labor naturally. She wanted her \nbaby born on God's time and did not want to interfere. The family spent \n2 weeks going from expert to expert.\n  Again, I have heard my colleagues on more than one occasion demean \nthese women, saying, ``Well, if only they had checked, they would have \nfound another option.'' There are always other options, say my \ncolleagues who don't know anything about medicine.\n  Coreen and her family were told they couldn't consider inducing \nlabor. They considered a caesarean section. But the doctors were \nadamant that the risks to her health and her life were too great.\n  Then Coreen finally said, ``There was no reason to risk leaving my \ntwo children motherless if there was no hope of saving Katherine \nGrace.''\n  My colleagues, women like Coreen Costello deserve our love and \ndeserve our support. They don't deserve the kind of treatment they \nwould get if this bill becomes law. They have come forward. They were \nsaved. But they are coming forward to spare other families the tragedy \nthey went through.\n  Coreen writes to us, ``The birth of Tucker would not have been \npossible without this procedure. Please give other women and their \nfamilies this chance.\n  ``Let us deal with our tragedies without any unnecessary interference \nfrom our Government. Leave us with our God. Leave us with our families \nand our trusted medical experts.''\n  I could go on. I will show you a picture of Vikki Stella, a mother of \ntwo. She went through a very similar case. She tried in every way to \nsave her baby, but was told that her life was at risk if she didn't use \nthis procedure. The surgery preserved her fertility.\n  Here she is shown with her son Nicholas. She calls him our darling \nson, Nicholas, who was born in 1995. This was after she had undergone \nthe procedure that the Santorum bill seeks to outlaw.\n  So the procedure saved Vikki's life. It preserved her family. Vikki's \nsituation was heart-wrenching.\n  Mothers and fathers need to be able to make medical decisions like \nthat with their God and with their doctors, not with Senators. We don't \nbelong in that room.\n  We have offered alternatives, alternatives that go to the heart of \nanother matter, which is the decision Roe v. Wade that is the law of \nthe land, which basically says in the early stages of a pregnancy a \nwoman has the right to choose and the State does not have a right to \ninterfere. But after viability, Roe says the State does have a right to \ninterfere. And I agree with that.\n  Senator Feinstein and I offered an alternative that would have said \nno abortion after viability. But we make two exceptions, consistent \nwith compassion, consistent with caring, consistent with Roe and the \nCourt cases. We say no abortion after viability except to preserve the \nlife of the mother or to spare her serious adverse health consequences.\n  My colleagues on the other side have said, ``Senator Boxer and \nSenator Feinstein believe in abortion on demand.'' They have misstated \nour position day in and day out. What we are saying is there should be \nabsolutely no abortion after viability except to save the life and the \nhealth of the woman. That is the option that would be endorsed, I \nthink, by the majority of the American people. The bill that is before \nus doesn't do anything about late-term abortion. It deals with one \nprocedure, a procedure that in fact doctors say is necessary to save \nthe life and the health of a woman.\n  I would like to read parts of an opinion piece that appeared in the \nLos Angeles Times written by Ellen Goodman.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4710]]\n\n                      [From the Los Angeles Times]\n\n               Congress Can't Legislate Maternal Heroism\n\n                           (By Ellen Goodman)\n\n       You cannot hear it in the cacophony of outraged voices \n     arguing about the so-called partial-birth abortion ban. But \n     it is there. The theme song of the abortion controversy is \n     being repeated, the soundtrack replayed:\n       Just how much are we willing to require of a woman for the \n     sake of having a baby? Just how much can the government force \n     a woman to sacrifice for a fetus?\n       The Senate debate has not really been about banning an \n     abortion method. It's been about permitting exceptions to \n     that ban. Senators led by Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum have \n     refused to allow an exception even to protect the woman from \n     serious harm to her health. President Clinton has refused to \n     sign a bill without it.\n       So the push for a veto-proof majority to ban this rare \n     procedure has drawn a line as clear as possible in this \n     unrelenting and murky struggle. A line around a woman's \n     health.\n       From the beginning abortion opponents have said that \n     ``health'' is nothing but a loophole for women who would \n     abort a pregnancy to fit into a prom dress. But pro-choice \n     supporters have countered with real women whose bodies were \n     at serious risk. Underlying it all has been the issue of \n     women and sacrifice.\n       Last week, pro-lifer Kristi S. Hamrick argued against any \n     exception, saying, ``Any woman who has ever been pregnant can \n     tell you that every pregnancy carries potential risk.'' \n     Indeed, women once died in pregnancy and childbirth with \n     appalling frequency.\n       But while the focus is on health, is it fair to ask whether \n     the law can force pregnant women to sacrifice more for \n     ``unborn children'' than it can force parents to sacrifice \n     for those who are born?\n       Imagine a different bill going through Congress. This one \n     requires mothers and fathers to give up a kidney for their \n     child. Or maybe it just allows the government to extract bone \n     marrow against their will for an ailing son or daughter.\n       If such a bill got to the Senate floor, would Santorum \n     decry ``the selfishness, the individual self-centeredness'' \n     of its opponents? Surely, we expect a parent to eagerly \n     exchange bone marrow for a child's life. But we would not \n     assume the state's right to go in and take it.\n       ``No case has ever been upheld that says you can intrude on \n     the body of a genetic parent to protect a born child,'' says \n     Eileen McDonagh, who raises such matters in a provocative \n     book, ``Breaking the Abortion Deadlock.'' Indeed, in \n     Illinois, a court ruled that the law could not even require a \n     blood test to see if a relative could be a potential donor.\n       Can the law then require a woman to suffer ``serious health \n     effects.'' for the sake of a fetus? A central question in the \n     abortion debate, says McDonagh, is: ``What are the means the \n     state can use to protect the fetus? One benchmark is to ask \n     what the means are the state can use to protect a born \n     child.''\n       The issue is government intrusion: who decides. How much \n     more serious is this decision when we are talking, not about \n     extracting bone marrow, but about losing a uterus or a \n     kidney? Is it up to Congress to overrule the doctor? To \n     overrule the ``selfish'' woman defending her health?\n       An outraged Santorum screamed that this procedure ``is \n     killing a little baby that hasn't hurt anybody!'' But the \n     whole point of a vote about a health exception is that this \n     fetus--however unintentionally, well or deformed--is hurting \n     someone: the pregnant woman.\n       This is a tough-minded argument about those few pregnancies \n     that have gone most tragically awry. Pregnancy is risky. Many \n     women embrace heroic procedures to have children.\n       But the bill is not really about banning one procedure. If \n     dilation and extraction is the first method banned without \n     exceptions, it won't be the last. The goals of abortion \n     opponents are unequivocal.\n       Not was the losing bill by Democrat Tom Daschle a true \n     ``compromise.'' Allowing late abortions for physical, \n     ``real'' health reasons but not mental health? What would \n     that distinction mean to a woman forced to carry an \n     anencephalic (brainless) baby to term?\n       We already have compromises. The Supreme Court decisions \n     weigh the interests of the woman with those of the developing \n     fetus. The law allows states to severely limit abortion after \n     viability. But at no point does it give the government the \n     right to seriously damage a woman's health to protect a \n     fetus.\n       This is at the primal heart of the matter. No Congress can \n     be allowed to legislate a new flock of sacrificial women.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Ellen Goodman writes:\n\n       The Senate debate has not really been about banning an \n     abortion method. It's been about permitting exception to that \n     ban. Senators led by Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum have \n     refused to allow an exception even to protect the woman from \n     serious harm to her health. * * *\n       Is it up to Congress to overrule the doctor? To overrule \n     the ``selfish'' woman defending her health?\n\n  The bill is not really about banning a procedure. If dilation and \nextraction is the first method banned, without exception it won't be \nthe last. The goals of abortion opponents are unequivocal. And, indeed, \nin, I thought, a good debate that the Senator from Pennsylvania and I \nhad on Sunday, I think he was very straightforward about that. The \nSenators who have been speaking on the other side of the aisle on this \nsubject all would tell you they are against all abortions from the \nfirst moment of a pregnancy.\n  Ellen Goodman writes:\n\n       We already have compromises. The Supreme Court decisions \n     weigh the interests of the woman with those of the developing \n     fetus. The law allows states to severely limit abortion after \n     viability. But at no point does it give the government the \n     right to seriously damage a woman's health to protect a \n     fetus.\n       This is at the primal heart of the matter.\n\n  She concludes:\n\n       No Congress can be allowed to legislate a new flock of \n     sacrificial women.\n\n  What does she mean, sacrificial women? That is, women who will be \nsacrificed because of politics, because of laws that are made right \nhere. And when abortion was illegal, women died.\n  There are those of us who will stand here as long as it takes to make \nsure we don't go back to those dark days. This bill should not be about \npolitics, though, sadly, it might turn out to be. This bill should not \nbe about 30-second misleading commercials, though, sadly, it might turn \nout to be. This bill should not be about fear, fear of doing the right \nthing, though, sadly, it might turn out to be.\n  What this should be about is at least the basic bottom line that we \nshould keep in mind when we pass any legislation. And that bottom line \nshould always be do no harm. Do no harm. Yet, we are told by physicians \nthat this bill does harm. It has no exception for physicians who \nbelieve the banned procedure is in the best interests of the woman for \nher very survival and for her very health.\n  My colleagues, please do not relegate women to a status that says \ntheir life and their health do not matter. Please look inside your \nhearts. Ask yourself how you would feel if your daughter was told that \nthe safest procedure in a pregnancy turned tragically wrong was an \nintact D, and, yet, the doctor fearing jail refused to use it. Look \nin your heart. Think about how you would feel. You would drop to your \nknees. You would pray to God that the doctor could use the option that \nwas safe, that would save the life and the health of your daughter. And \nthen, if this bill was the law, you would go to court to defend that \ndoctor. But the rules would be stacked against him or her.\n  Just read this bill.\n  My colleagues, that is the wrong way to go. These women have been \nsaved because this Congress didn't outlaw the procedure that was \nnecessary to save their lives and their health.\n  There will be other women who look like this, who have families like \nthis, who might be, as Ellen Goodman said, sacrificed because of \npolitics. I say that we should save these women who are relying on us \nto protect them.\n  This isn't about them versus their babies. They wanted their babies. \nThey desperately wanted their babies. But in circumstances that no one \nseemed able to predict, in rare circumstances, in tragic circumstances, \nthey needed an intact D\n  We are not doctors--not even close. Every speaker I have heard--I may \nbe wrong on this--on the side of the Santorum bill has been a man. \nAgain, I may be wrong on this. But I am 99 percent sure that every one \nof them would support outlawing all abortions. They do not know what it \nis like to find yourself in a desperate situation as a woman--as a \nwoman. Situations like Vikki's or Coreen's or Eileen's, or any of the \nwomen who were told they needed an intact D to save their lives or \ntheir health.\n\n  Mr. President, I have a letter dated today from these women I have \nbeen talking about. They have listened to this debate. This is what \nthey say:\n\n       Please don't forget us, and the stories that brought us to \n     Washington to meet with so many of you over the last two \n     years. We are just a sampling of the women and families who \n     have had very wanted pregnancies go wrong, and whose doctors \n     have wept with us as they explained the options that could \n     help us maintain our health and our fertility. We know the \n     truth about the so-called ``partial-birth abortions'' that \n     you debate in Washington, because we needed the surgery that \n     doctors call intact dilation and evacuation. * * *\n       The AMA endorsement of this legislation, and the \n     superficial changes added today do\n\n[[Page S4711]]\n\n     not change the fact that this ban still contains no provision \n     to protect the health of women like us.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter in its \nentirety be printed in the Record, along with the following letter from \nthe California Medical Association, which says, in part, ``The \nCalifornia Medical Association is opposed to this bill and is saddened \nthat the debate appeals to the emotive, rather than the reasoning, \nsegment of America.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 20, 1997.\n       Dear Senators: Please don't forget us, and the stories that \n     brought us to Washington to meet with so many of you over the \n     last two years. We are just a sampling of the women and \n     families who have had very wanted pregnancies go wrong, and \n     whose doctors have wept with us as they explained the options \n     that could help us maintain our health and our fertility. We \n     know the truth about the so-called ``partial birth \n     abortions'' that you debate in Washington, because we needed \n     the surgery that doctors call intact dilation and evacuation.\n       We and our families stood with President Clinton last year \n     when he vetoed similar legislation that would have banned the \n     surgery that we needed. This ban would have torn families \n     apart, robbing us of the ability to make the most private and \n     personal decisions about our own well-being. It would have \n     subjected women like us to unwarranted medical risks and even \n     greater heartbreak than the loss of our precious babies had \n     already caused. President Clinton did the right thing when he \n     courageously vetoed this legislation and protected our health \n     and that of the women who come after us. These are decisions \n     that can only be made by a woman in consultation with her \n     family and her doctor. Congress can't begin to know what's \n     best for us as we face our own personal tragedies.\n       As you consider your vote on HR1122, we hope that you will \n     take a few moments to remember us, and to recall that this is \n     a bill that affects real people--American women and their \n     families. Please don't compound the tragedies of families \n     like ours. The AMA endorsement of this legislation, and the \n     superficial changes added today do not change the fact that \n     this ban still contains no provision to protect the health of \n     the women like us.\n       Please vote ``no'' on HR1122.\n           Sincerely,\n     Claudia Crown Ades,\n     Coreen Costello,\n     Mary-Dorothy Line,\n     Vikki Stella,\n     Tammy Watts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               California Medical Association,\n\n                                     Sacramento, CA, May 20, 1997.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We have reviewed the amendments to HR \n     1122 and believe that they make no substantive changes to the \n     legislation. While the debate over late-term abortion is \n     painful, both within the medical community and the general \n     citizenry, we believe these decisions must be left to \n     physicians and patients . . . acting together.\n       While late-term abortions may have occurred inappropriately \n     in some instances, they have also saved women's lives and the \n     health and well-being of many American families. In a society \n     where values are assaulted on every side . . . and technology \n     often seems to replace human relationship . . . the bond \n     between healer and patient is ever more important. Passage of \n     HR 1122 would be one more step in eroding that relationship. \n     The California Medical Association is opposed to this bill \n     and is saddened the debate appeals to the emotive, rather \n     than the reasoning, segment of America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Rolland C. Lowe, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say that we need to listen to these \nwomen. I say that we need to listen to these doctors. I say that the \ndoctors who work with this every day of their lives know best. And I \nhope we will vote against the Santorum bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time on this side.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Indiana, who \nhas done terrific work on this issue which deals with protecting \nchildren. He has been an outstanding spokesperson for a long time in \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his \nkind words. The real credit goes to the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis effective and unrelenting advocacy on behalf of life. The Senator \nhas expressed in many, many ways and provided us with many, many facts \nthat I think gives all of us pause and that has given us a reason to \ngive great deliberation and consideration to this most fundamental of \nissues.\n  I also think it is appropriate to mention the efforts of Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire who had the courage to come to this floor some \ntime ago and introduce the Senate to a procedure none of us had ever \nheard of. He was vilified on this floor and in the press. He had the \ncourage to raise an issue that many didn't want to talk about. We have \ncome a long way since that day when Senator Smith walked onto this \nfloor.\n  We are close. And we clearly have a majority in both the House and \nthe Senate now in favor of banning partial-birth abortion. We have more \nthan a two-thirds majority necessary to override a Presidential veto in \nthe House, and we are hopeful that we can achieve that level today. We \nwill know at 2:15 this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I think it is most appropriate that we are debating \nthis issue on the Senate floor because we are talking about one of the \nmost fundamental, if not the most fundamental, of all issues that we \ndebate on this floor. That is the meaning of life itself. It is a right \nthat is guaranteed or enunciated in our Declaration of Independence. It \nis labeled an inalienable right, meaning it is not created by \ngovernment; it is not taken away by government; it is not the purview \nof government. It is an inalienable right, according to our Founding \nFathers, the right to life being the very first enunciated, written--\ninalienable right, part of the very fabric of the foundation of this \nsociety, not endowed by government but endowed by the Creator. Over the \n200-years-plus history of this country and of this Congress, we have \nhad monumental civil rights debates, appropriate debates on the meaning \nof inclusion in the American experiment of what it means to be part of \nthis greatest in all experiments in human history, of democracy, of \nbeing part of a system which allows each individual the dignity of \nbeing part, an equal part, of this democracy.\n  Great civil rights debates have taken place in this Chamber, the \ndebates about allowing women equal opportunities, equal rights to vote, \nequal rights to participate in society, the rights of handicapped, \nreaching out and providing within the American experiment to include \nthem, the weakest of our society, the most disadvantaged of our \nsociety. And now we come to the weakest of all, now we come to the most \ndisadvantaged of all, those who have no voice of their own, those who \nhave no political action committee, no caucus, no ability to march, to \nspeak for themselves, but those who have every right to be included in \nthis great experiment in democracy.\n  I do not know what the vote count is going to be this afternoon. I am \nobviously hoping it will exceed the 67 votes needed to overcome the \nPresident's intransigence on this issue, the President who pledged to \nthe American people and to the Congress that he wanted abortion to be \nsafe, legal and rare, the President who is confronted with the \ninformation that this is not a rare procedure, that this is a procedure \nthat is done thousands and thousands of times mostly for the \nconvenience not of the woman but of the abortionist, a procedure that \nis more convenient for the abortionist than it is recognizing concerns \nof women and certainly the rights of the child to live.\n  I do not know what that vote count is going to be, but win or lose, \nwe have fundamentally altered the nature of this debate. Win or lose, \nwe are now debating the meaning of life and the right to life in this \nsociety, and that is where the debate should have been centered and \nwhere the debate needs to be centered.\n  I am pleased that we have finally arrived at this point. I do not \nquestion the motives of other Members, those who vote for or those who \nvote against. That is why I did not question the motives of the \nminority leader when he stated that he thought we ought to engage in \nthe debate on the viability of the child. It advances the debate one \nway or another. Some are skeptical about his efforts, about his \namendment. I do not think it is an appropriate amendment because I \nthought the exceptions allowing the decision to be in the hands of the \nabortionist himself or herself was not appropriate to defining the \nright to life. But by placing in the Chamber the question of viability, \nwe will now center the debate on\n\n[[Page S4712]]\n\nwhat is the meaning of life. When does life begin? What are the rights \nof that life as well as the rights of the woman? So I am pleased that \nwe have arrived at this point. As I said, win or lose, we are now \nfocusing the debate where it ought to be.\n  Several years ago, Justice O'Connor made the statement that Roe \nversus Wade, the decision of the Court in Roe versus Wade, was on a \ncollision course with medical science because medical science was \ndemonstrating to us the viability of life at earlier and earlier ages. \nSonograms, listening to heart beats, and the ability to perform fetal \nresearch, the protection of the infant in the mother's womb, and the \nrights of that infant in cases of negligence, in cases of attempted \nmurder, in a whole number of areas of the law have demonstrated to us \nthat there is a life with a heart beating within the womb of that \nmother, and that life deserves our consideration in terms of the \nprotections that we give it.\n  Recently there has been a lot of talk about new discoveries of brain \nactivity and a lot of focus on that, focus brought to this floor by \nthose who say we must make sure we give children ages zero to 3 the \nright opportunities so that their brain can develop in ways that \nmedical science tells us it needs to develop to a fully competent human \nbeing. We need to ensure that that takes place.\n  What medical science is also telling us and what we have not \ndiscussed on this floor is that we now know that brain activity exists \nmuch earlier than we thought. Never has the conflict between science \nand abortion been more dramatic than in the recent discoveries about \nthe science of the brain. We know that a human embryo at 10 or 12 weeks \nafter conception has astonishing brain activity. We know that by the \nfifth month of gestation the brain is fully wired, as the scientists \nsay, with the connections between neurons largely complete. Astounding \nevidence. We know that these neurons are firing with impressive \ncomplexity once a minute, shaping the brain itself, and we know that \nwhen this process is interrupted by malnutrition or drug abuse or a \nvirus, the results can follow a child its entire life, and we know that \na child may be born knowing the distinctive sound of its mother's and \nfather's voices. In short, our mental development, not just our \nphysical development, the mental development, the process of learning \nbegins well before birth.\n\n  If we look at the evidence--not the rhetoric, not the anecdotes, but \nthe evidence, the facts--it is increasingly evident that human life is \na continuum in which birth is really not a particularly decisive \nmoment. An essential part of who each of us is, who we are, including \nthe shape of our minds, is determined even before we are born. Even \nthose who do not call themselves pro-life have to find this a troubling \nexperience and troubling knowledge. They have to because abortion not \nonly destroys the body; it extinguishes a complex, developed mind. This \npoint, I think, has particular relevance in this debate on partial-\nbirth abortion because the very procedure itself destroys the brain. \nYes, it kills the body, but when we understand the complexity of that \nbrain, when we understand the development of that brain, mostly fully \nwired at the point of termination, we have to understand that plunging \na scissors into the back of that skull and sucking out the brain has \nenormous implications.\n  Mr. President, I ask for just 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. So here we are on this floor debating something that is \nvery much in the role of the Senate. If it is not in the role of a \nSenator to make moral judgments, then we might as well close the place \nup because there is very little else to do. Most of what we do here has \nmoral implications. There are some things that do not, but most things \ndo. If that is the case, then I think a lot of people are going to have \nto remove their names from sponsorship of legislation that mandates \nmammograms for women under a certain age. Some Senators are going to \nhave to remove their names from support for laws that require 48-hour \nhospital stays after birth. Some Senators are going to have to remove \ntheir support for laws and legislation that condemns genital \nmutilation. Are those not medical procedures? So if we are going to \nleave all that to the world outside of this Chamber, I think a lot of \nSenators are going to have to rethink their positions on a lot of \nissues.\n  I also think it is inappropriate to suggest that this is some kind of \nmale conspiracy against women. I think when the vote is taken today, we \nwill see women voting to terminate this procedure. I think when the \npolls are taken and women are addressed throughout our society, we will \nfind there are as many women in opposition to this procedure and in \nabhorrence of this procedure as there are men.\n  It is also wrong to say that this is only some kind of a pro-life \nSenate movement. There are a number of people here who have openly \nstated they are pro-choice Senators but are voting to ban this \nprocedure. So let us tone down the accusations and let us deal with the \nfacts.\n  I think the facts and medical science that have been presented to us \nso outstandingly by the Senator from Pennsylvania need to be carefully \nconsidered by each and every one of us. A civil right to the weakest \namong us, the inalienable right to life as enunciated in the most \nfundamental of all the documents of democracy, our Declaration of \nIndependence, can be honored here today by our vote to ban this \nprocedure.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania particularly for \nhis outstanding work and yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if you will notify me when I have 4 \nminutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes and will be \nnotified by the Chair when 4 minutes are remaining.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Indiana for \nhis excellent work. I want to address a couple issues the Senator from \nCalifornia raised.\n  One, she mentioned support of the American College of Gynecologists. \nI have 50 letters here from fellows of that organization who are \noutraged at the organization for the position they have taken. We have \na group of over 500 obstetricians and gynecologists who have signed on \nsaying they are supporting the ban on partial-birth abortions and are \nalso outraged at the position taken by the board here in Washington \nthat was not voted on by the general membership.\n  So I just suggest that this, as the Senator from California noted but \nI want to reemphasize, is not speaking for all physicians, certainly \nnot all obstetricians and gynecologists, because we have read plenty of \nstatements from them as to why this procedure is never medically \nnecessary.\n\n  She went through her facts. Let me tell you the first fact. This is \nnot about abortion. This is about infanticide. This is about taking a \nbaby that is born, in the process of being born, four-fifths outside of \nthe mother, moving outside of the mother and killing that baby. We can \ntalk about abortion. I know the Senator likes to get it back to the \nissue of abortion. The reason we believe, as I just read a letter from \n62 law professors, it is not governed by Roe versus Wade is because the \nbaby now has rights. It is being born. So do not keep focusing back on \nthis issue of abortion. This is about infanticide.\n  If the Senate today does not muster up the moral courage for 67 \nvotes, it will be validating infanticide--not the woman's right to \nchoose, infanticide.\n  As one of the listed facts, the Senator from California said the fact \nis this procedure is done by obstetricians and gynecologists acting in \nthe best interests of the mother to save her life or health. That is \nnot a fact, and we all know that. Even people who support the position \nof the Senator from California know that is not a fact, admit it is not \na fact. It is very difficult to get engaged in a real debate when the \nother side keeps using misinformation about what is going on here.\n  Ron Fitzsimmons, the director of an association of 200 clinics, said \nthat 90 percent of the abortions done, partial-birth abortions done, \nare done on healthy mothers and healthy babies in the 5th and 6th \nmonths of pregnancy for birth control reasons.\n\n[[Page S4713]]\n\n  Now, that is not, as the Senator from California suggested, a \nprocedure done by obstetricians and gynecologists.\n  Let me make a parenthetical remark there. This procedure was not \ninvented by an obstetrician or gynecologist. It was invented by a \nfamily practitioner who does abortions. Obstetricians and gynecologists \ndo not do this procedure. This is not done in hospitals. It is done in \nclinics, not by, in many cases, obstetricians and gynecologists. So to \nsuggest that this procedure is done by obstetricians and gynecologists \nacting in the best interests of the mother and that's the fact is not \nin fact the case.\n  This is done by abortionists--some of whom are obstetricians, many of \nwhom are not--who perform in clinics, not in hospitals, who do it on \nhealthy mothers and healthy babies. Those are the facts. That is why \nthis is such a troubling debate today. That is why we have seen the \nmovement across this country and in the Senate today, because the \nalleged facts that the Senator from California was offering again as \nthe truth muddy the waters a little bit. But now we know what the real \ntruth is from people who support her position. But yet we keep hearing \nthese repeated allegations that have no basis in reality anymore, but \nthey still find themselves on the Senate floor as a defense for an \nindefensible procedure, and this procedure is indefensible.\n  Mr. President, we have heard comments about women who suffered with a \npregnancy that had gone tragic. Let me first say that my heart goes out \nto each and every one of the people whose picture we have seen \ndisplayed on the floor of the Senate. I know, I know personally the \ndifficulty that these families face with a child that you hoped for and \ndreamed for and had something go wrong; that a life that you had hoped \nto be with and to mother and father would be cut short. I know what \nthey went through.\n  I am just suggesting that the fact that the women came to testify, \nnot the doctors, tells you something about the medical reality of what \noccurred. You have not seen any of these doctors who did these \nprocedures come to the U.S. Senate, the House, or anyplace in a public \narena and talk about what they did, because they know that they would \nnot stand the light of day in front of any peer review. In fact, none \nof these procedures is peer reviewed. None of them is peer reviewed. \nNone of these cases has been peer reviewed, none of them. They would \nnot open up to any discussion by other experts in the field as to \nwhether they acted correctly.\n  That is the problem, you see. We hide behind the emotion, and it is \nreal, tragic, and I empathize, but we are hiding behind emotion when we \nare talking about the life and death of little babies. We owe it to \nthem, we owe it to these mothers who are dealing with these tragic \nsituations today to talk about the facts, to let the light shine in as \nto what are really the options, what is really necessary, not to hide \nbehind pictures and emotional pleas that have no basis in medical fact, \nin medical practice.\n  I will give you a counterexample. This is a little baby girl, named \nDonna Joy Watts, who was born with hydrocephaly, the same condition \nthat some of the children of the people Senator Boxer shared had. Her \nmother and father, Lori and Donny Watts, refused to abort this child. \nThe genetics counselor and the obstetrician suggested a partial-birth \nabortion for this little baby. They said she couldn't survive, she \nwouldn't live. She had to go to four hospitals--four places--just to \nget this baby delivered. They wouldn't deliver her baby.\n  We worry so much about the right to choose. How about the right to \nchoose life, to give your baby a chance? Well, Donny and Lori fought \nfor this chance. This baby was born finally by cesarean section. And, \nby the way, the issue of future fertility, we hear that a lot, Lori and \nDonny now have another little baby. But this little baby was born and \nhooked up to IV's to give hydration to, water to, and for 3 days. These \ndoctors, who will never come to testify before the Congress, all these \ndoctors who recommend abortion, who never come to justify before a peer \nreview panel what they do, called this little baby lying there \nbreathing a fetus for 3 days. Do you want to know what some of the \nobstetricians and gynecologists think about little babies who are just \nnot perfect? They called this baby a fetus 3 days after it was born. It \nis not a fetus, it is a baby. What they wanted to do was kill this baby \nby stabbing her in the base of her skull and suctioning her brains out, \nand Lori and Donny said no.\n\n  Through a lot of hard work, a lot of pain, a lot of suffering, a lot \nof forcing them to treat her daughter because they wouldn't treat her \nfor 3 days, 5\\1/2\\ years later, this is little Donna Joy Watts, who is \nin my office right now. She would have been up in the gallery of the \nSenate were it not for the objection of the Senator from California \nprohibiting her from being there. She is in my office and watching this \ndebate. She is watching to see whether the U.S. Senate is going to \nallow other doctors to misinform their mommies and daddies so we won't \nhave other little Donna Joy Wattses to be with us, to ennoble us, to \ngive us pride in our culture and in our civilization, that we care even \nfor those who are like little Donna Joy--who runs around and plays in \nmy office, who colors with my kids--but just didn't have the chance.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes are reserved. Who seeks time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask that I be allotted such time as \nI may consume in the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes is remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I myself find this a sad day. In a sense, it is a \nwatershed debate, and I very much fear it is the first major \nlegislative thrust to set this Nation back 30 years with respect to \nfreedom of choice.\n  I am going to speak about what freedom of choice really means. \nEssentially, to me it means that Government will not become involved in \nthese most intimate decisions that a woman has to make, not become \ninvolved in legislating a woman's reproductive system, what she must \ndo, when she must do it, and how she must do it, but that government \nwill essentially leave those intimate decisions to the physician, to a \nwoman, to her faith, and to medicine. And here we have the Congress of \nthe United States essentially saying that every woman in this country \nwho may find out in her third trimester that she has a horribly, \nseverely deformed child with anomalies incompatible with life, and if \nthat child can be born, even if it is a major threat to her health, she \nmust deliver that child.\n  Unfortunately, no Member of this body is going to be present, no \nMember of this body is going to hold that mother's hand and tell her \nthat it is OK if she jeopardizes her health perhaps for the rest of her \nlife. No Member of this Congress is going to be present in that \ndelivery room and see a child who is incompatible with life, a baby \nthat may not have a brain, a baby that may have a brain outside the \nhead or other major physical anomalies. No Member of this Congress will \nbe there to see that child delivered to live an hour, 6 hours, a day, 4 \ndays and then die, and the woman's health may be seriously, adversely \nharmed in a major way for the rest of her life. No one will be there. \nNo one will say, ``I'm so sorry, I didn't know about you when I cast \nthis vote.''\n  We are all accustomed to legislating, and when we legislate, we \nlegislate for a majority, not for the exception. We legislate with some \nknowledge, or should, of what we are doing. But I think in this case, \nit is a very skewed knowledge. It is based on a case that the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania put forward of a young woman \nwho I believe could have and would have been born in any event and \nsaying that this one case typifies all mothers that we are talking \nabout. In fact, it doesn't.\n  I must express my profound dismay. My father was chief of surgery at \nthe University of California Medical Center. My husband, Bert \nFeinstein, was a distinguished neurosurgeon. And all my life, I have \nlived in a medical family. As I read the AMA's letter, essentially what \nthey are doing is providing some protection for doctors, but they are \ndoing nothing to see that a woman's health is protected, and I feel \nvery badly about that. Both my husband and my father were members of \nthe American Medical Association.\n\n[[Page S4714]]\n\n  I take some heart in letters from the California Medical Association \nwhich indicate their opposition to this legislation and clearly state \nthat they believe the amended legislation before us today falls very \nshort of the mark. They indicate their strong opposition to this bill. \nI ask unanimous consent to include in the Record two letters I received \nfrom the California Medical Association.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               California Medical Association,\n\n                                  San Francisco, CA, May 20, 1997.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We have reviewed the amendments to \n     HR 1122 and believe that they make no substantive changes to \n     the legislation. While the debate over late-term abortion is \n     painful, both within the medical community and the general \n     citizenry, we believe these decisions must be left to \n     physicians and patients . . . acting together.\n       While late-term abortions may have occurred inappropriately \n     in some instances, they have also saved women's lives and the \n     health and well-being of many American families. In a society \n     where values are assaulted on every side . . . the bond \n     between healer and patient is ever more important. Passages \n     of HR 1122 would be one more step in eroding that \n     relationship. The California Medical Association is opposed \n     to this bill and is saddened the debate appeals to the \n     emotive, rather than the reasoning, segment of America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Roland C. Lowe, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               California Medical Association,\n\n                                  San Francisco, CA, May 14, 1997.\n\n     Re opposition to H.R. 1122.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The California Medical Association \n     is writing to express its strong opposition to Congressional \n     intrusion into the physician-patient relationship, as \n     exemplified by the above-referenced bill, which would ban \n     ``partial-birth abortions.'' We believe that it is wholly \n     inappropriate for a legislature to make decisions which \n     prevent physicians from providing appropriate medical care to \n     their patients. Physicians must be allowed to exercise their \n     professional judgment when determining which treatment or \n     procedure will best serve their patients' medical needs.\n       The obstetricians and gynecologists have already eloquently \n     expressed the medical justifications for this procedure in \n     rare but very real circumstances. CMA certainly does not \n     advocate the performance of elective abortions in the last \n     stage of pregnancy. However, when serious fetal anomalies are \n     discovered late in a pregnancy, or the pregnant woman \n     develops a life-threatening medical condition that is \n     inconsistent with continuation of the pregnancy, abortion--\n     however heart-wrenching--may be medically necessary.\n       CMA respects the concern that performing this type of \n     abortion procedure late in a pregnancy is a very serious \n     matter. However, political concerns and religious beliefs \n     should not be permitted to take precedence over the health \n     and safety of patients. CMA opposes any legislation, state or \n     federal, that denies a pregnant woman and her physician the \n     ability to make medically appropriate decisions about the \n     course of her medical care. The determination of the medical \n     need for, and effectiveness of, particular medical procedures \n     must be left to the medical profession, to be reflected in \n     the standard of care. It would set a very undesirable \n     precedent if Congress were by legislative fiat to decide such \n     matters. The legislative process is ill-suited to evaluate \n     complex medical procedures whose importance may vary with a \n     particular patient's case and with the state of scientific \n     knowledge.\n       CMA urges you to defeat this bill. Many of the patients who \n     would seek the procedure are already in great personal \n     turmoil. Their physical and emotional trauma should not be \n     compounded by an oppressive law that is devoid of scientific \n     justification.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Rolland C. Lowe,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe the California Medical \nAssociation still represents the largest group of physicians anywhere \nin this Nation. No one seems to care about the Constitution, that this \nbill constitutes a direct challenge to the Roe versus Wade Supreme \nCourt decision. The Supreme Court held that in Roe, a woman has a \nconstitutional right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. It \nset for the different trimesters, some specific limitations on that \nright, that before viability, abortion cannot be banned; after \nviability, the Government can prohibit abortion, except when necessary \nto protect a woman's life or health.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This bill, the bill before us, says the woman's \nhealth doesn't matter, it is of no consideration. I must tell you, to \nme a woman's health matters. It should be of direct consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So I will vote no on this bill, and I really regret \nthat this day is upon us. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just suggest the American Medical \nAssociation and the other hundreds of doctors understand the point that \nseems to elude the Members of this Chamber. By outlawing this procedure \nthey are, in fact, protecting the health of the mother, because this is \nan unhealthy procedure, this is a dangerous procedure. This procedure, \nas said by over 500 physicians ``is never medically necessary, in order \nto preserve a woman's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately \nkill an unborn child in the second and third trimester, and certainly \nnot by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her to \ndeath.''\n  I will quote another obstetrician/gynecologist, Dr. Camilla Hersh:\n\n       Any proponent of such a dangerous procedure is at least \n     seriously misinformed about medical reality or at worst so \n     consumed by narrow minded ``abortion-at-any-cost'' activism \n     to be criminally negligent.\n\n  What we are doing here is, in fact, advocating for the life health of \nthe mother by banning a procedure which is a rogue procedure, not \nperformed at hospitals, performed at abortion clinics, not even \nperformed by obstetricians, invented by someone who is not an \nobstetrician. That is why the AMA wrote to me yesterday supporting H.R. \n1122 as it now appears on the floor of the U.S. Senate saying:\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to work with you toward \n     restriction of a procedure we all agree is not good medicine.\n\n  In other words, it is not in the interest of the health or life of \nthe mother to do this procedure. It is wrong to do this procedure. It \nis immoral to do this procedure because you are killing a little baby. \nYou are killing a baby that is fourth-fifths born, that is moving \noutside of its mother. How can we accept that when there are other \noptions available?\n  As I suggested before, here is living proof of other options \navailable: a little girl who is here today on Capitol Hill, who will be \nright out here by the elevators during that vote. I ask Members to go \nover and to look into her eyes, to talk to her, because if her parents \nwould have listened to all the expert doctors who knew what was best \nfor their child, she wouldn't be here today.\n  She would have had this brutality, this violence, this vile procedure \ndone on this innocent little girl who now walks and talks and writes \nnotes--``Donna'' with a hand there, reaching out asking that this \nprocedure not be made available, so little girls like her, little boys \nlike her, be given a chance at life.\n  The Senator from California said, these kids who are not well enough \nto make it. Who are we to decide whether they are well enough to make \nit? Who are we to say they should die because they are not perfect?\n  Give them a chance. Give them the dignity of being born and brought \ninto this world with love, not violence and brutality. Give them a \nchance. Give them a chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4694-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to explain my vote today on H.R. \n1122, the partial-birth abortion ban.\n  As with many of my colleagues, this was not an easy decision. \nVirtually every Senator who has participated in the debate has noted \nhis or her abhorrence to the procedure.\n  I respect the views of Senators on either side of this issue. I have \nchosen to speak after the vote because this is a decision each Senator \nmust decide for himself or herself.\n  My own decision was not easy, in part, because this bill may have no \npractical effect on abortions in this country. It is likely that \ndoctors wishing to perform later-term abortions will simply choose \nanother option.\n  As I repeated last week, this is not a ban of abortion; it is a ban \nof a specific procedure.\n  It is not an easy decision because I favor a woman's right to consult \nthe physician of her choice to decide the most appropriate course of \naction on matters directly affecting her health and her most personal \ncircumstances.\n  This decision was not easy because, in spite of the personal nature \nof this debate, its complexity, the medical repercussions, and its \nseriousness, this issue has become politicized to the extent that much \nof the rhetoric has substantially diminished the potential for real \ndiscourse on such an important matter.\n  The result is that sincere efforts to find common ground have been \nlabeled as ``shams,'' as ``political cover,'' and ``deceptive'' by many \nwho passed judgment without having even read the legislation.\n  Perhaps because my expectations were much too high, my greatest \ndisappointment is reserved for some officials in the Catholic Church, \nespecially in my State, for whom I had great respect and from whom I \nwas given initial encouragement for my efforts. Their harsh rhetoric \nand vitriolic characterizations, usually more identified with the \nradical right than with thoughtful religious leadership, proved to be a \nconsequential impediment to the decision which I have made today. It \nwas most instructive.\n  This was not an easy decision, because it is highly likely that H.R. \n1122 will be declared unconstitutional should it be enacted into law.\n  The Supreme Court has been very clear in regard to two issues \nconcerning abortion.\n  First, prior to the viability of a fetus, a woman's ability to choose \nto terminate her pregnancy is a fundamental constitutional right and \ncannot be abrogated. The Court has ruled that the Government cannot \nimpose an undue burden on a woman who wishes to terminate her pregnancy \nwith an abortion, prior to the viability of the fetus. Second, that \nafter a fetus is determined to be viable, it can be given protection, \nso long as it does not endanger the life or health of the mother.\n  On both principles, the bill just passed appears to be in conflict \nwith numerous Supreme Court rulings.\n  Yet in spite of the difficulty in coming to my decision, I voted in \nfavor of its passage because I still desire to find common ground with \nthose outside the extremes who truly hope to resolve the issue in a \nconstructive and meaningful way.\n  I will continue to insist that any common ground approach fall within \nthe constitutional parameters which protect a woman and respect the \nlegitimate concerns for her health. But I will consider other proposals \nwhich accommodate that need in a manner more effective than mine.\n  My hope is that we can get beyond this debate to find a lasting, more \nacceptable legislative response. Recurring efforts to pass and veto a \nbill which is likely to be found to be unconstitutional only delays \nmeaningful progress in an effort to ban not just one procedure but all \nof them once a fetus is viable.\n  Failure to find common ground leaves little choice but to accelerate \nthe legislative process to allow the earliest review of the law by the \nSupreme Court. Its determination of the questionable constitutionality \nof this approach will guide us and will certainly force those unwilling \nto compromise now to a more conciliatory position later.\n  Our Nation must find the solution to this deeply vexing, moral \nproblem which has persisted in dividing us.\n  Let us not give up hope.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I supported passage of the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act when it was considered during the 104th Congress and I \nsupported overriding the President's veto of that measure. Today, I \nagain voted in favor of this legislation.\n  My position on abortion issues is clear. I have consistently stated \nthat I would not support overturning the Supreme Court's decision in \nRoe versus Wade. I support a women's right to have an abortion. I do \nnot think we should turn back the clock and make abortion illegal, but \nwe should work in every way to reduce the number of abortions that are \nperformed.\n  I have also cast votes in Congress in opposition to using Federal \nfunds to pay for abortions except in cases of life endangerment, rape, \nor incest.\n  Today, the Senate again voted on legislation which would prohibit a \nphysician from performing partial-birth\n\n[[Page S4716]]\n\nabortions, a procedure in which a fetus is delivered into the birth \ncanal before its skull is collapsed and delivery is completed. This \nlegislation contains a provision which would make an exception for \npartial-birth abortions that are necessary to save the life of the \nmother in cases in which no other medical procedure would suffice.\n  After careful thought about this issue, I have concluded that I \nsimply cannot justify the use of this specific procedure to terminate \npregnancies in which the mother's life is not at stake. For this \nreason, I voted to support the ban on partial-birth abortions, and I \nhope that the President will reconsider his decision to veto this \nmeasure and sign it into law.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express deep regret at \nthe passage of H.R. 1122, the so-called partial birth abortion bill. I \nfind it appalling that the U.S. Senate will enact legislation that is \nnot just an attack on choice, but more importantly an assault on a \nwoman's reproductive health.\n  I had hoped that the Daschle amendment, which I cosponsored, would \naddress the alleged concerns about unnecessary abortions being \nperformed after viability. This amendment was a reasonable approach and \nwould have met the State objective of preventing late-term abortions on \nhealthy fetuses when there was no serious threat to the life or health \nof the mother. However, it has become obvious what the real agenda is; \nto chip away at the guarantees and protections afforded to all women by \nthe Supreme Court. Those on the other side have now solicited the \nAmerican Medical Association [AMA] in their efforts to undermine Roe \nversus Wade and to jeopardize the health of women.\n  The AMA has simply cut a deal which unfortunately does not include \nwomen's reproductive health. They have acted in such a way to protect \ntheir interests and not the interest of their patients. Their \nannouncement does not in any way change the intent of this legislation \nnor does it do anything to address the concerns about women's health. \nIt is simply a political, calculated decision.\n\n  During the 104th Congress, there were 53 floor votes attacking \nreproductive health. Today's vote is simply a continuation of this \nattack. In the 104th Congress we witnessed attacks on title X, \ninternational family planning, and access to save and legal abortion \ncoverage for Federal employees and military personnel. This is not \nabout preventing late-term abortions, this is about preventing a \nwomen's and physician's right to determine their own health care needs. \nThey will not stop here. This attack will continue until all abortions, \nregardless of viability or the life and health of the mother are \nillegal. Today, we have taken a huge step backward.\n  Since joining the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I have \nheard from numerous groups representing physicians and from numerous \ndoctors from Washington State. I have been told repeatedly that \nCongress must act to prevent the further eroding of the patient-doctor \nrelationship currently taking place in the managed care delivery \nsystem. I have heard numerous stories about physicians who are unable \nto prescribe the appropriate treatment for their patients because \ninsurance companies have determined this treatment too costly or not \nnecessary. I have always agreed that doctors should be making health \ncare decisions, not insurance companies. I now am baffled as to why the \nAMA would want the U.S. Congress to dictate what treatment options \nphysicians can use to save the life and health of their female \npatients. Today's action invites the U.S. Congress into the operating \nroom and appears to have the blessing of the AMA.\n  I am grateful that there is one last line of defense; the President's \nveto. I am hopeful that the President will act swiftly to veto this \noffensive and threatening legislation and that we will do the right \nthing and sustain this veto.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npresence and use of small electronic calculators be permitted during \nconsideration of the fiscal year 1998 concurrent resolution on the \nbudget and any conference report thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is for the duration of the discussion on the \nresolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the staff of the Senate Committee on the \nBudget including congressional fellows and detailees from the executive \nbranch named on the list I now send to the desk be permitted to remain \non the Senate floor during consideration of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 27 and any conference report thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I note the presence of Senator \nLautenberg in the Chamber and I wonder if he might join with me in at \nleast discussing with the Senate how we might try together to be as \nhelpful to fellow Senators yet move this resolution along as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  From my standpoint, I do not believe my opening remarks and the \nopening remarks of any Members that I am aware of who want to speak in \nfavor of the resolution should take any longer than 1 hour. I am not \nholding anyone to that but just sort of indicating to\n\n[[Page S4717]]\n\nthe Senate that is the way I kind of see the time elapsing, to be \nexchanged side by side, one on the Democrat side and one on ours. But I \nthink we need about 1 hour in that regard. Does the Senator have any \nidea in reference to that side?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for the way in which cooperation has taken place. Both of us \nand our staffs have worked cooperatively together to get this done, and \nwe now arrive at the point before giving our formal statements where we \nare about to begin the debate that counts the most, going beyond the \ndiscussions we have had within the committee.\n  I have had several requests for people who would like to make opening \nstatements. I think I probably need 20 to 25 minutes on my own. I do \nnot know how long the distinguished chairman of the committee is going \nto take for his statement, but I would think that an hour might be on \nthe short side of things.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we could give enough of our colleagues \na chance to air their views. It is my fervent hope we will be able to \nconclude our business before the full 50 hours are used. I also hope \nthat we can get this budget agreement passed. We have a historic \nopportunity to work together on something that I think the American \npeople want to see, a bipartisan effort to reduce our annual deficit to \nzero. I think we accomplished that, and I hope the amendments will be \nthose we can discuss honestly, having votes where required and move on \nwith the business of the country.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me try this. I know that in our conference the \nleader, Senator Trent Lott, suggested we will be voting tonight and \nthat we will be in here late and that is because we expect amendments. \nThere may have to be a window of a couple of hours from 6 to 8 because \nof some event on that side of the aisle and likewise tomorrow night \nsome window but we do intend to stay in late. I would be willing to \naccommodate Senators in any way possible, but we need Senators to begin \nto bring amendments down as soon as possible.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to suggest if a Senator has amendments ready \nto go, even if we have not finished our opening remarks, other than the \nSenator's and mine, we ought to welcome them to the floor and proceed.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In response to the need to get business done here, \nour leader asked at the caucus that people get their amendments up \nearly this afternoon, at least let us know what amendments are coming \nso we can deal with them, and move on with the business. Meanwhile, I \nhave alerted my colleagues on the Democratic side to the fact that we \nwill be accepting opening statements this afternoon and those who want \nto make them are welcome to do so, I think under the structure of our \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first I thank my friend, Senator \nLautenberg, for those remarks. Fellow Senators from either side of the \naisle, if you have amendments, it would really be helping the Senate \nwith its work if you would let us know about your amendments. We have \nabout five or six already that we are aware of, and we will start \nsharing those with the Senator from New Jersey so that he will know \nabout them. If the Senator will do the same with us, it will be very \nhelpful.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have reason to believe there are about a half a \ndozen presently listed. We will confirm that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank and compliment a few people before I \nproceed to my substantive remarks. First and foremost, I thank Senator \nTrent Lott, the majority leader of the Senate. He has exhibited a rare \ndetermination and real dedication and commitment to trying to get a \nbipartisan budget resolution through so that the Congress could do the \nwork of the people this year and do as much of it together as we \npossibly could.\n  I thank the Democratic leadership, at least the Democratic leadership \nin the Senate, for their work in behalf of this resolution. Senator \nDaschle has been extremely helpful. On the Democrat side, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, has been extremely \nhelpful. He has worked hard. And together we intend to get this budget \nresolution out of here as close as possible to the form approved by the \ncommittee yesterday afternoon, by as overwhelming a vote as we could \nexpect, 17 to 4, and I believe this morning the vote finished up at 17 \nto 5. So there were 17 Senators from both sides of the aisle and 5 \nagainst.\n  I thank President Clinton and his negotiators, the President \npersonally for his insistence we stay with it and for his early \ndeterminations made to this Senator and to Senator Lott that he wanted \nto proceed to try to do this.\n  Obviously, there are many other people who were very important. I am \nnot going to name them all here now but in due course we will try to do \nthat.\n  Let me say to those listening today that 2 weeks ago we announced in \nthe rotunda that Republicans and Democrats had reached an important \nagreement on a bipartisan budget plan. That announcement represented a \ncrucial step in both sides coming together to produce a budget in the \nbest interests of the American people.\n  Yesterday, the Senate Budget Committee took the next step and \napproved this bipartisan plan, and I sincerely hope this body will \nfollow suit and pass this agreement within the next day or two at the \nmost.\n  Because the real winners in this budget are the American working \nfamilies, this budget will lead to reduced Federal spending, the \nlargest tax cut since 1981, and ultimately to lower interest rates that \nwill mean more and better paying jobs.\n  Moreover, this agreement responds to the American people who clearly \nsent a message in the last election, tough elections for many Members \nwith many issues, but I believe there was one unmistakable resonance \nthrough that campaign across America. I think the people said work \ntogether when the interests of the American people are at stake, work \ntogether when the issues are American. Do not fight all the time. So we \nhave done just that. A year will find this Congress on opposite sides \nin the best tradition of debate, disagreeing with each other. \nUltimately, parts of the implementation of this budget will find us \ndisagreeing, but the truth is we have taken, yesterday afternoon, the \nfirst real step in saying to the American people we accept your \nrequest, in many cases your desire and your begging us to work \ntogether, and we have done just that. And in doing so we have produced \na compromise that I believe will improve the lives of families today \nwhile providing a better future for tomorrow.\n  It will mean, when it is all finished, the first balanced budget in \n30 years. It will mean $135 billion in gross tax relief over 5 years. \nIncluded in this will be a capital gains tax differential, obviously a \nchild tax credit, and other things that both sides have talked about. \nClearly, it will include some of the President's tax requests with \nreference to education, higher education and some of the ideas he has \nenacted.\n  Now, a budget resolution does not tell anybody precisely what these \nare. The committees that have to write the law will do that. But what \nwe do give them is a flow of taxes over the years saying how much they \ncan cut each year, and at the end of 5 years they will have a gross \nrevenue number of $135 billion in new tax cuts. We have also agreed, \nthe leadership has, that over 10 years just in the normal sequence of \nthings that body of new taxes will amount to $250 billion in permanent \nreductions over a 10-year period.\n  I believe those two are pretty good propositions that many Americans \nwould support, but we do not want to stop there. We have made \nadjustments to the trust fund for senior citizens under Medicare such \nthat it will be solvent for about 10 years. That provides Americans, \nAmerican leadership with ample opportunity to permanently reform the \nMedicare system. It also without question provides more options for the \nMedicare plan which can be adopted as part of this agreement by the \nFinance Committee and its counterpart in the House. Ten years of \nsolvency for Medicare while providing more choice is, indeed, \naccomplishing something significant.\n  Entitlement reforms over the next 10 years including those that will \nbe found in Medicare amount to about $630 billion over the next 10 \nyears. Some of these might be challenged by Members and we are willing \nto debate\n\n[[Page S4718]]\n\nthem. But it is obvious that the entitlement package we are used to in \nour country will grow far less because of this budget resolution than \nif we had left everything alone. Funding for White House and Republican \ndomestic priorities and Democratic priorities including education, \ntransportation, housing, environment, crime control, and science \nprograms have been provided for.\n  All of those will be in the ascendancy, and all of those will be \ndeemed priorities so that the Appropriations Committee will have the \nfull support of the leadership in funding these items at a higher \nlevel, including, if I did not mention, the basic environmental \nprotection funding for the United States.\n  (Mr. KEMPTHORNE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, passing this Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \nwill force the Federal Government to finally live within its means. It \nmakes permanent change that will reduce Government spending by some \n$320 billion in the next 5 years and more than $1 trillion over the \nnext decade.\n  The agreement will also give families relief by cutting gross taxes, \nas I have indicated before, by $135 billion in the first 5 years and \ngross taxes by as much as $350 billion over 10 years.\n  Seniors can be assured that Medicare will remain solvent, ensuring \nthis solvency for 10 years by enacting reforms that slow the growth of \nspending while providing seniors with more choices, which is what we \nneed in the Medicare system. But nobody should assume that this budget \nresolution, and I would be prepared as one who knows a bit about budget \nresolutions, neither this nor any budget resolution will be the vehicle \nto provide permanent, long-term major reform of the Medicare system \nwhich is going to be needed within the next 5 to 6 to 7 years to meet \nwhat everybody understands is a very, very large population increase, \nwhere the demographics begin to change dramatically because of the baby \nboomers. We do not have a plan. This budget is not a plan to make \nMedicare solvent for that kind of change. Anybody who thought it should \nbe has a mistaken understanding of what you can do in a budget \nresolution. But we did a lot, because it is done on a bipartisan basis \nand with the President.\n  This overall plan will shrink Government, making most of the programs \nleaner and more efficient. Medicaid, Federal retirement, housing, \nveterans, student loans programs are just some of those that will be \ntargeted for reform and savings, while overall spending will be \nreduced, as I have indicated, over 10 years by an excess of $1 \ntrillion. We have added money to protect priorities, and so those \npriorities that I have mentioned find themselves this time in this \nbudget resolution, and the agreement that attends it finds modest but \nnecessary increases for education, transportation, anticrime, \nenvironment, and science.\n  Contrasted with other budget resolutions, wherein these kinds of \nideas would be nothing more than telling the Appropriations Committee \nwhat we hope would happen, we have entered into a very major bipartisan \nleadership agreement, which I will hold up here, and eventually it will \nbe made a part of the Record, entitled the ``Bipartisan Agreement on \nthe Budget,'' dated May 15, between the President and the leadership of \nCongress. It contains the summary tables, the description of agreements \nby major category, both in the discretionary programs and the mandatory \nand budget process reforms that have been agreed to that will have to \nwork their way through the various bills, Mr. President, as they find \nthemselves reported by the various committees.\n  There are also two letters pertaining to the taxes which were \nexecuted by the Republican leaders of the House and Senate directed to \nthe committee chairmen and the President indicating the situation \nregarding the tax cuts. Once again, I know those listening would like \nfor those of us who write a budget to tell them exactly what the \ncapital gains tax will be. We don't know that. We know it will be \nsignificantly reduced. Exactly when the $500 child care credit will be \ntotally implemented we cannot tell you, but it will be, because, with \nall of the tax proposals, it may be that some have to wait a little bit \nand others will start more quickly, but that will be done. Some \neducation tax relief for middle-income Americans who are sending \nchildren to college as part of the President's request is included in \nthe letter of agreement as to what our committees will work on as they \ncarry out and implement this budget.\n  It should be pointed out that this is the first time we have ever had \nsuch an agreement, and that means that those of us in the bipartisan \nleadership and those who worked on this committee, my Democratic \ncounterpart and I, have a very serious responsibility to see we try to \ncarry out on the floor of the Senate not only the budget resolution, \nbut the terms of the agreement as it applies to the budget resolution. \nWe will try that, yet we will have the Senate working its will in its \nnormal manner for the next couple of days.\n  I am sure there will be many very, very difficult votes. I myself \nbelieve the budget is about as good as we are going to get it. It is \nnow agreed to by Democrats and Republicans and the President. I believe \nbefore we finish, it will receive an overwhelming vote of support, and \nwe will just have to wait and see whether that prediction is true or \nnot.\n  We have also agreed in two areas to deal with some problems in \nsociety that needed some attention, and let me address the two in a \ngeneral way.\n  First of all, it is obvious that even with Medicaid, which should \ncover many of our children, poor children, there are a lot of American \nchildren who have no health insurance. We have agreed to put money into \ntwo programs, and in the basic agreement that we have with the \nPresident, it is spelled out that over the next 5 years, $16 billion \nwill be spent in an effort to cover all children in America who are not \ncovered. There is a lot of leeway on the part of the committees to \nwrite that, but it is obvious that there will be added moneys for \nMedicaid so that they can pick up many of the children who are not \ncovered. There are additional resources in there for a program that \nwill go back to the States, a partnership arrangement, where the States \nwill receive our money and match it and try to cover other children in \ntheir own way as they manage the programs in the best possible way.\n\n  That is one area that we agreed needed coverage, and I am pleased to \nsay my own polling of Republicans, not a whip check or anything, \nindicates there are many of them who want to do that. The question \nremains, how do we do it best and what will it ultimately cost? But we \nhave provided the $16 billion that goes to the committee of \njurisdiction to do the very best job they can.\n  We also found in the U.S. Senate not too many days ago on an \nappropriations bill presented by Senator Stevens that the Senate voted \nby a huge margin to continue coverage for a group of legal--legal--\nresidents of the United States who happened to come here as immigrants \nin a legal manner and remain here legally but are not American \ncitizens. They come under an American program of generosity, which \npermits family reunification. Many of them come here as grandparents \nand parents. The program has broken down because the sponsors who are \nsupposed to take care of them have not taken care of them, and the law \nintended to do that has not been enforced for years. As a result, there \nare more than a few thousand disabled senior Americans who are here as \nlegal immigrants who are getting an SSI check every month. This budget \nresolution says we are providing sufficient funds so that those people \nwill not drop off the rolls automatically on a date certain as \ncontemplated under last year's law but will continue coverage so long \nas they live.\n  We have also said if there are Americans of the same condition that \nare here under the same circumstance that I described, if they reach \nthe time when they are both senior and disabled, they would be entitled \nto SSI. But that ends the pool. In the future, any newcomers under \nthese rules will have to rely upon their sponsors, and we wrote strong \nlaws last year to make the sponsors more responsible.\n  Those are the two major areas of additional expenditures that we have \nput in place and agreed with the President on.\n  I will just make a few comparisons by dollars and show those who are \npaying any attention what we are talking about.\n\n[[Page S4719]]\n\n  While some accounts are protected, as I indicated, the emphasis in \nthis plan is clear: For every new $1 added to the budget, it is reduced \nby $15. For every new $1 in spending, there is roughly $3.50 in tax \ncuts.\n  This displays in a very vivid manner what happens to the deficit. \nWithout the agreement is the red line; with the agreement is the green \nline. We think that is as simple as we can show it. The deficit will be \ngoing up from 90 and not coming back down significantly, according to \nthe best estimates. And under these estimates, the green line \nrepresents how we will get to balance and, in fact, have a slight \nsurplus by 2002, a pretty important and very-easy-to-understand chart.\n\n  This simple chart is nondefense discretionary spending. In our \nnational budget, we have essentially three kinds of expenditures. One \nbatch is called discretionary, which simply means we appropriate it \nevery year. I am not one who thinks that is the greatest idea. I am \nhoping we can change that and appropriate for 2 years at a time. Part \nof that is defense, which is appropriated every year. It is a \ndiscretionary account annually done, and then all the domestic programs \nthat are appropriated every year are called the nondefense \ndiscretionary program.\n  The sum total of those amount to about $540 billion plus, about 37 \npercent of the budget. Some people think it is the whole budget, but it \nis about 37 percent.\n  This shows under the greenline, spending without this agreement, for \nthe discretionary domestic part of this budget, and under the red line, \nit shows what will happen. There were some a few weeks ago who were \nsaying this budget agreement was one that was just throwing money at \nthe discretionary programs instead of trying to get some frugality and \nsome better performance.\n  This redline indicates that the entire discretionary piece of our \nGovernment for the domestic programs will go up, Mr. President, one-\nhalf of 1 percent a year. In the prior decade, it went up 6 percent on \naverage. For some, that is bad news. For others, that is good news. The \nfact that the President of the United States has agreed to that and \nthat we have and said even while it is adjusting at such a low rate of \ngrowth, we want to have some priorities like roads, like in education, \nto me seems to be the kind of thing the public would like us to do.\n  Share of the total outlays of our budget has changed dramatically, \nand I will just show that quickly and summarize my remarks very \nquickly.\n  When John Kennedy was President of the United States, the budget of \nthe United States was broken up into two parts and went something like \nthis. The interest on the debt was small, Mr. President, so let's leave \nthat aside. It was about 67 percent discretionary spending for defense \nand domestic programs, those annual ones we do every year, and the rest \nof the budget, which would be about 33 percent, were what we call \nmandatory or entitlement programs. That means a program that spent out \non its own, unless Congress changes the law--a Social Security check, a \nMedicare benefit payment to a hospital.\n\n  All the other programs, pensions, and the like, and I guess I would \nsummarize them this way, any program that the U.S. Government has that \nif they failed to pay it to a citizen or an institution that is \nentitled to it, they can prevail in getting their money from the \nTreasury of the United States direct through a court of law.\n  It turns out from President Kennedy's time to ours, it has flipped on \nits head, and 67 percent of the budget is now on automatic pilot, \nrunning on its own, mandatory programs which we can only control if we \nchange the underlying law by a vote of the Congress and the signature \nof the President. The balance of 33 percent makes up all of the \nexpenditures for defense and domestic programs.\n  So it seems to most of us that we know where the area of growth is \nand the areas that cry out for reform if we are going to bring this \nGovernment's fiscal policy under control and not have to look at taxes \nskyrocketing 15 years from now and the bill that our children must pay \ngetting bigger and bigger and the credit card that we kind of take from \nthem without representation. If ever there was taxation without \nrepresentation, it is the deficit you impose on kids where they do not \nget to vote. It clearly means they are going to have to pay taxes in \norder to pay these bills that they were not even around to vote on.\n  So I believe when you look at what we have done and add three other \nthings, we will enforce this program. The discretionary caps, the \ndiscretionary programs that I have described for domestic spending, we \nwill have a cap on them for each year at a dollar number agreed to in \nthe resolution. That dollar number is the one that moves this one-half \npercent growth we spoke of. That will be a cap that says, at the end of \na year if you spend more than that, by operation of law, every program \nin the Government will get cut by the percentage needed to bring it \nback to that cap.\n  It has been the only effective tool we have had. It has worked twice \nbecause we have only breached it twice. That is set to expire. We need \nto reput that in the law for another 5 years. That is provided for \nhere.\n  We also preserve budget points of order against those caps. I will \nnot go into that, but that is a second remedy to make sure we are doing \nwhat we promised and what we say here.\n  In addition, the deficit comes down each year starting in 1998, \nalbeit not as much as we would like in the early years because, \nremember, we are cutting taxes in those early years and the entitlement \nprogram savings grow in the outyears. But essentially it will not go \nback up and down in spurts; it will be at a level and gradual road and \npath downward.\n  We used conservative economics in this budget. There is some \nconfusion about that. But if one wants to check them, we use the \neconomic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office as to growth, \nunemployment, and those basic ingredients, those basic pieces of the \neconomy that we measure.\n  This budget is conservative. So when somebody says you have not \nprovided for a recession, I ask, have you ever seen a budget presented \nby a President or Congress that anticipates specifically a recession \nand says in 2 years we have a recession and therefore things are \nchanged? Obviously, nobody does that. But when you use the conservative \nnumbers that the Congressional Budget Office says should be used, they \nsay built within it over time is the conservativeness that would permit \nyou to be much safer in case of a recession, that your numbers will not \nbe very much out of kilter, because of the conservatism of the economic \nassumptions.\n  Now, later on, if a Senator wants to talk about the revenues that we \nassume will come into this budget, I will be pleased to do that. We \nwere confronted midstream with a change in the revenue expectations, \nbut I would be pleased to discuss that with anybody who chooses during \nthe next 2 days.\n  Suffice it to say that we hope--we found out the revenues were going \nto be up, and the Congressional Budget Office, heretofore very \nconservative in that regard, had decided that their estimates were too \nlow. We spent only about $30 billion of their $225 billion, and that \nwas done for very specific purposes, and the rest stayed in there as \ndeficit reduction.\n  So I believe for the future of our country and in particular for the \nfuture of our children, the time is now to pass this budget rather \nintact and get on with implementing it.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, this budget has the best chance of \nreaching the reality that is predicted within the four corners of this \nresolution of any we have produced, because this is not one party's \nbudget resolution, and that party being in Congress, and another \nparty's President being in the White House with a different idea. Since \nwe have something that is agreed to by both, it would seem to me that \nits implementation has a much better chance of being achieved rather \nthan just fought over and reach stalemates because we cannot agree.\n  That is why last year as I finished doing our Republican budget, I \nsaid, I hope I do not have to do one that is just Republican again \nunless we happen to have a Republican President, because it would seem \nto me you have to take into consideration the President and his wishes \nto some extent. And I\n\n[[Page S4720]]\n\nbelieve we have done that. And he has taken ours into account to some \nextent. And that is the final product.\n\n  So, fellow Senators, that is my best explanation. I will answer \nanybody's questions and go into as much detail on any parts of it that \nanyone wants. But for now, again, if you can give us ideas about \namendments you intend to offer, it will be greatly appreciated.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I start by issuing the plea \nalso that Senator Domenici, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, started with; that is, to our fellow Senators, get your \namendments down here. Do not cause a jam up at the end when you may not \nbe able to get the floor. You may not be able to have a full \nexplanation of that which you are interested in.\n  We want to move the process. This is no longer a time for delay and \nbickering among ourselves. We are obliged to move it because it is the \nright thing for America.\n  First, let me say that I am pleased to join my colleague, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, in urging support \nfor this budget resolution.\n  For the past several weeks, Senator Domenici and I, along with \nrepresentatives of the administration and the House Budget Committee, \nhave been working long hours and arduously to reach a budget agreement. \nIt has been a long, difficult and occasionally a painful process. But \nin the end I am pleased to say that we succeeded in our mission.\n  Today, for the first time in many, many years, we will be considering \na budget resolution that is truly bipartisan. This resolution, Mr. \nPresident, is historic. It will lead to the first balanced budget since \n1969. It calls for the largest investment in education and training \nsince the Johnson administration. It combines tough fiscal discipline \nwith a strong commitment to Medicare, the environment, transportation, \nand other national priorities.\n  Beyond its substance, Mr. President, I am hopeful that this agreement \nrepresents a turning point in contemporary American politics. For many \nyears, Congress has been dominated by partisanship and immobilized by \ngridlock. This constant infighting has undermined our standing around \nthe country. It has made it more difficult to solve our Nation's \nproblems. And we all hope that a sense of comity that now seems to be \nhere during these budget discussions will prevail here in Washington. \nThis agreement marks a major step in that direction.\n  The agreement shows Democrats and Republicans are ready to put aside \npartisan differences, rise above petty bickering, and make the hard \ndecisions that our people across the country want us to do. That is \nwhat we are delivering.\n  Mr. President, this agreement comes before us at a time when our \neconomy is remarkably strong. Over the past 2\\1/2\\ years the stock \nmarket has skyrocketed by more than 80 percent; unemployment is at its \nlowest point in 24 years; inflation is at the slowest pace in 31 years; \nnew investment has soared at a 9 percent annual rate over the last 4 \nyears, a welcome change from the performance over the preceding 8 \nyears; and real wages have started to rise again after years of \nstagnation.\n  The tremendous strength of our economy is a tribute to President \nClinton and the Democratic Party. When President Clinton came into \noffice, the budget deficit was $290 billion and it was expected to \nexplode to more than $500 billion by 2002. Since then, just the \ncontrary has happened. The deficit has been cut by 63 percent, falling \n4 years in a row to $107 billion in 1996. This year, the deficit is \nestimated to be falling to $67 billion.\n  This, Mr. President, is remarkable progress. We want to continue that \nprogress, and this budget agreement will get it done.\n  People tend to think of budgeting as a zero sum game in which one \nperson's win is another's loss. But this budget agreement is a win-win-\nwin all around. It is a win for our economy. It is a win for ordinary \nAmericans who are working hard to raise their families and keep their \nheads above water. It is a win for the future of our country.\n  Mr. President, both parties should be pleased with this bipartisan \nachievement. But I want to take a few minutes to explain why I think \nDemocrats deserve to be especially proud.\n  Throughout this process, we Democrats have insisted on an agreement \nthat imposes real fiscal discipline that builds on President Clinton's \ntremendous success in reducing the deficit, and that balances the \nbudget in a real, credible way. And the American people have won.\n  Democrats have insisted that we make education a top national \npriority. We have demanded that middle-class families get tax relief to \nhelp pay for college, and that all Americans get assistance in \naffording further education and job training. And the American people \nhave won.\n\n  Democrats have insisted that Medicare be protected. We have demanded \nthat the solvency of the Medicare trust fund be extended, that senior \ncitizens not be asked to bear unfair burdens, that the quality of their \nhealth care not be put at risk, and that new preventative benefits be \nadded. And the American people have won.\n  Democrats have insisted on targeting tax relief to the middle class. \nWe have demanded that when Congress cuts taxes, much of the relief must \ngo to struggling families who need help the most. And the American \npeople have won.\n  Democrats have insisted that uninsured children be provided with \nhealth insurance. We have demanded that millions of kids get the health \ncare they need and deserve. And the American people have won.\n  Democrats have insisted on fairness for people who come into this \ncountry legally, who have obeyed the law, and paid their taxes and who \nthen suffer from a disability. We have demanded the elimination of \nextreme laws that punish people because they get hit by a bus or lose \ntheir eyesight. And the American people have won.\n  Democrats have insisted on maintaining our commitment to \nenvironmental protection. We have demanded more funding to clean up \nhazardous waste sites while resisting schemes to gut the Environmental \nProtection Agency. And the American people have won.\n  Democrats have also insisted on investing in transportation. We have \ndemanded that transportation be made a priority and that funding be \nincreased substantially over the levels originally proposed earlier \nthis year. And the American people have won.\n  Mr. President, my point is not that Democrats are the sole winners \nhere. That of course is not true. This is a fair and balanced \nagreement. The Republicans have won on many of their most cherished \npriorities. Some of those wins have been bitter pills for me and for \nmany Democrats, but I say to my friends on this side of the aisle, the \nfact is that we do not control either Houses of the Congress. And we \nhave to respect the will of the American people. So there is no way to \nsolve our Nation's problems without compromise. It is the only way, and \npainful though it may be for some, it is the right thing to do.\n\n  Mr. President, let me turn to some of the specifics in the budget \nagreement, some of which have been mentioned by the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee, but I think are worthy of repetition.\n  First, and perhaps most fundamentally, this agreement will balance \nthe budget by the year 2002. Beginning next year, when the agreement \nfirst goes into effect, the deficit will decline every year until we \nreach balance. Balancing the budget will require real fiscal \ndiscipline. This agreement calls for $320 billion in savings over the \nnext 5 years. More than half of those savings will come from \nentitlement programs and other mandatory spending. More than $75 \nbillion will come out of the military budget. While important domestic \npriorities will be spared the meat cleaver, nondefense discretionary \nspending, which encompasses many of the programs that the people across \nthe country are interested in, will be reduced in real terms by $61 \nbillion, or about 4 percent. As I said, some pain comes.\n  Will all of these savings really balance the budget? Mr. President, \nany\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\nbudget projection must rely on economic assumptions. But the \nassumptions in this budget are on the conservative side. They are based \non economic projections of the Congressional Budget Office which have \nproven to be far from reality for the past 4 years. They have missed \nthe targets. They have overestimated some poor results.\n  Consider that just a few months ago, CBO, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, estimated this year's budget deficit would be $124 billion. \nThat was only in January. In March, CBO, 2 months later, revised its \nestimate down to $115 billion from $124 billion. Now, in May, there are \nreports that the deficit could be as low as $67 billion.\n  Think about that, Mr. President. We are talking about the current \nfiscal year which ends in less than 5 months, and in just that same \nlength of time, the projected deficit has shrunk by 45 percent from \n$124 billion to $67 billion.\n  At this rate, some have suggested the best way to balance the budget \nwould be for Congress to sit down, keep quiet, and go home. Who knows, \nthey may be right. If they are, this agreement will produce significant \nbudget surpluses, a result unimaginable not long ago.\n  My point, though, is simply that in using CBO's economic assumptions, \nwe are using projections that have consistently proven to be too \npessimistic. This budget does not rest on unrealistic rosy scenarios, \nas have past budget agreements, so it is very likely that we will \nactually reach balance or a surplus before the next 5 years is out if \nwe can get this agreement enacted into law.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution establishes without question \nthat both political parties are now firmly committed to fiscal \ndiscipline. For years, Republicans have run for office by accusing the \nDemocrats of being tax-and-spend liberals, unconcerned about fiscal \nresponsibility. This agreement puts these charges to rest once and for \nall. It is now clear that Democrats and Republicans are both committed \nto a balanced budget. We disagree only about the means to that end and \nhow the burden of the deficit reduction will be distributed.\n  Fortunately, this budget agreement is more than an accounting \nexercise. It will set our country on a firm course into the 21st \ncentury by empowering our people, by investing in them and ensuring \nthey are ready to compete in the years and decades ahead.\n  As I noted earlier, this agreement includes the largest investment in \neducation and training since the administration of Lyndon Baines \nJohnson. The agreement moves us toward a day when every 8-year-old \nchild can read, every 12-year-old child can log in on the Internet, and \nevery 18-year-old can go to college. Those are the goals that President \nClinton committed to when he addressed us earlier this year, and they \nare the right goals for America.\n  Mr. President, I grew up the son of working-class immigrants, but was \nable, because of my service in World War II, to attend Columbia \nUniversity, thanks to the GI bill. I want all Americans to have the \nsame opportunities I had, because education is the key to prosperity \nand security and because, like I, not only will they learn important \nsubjects, but maybe their horizons will be less limiting. My horizons \nwere developed because I saw my parents standing behind the counter \nmaking sandwiches, washing dishes, working from 6 o'clock in the \nmorning until 11 o'clock at night, typically, 7 days a week, just to \ngrind out a living to take care of my sister and me. They could not \ngive us much more than the comfort of interested parents, and goals to \nwhich they wanted us to aspire. That is the way it ought to be, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The opportunity came along for me to have an education that never \nwould have come my way. It changed my perspective totally, and enabled \nme, without being too immodest, to start a company that started an \nindustry--the computing industry--that is today larger than the \nhardware industry. That is on the service side, software--everybody now \nis familiar with software--outsourcing services. The company has 29,000 \nemployees. I am a member of something called the ``Information \nProcessing Hall of Fame,'' all of that because I got a boost from my \nGovernment, from my fellow citizens, for something that I did.\n\n  All Americans, no matter how rich or poor, should have access to that \nAmerican dream. My parents never thought that I would have the \nopportunity to serve in the U.S. Senate, to be given the honor of \nserving the American people, but, again, it happened because a start \nwas given to me at just the right time in my life.\n  Toward that end, Mr. President, toward access to the American dream, \nthis agreement includes the largest Pell grant increases in two \ndecades. Four million students will receive a grant of up to $3,000 for \nhigher education. These grants, we hope, will open the doors of \nopportunity and help lead our country in the next century. Our entire \nNation will reap the reward.\n  The agreement also will provide significant tax relief to those who \nwant to attend college. It endorses the objectives of President \nClinton's HOPE scholarship proposal, which would provide a $1,500 \nannual tax credit for higher education. This extra money would \nencourage millions of young people to go to college.\n  The agreement also endorses the objectives of the President's \nproposal to give a $10,000 tax deduction to help cover education and \njob training costs for young people in the family. This proposal is \ncritical to ensure that Americans are able to train and retrain \nthemselves throughout their lives, not just upper level managers, but \neach and every American.\n  There are several other education initiatives that are guaranteed by \nthis agreement. For example, it guarantees funding for a child literacy \ninitiative such as the President's America Reads proposal. This program \nwould provide individualized after-school and summer help for more than \n3 million children in kindergarten through the third grade. More than a \nmillion tutors would be involved.\n  The budget agreement also will fund a technological literacy \ninitiative. The President has proposed to connect every American \nclassroom to the Internet and to ensure that all teachers are trained \nto work with this latest in technology. His proposal would help schools \nintegrate the technology into their programs so that no American child \nis burdened with computer illiteracy.\n  The budget agreement also calls for significant expansion of Head \nStart. This widely praised program has had tremendous success in \npreparing very young children for their education and for their \nfutures. This agreement will help move us toward President Clinton's \ngoal of increasing Head Start enrollments to 1 million children by the \nyear 2002.\n  Mr. President, the combination of increased Pell grants, the tuition \ntax credit, the education training deduction, the children literacy \ninitiative, the technological literacy program, Head Start, and many \nother educational initiatives, make this agreement a truly historic \ncommitment to education, and it is reason enough for Democrats and \nRepublicans alike to support this agreement.\n  I want to move on to some other important features of the budget \nresolution. It will ensure that up to 5 million uninsured children are \nprovided with health coverage. The resolution includes $16 billion \ntoward that end, and it will be up to the committees of responsibility \nto decide whether to use Medicaid expansion or a grant program to \nStates or another approach, but the commitment and the resources are \nthere to get the job done. In the end, that will mean that more \nchildren of working families will have health insurance.\n\n  This budget agreement also will strengthen and modernize our Medicare \nProgram. The agreement first would extend the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund for at least 10 years. Senator Domenici made mention of the \nfact that during that time we will have to look to the longer term \nproblems often associated with Medicare while carrying on the \nwonderful, very positive benefits that have resulted. It makes positive \nstructural reforms which will bring Medicare more into line with the \nprivate sector while preparing it for the baby-boom generation.\n  The agreement extends the trust fund solvency in part by reforming \npayment systems for hospitals and doctors. In addition, it gives the \nseniors more choices. It increases the number of health plan options \nsuch as preferred provider organizations and provider-sponsored \norganizations. It also gives beneficiaries comparative information\n\n[[Page S4722]]\n\nabout their options such as now provided Federal employees of the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  Additionally, the agreement provides funding for several very \nsignificant new preventive benefits. These include expanded mammography \ncoverage, coverage for colorectal screening, coverage for diabetes \nself-examination, and vaccinations. Beyond investing in education and \nprotecting and improving Medicare, this agreement will provide \nsignificant tax relief to millions of American families.\n  In addition to the education tax cuts that I mentioned earlier, the \nagreement includes a $500-per-child tax credit. This will be of real \nassistance to many Americans who are working hard and struggling to \nmake ends meet. The agreement also will allow the Finance Committee to \ncut capital gains and estate taxes, as well as expand IRA's and make \nother changes to the Tax Code. These changes will benefit many small \nbusinesses and farmers, goals which Republicans and Democrats strongly \nagree upon.\n  However, there is real concern, Mr. President, among many Democrats \nthat these tax breaks will go disproportionately to the wealthy and \nwill explode the deficit in the long term. Frankly, I share those \nconcerns. In a time of scarce resources, it seems wrong to be handing \nout huge tax breaks to people who do not need them.\n  The bottom line is we would not have a budget agreement if Democrats \nwere not willing to accept some of these tax breaks. This was the main \nwin that the Republicans demanded. Though it is a bitter pill for some, \nin my view, it is a pill we have to swallow for the benefits of a \nbalanced budget, education investment, health coverage for 5 million \nchildren, restoration of disability benefits for desperate legal \nimmigrants, and other positive parts of this agreement.\n  I do want to assure my colleagues, however, that the agreement \nincludes significant constraints in the tax area that will help prevent \na redo of the kind of economics that created the deficit problem in the \nfirst place.\n  First, there are firm limits on the size of the tax cuts--the \nagreement states that the net tax cuts shall be $85 billion in the \nfirst 5 years, and no more than $250 billion through 2007. Second, \nLeader Lott and Speaker Gingrich have given their firm commitment--in \nwriting--that tax cuts, and I quote ``shall not cause costs to explode \nin the outyears.''\n  For those who are not satisfied with that commitment, I would point \nout that President Clinton has made it clear that he will not tolerate \na tax bill that imposes huge costs in the future. And while he has \nagreed to a significant capital gains and estate tax cut, he has not \nsigned away his right to veto extreme legislation that violates our \nbasic understanding.\n  I also want to assure my colleagues that the size of the tax cuts in \nthis agreement are very small compared to the enormous breaks that were \napproved in the early 1980's. The tax cut of 1981 cost $2.8 trillion \nover 10 years, in today's dollars. By contrast, this agreement would \nallow tax cuts of $250 billion--less than 10 percent of those that were \nproposed 17 years ago.\n  Mr. President, Republicans may have won in their insistence on tax \nbreaks for wealthier Americans, but they did abandon radical plans to \ncompletely gut domestic priorities, and undermine the basic functions \nof Government. Over the next 5 years, this agreement calls for $355 \nbillion more in domestic discretionary spending than Newt Gingrich \ndemanded in the infamous Contract With America. And it includes $189 \nbillion more than in last year's Republican budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, lest anyone has the impression that Government is \ngoing to be growing over the next 5 years because of these increases in \nsome of the discretionary funds, it won't be. Nondefense discretionary \nspending will be cut from baseline by 4 percent overall, and by 10 \npercent in real terms in 2002. And when you consider that priority \nprograms will be spared, the real cuts in other programs will be \nsignificant.\n  Still, in nominal terms, available resources for basic Government \nfunctions will increase overall, if only modestly. And we will trim \nGovernment with a scalpel, not a meat axe cleaver. Under the \ncircumstances, that's a major victory.\n  Let me now move on to another part of the budget agreement, which \ndeals with Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, this agreement preserves the Medicaid Program in two \nmajor respects. First, it preserves the guarantee of health coverage \nfor our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. Second, it rejects the \nadministration's proposal to establish a per capita cap on Medicaid \npayments. I want to publicly thank my fellow negotiators for both of \nthese decisions.\n  I think it would have been a poor way to administer the Medicaid \nProgram. We shouldn't be adopting a scheme that jeopardizes the quality \nof health care for millions of children, seniors, and other vulnerable \nAmericans.\n  At one point, I was in a distinct minority in the negotiating room in \nmy opposition to the per capita cap, and I am very pleased that the \nproposal was rejected in the end. In my view, at a time when the growth \nin Medicaid spending has dropped dramatically, we should not be \nadopting risky schemes that could jeopardize the quality of health care \nfor millions of children, seniors, and other vulnerable Americans.\n  Mr. President, the agreement does include a cut in payments for \nhospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicaid and uninsured \npatients. I have real concerns about this. Clearly, some States have \nabused the program, and we should be able to find savings by reforming \nthe program. But we must be very careful not to hurt children's \nhospitals and others who are very reliant on this funding. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to \nensure that this does not happen.\n  Mr. President, let me turn now to another important element of this \nagreement, the provisions that will roll back some of the more extreme \nprovisions in last year's welfare reform bill.\n  First, this agreement will restore Medicaid and disability benefits \nfor many disabled legal immigrants. These are people who have come to \nthis country legally, who have worked and paid their taxes, and who \nsuffer from a serious disability.\n  Mr. President, it is wrong to punish these people for getting hit by \na bus, or losing their eyesight. Many of them are desperately poor to \nbegin with. Now they may be confined to bed or a wheelchair, with \nnowhere to go and nobody to turn to. They can't work. And they need \nhelp to survive. Providing basic assistance is the right thing to do.\n  This agreement also will provide relief to some individuals who would \nlose food stamps because they are unable to find work. This was another \nprovision of the welfare reform bill that simply went too far. The \nagreement will permit States to exempt 15 percent of those who would \nlose benefits because of the law's very strict time limits, and would \nfund additional work slots for individuals subject to those limits.\n  In addition, the agreement includes $3 billion to help people move \nfrom welfare to work, something that all of us want to see happen.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to an area of special interest to me, \ntransportation.\n  Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, I believe strongly in \nthe value of investing in transportation, because I'm convinced that it \nyields tremendous benefits for our people and our economy. For years, \nour Nation has underinvested in transportation. And we are paying the \nprice for that--in deteriorating roads, in snarling traffic, and in \ncrumbling bridges and deteriorating rail systems.\n  Mr. President, when you compare transportation to other functions \nwithin the Government, this agreement treats transportation relatively \nwell. I pushed hard in the negotiations for additional resources, and \nwe were able to find over $8 billion more than the President's request \nover the next 5 years. That was a major increase from where we began.\n  Is it enough? No, it's not. But the bottom line is that there just \naren't enough resources to balance the budget while doing everything \nwe'd like. Compared with most parts of the Government, transportation \ndoes very well in this budget. And I'm hopeful we can identify even \nmore resources as the legislative process moves forward.\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\n  Let me turn briefly to another area of particular interest to me, the \nenvironment. This budget agreement confirms that the environment is a \npriority. It commits the congressional leadership to fully fund \nenvironmental protection and natural resources. And it specifically \nprotects the President's funding requests for operations of the EPA and \nthe National Park Service's operation of the National Park System and \nthe Everglades. In addition, the agreement reserves funds for cleaning \nup hazardous waste sites, assuming we can reach an agreement on policy \nissues concerning Superfund, which I expect will happen. Finally, the \nagreement provides an additional $700 million for priority land \nacqusitiions and exchanges.\n  Mr. President, before I close, let me once again say how much a \nprivilege it has been for me to work with the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. We have spent many, many hours \ntogether over the past several weeks. And the more I have gotten to \nknow him, the more I have come to respect and like him. He is an \nhonorable man who genuinely cares about our country, even if we often \ndisagree. And he is a strong negotiator.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to publicly thank the other \nnegotiators who have worked so hard to make this agreement a reality. \nFirst, Congressmen John Kasich and John Spratt, men of totally \ndifferent styles who share a common commitment to hard work and serious \npolicymaking. And Frank Raines, John Hilley, and Gene Sperling of the \nadministration, all of whom did a tremendous job in pulling this \nagreement together. The President has put together a very impressive \nteam.\n  I also want to acknowledge the many contributions of Democratic \nSenators on the Budget Committee who have worked with us on this \nagreement.\n  Senators Hollings, Conrad, Feingold and Johnson have all been vocal \nand effective advocates for truth in budgeting, and for a plan that \nmakes real progress in addressing our long-term deficit problems. They \nhave held our feet to the fire, and deserve real credit for that.\n  Senator Sarbanes has taken the lead to ensure that the burdens of \ndeficit reduction are distributed fairly. I know he still has some \nconcerns about the resolution, but I want to thank him for his input as \nthe process has moved forward.\n  Senators Boxer and Murray have been outspoken advocates for our \nchildren. They have demanded that we do a better job of covering our \nuninsured young people, and that we not make dangerous changes in the \nMedicaid Program that could jeopardize health care for our Nation's \nmost vulnerable citizens. Their efforts will touch the lives of \nmillions of Americans.\n  Senator Wyden has been unrelenting in his demand that we modernize \nMedicare, that we provide additional health care choices for senior \ncitizens, and that we protect the long-term solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund. No Senator has been more devoted to the future of this \ncritical program, or more determined to make it work.\n  Last but not least, Senator Durbin has in many ways been the \nconscience of our efforts in recent weeks. He has demanded that \nordinary Americans, especially those with modest incomes, be treated \nfairly as we reduce the deficit. And he has helped lead the fight to \nrestore critically needed protections for legal immigrants and \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I know that many of my fellow Democrats have been \nfrustrated with the process that led to this agreement. And I share \nthat frustration. This was not the process that I wanted. But we have \ndone our best under the circumstances to maximize consultation with \ncommittee members, and with all Senate Democrats. And I am optimistic \nthat, in the end, most of my colleagues will be pleased with the end \nproduct.\n  Finally, I want to congratulate President Clinton for his leadership \nin this effort. We are here today on a bipartisan basis only because \nthe President decided to make it happen. He deserves enormous credit \nfor that. And I think his commitment will be appreciated and \nacknowledged for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, let me close this way. I don't think there's anyone \nwho is entirely happy with this agreement. But while nobody sees it as \nperfect , everyone should see it as a good compromise. It's fair and \nit's balanced. And it will serve America well.\n  It will balance the budget. It will invest in education and training. \nIt will provide tax relief to the middle class. It will protect \nMedicare and Medicaid. It will provide health care coverage to millions \nof children. It will throw a life vest to disabled legal immigrants. It \nwill invest in transportation, and in environmental protection. And it \nwill make life better for millions of ordinary, working Americans.\n  I close, Mr. President, with saying my thanks and appreciation to my \nstaff who worked so hard on the Budget Committee--Bruce King, Sander \nLurie, and Sue Nelson--and all of the members of the staff of the \nBudget Committee for their effort. We all did what we thought was right \nfor America. I am proud to have been a part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire of the number of \nSenators present on the floor--which pleases me to no end. Normally at \nthis hour at this stage of the budget resolution nobody is interested. \nSenator Dodd was here first. Might I inquire what he intends to do, so \nwe kind of know?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. My intention was to \noffer an amendment at the appropriate time. I thought if I got here \nearly, I would be high on the list, if not first, to offer my \namendment. I will defer any comment on the bill itself and reserve time \nto offer an amendment favorably on the budget agreement that was \nreached. That is my purpose.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Sarbanes?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it was my intention to offer a statement \nabout the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Byrd? I am not trying to limit or anything of \nthis sort.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I expect to \nspeak about 20 minutes. It will not be on the budget resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will take the time off the resolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well, if you will allow me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Indeed.\n  Senator Wellstone?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It is my intention to speak on the bill in general and \nto try to analyze the overall agreement. I will in all likelihood join \nwith Senator Dodd in his amendment later.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think we have established in the \nbeginning that we would go from side to side in recognition. If it is \nall right with my colleagues, I would like to give Senator Byrd the 20 \nminutes that he has asked for and permit him to speak as he wishes at \nthis juncture.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nyield to me for just a moment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to leave Senator Gorton in my stead here in \na minute or so. Whatever rights have been designated to me by the \nleader I designate to him under the statute. I am not going to try to \nmake any further allotment. But if there are no Republicans forthcoming \nafter Senator Byrd, then I will have no objection to whomever you \nchoose next, and I will ask you to hold the amendments until some of \nthese speeches are finished. Then we can kind of pile some of those up, \nand that is what people would like to do. I shouldn't use that word. \nThat carries with it some resonance that is not so nice. We will try to \nstack them like beautiful lumber.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Do they grow lumber in New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They grow anything you like in New Mexico. It is all \nsweet, aromatic, and beautiful.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a few points.\n  First of all, I am very glad, even though I did not intend to during \nthis budget debate, to go through a litany of what Republicans have \nstood for and what we have accomplished, nor do I intend at this moment \nto go through all of the things the President asked\n\n[[Page S4724]]\n\nfor that he didn't get. I would like to make just a couple of comments.\n  First of all, I believe that I should be very proud of being a \nRepublican because I don't believe without Republicans pushing for a \nbalanced budget this President would ever have gotten to the point \nwhere he would have been for a balanced budget, much less negotiating \none with us. I think history will reveal that. It was very hard to get \nhim to come to that point.\n  I am not now offering this as a critical thing but merely saying that \nRepublicans--since my friend Senator Lautenberg chose to have a great \nlitany of Democratic things the Democratic Party has done--I am very \npleased to be part of the party that actually pushed this country and \nits leaders to get a balanced budget.\n  Second, I would like to say I am unabashed in talking about tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that our philosophy and our idea \nis that tax dollars don't belong to the Government, that they belong to \nthe people who earned it, and that the Government ought to take from \nthe people only that minimum amount needed leaving the people as free \nas possible.\n  I believe that before we are finished, many middle-income families \nwill be receiving some of their money back. We will not be saying that \nwe are refunding taxes to them. They will be keeping some of their \nmoney, which we are hopeful as time passes they can keep more and more \nof as we make Government more and more efficient.\n  The country with the most individual freedom is the country that is \ngoing to achieve the most. And one measurement of that over time is \ngoing to be the level of taxation that the Government chooses by virtue \nof which they take from people rather than leave money with people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, two weeks ago, on May 6, 1997, a military \njury sentenced an Army staff sergeant to 25 years in prison for raping \nsix female trainees, just one of a series of highly visible scandals \nregarding sexual relations now plaguing training facilities in the \nArmy. Press reports indicate that hundreds of similar cases of alleged \nsexual abuse and discrimination have been reported and are being \ninvestigated at other military training commands around the country. On \nMay 10, 1997, the senior enlisted soldier in the U.S. Army was charged \nwith similar offenses. The extent of the scandals that have been \nunearthed at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, as well as other \nfacilities, indicates to me that the time has arrived for a thorough \nreview of further gender-integrated training in the military. There are \nthose who feel that same-sex training has failed as a training \nmechanism and is adversely affecting morale, discipline and the \nintegrity of our armed forces. This is a serious situation, involving \nvery serious allegations with possible repercussions on our national \nsecurity. The situation needs to be examined with a dispassionate \nattitude, and it greatly complicates our task if well-meaning advocacy \ngroups in our country make the assumption that anyone who calls for a \nthorough investigation of the viability of gender integrated training \nand operational roles is per se, a bigot, is against equal treatment \nand opportunity, and is trying to roll the clock back because of his or \nher narrow vision.\n  The Senate Armed Services committee held a hearing on this matter on \nFebruary 4, 1997, at which the Army leadership testified. Certainly one \nof the issues we need to understand is the pervasiveness of sexual \nmisconduct in the services. Are these isolated incidents we have been \nreading about, or are there systemic problems rooted in the integration \nof the armed forces and the environments in which they must train and \noperate? There was some testimony before the committee that these \nincidents are akin to the proverbial few bad apples in the barrel, and \nthat what needs to be done is emphasize right and wrong, professional \nbehavior, and punish unprofessional behavior. But, Mr. President, the \nnumbers involved here tell a different story. The Army established a \nhot line for women to report sexual harassment, misconduct, or abuse \nlast fall when the first incidents were reported. In a little over two \nand a half months, that hot line received about 7,000 phone calls. That \nis an astonishing and disturbing number. It takes little courage to \nmake such a phone call. One wonders how many phone calls, on top of the \n7,000, that should have been made were not made for fear of \nretaliation, or just reticence. Now, the Secretary of the Army \ntestified that by February the number of calls on the hot line had \n``tapered off'' to about 50 a week. This is not indicative to me of \njust a few bad apples in the barrel. More than one thousand of those \ncalls have generated an investigation of some kind. Furthermore, recent \nsurveys taken by the Defense Manpower Data Center Survey indicated that \nlarge numbers of women reported one or more incidents of unwanted \nsexual attention. In 1988-89, 68 percent of women reported such \nincidents. In 1995 a similar survey got similar results, with 61 \npercent of the women in the Army reporting such incidents. So this is \nnot just your random, marginal population. There is a serious, central \nproblem that needs to be looked at.\n  This is not just about sexual harassment among soldiers of equal \nrank. It is about that, but it is about much more, it is about the use \nof power and authority of sergeants and officers whom we put in \nauthority, over the recruits and junior people whom they are \nresponsible to train and look after. It is about raw abuse of power of \na shocking, crude kind. It is about power and sexual misconduct. It \nleads one to ask a fundamental question: are women actually safe in the \nU.S. military? As Senator Snowe said during that hearing: ``As we \nincorporate the sexes together in tighter and tighter situations, at \nhigher and higher stress situations, in more confined situations, \ncommon sense tells us that we are going to be dealing with a very \ndifficult problem. Is there a danger that we are trying to minimize the \nvery real differences here between men and women? Might there really be \nenough significant distinctions between being a man and being a woman \nthat we should be more discriminating, not less, in terms of \nassignments and utilization?''\n  The Chief of Staff of the Army, Mr. Joe Reimer, testified at the \nArmed Services hearing that this is an issue that is not about policy, \nand instead it is an issue about right and wrong. That is, it is not \nabout whether we should have women in the military, but whether we can \nexpect our sergeants and officers in authority to carry out their job \nproperly, not use their power to engage in misconduct. But, I think \nthat just begs the question. While it is about right and wrong, it is \nalso surely about policy. It is about in what situations, what kinds of \ntraining, what kinds of operations, women and men can work effectively \nin the military, and in what kinds of training and operations \nsituations the sexual diversion is just too difficult a factor. For \ninstance, we have had gender integrated training in the military since \n1974, but we have only had such training of recruits in the military \nfor the last three years. It is in the recruit training situation that \nwe are certainly experiencing very serious problems, and surely that \nneeds to be revisited now. I note that there is legislation moving \nthrough the other body to prohibit mixed recruit training. That is one \nnatural reaction to the situation, as I now understand it, and that is \nthe approach that I would support.\n  But I think the better policy question is this: are we putting people \ninto situations that put at risk our goal of an effective trained \ncombat force with high morale, discipline and unit cohesiveness, making \nthat goal more difficult to achieve than it should be? Are we putting \ntemptations in the face of people and saying to them, ``overcome those \ntemptations?''\n  The U.S. military goal is not to change basic human nature. It is to \nmold that nature for very specific military tasks. We do not need a \nmajor sociological analysis to know that sexual tension between men and \nwomen is affected by the environment in which\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\nthey are placed. Surely every military activity, and particularly \nrecruit training, and high tension battlefield environments, are the \nkinds of environments wherein we need to be particularly attentive to \nthe burdens we are placing on normal American men and women.\n  It certainly should be clear that integrating men and women in the \ntraining, and into the combat forces of the military, introduces an \nexplosive new element into the attempt to create an effective fighting \nforce. The ultimate, bottom-line question should be this: what is the \nimpact of sexual integration on the battlefield? The purpose of an Army \nis to fight, and to win. If gender integration enhances the prospects \nof readiness, and effectiveness in combat, then we should all be for \nit. If it reduces American effectiveness on the battlefield, should we \nbe for gender integration on the general grounds of social equality? I, \nfor one, think the question answers itself, and the answer is no. \nPerhaps the facts are not all in. There are few, if any models around \nthe world, of other modern, effective Armies which have gender-\nintegrated their forces. So we are breaking new ground in America on \ngender integrated training, particularly when it comes to combat roles. \nIn plain words, we are conducting an experiment.\n\n  I think that the scandals which we are seeing in the training \ncommands must be taken as a danger sign that sexual integration \ncomplicates an Army's fighting capabilities, in that it introduces a \nnew element which diverts the focused attention on winning battles that \nan Army must have.\n  It seems completely obvious to me that living and training in close \nquarters puts a strain and a stress on people's behavior. Furthermore, \nthe effect of confined environments where men and women work and live \nin close quarters certainly involves sexual issues. It is laughable to \nassume otherwise. Sexual issues involve not just breaking the rules on \nfraternization and sexual relations, per se, but involve perceptions of \nfavoritism in unit life which can negatively affect the cohesiveness, \nmorale, and discipline that are the critical ingredients of success in \nmilitary life, and success in combat. Whether one believes in equality \namong men and women is not the issue here. In the special world of \nmilitary life where the ultimate mission of fighting and winning is \nuniquely different from all other environments and roles in civilian \nlife, the issue is the national security of our nation and how best to \nmaintain it with the most effective fighting force.\n  There is no real reason for social experimentation in mixing the \nsexes at all levels of military life and functions. Certainly this does \nnot mean women cannot be as successful as men in all or certainly most \nof the levels of work in the military. But this may only be true with \ntwo caveats. First, because women are not as a rule as physically able \nto meet harsh combat conditions, they start with a disadvantage. This \nreality is central to the consideration by the Marine Corps not to \ninclude women in infantry units. Second, the relations among the sexes \npresent an irreducible diversion which complicates the effectiveness of \ncombat units. The Marines train women and men separately as recruits, \nand have found that it works best for them. After initial recruit \ntraining, they are trained together, except for the unique function of \ncombat training, since women do not serve in Marine infantry units.\n  It is not at all clear to me that there is any body of evidence that \na force trained on a gender-integrated basis performs better in combat \nthan a force trained on a segregated basis. More to the essential \npoint, there is no credible body of evidence showing that gender-\nintegrated combat forces, such as infantry forces, perform better than \nall male units. Before we extend our desire to treat women fairly and \nequally with men, a bedrock working principle of American society, we \nneed to satisfy ourselves that the conditions under which men fight are \nactually conducive to fielding integrated units. Indeed, it would \nbe folly to assume that the natural attractions, jealousies and \ndiversions that close sexual quarters enhance can be overcome by \nissuing an edict that professionalism only will be permitted. It is \nquite clearly the case, as Aberdeen and other scandals indicate to me, \nthat gender-integrated training is having a very bumpy ride, and we \nshould review the kinds of integrated training that will work, and the \nkinds of gender-integrated training that will not work.\n\n  Mr. President, there must be ways to thoroughly examine, review, and \nevaluate the reasons for the recent spate of scandals regarding sexual \nrelations in training commands. Such a study should be made by an \nindependent blue-ribbon body with unquestioned credentials--with no \nsocial agenda, but geared solely to the effect of gender integration at \nall levels of the military, in support as well as combat roles, in \ntraining recruits as well as seasoned soldiers--to evaluate the impacts \nsolely on our national security. In the meantime, until such a review \ncan be done and fully considered by the Congress, I intend to propose \nan amendment to the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense \nauthorization bill which would suspend the continuation of gender-\nintegrated recruit training in all the services, as is currently the \ncase with regard to the Marine Corps.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4724-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4725-S4744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as we are going back and forth, I will \ntake a very few moments and then yield to one of my Democratic \ncolleagues, so I yield such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, the parentage of this successful budget resolution is \nardently sought by many. Only failure is an orphan. In this case--I \nhope not to drive the metaphor too far--I believe that many properly \nmay claim parentage of the resolution that is before us here.\n  In the decade and a half during which I have served in the U.S. \nSenate, this budget resolution marks two firsts. It is the first \nresolution that genuinely will yield us, when passed and enforced, to a \nbalanced budget, to a situation in which we will no longer be piling \ndebt upon debt on the backs of our children and our grandchildren. It \nis also, remarkably, the first budget resolution during that period of \ntime that seems likely to pass with significant majorities in favor of \nit from both political parties.\n  As I look back on the history that has led to this point, I reflect \non the fact that members of the Democratic Party and the President of \nthe United States can claim some credit in moving in this direction for \nthe highly controversial resolution that they proposed and passed \nwithout any support from the Republican Party some 4 years ago. Our \npredictions that that resolution would have dire consequences did not, \nin fact, turn out to be the case. We may still believe that a different \ncourse of action would have had even better results, but, obviously, at \nthis point we cannot prove that. The Senator from New Jersey has \nalready spoken to that proposition.\n  At the same time, 2 years later, when the Republicans became a \nmajority in both the House and in the Senate, we passed and attempted \nto enforce a budget resolution more dramatic even than the one that is \nbefore us today, with its reform of entitlement programs, its securing \nof Medicare for many, many years to come, and in the tax relief that it \nprovided for the American people.\n  Ultimately, the enforcing mechanism for that budget resolution was \nsuccessfully vetoed by President Clinton, but, nonetheless, it charted \na new and different course of action for the American economy and \nespecially for the way in which the Congress and the President \ndetermined spending and taxing priorities.\n  Before the President vetoed the results of that budget resolution, he \nhad, for the first time, committed himself to balancing the budget. I \nthink, again, many Members of this side discounted that commitment, as \nwe believed that it was not carried out by the policies that he \nrecommended pursuant to his commitment to a balanced budget. But \nnevertheless, the debate then became not whether to balance the budget \nbut how. That debate, a debate separating the two political parties, \ncontinued until just a short few weeks ago.\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\n  At that point, the President, the leaders of the Republican Party in \nboth the House and the Senate, with the assent of much of the \nDemocratic leadership, reached an agreement, not only on the ultimate \ngoal but on the means by which to reach that goal, and it is some of \nthe details of that agreement which, after further negotiation, are a \npart of the budget resolution that is before us this afternoon.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has outlined many of the elements of this \nbudget resolution which he believes meet the agenda of his party and of \nthe President of the United States. Ours on this side may be fewer, but \nwe think they may be more profound. We have reached the goal we have \nsought without wavering and without compromise: of a resolution that \nwould, in real terms, promise a balance to the Federal budget with \nlower interest rates, with a fiscal dividend that that would bring with \nit. And we are now right at the edge of meeting that goal.\n  We have succeeded in crafting a budget resolution and getting \nagreement to a budget resolution which will provide real genuine tax \nrelief for the American people, for American families with children, \nfor farmers and small businessmen, and estate tax relief, for investors \nand for job creators in the realm of capital gains, and we have also \nsucceeded, at least modestly, in getting agreement to the beginnings of \ncertain reforms in the entitlement programs, which are almost \nexclusively responsible for spending increases each and every year for \ndecades that outpaced both inflation and the growth of our economy.\n  Government will not grow as a result of this resolution at anything \nlike the rapidity it would have grown without it. The distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, has, in \nthis illustration, shown what happens with respect to the budget \ndeficit, even including the tax relief that is an integral part of this \nresolution today.\n  So we will have more modest spending than would otherwise have been \nthe case. We will have tax relief for the American people. We will have \na balanced budget due to the diligence of the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico and the broad support he has from his own party, due to \nthe eloquence and hard work of the majority leader, the Senator from \nMississippi, and the wonderful relationship he and the Senator from New \nMexico created for one another, due to the hard work of many members of \nthe Democratic Party and of the President and his advisers, and perhaps \nnot least in all of the credit that should be given here in the \nparenting of this budget resolution would go to those outsiders led by \nthe Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] and the Senator from \nLouisiana [Mr. Breaux] who last year created a bipartisan budget \nresolution, with all of the elements that this one has--some to a more \ndramatic extent than this one has--and came within four votes of \ncarrying that resolution on the floor of this U.S. Senate, even though \nthey were opposed by the leadership in both parties and by the \nPresident of the United States. Many of the elements of their proposal \nare included today, but they blazed the trail for a degree of \nbipartisan cooperation that had not previously existed.\n\n  So for my part at least, Mr. President, I am delighted to give credit \nwhere credit is due and to say that credit is extremely widely spread. \nI trust that after listening to the debate today and tomorrow--I hope \nnot longer than that--that the resolution that is before us will not \nhave been significantly changed by amendment, that it will be passed by \na very substantial bipartisan majority, a majority of both parties, and \nthat it will then be properly carried out and properly enforced by all \nof those who have supported it, for which the Congress and the \nPresident will deserve credit and thanks from the people of the United \nStates, both for their responsibility and for having created the \nopportunities for greater economic growth and greater prosperity for \nthe people of the United States.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield so much time as the Senator \nfrom Maryland wants to use to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, in 1993, just 4 years ago, in order to reduce the \ndeficit, the Congress, by a narrow margin, enacted a budget resolution \nwhich curtailed programs and increased taxes. The increase in taxes \nprimarily impacted those at the upper end of the income scale.\n  This combination of spending restraint and revenue increases \nrepresents a logical way of dealing with the deficit issue. When you \nare trying to reduce and then eliminate the deficit, the logical way to \ndo it is to restrain spending and to seek additional revenues. That \ncombination, presumably, will result in lowering your deficits.\n  This approach has worked in a most impressive way. A flourishing \neconomy has brought unemployment below 5 percent for the first time in \n24 years. This chart shows the unemployment rate going back to 1971. As \nyou can see, with one exception, the unemployment rate now is the \nlowest it has been in this period. Back here, in 1973, is when it just \ndipped below 5 percent. It has now gone below 5 percent again.\n  While unemployment is at a 24-year low, inflation is at a 31-year \nlow, as is shown by this next chart, which shows the inflation rate \nfrom 1966 to 1996.\n  I do not know what better proof one can offer of a strong economy \nthan the low unemployment rate and the low inflation rate we are now \nexperiencing.\n  As a consequence of this flourishing economy, the deficit has \ndeclined on a steady basis since fiscal year 1992. In fiscal year 1992, \nthe deficit was at $290 billion. And it has come down in each \nsucceeding year, to $255 billion in 1993, $203 billion in 1994, $164 \nbillion in 1995, and to $107 billion in the last fiscal year, the year \nthat ended this past September 30. It is now expected to be below $70 \nbillion for the current fiscal year. In other words, we will have gone \nfrom a $290 billion deficit in 1992 on a straight downward trend, and \nwe are expecting a deficit under $70 billion for the fiscal year in \nwhich we now find ourselves.\n  As a percent of the gross domestic product, the deficit has declined \nin a most impressive way, from 4.9 percent in 1992 to 1.4 percent for \nthe fiscal year that ended this past September 30. As you can see from \nthis next chart, it declined from 4.9 percent in 1992 to 4.1 percent in \n1993 to 3.1 percent in 1994 to 2.3 percent in 1995 to 1.4 percent in \nthe fiscal year ending September 30, and it is now anticipated that the \ndeficit as a percent of gross domestic product will be less than 1 \npercent for the current fiscal year, the lowest percentage since 1974.\n  So you have the best unemployment rate in 24 years, the lowest \ninflation in 31 years, the lowest deficit as a percent of GDP in 23 \nyears.\n  By way of comparison, the Maastricht Agreement of the European \nCommunity, which established what are regarded as tough requirements \nfor the member nations, has as its goal the bringing of deficits down \nto under 3 percent of GDP--3 percent. We, at the end of this year, will \nbe down to less than 1 percent.\n  In fact, just comparing the United States with the other major \nindustrial countries, we see from this chart that our deficit as a \nshare of GDP is 1.4 percent. Japan is at 3.1 percent, Germany at 3.5 \npercent, Canada at 4.2 percent, France at 5 percent, the United Kingdom \nat 5.1 percent, and Italy at 7.2 percent.\n  Now, by any measure, this is a most impressive economic performance, \nand certainly a very impressive deficit reduction performance.\n  Given this performance, one would think that the wise policy would be \nto stay the course and finish the job. I mean, this is a spectacular \ncourse that I have outlined here that we have been following. So one \nwould assume that the wise policy would be to stay the course and \nfinish the job. Instead, the budget resolution before us combines \nspending restraint with tax cuts--I repeat, spending restraint with tax \ncuts.\n  Obviously, spending restraint, as in 1993, works in the direction of \ndeficit reduction. As I said at the outset, that is logical. You are \ntrying to bring the deficit down. Spending restraint works in the \ndirection of deficit reduction. But tax cuts work against deficit \nreduction. And the tax cuts contained in\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\nthis budget agreement will grow over time in a way that may well \njeopardize the goal of reaching and staying--and staying--in budget \nbalance.\n  The capital gains, inheritance, and IRA tax cuts, all of which are \nprovided for in the tax portion of this budget agreement, carry with \nthem the potential for substantial increases in future years.\n  In fact, this budget agreement recognizes such a trend line by \nproviding for $85 billion net tax cuts in the first 5 years, 1998 to \n2002, and almost double that, a net tax cut of $165 billion, in the \nnext 5 years, 2003 to 2007. No agreements were made as to the following \ndecade. But obviously, if we are concerned about the future strength \nand viability of the economy, it is important to look to the out years, \nto have some sense of where these trend lines may be taking us.\n  The budget agreement itself, in the tables accompanying the text of \nthe agreement, projects that in the 10th year of the agreement--in \nother words, at the end of the period when we are to have a total of \n$250 billion in tax cuts--the tax cuts would be $42 billion. Now this \nrepresents a rising trend line with respect to the tax cuts. In fact, \nthe projections are that the tax cuts will increase by $5 billion in \neach of the last 2 years of the 10-year agreement on which this \nresolution is based, that is from 2005 to 2006, and from 2006 to 2007.\n\n  If you are at $42 billion in the 10th year, then one can anticipate \ntwo scenarios for the following decade, from 2008 to 2017. If in fact \nthe cost of the taxes stayed at $42 billion a year for each of those \nyears, in other words, plateaued--a most unlikely assumption given the \ntrend line--you would then project $420 billion in tax cuts over the \nnext 10 years. If, however, the cuts continued to increase according to \nthe trend line established through the first 10 years, in other words, \nincreasing by $5 billion a year through 2017, you would have tax cuts \nof $700 billion in the following decade.\n  So we have a situation here where it is almost certain that the tax \ncuts that are part of this agreement will carry with them a rising \ntrend that will, in effect, undercut the deficit reduction effort. And \nI ask, is it not imprudent, indeed irresponsible to commit to such tax \ncuts before we have actually achieved budget balance and before we have \na more accurate and realistic view of whether it can be sustained?\n  We are talking about responsibility here. Yet we are undertaking in \nthis resolution to commit to tax cuts before we have actually achieved \nbudget balance and furthermore before we have a realistic and accurate \nview of whether budget balance can then be sustained.\n  I believe that the tax-reduction side of the budget agreement carries \nwith it the potential for undermining the deficit-reduction effort. \nFurthermore, the combination of program curtailment on the one hand and \ntax reduction on the other represents an inequitable allocation of the \nburdens of deficit reduction.\n  The impact of a reduction in programs will be felt by ordinary \nworking people primarily. The tax reductions, by contrast, will \nprimarily benefit those at the top end of the income and wealth scale.\n  Consider that 75 percent of the benefits of the capital gains tax can \nbe expected to go to those making over $100,000 a year, the top 5 \npercent of the population. The inheritance tax cut would benefit an \neven smaller percentage of the population. Yet this resolution that is \nbefore us imposes additional burdens on working people through program \nreductions.\n  In fact, the projections are that domestic discretionary programs \nwill be 10 percent below--10 percent below--the current service level, \nnamely, the level adjusted for inflation, in the year 2002. At the same \ntime that we have a 10-percent cut in programs, substantial tax \nreductions will be given to those at the apex of the income and wealth \npyramid. This is not fair or equitable.\n  A budget agreement should undertake equitable deficit reduction, \nnamely, apportioning the burdens in a way that it is reasonably spread \nacross the entire society, as was done in 1993, when ordinary working \npeople made their contribution through program reductions and those at \nthe top end of the income scale made their contribution through tax \nincreases.\n  But in this instance, we have working people bearing a burden through \nprogram reduction, but we can anticipate tax reductions which markedly \nbenefit those at the upper end of the income and wealth scale, and \nimpose no burden on these individuals.\n  Thus, this budget fails the equity test. A budget agreement should \nalso lead to lasting, long-term deficit reduction. As I have indicated, \nI am most apprehensive about this agreement because I foresee that we \nwill not be able, even if we were to reach balance in 2002--and there \nis some serious doubt about that under this agreement--to sustain that \nbalance in the subsequent decades. Thus, this agreement also fails the \nlong-term deficit reduction test.\n  In short, this budget agreement does not have either of the two \nessential attributes of a budget: equitable deficit reduction and \nlasting, long-term deficit reduction. Because of that, I do not support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask Senator Allard, do you want to offer an \namendment?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I do have an amendment at the desk, but I understand that \nSenator Dodd is going to offer an amendment before me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, that means we are going to have \nSenator Wellstone give his general speech because we are going with \ngeneral speeches ahead of amendments.\n  Is that all right with the Senator?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for their \ncourtesy.\n  Let me first of all start out by saying I associate myself with the \nremarks of Senator Sarbanes, the Senator from Maryland. Senator \nSarbanes talked about equitable deficit reduction. I emphasize the \nequitable part of that formulation.\n  Mr. President, those on both sides labored very hard. People make the \ndecisions they think are the right decisions. I do not rise to point an \naccusatory finger at any of my colleagues. As I look at this agreement, \nI do not see that equitable deficit reduction.\n  To give but one example, I see very little of the shared sacrifice, \nand I think to be shared sacrifice we would have to extend part of the \ndeficit reduction burden onto large and wealthy corporations and zero \nin on what has been called corporate welfare. That means some of our \nlarge multinational corporations--oil and gas, mining, pharmaceutical, \nhealth care conglomerates, and others--who now reap benefits of huge \nloopholes in our Tax Code, who are fed, if you will, at the trough of \nunjustified tax giveaways, would, in fact, be required to pay their \nfair share toward deficit reduction. They are the heavy hitters, the \nwell connected. They are the players. That is not a part of this budget \nagreement. I do not think what we have here is equitable deficit \nreduction.\n  I know a number of my colleagues, as they look at some of these \nloopholes and deductions or as they make the case for across-the-board, \nwhat I call kind of a scatter-gun approach to cuts in capital gains or \nestate tax, make the argument this will bolster the economy by boosting \nsavings and investments.\n  I cite a report by the Republican staff of the House Budget Committee \nfrom just a few short years ago:\n\n       Whether aimed at increasing efficiency or growth, many so-\n     called ``growth enhancements'' backfire. This is due to two \n     factors. First, few incentives are very powerful, and simply \n     do not result in large increases in output. Second, they \n     typically lose revenues, increasing government borrowing as a \n     consequence, and thus reducing the accumulation of private \n     capital as a result.\n\n  My friends say to me, ``But we are balancing the budget.'' I smile \nand say, ``We will see.'' My guess is, as I look at those who are in \ncontrol of the committees and especially are going to be dealing with \nthe tax legislation, it looks to me like we go toward indexing capital \ngains. It looks to me that we will have across-the-board cuts in \ncapital gains in estate not targeted to family business, not targeted \nto middle\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\nincome, with the lion's share of benefits going to the very top of the \nAmerican population.\n  Mr. President, studies have shown consistently that households with \nincomes of over $100,000 a year receive approximately 75 percent of the \ncapital gains income. If the goal is to provide relief to middle-income \ntaxpayers, that is one thing, but what is happening here is the vast \nmajority of the benefits go to those at the very top.\n  At the same time, as we look at capital gains or estate tax, if you \ntalk about family farmers or small businesses, fine. But I think that \nunder the cover of the problems of small family farmers and small \nbusiness people we are seeing in this budget agreement massive tax \nbreaks to those who least need it.\n  This estate tax goes to some of our families. Some of the families \nthat will benefit are Cargo Co., a family-owned company, or Mars Candy \nor Continental Grain. I suggest to you that the multinational \ncorporations hardly need more by way of more tax breaks.\n  Mr. President, I think many Democrats are going to vote for this \nbudget agreement but with far less enthusiasm than their public posture \nsuggests. They are hoping when the reconciliation bill fills in the \nblanks on the budget and it comes to the floor this summer, we will not \nexplode the deficits, and in addition, the critical investments in \nhealth care and education and children and all the rest that we believe \nin will, in fact, be there.\n  As I look at the record of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle over the last couple of years, I have seen a defeat of efforts to \ngo after corporate welfare. I have seen outrageous tax giveaways. I \nhave seen a relentless attack on those in society least able to protect \nthemselves, and I have seen very little standard of fairness when it \ncomes to deficit reduction. I have seen deficit reduction based upon \nthe path of least political resistance. Cut the benefits for those who \nare weakest --for children, for legal immigrants, for low- and \nmoderate-income people, but when it comes to the subsidies for large \noil companies or big insurance companies or some of the multinational \ncorporations, big grain companies, no; they need more by way of \nbenefits.\n  I agree with my colleague from Maryland, I fear, and I think there is \nevery reason to believe this based upon the pronouncements I have heard \nso far, that when we get to the tax part of this package we will see \nbackloaded cuts, indexing, and cuts in capital gains and estate taxes \nthat will explode the deficit as we move into the next millennium, at \nthe very time, I might add, Mr. President, that many of us baby boomers \ncome of age and we will have precious little by way of investment.\n\n  Mr. President, I have several amendments that I will propose. I will \nstart out joining with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. But \nI just want to highlight a few things I want to focus on.\n  First let me talk a little bit about child nutrition. The School \nBreakfast Program, currently 6.5 million children participate. That is \nbarely half of the children that are eligible. In the reform bill \npassed last year, all in the name of deficit reduction, we eliminated, \nwiped out grants for schools to start up the School Breakfast Program.\n  Anybody who understands anything about education, anybody who \nunderstands anything about children, anybody who spends any time in \nschools will certainly acknowledge the fact that children who come to \nschool hungry and cannot participate in school breakfast because we cut \nthe funding for this program, are not going to be able to do as well in \nschool as children who do not come to school hungry.\n  Where is the standard of fairness?\n  Mr. President, we also have a Summer Food Service Program, not real \nwell known. As a matter of fact, only 2 million out of 14 million \nchildren participate because we do not adequately fund it. But do you \nwant to know something, Mr. President? These children that really are \nso dependent upon school lunch and school breakfast, where it is \navailable, during the summer they are malnourished and do not have an \nadequate diet. We are able to fund only 2 million out of 14 million \nchildren. Mr. President, in my amendment I will call for increasing the \nfunding for this program.\n  Finally, I want to talk a little bit about school construction. My \nfriend Jonathan Kozol wrote a book called ``Savage Inequalities.'' He \ntraveled all across the country and reported on what he observed.\n  Mr. President, let me just make the point, I will not give specific \nexamples, but let me say to my colleagues, we have too many children \nwho go to rotting schools. What kind of message are we conveying to \nchildren in this country when they go to schools that are dilapidated, \nwith rotting infrastructure, toilets that do not work, cold in the \nwinter, too hot in the summer, crumbling buildings, decrepit? What kind \nof message are we conveying to these children? Are they not all God's \nchildren? Is there not some need for investment in infrastructure?\n  The General Accounting Office reported in 1994, that over all, it \nwould be about a $112 billion investment, and we want a $5 billion \ninvestment by way of a start as we move into the next century?\n  Mr. President, have I not heard before speeches given, the talk about \nthe importance of building a bridge to the next century? If we are not \ngoing to invest in rotting schools, if we are not going to invest in \nthe infrastructure of the schools our children attend in this country, \nif we are not willing to invest a little bit more in child nutrition \nprograms, if we are not willing to invest in some of what Senator \nDodd's amendment, an amendment I want to join in and I know others will \njoin, Head Start and Early Start, if we will not invest in children in \nthese very critical early years of their lives, how can this budget \nagreement be a blueprint or a bridge for moving into the next century?\n  My amendments will just simply say, take it out of corporate welfare \nand invest it in Head Start, child nutrition programs, and invest in \nthe infrastructure of schools in America for our children.\n  I have another amendment that will focus on some of the tax cuts that \nwill say scale down the capital gains tax cut, scale down the estate \ntax cut, target it to middle-income people, target it to small business \npeople, and target it to family farmers. Frankly, these large \nmultinational corporations do not need it, nor do the top 1 or 2 \npercent of the population. Instead, invest in children. Invest in \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, my final point, because I know we want to go on with \nthe amendments, my final point, we have in the last several months been \nreading in Time magazine, in Newsweek magazine, there was a White House \nconference on the importance of early childhood development and the \nargument that is made is that the neuroscience evidence tells us if we \ndo not do well for these children from the very beginning of their \nlives, if we to not do well with a mother expecting a child, in the \nvery early years up to age 3, many of these children will never come to \nschool ready to learn, and many of these children will never be \nprepared for life.\n  One out of every four children in America under the age of 3 are \npoor. And one out of every two children of color in America under the \nage of 3 are poor.\n  Mr. President, it is a scandal. It is unconscionable that we do not \nyet even fully fund the programs that we know work--Head Start, to give \nchildren a head start, nutrition programs so they do not come to school \nhungry, investment in infrastructure so the schools are inviting places \nas opposed to being decrepit and so demoralizing for children.\n\n  Mr. President, my amendments will say invest in these areas and take \nit out of the subsidies of these large multinational corporations or \nscale back these tax giveaways that go mainly to the top 1, 2, or 3 \npercent of the population.\n  To my colleagues, all of us have to make our own decisions, but for \nmy own part, I think this is a budget without a soul. Quite frankly, I \nsay to Democrats in particular, I think there comes a point in time \nwhere there are certain values and there are certain principles we hold \ndear. I think there comes a point in time when we cannot keep giving \nthe speeches about the importance of children, the importance of \neducation, the importance of equality of opportunity, the importance of \neach\n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\nand every child having the same opportunity to reach his and her full \npotential. We cannot keep giving those speeches if we do not match the \nlegislative lives that we live with the words that we speak.\n  I will join with Senator Dodd in his amendment, and I will have other \namendments on the floor, and I will raise this issue over and over and \nover again. I will raise this question over and over and over again.\n  I do not believe this is a budget that calls for equitable deficit \nreduction. I do not believe this is a budget that is a bridge to the \nnext century. I do not believe this is a budget that gives children in \nour country, every child--they are all God's children--the same \nopportunity to reach their full potential.\n  I do not think this is a budget that invests in our future, because \nthis budget, as opposed to being a new deal for too many children in \nAmerica, is a raw deal for too many children in America, and that makes \nthis budget unfair and that makes this budget wrong and that makes this \nbudget not the best that we can do for children in America. Therefore, \nI will oppose this budget agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as previously agreed, Senator \nDodd was to be recognized for 10 minutes to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. If I could, I have discussed this with my colleague from \nColorado, and we will defer at this moment and let my colleague from \nColorado go first and I will follow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 293\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate about the Federal debt and \n  that the President should submit a budget proposal with a plan for \n                     repayment of the Federal debt)\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 293.\n       At the end of the budget resolution add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON REPAYMENT OF THE FEDERAL \n                   DEBT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Congress and the President have a basic moral and \n     ethical responsibility to future generations to repay the \n     Federal debt, including money borrowed from the Social \n     Security Trust Fund;\n       (2) the Congress and the President should enact a law that \n     creates a regimen for paying off the Federal debt within 30 \n     years; and\n       (3) if spending growth were held to a level one percentage \n     point lower than projected growth in revenues, then the \n     Federal debt could be repaid within 30 years.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the President's annual budget submission to Congress \n     should include a plan for repayment of the Federal debt \n     beyond the year 2002, including the money borrowed from the \n     Social Security Trust Fund; and\n       (2) the plan should specifically explain how the President \n     would cap spending growth at a level one percentage point \n     lower than projected growth in revenues.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I would like to begin by commending the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, in fact, the entire \nBudget Committee, Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, for their hard work and diligence in crafting the budget \nresolution.\n  While I am pleased that we have a budget resolution before the \nSenate, I believe that this document is not without faults and that \nimprovements can be made.\n  The people of Colorado elected me on the premise that I would utilize \nall the tools at my disposal to balance the budget. This is a promise \nthat I made to my constituents and a commitment that I do not take \nlightly.\n  In this light, I am pleased that the current budget debate is focused \non not ``if'' we are going to balance the budget, but ``how'' are we \ngoing to balance the budget. I believe that this is in and of itself a \nmoral victory for those of us who preach fiscal responsibility. Yet, we \nmust now begin the process of balancing the budget by 2002. The \nframework provided within the budget resolution is an excellent \nstarting point on which we can improve.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment talks about what we are going to be \ndoing today. The economy is strong. People have jobs. And the stock \nmarket is surging. History tells us, however, that this is not always \nthe case. Unfortunately, the budget resolution assumes economic growth \nover the next 5 years that is unmatched in this country's history. I am \na veterinarian. I am not an economist. But I do know that the document \nbefore us today must be able to account for a future that is not \nnecessarily as rosy.\n  On the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we are talking about the years \nthat are following after 2002. Let us say that we have eliminated the \ndeficit. Then what is the next step in the Congress? We need to begin \nto address the problem of the debt.\n  This amendment is a resolution that was adopted on the House side. It \nsays that in order to continue to move forward on the fiscal soundness \nof this country, we need to begin to pay down the debt, and we do that \nby spending less than what we bring in in revenues. The amount that I \nsuggested in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution is to spend 1 percent \nless than what comes in in revenues.\n  For example, if we have 5 percent in revenue that comes in in any one \nof the years, then we would spend out 4 percent. One percent would be \nmoved toward paying down the debt. If the Congress, both the House and \nthe Senate, will commit themselves to this type of plan to pay down the \ndebt, we can balance the budget and pay down the debt by the year 2023.\n  The debate so far in both the House and the Senate has been \nconcerning deficits that have been accumulating, and now we must move \ntoward paying those down. I am comfortable that the direction of \ndeficit spending is moving down. But once we eliminate deficit \nspending, then I think we have to begin to look at paying down the \ndebt.\n  The debt is reflected in this budget by the interest that we are \npaying on the debt, which is running somewhere around $245 billion a \nyear, about 15 percent of our total budget. That is almost as much as \nwhat we pay for defense.\n  So we put ourselves at considerable liability as we move through the \nyears after 2002 because we do not know what the interest rates are \ngoing to be. We do not know whether they are going to be 2 percent, or \n6 percent, and heaven forbid if they ever get into the double-digit \ninflation rates and interest rates that we had in the late 1970's.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to begin to pay down that total debt \nso we don't have that unknown liability that this country will be \nfacing year after year. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution is to point \nout to the Senate that there is a potential problem.\n  So I am asking that this amendment be adopted so that we can begin \nconsidering a plan that says that we will begin paying down the debt by \nspending 1 percent per year less than comes in in revenues, which would \neliminate our debt around the year 2023, which would indeed put this \ncountry on a very sound fiscal and financial basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, we are prepared to accept the \namendment and yield time back off the amendment, if the Senator from \nColorado agrees with that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Is there any reason to ask for the yeas and nays? Is the floor \nmanager ready for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, it was my understanding that this \namendment was going to be offered and dealt with on a voice vote. As \nfar as I know, there is no further debate required. If that is the \ncase, then I suggest that we move in that direction.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, if the Senator from New Jersey will \nyield, I agree to a voice vote and ask for a voice vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. To my colleague, the manager at the moment, we will \naccept this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Colorado.\n  The amendment (No. 293) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by \nwhich the amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Under a previous agreement, Madam President, I \nyield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, unfortunately, it is our obligation \nto yield time to our people.\n  So, is the Senator from Connecticut ready?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, Madam President.\n  If my colleague will yield, I would like to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss the budget proposal generally, and then I will be offering an \namendment on behalf of myself and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. \nJeffords] and others. We have not reached any agreement on time, but I \nam sensitive to the needs of the committee to move along. I don't \nintend to take a long time on the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. With that understanding, Madam President, I would \ncertainly be willing to yield as much time as the Senator from \nConnecticut requires.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I would like to spend a few minutes on the \noverall budget agreement. I know several of my colleagues have talked \nabout it earlier today.\n  I had the privilege of serving on the Budget Committee for a number \nof years with the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nDomenici, and my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, and my \ncolleague from South Carolina, whom I see on the floor, Senator \nHollings, and others.\n  It was involuntary servitude, I would say. Serving on the Budget \nCommittee was not a position that I sought at all. I was asked to go on \nthe committee and I served there for a number of years. I enjoyed my \nservice. But it can be a thankless task in many ways to be on the \nBudget Committee.\n  So, I begin these brief remarks by commending the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking Democrat, Senator Lautenberg, for their \ntremendous effort. It is not easy to put these agreements together, \nthis year in particular. Over the last several months, we have seen a \nmajor effort here to come up with a budget agreement that would bring \nthe Federal budget into balance over the next 5 years. I commend them \nfor their efforts.\n  I must say that despite reservations that we all have, I don't know \nof a single Member of this body who wouldn't have written a different \nagreement had they been king or queen for a day.\n  So I begin by complimenting my colleagues and endorsing their work \nwith reservations. I will offer an amendment to do a bit better for \nHead Start, Healthy Start and child care issues.\n\n  I support this agreement. Obviously, I am going to watch what happens \nin the amendment process and reserve final judgment. I respect, as \nwell, my colleagues on both sides who will have strong feelings about \nthis agreement. But, as it stands today, I think the authors have done \na pretty good job with this budget agreement.\n  In 1981, I voted against that budget agreement. In my view, that deal \nwent way too far. As has been pointed out already, this agreement is \nvastly different from the 1981 agreement that created such huge \ndeficits from which we still are recovering. In many ways, today's \nagreement is an effort to really try to solve the problem that began \nback almost 16 years ago with that vote and the problems which were \ncreated by that legislation.\n  David Stockman, who many may have forgotten, was the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget at that time. He has since written a \nwonderful book about that agreement, ``The Triumph of Politics,'' which \nI strongly urge my colleagues to read if they want to know the history \nof what happened in 1981 when this earlier agreement was reached \ncausing the deficit to reach the magnitude that we have seen in the \nlast number of years.\n  So this agreement I think needs to be seen in a broader context. It \nis the culmination of a 4-year effort by the President and supporters \nin this body and the other to try to come up with a budget that would \nprotect American families, that would allow us to reduce that deficit \nand reduce interest rates, which are like a tremendous tax people pay \nwhen they buy homes or automobiles. Obviously, as we have seen over the \nlast several years, the declining deficit has contributed significantly \nto the growth and expansion in this country.\n  When the President came to office 4 years ago we had an annual \ndeficit of some $290 billion. That annual deficit has been reduced to \n$67 billion, a major achievement over the last 4 years that has brought \nsignificant prosperity to this country. We have seen 12 million new \njobs created, the lowest average inflation since John F. Kennedy was \nPresident; median family income rise over $1,600, and the list goes on \nand on of effects of the improved economy in this country.\n  Without this progress, obviously, we would never have what we have \ntoday, and that is the first credible chance in a generation to \nactually eliminate the deficit completely. I believe that we must take \nadvantage of this chance, and that is why I will support this \nresolution, provided that it is not amended beyond recognition. It is a \ngood framework for a budget that achieves real balance while protecting \nour Nation's most important priorities. It is, of course, as I said \nonly a framework. We will have to see what the details will be before \nultimate passage.\n  Obviously, there will be two sets of debates, the one that we will go \nthrough on the outlay side, and then, of course, on the tax-cut \nproposals, the specifics of which we will not see until the fall, and \nthat will be another debate. I myself am going to be interested, as my \ncolleagues will be, to see the details of the tax plan that is passed \nby the Finance Committee.\n  Any final tax bill should be designed, I think all of us would agree, \nso that its cost in the out years is limited. And I listened very \ncarefully to the remarks of my colleague from Maryland, Senator \nSarbanes. I know my colleague from South Carolina will address this \nissue in part. Their concerns should not go unheeded because there is a \nlegitimate concern about what happens at the end of this process. And \nif we end up where we were at the end of the 1981 process, with an \nexplosion in the deficit, obviously, we may look back on this agreement \nand wish we had done otherwise.\n  But nonetheless, I think it strikes a good balance here with tax cuts \nin the education field. I for one might reserve any tax cuts until we \nactually got down to zero. I think there is a lot of legitimacy in that \nargument. But I accept the notion that that is not going to happen, \nthat we are going to have some tax cuts here, and some, like the \npostsecondary education tax cuts, can actually be helpful to many \nfamilies.\n  I would note as well that in addition to these tax cuts, there are \nlarge increases in discretionary spending on education. For instance, \nthe Pell grant is increased to a historic high of $3,000 a year. Many \nof us have fought for this program, which we think is tremendously \nimportant, for years. There also is real progress in the area of \nchildren's health insurance. Obviously, we will have a chance with the \nKennedy-Hatch proposal tomorrow to do even more in that regard. But \nnonetheless, I would be less than honest if I did not commend the \nbudgeters for doing a lot in moving in the right direction.\n  Madam President, I think the budget agreement is pretty good and one \nthat I think is going to help the country. This has not been an easy \nprocess. There have been weeks and weeks of discussion. I respect that. \nI also respect the fact that each and every one of us here as \nindividual Members of this body have the right certainly and obligation \nwhere we disagree to offer some changes to this agreement.\n  And so for those reasons I will be offering an amendment that will \nincrease funding for Head Start, Healthy Start, and child care. These \nare three issues that I have spent a good part of my entire career in \nthis body working on. In fact, the Presiding Officer and I, in years \npast, worked on a number of issues together, as I have with a number of \nmy colleagues here. I never would have passed the original child care \ndevelopment block grant legislation if it had not been for my colleague \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, who joined in bringing that bill together.\n\n  On the issue of Head Start, there have been a lot of people here who \nsupported the efforts over the years to do\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\nmore. I noted in this budget, there is a determination to serve 1 \nmillion children by 2002 in Head Start. That is certainly progress; it \nis an increase of 200,000 over where we are today. But I think we can \ndo better over 5 years. We should ensure that all eligible children are \nserved. We know it works so well and makes such a difference in \nchildren's lives. Particularly now with welfare reform, we are going to \nhave so many more families that are going to need to have child care or \nHead Start. It is clear we are coming up short in this area. Serving 1 \nmillion children in Head Start is a laudable goal--but it is far short \nof what is needed. With this amendment over 1.4 million children \neligible and in need would receive Head Start services.\n  In addition, this amendment would triple the size of the Early Head \nStart Program, which serves that critical zero to 3 group. We see so \nmany of these families now that have these new infants, with Early Head \nStart, we can make a real difference in these children and their \nfamilies to provide them a safe, quality environment where these \ninfants will be while the parents go to work.\n  Welfare reform is all about getting people off welfare and into jobs. \nHowever, we know, and the Governors tell us, there will be tremendous \nneed in the child care area. If we are going to move these families off \nwelfare and public assistance into a working environment, there must be \nsomeone to care for these children.\n  I do not know of anyone who disagrees with that. No one wants to see \nchildren wander neighborhoods or in makeshift baby-sitting operations. \nIn every State, there are horror stories of what has happened when \nparents have left children unattended and uncared for. We have had \ndreadful stories in my State in the last year alone; some five deaths \nhave occurred in these settings that are far from high quality. I am \nnot suggesting you are going to solve every one of those problems, but \nat a most basic level, none of us here could come to work each day if \nwe had a child that we did not have someone to care for. We would miss \nvotes, we would miss committee hearings, if it were a question of \nplacing our child in a unsafe environment. And there is not one of our \nconstituents who would disagree with that. We would be indicted \npublicly for irresponsibility.\n  This is a fine agreement, but we can do better in this area. This \namendment would provide Head Start to 400,000 more children, it doubles \nthe size of the child care development block grant and addresses infant \nmortality. When we are talking about $85 billion in tax cuts--and I do \nnot disagree with that--do not tell me we cannot find over 5 years less \nthan $15 billion to deal with Early Head Start, Head Start, Healthy \nStart, and child care so that these kids and families can really have \nthe kind of support they need in their lives.\n  That is the intent of this amendment that I am offering on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Jeffords, Senator Murray, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nWell- \nstone, and Senator Landrieu to this resolution. We think it is a modest \nrequest to make. It is not as if we do not respect the work of the \nBudget Committee. I also feel we can do a bit better here.\n  I support the hard work of those who put this agreement together, but \nlet us not suggest somehow that this is totally inviolate. Some \nsuggestions we might offer here would make this a better bill in our \nview. I think quality child care is one of those issue. I know very few \nof my colleagues who disagree with that. I know of no one who disagrees \nwith Head Start, the work its done, and the Early Head Start Program. A \nfew more dollars here, shaving off a bit on one end to provide a bit \nmore on the other is really not too much to ask to make this agreement \nthat much more worthwhile.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 296\n\n (Purpose: To improve funding of critical programs to assist infants, \n toddlers and young children by increasing the discretionary spending \ncaps by $15.752 billion in outlays over five years and offsetting this \n               effort by closing corporate tax loopholes)\n\n  Mr. DODD. So with that, Madam President, I will send this amendment \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Wellstone, and Ms. \n     Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 296.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 3, line 4, increase the amount by 2,006,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 5, increase the amount by 2,820,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 6, increase the amount by 3,991,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 7, increase the amount by 5,766,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by 2,006,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by 2,820,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by 3,991,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by 5,766,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by 2,533,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by 3,481,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by 4,993,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by 7,305,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by 2,006,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by 2,820,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by 3,991,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by 5,766,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 25, increase the amount by 1,013,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 1, increase the amount by 643,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 8, increase the amount by 1,951,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 9, increase the amount by 1,335,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 16, increase the amount by 3,453,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 17, increase the amount by 2,458,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 24, increase the amount by 5,755,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 25, increase the amount by 4,224,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 15, increase the amount by 20,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 16, increase the amount by 13,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 22, increase the amount by 30,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 23, increase the amount by 23,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 5, increase the amount by 40,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 6, increase the amount by 33,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 12, increase the amount by 50,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 13, increase the amount by 43,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 14, increase the amount by 1,500,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 15, increase the amount by 1,350,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 22, increase the amount by 1,500,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 23, increase the amount by 1,463,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 5, increase the amount by 1,500,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 6, increase the amount by 1,500,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 13, increase the amount by 1,500,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 14, increase the amount by 1,500,000,000.\n       On page 41, line 7, increase the amount by 5,766,000,000.\n       On page 41, line 8, increase the amount by 15,752,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 21, increase the amount by 2,533,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 22, increase the amount by 2,006,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 24, increase the amount by 3,481,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 25, increase the amount by 2,820,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 2, increase the amount by 4,993,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 3, increase the amount by 3,991,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 5, increase the amount by 7,305,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 6, increase the amount by 5,766,000,000.\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that funding should be \n     increased for vital programs serving the youngest children. \n     Head Start should be funded at a level necessary to serve all \n     eligible children. Funding for the Child Care Development \n     Block Grant should be doubled to support the working poor and \n     new resources should be dedicated to addressing issues of \n     quality and supply in areas such as infant care and care \n     during non-traditional work hours. The Healthy Start should \n     be expanded to improve maternal and infant health. These \n     initiatives should be funded through by changes in the tax \n     code such as the elimination of the runaway plant deduction, \n     the billionaire's loophole, the exclusion of income from \n     Foreign Sales Corporations and other changes as necessary.\n\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me, if I can, briefly describe what the amendment does. \nI see my colleagues here who have come to the floor. I note the \nchairman standing. Is he looking for a time agreement? When a chairman \nstands, it usually means he is looking for a time agreement. Is my \ncolleague from New Mexico looking for a time agreement?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wanted to just--excuse me. I yield on my time.\n  Mr. DODD. I will yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just wanted to sort of suggest to those in the \nChamber who I see--I see Senator Dodd has an amendment, and I assume \nthat is what the Senator from Minnesota is going to speak to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, my colleague from New Mexico is \ncorrect. I join with him on his amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand Senator Hollings has an amendment, and I \ndo not know how long the Senator intends to speak to it, but I plan \nsequentially to call on the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nAllard, who has an amendment.\n  I was wondering if we might just at least be considering for our \nfellow Senators that we might finish the debate on those amendments by \nsomewhere around 6: 15. It is 5:30 now. And then we try to stack these \nthree so people after that could have a little time for dinner while we \ncontinue debating here. We would eventually ask those votes be 10-\nminute votes. I am just wondering, does that make any sense?\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I don't know how many Members \nwant to speak on this, and there may not be that many. So rather than \ntrying to spend the time negotiating an agreement, why not let it roll \na little while on the bill; we just got underway, and see how it comes \nout. We may not need a time agreement. There is probably going to be \njust on this amendment 45 minutes, just the three of us on the floor \nwho I know are sponsors of the amendment, and I presume Senator \nJeffords is coming over, and there may be a couple of others. So we \nwill try to move quickly. It is not my desire--I understand what the \nchairman wants to do, and we will try to move as fast as we can.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Smith is in the Chamber in my stead and \nwhatever parliamentary privileges I have under the bill, I designate to \nhim until I return.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I do not want to cut off the debate, but I wonder, \nbecause I deferred to my colleague from Connecticut to present his \ncomments on the amendment, whether there is--can we ask the people who \nwant to speak, I ask the Senator, whether the Senator from Minnesota \nand the Senator from Washington would be able to conclude their remarks \nin 5 minutes. Would that be asking too much?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, if I could respond to my colleague \nfrom New Jersey, I think it would be difficult to do so. I think it is \na very important amendment. I did not go into the specifics of what \nthis amendment was about earlier because I thought we would have a \nchance to speak to it. I think it speaks to a fundamental question of \npriorities. I could not cover this in 5 minutes. I certainly will do \nwhatever I can to stay within a reasonable limit but 5 minutes would \nnot be a sufficient time. I do not know about Senator Murray.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Washington has requested 5 minutes. \nAnd we will take the rest of the time as needed. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, the amendment I have sent to the desk that is under \nconsideration basically says I think we can do a little bit more here. \nThat is basically what it comes down to. As I said earlier, it is not \nto be offered to undo the budget agreement that has been struck by the \ncommittee along with the President. I respect and support that \nagreement.\n  I think we can do a bit more when it comes to investing in our most \nimportant resource. Statements are made over and over on the floor of \nthis Chamber, about America's children. I do not know anyone who would \nlist a higher priority than doing what we can to serve the most \ninnocent in our society, who have the most in front of them. There is \nno lack of people expressing an interest in the subject matter today.\n  I recall going back some 15 to 16 years ago when Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania and I formed the first children's caucus of the Senate. We \nhad a difficult time, but we tried to convince people over the years \nthat this was a worthwhile endeavor in which to engage on child care, \non the issue of Head Start, and family and medical leave. No one would \nbelieve it today, but back then we had to fight hard just to form a \ncaucas. Fortunately, we were successful in that effort as well as in \nthe effort to pass critical legislation on issues affecting families \nand their children.\n  Today, few argue against these initiatives. Most people agree in our \nsociety, as we look to the 21st century, that we want to give our \nchildren the best start they can possibly have. We cannot guarantee \nthem success. No one can be guaranteed that in our society. But we want \nto guarantee them an opportunity.\n  What we are talking about with Healthy Start, Early Head Start, Head \nStart, and quality child care is trying to give children a good start, \nthe best start we can so they will at least have the opportunity for \nsuccess.\n  In that regard, the amendment I am offering increases funding for \nthree children's programs that strike at the very heart of the most \nbasic needs of children in our Nation: Head Start, Healthy Start, and \nchild care. These three programs truly are sound investments and, I \nthink, time tested. These are not new ideas. They have been around now, \nin the case of Head Start, a generation. We have had the benefit of \nanalyzing the programs and know they work.\n  In the case of child care, it has been over a decade, and Healthy \nStart, almost as long. We know from recent scientific findings that \ncreative, positive environments for children in their earliest years is \nan investment that yields tremendous returns in the long term.\n  We are now engaged in the process of laying out this Nation's \npriorities for the next 5 years. In addition to numbers, we are laying \nout where are our priorities, where do we believe the most important \nthings that need to be addressed over the next half decade are. We \nmanaged to find $85 billion in tax cuts intended to spur investment. \nWhile I do not necessarily disagree with that, I think it can be \ntremendously helpful and important. But I believe we can certainly find \nan additional $14.6 billion over the next 5 years to improve the \ninvestment of children, and that is what I am talking about.\n  This amendment would provide for full funding of Head Start by the \nyear 2002. The President's budget and the budget agreement take a \npositive step in this direction by committing, as I said, to serve 1 \nmillion children over the next 5 years. That is up from 800,000 \ncurrently to 1 million in 2002, 200,000 additional slots. I think we \ncan do better. This amendment would ensure that all eligible children \nwho need Head Start will get it. By increasing funding to $11.2 billion \nin the year 2002, Head Start could reach over 1.4 million children. \nThat is 400,000 more who would be reached than under the budget \nagreement.\n  As my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, related the other \nday, in Albuquerque, NM, they have a staggering number of children \nwaiting to get into Head Start and were unable to because the resources \nwere not there. I am sure that story can be repeated in every State in \nthe country, where parents are trying to get their children into the \nprograms.\n  Going from 800,000, where we are today, to 1 million, 1.4 million \nover the next 5 years ought not be an impossibility for us to achieve \nin this country.\n  This amendment would also triple funding for Early Head \nStart programs to $560 million by the year 2002. This program, which my \ncolleagues certainly recall, provides high-quality child development \nfor infants and toddlers ages zero to 3. Again, I am\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\npreaching to the choir here, I presume, because of the tremendous \namount of new information on this 36-month period that occurs in a \nchild's life, to see to it that they get the quality care and \ndevelopment they need.\n\n  This amendment that I have offered on behalf of myself and Senator \nJeffords, along with others, would also make an investment in quality \nchild care. It would double the size of the child care development \nblock grant to $2 billion annually and provide an additional $500 \nmillion each year to help increase quality and meet supply shortages in \ncritically underserved types of care, including infant care and \nnontraditional hours.\n  I heard my colleague from Minnesota speak on the need for child care \nduring nontraditional hours. Most people think of people working from 8 \nto 5. However, there are a vast number of people in our country who do \nnot work traditional hours because of time shifts and so forth. We have \nvery few child care slots for the nontraditional hours. We need to be \ndoing everything we can as people are struggling to hold their families \ntogether economically to provide for that quality child care.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, when Senator Hatch and I initially \noffered the Child Care Development Block Grant Program 10 years ago, we \nmade the point over and over again how important it is to working \npeople that their children are in quality child care. The block grant \nprovides vital assistance to working families as they struggle to meet \nthese needs. But it is not enough; it is sorely underfunded. The \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that in the wake of welfare \nreform, there will be a $1.4 billion shortage in assistance for child \ncare. This amendment provides an additional $1 billion for supply and \nanother $500 million to address issues of quality and supply in key \nareas such as infants and the nontraditional hours. Again, as we move \npeople from welfare to work, it is going to be critically important \nthat we have these quality slots out there for people. So that is the \nsecond part of this amendment.\n  The additional $140 million is for the Healthy Start Program. Let me \njust remind my colleagues, I think all of us, I hope, have had an \nopportunity to visit Healthy Start programs. These programs offer to \nat-risk mothers prenatal care and other services that have been \ntremendously successful in seeing to it that new infants and their \nmothers get the proper care. Again, the studies show how critically \nimportant this can be for children's cognitive and emotional \ndevelopment.\n  Overall, this effort dedicates an additional, as I said, $14 billion \nto meeting the most basic needs of our youngest children. Healthy \nStart, Head Start, and quality child care are all about the earliest \ndays. Obviously, the quality child care can spill over to school years, \nto after school programs, but nonetheless, the bulk of it goes to the \nearliest days of these infants' lives to see to it they have the best \npossible beginning. I realize $14 billion is not an insignificant \namount, but over 5 years, that is less than $3 billion a year to fully \nfund Head Start, to double quality child care, and to provide more \nresources for Healthy Start. If we can find the $85 billion over 5 \nyears, isn't it possible to find $3 billion less than that a year to \nmake a difference in the lives of children from zero to 5 years?\n  So tonight, as we begin this process, this very first amendment that \nwill be voted on in this budget debate, to say we have done a good job \nhere and we can do a bit more. In my view, this agreement must serve \nthe children who we talk about endlessly, who we debate and discuss at \nevery meeting. Here is to reset our priorities for children with just a \nfew more dollars. We know it is going to be hard. We realize there are \nother problems we are faced with, but when it comes to our children, \nthis Congress, this Senate will stand up and say we can find the \nresources to see to it that these children get the proper kind of \nbeginning that they deserve.\n  But don't look in the faces of innocent children and tell them we \ncan't do a bit more. I know we are going to do a lot for people in the \nupper income levels, I understand that. If we can do that, we can do \nthis and still balance this budget by asking for a little less in some \nareas for children, even though they don't vote, don't have political \naction committees, and don't participate in this process. With all the \nspeeches that are given over and over again, this is the time to let \nrhetoric become a reality.\n  Madam President, at the proper time, obviously, I will ask for a \nrollcall vote on this amendment and urge my colleagues to join Senator \nJeffords and me in this bipartisan proposal. Senator Jeffords is the \nchairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and has worked on a \nnumber of these issues over the years. He has joined with me, as \nSenator Coats did, on family and medical leave and Senator Hatch on the \nchild care legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor and invite my colleagues' comments.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes. I \nwould like to respond to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I think there are many on my side of the aisle who care a great deal \nabout issues with respect to children. I am one of those who has kind \nof bucked the tide in my party and signed up as a cosponsor, with \nenthusiasm, to the Hatch-Kennedy bill, which raises the tax on tobacco \nto provide expanded Medicaid to children. I also have great sympathy \nfor many of the points Senator Dodd is making. I believe we should \nfully fund Head Start. I am told it takes $10 billion to do that, not \n$14 billion----\n  Mr. DODD. Eleven billion dollars.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am interested in that, but I am not interested \nin breaking this budget agreement, if it means that we are breaking our \npromises to the American people. Republicans and Democrats alike--\nneither side, frankly--are thrilled with every provision of this \nbudget, but the truth is, a lot of promises are being kept with this \nbudget.\n  Ultimately, it comes into balance, but in addition to that, we are \nprotecting essential programs, we are cutting taxes, and we are \nbalancing budgets. I think that is what America expects. I think that \nis what they want, and overriding all of our individual little \nconcerns, I think they want us to keep our word on balancing the \nbudget. In defense of this Congress, I think it is important to point \nout that since 1990, funding for Head Start has tripled. It ought to do \nbetter, but it ought not to do so at the expense of the promises we \nhave made to cut the tax burden on the American people.\n  In addition, children's programming is a priority in this budget. We \nhave funded Head Start at the President's requested level of an \nadditional $2.7 billion over 5 years. We provided $1 billion for this \nprogram last year and an additional $4.5 billion for child care through \nthe welfare reform bill. So it is not like we are insensitive to this. \nIn fact, many of us would like to do more. It is just the vehicle being \nchosen, and this vehicle, the Dodd amendment, will, frankly, in the end \nviolate this bipartisan agreement, and that we cannot do, because to \nget a majority, we need to keep this promise to ourselves, to our \nconstituents, and keep faith with the leadership and with the White \nHouse.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, let me respond to the Senator from \nOregon. I appreciate his remarks, but I want to point out that this \namendment says that the offset comes from corporate welfare, as I \nunderstand it. Some we are looking at. The Joint Tax Committee and \nothers have carefully studied hundreds of billions of dollars of tax \nloopholes that usually go to some of the largest corporations and some \nof the wealthiest individuals in the country.\n  We are saying, can you not take a little bit from that, and instead, \nwouldn't you invest this in Head Start? And wouldn't you invest this in \naffordable child care? And wouldn't you invest this in Early Start? And \nwouldn't this make much more of a difference in children's lives? And \nwouldn't this better represent the standard of fairness of the people \nin the country?\n  So, Madam President, this is not about breaking any deficit reduction \nplan. This is about whether or not this budget agreement reflects the \npriorities of people in this country.\n\n[[Page S4734]]\n\n  With all due respect to my colleagues, I think that if the choice for \npeople in this country is between eliminating some of these egregious \nloopholes and deductions and instead investing more in children, and \nespecially investing in this critical area of early childhood \ndevelopment, I say absolutely we ought to be doing that.\n  Madam President, I would like to talk just a little bit about these \nprograms and a little bit about the sort of overall context of this \namendment.\n  First of all, I have heard it so stated--and I say to my colleague \nfrom Oregon I will be willing to be critical of my own colleagues. I \nactually say this in a scrupulously, if you will, nonpartisan way. We \ntalk about how we are expanding Head Start and, therefore, we are going \nto serve an additional 1 million children. But are we doing enough to \nreach the 2 million children who are not now participating?\n  My colleague from Connecticut points out that in addition there is \ngoing to be some early Head Start funding, frankly, above and beyond \nthe 1 million children who still are not receiving any assistance; that \nis, Head Start 3 to 5.\n  If I was to include early Head Start, which is very consistent with \nvery compelling scientific evidence that these are the really critical \nyears, you know, right after birth, 1, 2, up to age 3, we are not \ncoming even close to providing many children in this country with a \nhead start. I far prefer to do that than to continue with a variety of \ndifferent loopholes and deductions and breaks for some of the largest \ncorporations in this country and wealthiest individuals who do not need \nit.\n  I mean, I would be more than willing to lay out this proposition for \npeople in the country over and over again and say, you know, whose side \nare you on? Cargo Continental Grain Co. or vulnerable children who are \njust looking for a break by way of Head Start to get them prepared for \nschool or good child care or, as I was talking about earlier, though \nnot in this amendment, adequate nutrition? That is what this is all \nabout. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  So the issue is not whether or not Senators are going to vote against \nthis amendment because they are opposed to a budget agreement. I think \nmy colleague from Connecticut and I may have different views on the \noverall budget agreement. I do not know yet. I guess he reserves final \njudgment. But you can be for the budget agreement and vote for this \namendment because this amendment still keeps us within this path of a \nbalanced budget. It just says: Couldn't we do a little bit better for \nchildren?\n  I am aware of the fact that colleagues feel some time constraint, and \nI promise not to take more than a couple more minutes, but this is, I \nthink, such an important amendment. I am proud to join in with the \nSenator from Connecticut and Senator Jeffords from Vermont and Senator \nMurray from Washington.\n  Another way of looking at this for just a moment, with all due \nrespect--and this is my hard-hitting point; I might have said it before \non the floor of the Senate but it just feels right to say it at 10 to 6 \non Tuesday evening--a real heroine to me--she is no longer alive--was a \nwoman named Fannie Lou Hamer. She was a share cropper from Mississippi, \nan African-American woman. She once said, ``I'm sick and tired of being \nsick and tired.'' She was a great civil rights leader.\n  I just get a little sick and tired of everybody who says they are for \nchildren and investment in children and we are now going to build a \nbridge going to the next century and we are all for these children--\nexcept when it comes to investment.\n  On the one hand, we say it is so important that children who come \nfrom really difficult circumstances get a head start. I mean, that is \nwhat we try to do. We do what the name of the program suggests, give \nthese children a head start. And we talk about how unfair it is that so \nmany children do not have this head start. And then we seem to be so \ncomfortable with the fact that we still are not providing enough \nfunding for 1 million children who are not going to receive it, ages 3 \nto 5, and God knows how many more children under the age of 3.\n\n  Can't we do better? Can't we do better? Can't we have just a little \nbit less by way of tax breaks, loopholes, deductions, whatever you want \nto call it, for large multinational corporations? I mean, Lord, we are \njust talking about $15 billion out of studies that have talked about \nhundreds of billions of dollars. Can't we just provide them with a \nlittle less so we can provide a little more for these children?\n  Second point. It will just be the last one, which is the child care \npiece. I believe my colleague from Connecticut, in this overall over 5 \nyears, $15 billion, is saying we can do better. I think many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle agrees with this.\n  You look at the child care picture, and whether or not you want to \ntalk about family-based child care or center-based child care or figure \nout ways you can have child care available for parent or parents at \nplace of work, however you do it, however you do it, Madam President, \nit is just amazing, it is stunning how little we have done and how much \nwe have to do.\n  David Packard, who was Deputy Secretary of Defense under President \nReagan, and his wife Lucile Packard have a foundation. They issued a \nreport this past summer, and they talk about child care. They make the \npoint, look, it is not just nutrition, it is not just health care, but \nin addition, if these children do not get the kind of nurturing and \nintellectual stimulation that affects the way the brain is wired, that \naffects whether or not they are going to have a chance.\n  So many families--if we want to talk about working families, this is \nnot just a poor people's issue. So many working families, so many of \nour children of parents in their thirties with two small children \nthemselves, you look at their salaries, they cannot afford really good \nchild care.\n  What Senator Dodd is trying to do is at least expand some funding for \ngood developmental child care. This is critical. This is the critical \ntime.\n  If the medical evidence is so compelling, if it is so irreducible, if \nit is irrefutable, and if we know we have to do this for children, why \ncannot we in this budget agreement take a little bit away from or have \na little less by way of tax breaks, loopholes, deductions, you name it, \nfor large multinational corporations and wealthy people at the top of \nthe economic ladder in our country and instead do a little better by \nway of investment in children, so each and every child can finish this \nway, each and every child?\n  I think we should be able to get good, strong bipartisan support. \nEach and every child in America, regardless of color of skin, \nregardless of income, regardless of religion, regardless of rural or \nurban, regardless of whether they be in Oregon or Connecticut or Maine \nor New Jersey or Minnesota, each and every child, regardless of \nreligion, should have the same chance to reach her full potential, have \na full chance to reach his full potential.\n  That is the essence of the American dream. That is the goodness of \nour country. That is what we believe in. This amendment takes us just a \nlittle bit--but, boy, it really matters to many children in many \nfamilies--takes us a little bit further in that wonderful direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time does my colleague from Washington need?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the Senator from Washington 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, thank you.\n  We are at a historic time in our Nation's history where we have \nbefore this body a balanced budget agreement that purports to balance \nthis budget by the year 2002. I think many of my colleagues feel, as I \ndo, that we have worked long and hard to reduce the deficit and we are \nfinally getting there and we feel good about it.\n\n  But what we also know is that this economy is doing very well. We \nknow that unemployment is down. We know that those people on Wall \nStreet are doing well. We know that our college graduates are getting \njobs that were not available to them 5 or 10 years ago. And there is a \nlot of hope and opportunity out there.\n  Madam President, it seems to me that this is the right time to take a\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nlook and say, Who are we missing in this budget? And when we know that \none out of four children in this country live in poverty, despite the \nfact that our economy is doing well and that things are looking really \ngood, we ought to take this opportunity now, as we put this balanced \nbudget agreement together, to make sure that this country focuses its \nresources on a place where it can really make a difference.\n  I come to you today as a mother, as a preschool teacher before I was \nin the Senate, and as a U.S. Senator to tell you that I can think of no \nplace that we can invest money better than in the young children of \nthis country.\n  I want to thank Senator Dodd for his work on this issue over many \nyears and for all the time and energy he has put in to make sure that \nthat group of people who do not have a voice do have a voice on the \nSenate floor.\n  His amendment before us today, that I am delighted to be a cosponsor \nof, addresses the current needs of today's young children in a way that \nthis budget does not and should.\n  I can tell you from personal experience that Head Start makes a \ndifference, and it makes a dramatic difference for those kids who are \nnot in Head Start today. I taught preschool. I know that when you have \na child in your classroom and when they are 3, 4 years old and they \nlearn cognitive skills and they learn, in their beginning time, to get \nalong with other children and they learn child development in a healthy \nway with a good teacher and with good equipment and with good adults \naround them, they will enter our schools ready to learn. It makes an \nincredible difference.\n  But it makes an incredible difference in those families as well \nbecause that mother or father has to bring that child to your classroom \nevery day, and as a result they begin to learn how to deal better with \ntheir own young children. The result is a rippling tide. You have the \nchild in your classroom, you have the siblings of that child, and you \nhave the parents of that child really focusing on family. This is about \ncreating good, strong families in this country. There is nothing we can \ndo better than to devote our resources to Head Start for the families \nacross this country and for the children in this country.\n  The child care development block grants have been spoken eloquently \nto. We know, as welfare reform goes into effect, that as women and men \non welfare go into the work force, who is going to be left behind at \nhome is their children. If we do not do everything we can to provide \nchild care at those odd hours when a mother is working the night shift \nat the grocery store, that we are going to have infants and children \nwho are not well cared for.\n  The results of that are going to be dramatic on those young children \nas they are not paid good attention to. But it will have an even more \ndramatic impact on those welfare moms when they are at work, because I \ncan assure you that just like every other parent today, if I know that \nmy child is being taken care of, whether they are at school or whether \nthey are in child care, I do a better job when I am at work.\n  We need to make sure that the child care is available out there so \nthat every working adult can be the best and most competent they can be \nat work and so that those children grow up feeling secure. I am tired \nof having young children say to me today that they do not think adults \ncare about them in this country. If we leave them home alone without \nchild care, it sends that message strongly. Those children end up on \nour streets, they end up in gangs, and they end up disillusioned as \nAmerican citizens. We have to invest time and money and energy into \nchild care through the child care development block grant so that we \ncan raise a healthy generation of adults.\n\n  Finally, on the Healthy Start, we know when we take care of children \nand their health when they are young, that it will pay dividends in the \nfuture. One out of four children live in poverty. One out of four \nchildren are not getting the health care they need, not being taken \ncare of. Guess where they will be when they grow up?\n  Madam President, it is essential that as adults on the floor of the \nSenate, we take the time and the energy and the resources to send our \ncountry in the right direction when we have the time and energy to do \nthat. And that is now.\n  I applaud the Senator from Connecticut and the other cosponsors, and \nI urge this body to do what needs to be done. Those children were not \nin on the budget agreement. They were not there. They were not \navailable to be there for the handshakes. We have to be on this floor \nto speak for them and speak loudly. I urge your support of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am going to shortly yield the floor as \nwell to my colleague from New Mexico, who is also a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  Let me just address the issue of how does this get paid for. We are \nnot allowed specifically here to target revenue sources, but I have \ntried to lay out in the amendment where the revenues will come from.\n  One source is the foreign sales corporation, which most of my \ncolleagues may be familiar with. This was set up back about 1981 or \n1982, in fact, part of another budget agreement, done in a conference \nreport. These are basically paper companies with very few employees, if \nany, in some cases that enabled American companies to exempt export \nincome from U.S. taxation. That is about $24 billion over 5 years. The \ncigarette tax is another source here.\n  I cannot dictate a specific revenue source in this amendment--I am \nprohibited from specifically directing the Finance Committee. But it \nwould certainly be my intention, as we stated here, to take the $14 \nbillion over 5 years from those sources. If you took a little bit from \nthe foreign sales corporation--you do not have to take all of it--some \nfrom the cigarette tax increase, it would be easy to pay for this \namendment to provide for full funding for Head Start, child care, and \nHealthy Start programs.\n  My colleague from New Mexico is here, and I yield, Madam President, 5 \nminutes to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \non behalf of this amendment by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I think, to put this in context, at least as I see it, this budget \nresolution is a blueprint for taking us into the next century. It sets \nout our priorities as a nation as we go into the next century, what we \nthink it is important to spend our resources on, and what can we \njustify to the people who elect us in our States for spending resources \non.\n  I believe very strongly that we can justify to our constituents, to \nthose who vote for us and those who vote against us, we can justify to \nany of them the additional expenditure for the Head Start Program that \nthe Senator from Connecticut is recommending here.\n  I look at my home State and the inadequate funding that we have for \nHead Start there, and it is a great concern. Let me give you a few \nspecifics. In a State like mine, New Mexico, for example, 16 percent of \nthe eligible children under age 5 are enrolled in Head Start. That is \nin the 1995 fiscal year. The national average is around 20 percent; in \nmy State, it is 16 percent. There are only 1,000 of the 8,000 eligible \nchildren that are being served by Head Start in our principal city of \nAlbuquerque, NM, which is about 12 percent of the eligible children in \nAlbuquerque being served. I had the good fortune of visiting a Head \nStart center and was impressed by the opportunities being offered to \nthose young people, but for them to tell me there are 8,000 eligible \nstudents or eligible children who are not able to participate in \nAlbuquerque, I think, is a real concern.\n  Despite the clear need and several proposals to obtain funding that \nreceived higher ratings, my State has no early Head Start programs. The \nearly Head Start programs are for the students that are less than 3, as \nI understand it, and there are some of those around the country but \nvery few. We will have another amendment later on in the budget debate \nhere about the importance of early childhood education and the \ntremendous impact of trying to work with children from the age of birth \nuntil 3 years old. Early Head Start programs provide, fill a need\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\nthere, and we are doing too little. In my State, we have no, absolutely \nno early Head Start programs.\n  Increasing Head Start participation to 1 million children by the year \n2002, as has been proposed in the resolution, would only increase \nparticipation by about 200,000 children, as I understand it. We need to \nadd 1 million children to Head Start, not reach the total of 1 million \nby the year 2002.\n  For these reasons, I am glad to cosponsor the amendment of Senator \nDodd, and glad to speak on behalf of this amendment.\n  Let me say we need to recognize here on the floor, we have a lot of \ntalk about what we can afford and what we cannot afford. We are the \nwealthiest nation in the world. We have the largest economy of any \nnation in the world. We are able to afford what we determine is a \npriority in our country.\n  Unfortunately, we have not determined that it is a priority to fully \nfund Head Start. This amendment would correct that very major defect in \nthis budget resolution. I strongly support it. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for the amendment.\n\n\n                   Modification of Amendment No. 296\n\n  Mr. DODD. I send a modification of my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The amendment is so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n       On page 8 on line 13 after ``loophole,'' insert ``increases \n     in the cigarette tax,''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Briefly, Mr. President, the modification, as I pointed out \na moment ago, obviously, under the way the budget agreement is struck \nhere, we cannot dictate to the Finance Committee where revenues--that \nis up to the committee to decide. I listed various tax cuts that might \nbe modified or increased to pay for the amendment. You have to offset \nit. I have listed a number at the end of the amendment. I have added \nthe cigarette tax as one that could also be considered, obviously. So \nthat is the modification I sent to the desk. I listed a couple of those \nalready.\n  As I said earlier, I think this agreement is a pretty good agreement. \nI began my remarks in offering the amendment by suggesting that I \nthought the members of the Budget Committee and others have done a good \njob, certainly, in this process, and the reason we are debating and \nvoting is we have to offer our own ideas to it. My colleagues may \nreject the idea or accept the idea.\n  I happen to believe that by doing a bit more, a little under $3 \nbillion each year over the next 5 years, in Head Start, in child care, \nin Early Start, in Healthy Start, is in the best interests of our \ncountry. By doing so, by adding a bit more to the cigarette tax or \nlopping off some of the foreign sales corporation, a program that I \nthink, in fact, we voted on, the billionaire tax cut I listed, 96 \nSenators voted, 1.6 billion it would bring in. Many times we voted on \nit. It is there. There are resources that would not in any way get to \nthe issue of middle-income tax cuts that are also included as part of \nthis agreement which I would support.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is no issue of greater importance to \nour country than the education of our citizens. The budget before us \ncalls for modest new investments in education over the next 5 years by \nincreasing resources for education and training programs. In addition, \nthe budget provides tax credits and deductions to middle income \nfamilies to help pay for post-secondary education as outlined in the \nbudget resolution. I fully support those initiatives. However, I \nbelieve we can and must do better.\n  Several years ago I read a report by the Committee on Economic \nDevelopment. This is a group of CEO's from some of our Nation's largest \ncompanies and they called on us to fundamentally change how we think \nabout education. They said education is a process that begins at birth \nand that preparation must begin before birth. They called on the \nFederal Government to make additional investments in early intervention \nactivities such as Head Start. I believe we should heed their words.\n  The pending amendment makes these investments to ensure the readiness \nof all children and I want to commend Senator Dodd for his leadership.\n  Last month, at my request, the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Subcommittee held a hearing focusing on the importance \nof early childhood education. That hearing was on the eve of the White \nHouse conference on early learning and the brain which highlighted this \nmost significant issue of the education of our youngest children.\n  Over the past several months we have been reading a great deal about \nresearch on the brain and the implications for the education and \ndevelopment of young children.\n  The research provides the scientific evidence which validates what \nmany parents and children's advocates have been saying for years--the \ngreatest potential for learning happens during the first years of a \nchild's life. Therefore, we need to make sure that all children have \nrich learning experiences during that critical time.\n  The first National Education Goal states that by the year 2000, all \nchildren will start school ready to learn. I strongly support all of \nthe goals, but believe that the first goal is essential for achieving \nthe rest of our national goals. Without a strong foundation in the \nearly years, children, particularly children from low-income families, \nstart school behind their peers school and often find it very difficult \nto catch up.\n  Early intervention also makes good economic sense. Studies tell us \nthat each dollar invested in high quality early childhood education \nprograms such as Head Start saves $7 in future costs by increasing the \nlikelihood that children will be literate and employed rather than \ndependent on welfare or engaged in criminal activities. However, less \nthan half of the 2.1 million children eligible for Head Start \nparticipate. With the additional resources provided by the Dodd \namendment, Head Start will be fully funded in 2002. That's a goal that \nis long overdue.\n  The most perplexing problem for working families is the availability \nand affordability of high-quality child care. In Iowa, 67 percent of \nchildren under the age of 6 have all parents in the labor force. The \ncost of child care overwhelms the modest budgets of most working \nfamilies since the care for one young child can cost as much as $4,000 \nper year. Availability of subsidies for working families are vital to \nhelping many of these families stay off of welfare and the pending \namendment provides an additional $7.5 billion over the next 5 years for \nthis purpose.\n  Finally the amendment increases funding for the Healthy Start \nProgram. This initiative provides grants to areas with high rates of \ninfant mortality to decrease the incidence of infant deaths. The \nadditional will help sustain the gains made in those places and help \ndisseminate information on successful interventions for other areas.\n  Mr. President, we must not lose sight of the importance of \ninvestments in the education of young children. After all, high quality \neducational activities during a child's first years often alleviates \nthe need for more expensive interventions later in life. I hope that we \nwill be able to work together to create the infrastructure which truly \nredefines how we view education--as a process that begins at birth, \nwith preparations beginning before birth.\n  This amendment significantly increases investments for these vital \nearly intervention initiatives and pays for these investments by \nclosing several tax loopholes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Dodd amendment and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Would the Senator from Connecticut call for the \nyeas and nays?\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the request, I withhold, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ask all time be yielded back from our side.\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Connecticut yield back \ntime?\n  All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. The Dodd amendment is not germane. Pursuant to \nsection 305 of the Budget Act, I raise a point of order against the \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. This is not in line, I do not believe, on this particular \namendment. There are no budget increases in the first year. I changed \nthe amendment, and my colleagues may not have been aware of it, to \ncomply.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It is my understanding from the Parliamentarian \nthat----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion. There is 1 hour \nequally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. This will take 60 \nvotes to waive the nongermaneness, will it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from New Mexico \nis correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Unless you need further time, we do not need time. We \ncan have the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. My point was, I say to my colleague from New Mexico, to try \nto avoid a point of order is the reason we modified the amendment. I am \nhappy to make this a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and I think that \nwould then get us away from the point-of-order issue, and I would so \nmodify my amendment to make it a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, in \nwhich case we can avoid.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not believe he can amend, can he?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to modify.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent if I can modify it \nto make it a sense of the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \nstatus in the regular order at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to waive the \nBudget Act. The Senator from New Mexico has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have the yeas and nays been sought on the motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. They have not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the sponsor \nof the bill would like to--and the manager of the bill on this side \nwith the consent of Senator Lautenberg on the minority side--propose to \nthe Senate a solution to this problem which would expedite the matter.\n  We would like to proceed--and I ask unanimous consent that we do \nthis--that we vitiate the motion and we vitiate the germaneness \nstatement; that the Senator be permitted to modify his amendment; that \nwe will not make a germaneness point of order; and that we will proceed \nafter about 5 minutes--and I will say who gets the 5 minutes--to move \nto a motion to table the amendment; and the yeas and nays will be \nordered on that, and the first vote will then be on the motion to table \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I apologize to my colleague \nfrom New Mexico. What was the last part?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That when we rid ourselves of the germaneness and the \nmotion to waive it, we will be back on the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. And I will then move to table it, and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut will ask for the yeas and nays, which we will grant, \nobviously, and we will vote on a tabling motion to the Senator's \namendment without a germaneness defense being asserted.\n  Mr. DODD. There will no other points of order raised. I will just \noffer the amendment as proposed with the modification.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we are just permitting the Senator from \nConnecticut to make it as it is and not raising the germaneness issue.\n  Mr. DODD. I accept that. I would prefer we didn't have a tabling \nmotion. But I respect my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest that we ought to have 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me have a quorum call so that I can make sure we have \nthe modification correctly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, perhaps as the amendment is being \nreworked, maybe I can comment very briefly.\n  This is one of those very difficult circumstances that I am sure the \nmajority leader and I are going to find ourselves in throughout this \ndebate. I am very enthusiastic about the subject matter, about the \nissue, about the amendment. I would in any other set of circumstances \nbe a cosponsor of it. I applaud the Senator for raising the issue.\n  But because it falls outside the parameter of the agreement of this \nbudget I am going to oppose this amendment under these circumstances.\n  Again, I regret that I have to do that. But that is the agreement \nthat we have enjoined, and I am going to try to adhere to that \nagreement throughout this debate.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader \nfor making that statement at this time. I intend to do the same thing \nas we go forward.\n  When we have amendments that change the basic content of the budget \nagreement, as this one does, which would provide for changes in the tax \nprovisions, to have tax increases in the code, and move that over into \nfunding programs at a level above what was included in the budget \nagreement, we think that would be outside the agreement. And, while \nthere are a number of Senators led by the Democratic leader who see an \nattractiveness in it, I think this is the right thing to do.\n\n  We were trying to be cooperative by not going through the waiver of a \npoint of order. But we will have the vote on the motion to table.\n  It would be my intent to take the same position when amendments are \noffered of this nature from our side of the aisle.\n  I think it is important that the two leaders on both sides make it \nclear that we are going to try to stick with this agreement as we go \nforward in the next 2 days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                Modification No. 2 of Amendment No. 296\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The modification No. 2 is as follows:\n\n       On page 8, line 5 after ``that'' add ``the assumptions \n     underlying the budget resolution assume that,''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I think this modification of the amendment conforms with \nthe conversation that I had with the Parliamentarian.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has the modification been accepted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The modification has been accepted.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, a brief moment: That is to say, with \ngreat reluctance I am going to oppose the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Connecticut. He has a long and distinguished record on \nmatters affecting children and their well-being.\n  I have also been a supporter of those programs that protect America's \nchildren to try to help them develop into functioning citizens.\n  But we do have an agreement that was hammered out, if I can use the \nexpression, in great pain with a great pain in many cases over many \nweeks of hard work.\n  I just make the point that I commend the Senator for his interest, \nhis continuing interest in the well-being of our children in the \ncountry, and that I again acknowledge regretfully that in my position \nhere I am going to be opposing the amendment.\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that I be permitted to speak for 2 \nminutes after which we will vote, unless the Senator wants a minute.\n  Mr. DODD. I will take 30 seconds.\n  I respect immensely both my leaders, the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, and their positions on all of this. I \nunderstand their positions. I understand as well that, as Senators, we \nall have a chance to modify this resolution, hopefully without doing \ndamage to the underlying agreement.\n  This resolution is a 5-year commitment to our country. I thought it \nshould also be a stronger 5-year commitment to our children.\n  It seems to me that in the midst of everything else going on here, \nshifting around a little bit to accommodate those needs is very little \nto ask for America's kids.\n  I understand again the leadership position on it. I respect it. I \noffered the amendment. I am one who supports this agreement, by the \nway. I am not out here to undo it. I simply want to make it better with \nthis amendment.\n  I regret that the leadership will oppose this amendment. But I \nrespect that position, and urge my colleagues to support the amendment \nwhen the tabling motion is made.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, because there will be a lot of people \nsupporting my motion to table, I do not want them to feel the least bit \nembarrassed about doing that because, as a matter of fact, this \nagreement that is before us contains every single nickel that the \nPresident of the United States asked for in terms of Head Start--$2.7 \nbillion. That is what he asked for. It is a priority item. It must be \nfunded. And you can't do better than that.\n  We have a good record in the U.S. Congress in terms of child care. \nMr. President, $1 billion was added last year, and $4.1 billion in the \nwelfare bill.\n  So those who support my motion are, indeed, doing that with the full \ncognizance that the U.S. Congress and the President have done right by \nthese programs over the last 2 years, and intend to do even better by \nthem without the Dodd amendment when it is tabled tonight, because we \nare going to leave that $2.7 billion in.

Mr. President, I would like to propound ask a unanimous-\nconsent agreement now which would say we would not have any more \nrecorded votes until 7:45, but we would have two at 7:45.\n  So I ask unanimous consent the next two amendments in order to Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 27 be an amendment to be offered by Senator \nAllard and an amendment to by offered by Senator Hollings, that no \namendments be in order to either amendment, and at 7:45 this evening, \nthe Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the Allard amendment, \nto be followed by 2 minutes for debate, to be followed by a vote on or \nin relation to the Hollings amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask all time between now and 7:45 p.m. be equally \ndivided between the two amendments in the usual form, with Senator \nAllard's amendment being offered first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, it would be the \nintention, I believe, of the managers of this legislation, to proceed, \nthen, to continue to work on some other amendments that would be voted \non in the morning. But, for now, these would be the two votes stacked \nat 7:45, and they would be the last recorded votes tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I request order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will please be in order in the Chamber.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 292\n\n (Purpose: To require that any shortfall in revenues projected by the \n     resolution be offset by reductions in discretionary spending)\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could we please have order in the Chamber? The \nSenator is proposing an important amendment and deserves to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] for himself and Mr. \n     Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 292.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . OFFSET OF REVENUE SHORTFALLS BY DISCRETIONARY \n                   SPENDING REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 1999, 2000, 2001, or 2002 that provides a revenue \n     total for any of those fiscal years below the levels provided \n     in this resolution unless the discretionary budget authority \n     and outlay totals in that resolution are reduced to offset \n     the amount by which revenues are below the levels provided in \n     this resolution.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the \n     concurrent resolution, bill, or joint resolution, as the case \n     may be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of \n     the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n       (d) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of new budget authority, outlays, new \n     entitlement authority, and revenues for a fiscal year shall \n     be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee \n     on the Budget of the Senate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment is limited to \napproximately 25 minutes.\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I again thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee for their hard \nwork in putting together this agreement. I still have one overriding \nconcern. I think there are a number of Members in the Senate that share \nmy concern about what happens if the revenues we are projecting do not \nhold up over the years.\n  Mr. President, I share the concern that as we move through our \neconomic cycles, the projected revenues in this budget agreement may \nnot hold up. So I think it is a very legitimate question for us to ask \nourselves, what happens if the revenues do not hold up to this \nagreement? Potentially, we could find ourselves back at the negotiating \ntable, working hard to reestablish those priorities set up in the \noriginal agreement because the revenues were falling short.\n  Mr. President, I ask you bring the Senate to order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Can we please have \norder in the Chamber?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I think it is important that we move \ntoward our goal, that we continue to eliminate the deficit by 2002. The \namendment that I am offering considers that if the revenues do not come \nin as projected, then there will be an automatic adjustment that would \noccur through the procedure set forth to hold down spending and keep \nthe deficit from increasing.\n  We all recognize that the economy goes through cycles. As a member of \nthe House Budget Committee several years ago, I felt the figures coming \nout of the Congressional Budget Office, built on the first 2 or 3 years \nprior to that, were good numbers. But I have a feeling that we are \nreaching the top of our economic cycle and that at some point in time \nwe will be forced to address the problem of not meeting our projected \nrevenues.\n  This amendment tries to address that problem. Today, the economy is \nstrong. People have jobs and the stock market is surging. History tells \nus, however, that this is not always the case. Unfortunately, the \nbudget resolution assumes economic growth over the next 5 years that is \nunmatched in this country's history.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has provided Congress with a series \nof revised revenue forecasts, all pointing to future economic growth. \nIn fact, balancing the budget is $629 billion easier now than last year \nat this time. If these revenues do not materialize, then all of our \nhard work will be lost to increasing deficits. I do not want this hard \nwork to be lost. That is why I have introduced my amendment today.\n  The concept behind my amendment is simple: Provide a means to reduce \nspending within this budget agreement if real revenues fall short of \nthose projected. This amendment will decrease discretionary spending in \nproportion to the revenue shortfall. This would help ensure that the \nbudget remains on the glidepath to balance by the year 2002.\n  I am well aware of the historic nature of this agreement and would \nlike to back the resolution with my undivided support, but I cannot \nmortgage the future of my children and grandchildren on Congressional \nBudget Office revenue forecasts. We should make sure that the document \nbefore us today has a mechanism to secure deficit forecasts. I do not \nbelieve that this change alters the intent of the agreement, but rather \nenhances its ability to react to changes in the economy, changes we may \nnever see. But we cannot be shortsighted in this matter. If we are \ngoing to craft legislation to blueprint the next 5 years, let us be \nsmart enough to realize that we cannot see into the future. Let us be \nsmart enough to include language that allows this agreement to react to \nfuture changes.\n  I believe we can and should do more. We should do more in the form of \ntax relief for the American family, more in the form of tax relief for \nthe family farmer, more in the form of reducing waste and duplication \nwithin the Federal Government. But I also believe that we can do more \nin future budget debates.\n\n  My amendment is not to serve as a protest, but rather a constructive \nimprovement to a realistic budget compromise. I served on the Budget \nCommittee in the other body and realize how difficult it was even to \nget to the point where we are today. But this cannot preclude us from \nholding true to our commitments. This amendment locks in nothing but \nour commitment to balance the budget.\n  My greatest fear is that reduced future revenues will unravel this \nagreement, just as we have seen with similar resolutions in the past. \nThis amendment allows for future economic changes and would only \nstrengthen the budget resolution.\n  The people of Colorado sent me to Washington to balance the budget \nand, in the process, make sure that any budget agreement keeps the \nFederal budget on a glidepath to balance. I ask that my colleagues hold \ntrue to balancing the budget and support this amendment.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Is the manager opposed to the amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The manager is opposed to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Then the manager controls time in opposition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then I yield to Senator Lautenberg as much time as he \nwishes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the manager. I think, just to ask a \nparliamentary question, when there is time for an amendment, that time \nis automatically divided between the two sides regardless of which side \nis being spoken for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. When an amendment is proposed, half of the \ntime is controlled by the proponent of the amendment, the other half is \ncontrolled by the majority manager if he is in opposition, and if he is \nnot in opposition, then the minority manager will control that time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, now that that is resolved, this \namendment would force a cut in discretionary programs, if I read the \namendment correctly, if projected revenues fall. That means that we \nwould be putting national security at risk as well, because we would be \ntaking it from defense as well as from discretionary accounts. That \nhardly seems the way, in my view, that the country ought to be doing \nbusiness.\n  There may be circumstances that we cannot possibly imagine at this \njuncture, and apart from the basic rule of saying, look, this falls \noutside the understanding that, again, was negotiated at length, this \nmeans that if the economy falters, critical programs, in addition to \ndefense, would be cut. It might be a time when, if things suddenly \nstart turning tough, you might want to make other decisions. This would \ntie our hands and not enable us to consider these things as expected, \nand there are many other conditions that might be considered.\n  Would the Senator from Colorado suggest, if revenues fall short, that \ntaxes ought to be increased? I hardly think so. I will not bother the \nSenator for a response to that; I will answer for him, taking that \nliberty. I just want to make the point that an agreement has, again, \nbeen negotiated, considering all prospects--revenues, expenditures, \nfirewalls, protection of defense, development of discretionary \naccounts--again, through long, arduous discussions. While I think there \nare probably a number of people who would like to change the agreement, \nthe fact is this represents a consensus point of view, and we are going \nto oppose the Senator's amendment and hope that the manager will agree \nwith us that the amendment is going to be opposed. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, yes, I do oppose the \namendment, and let me tell the Senate why. First of all, I think \neverybody should understand that revenues are not the only thing we \nestimate in the budget. We estimate the economic growth, we estimate \nthe inflation, we estimate the unemployment, and, frankly, all of them \nare estimates. We also estimate the amount of revenues that are coming \nin.\n  Might I suggest, it is very interesting, during this recovery, which \nis not an enormously high recovery in terms of gross domestic product \ngrowth, it\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\nhas been an enormous yielder of revenues. Revenues have been coming in \nfor 4 successive years at much higher than the Congressional Budget \nOffice ever assumed, and, frankly, we have been saying the OMB is too \ngenerous, it has even been coming in higher than they have assumed.\n  On the other hand, the economic growth, the gross domestic product, \nhas come in higher than estimated by either OMB or CBO. Now, the best \nyou can do in a budget resolution is get the information regarding \nthose factors that you do not have control over, how much revenue is \ncoming in, how fast are we going to grow, what is the inflation rate \ngoing to be, how much unemployment are you going to expect and the \nother myriad of indicators of economic significance to the country.\n  Why we would just take one, revenues, and say if revenues do not meet \nthe expectation, that we would then set about to do what? To cut the \nappropriated accounts.\n  Let me remind everyone, the appropriated accounts are now about 33 \npercent of the budget, and guess what they are, Mr. President? Half of \nthem are defense--about half, almost split in the middle--and half are \nall the rest of the domestic programs. But how about this? What about \nthe 67 percent of the budget that are the entitlements and mandatory \nprograms and all the other things?\n  It would seem to me if you are going to have some kind of automatic \nadjustment--we tried this before and it has never worked--but if you \nare going to have one, then you ought to do it to everything. Why would \nyou pick out defense, and it essentially is going to get half the cut \nif such is necessary? I do not think that is fair. Right off the bat, I \nwould oppose this amendment on that alone.\n\n  There are others who say, ``If you only do defense, we will support \nyou, Senator from Colorado, and leave out the domestic.'' But the point \nof it is, you are not going to be absolutely accurate when it comes to \nestimating. You are not going to be absolutely accurate. You do the \nvery best you can, and then you make the alterations year by year if \nsuch are required.\n  I have even reached the point where I think you ought to make the \nalterations every 2 years. That is what I think about estimating. \nHaving to go through budgets and appropriations, I think it ought to be \nevery 2 years rather than one.\n  I do commend the distinguished Senator from my neighboring State of \nColorado. He is a new Senator, and he knows a lot about putting budgets \ntogether. He knows a lot about putting reserve funds in place so that \nyou come out right, because he has told me about them in his State of \nColorado, a good conservative State that knows how to budget.\n  Frankly, it is very difficult to be that accurate with our National \nGovernment's budget the size it is, since we have so many programs \nthat, if you change the economic growth just a little bit, then the \nunemployment compensation goes up a whole bunch and we have a lot of \nindicators, a lot of things that are related to this estimating that we \ncannot be certain of, other than look back after we have done it.\n  Incidentally, we have even done that. We have even said that, if that \nis the case, let's look back and correct it retroactively. I am not for \nthat either. I am for being conservative in the estimating, and we have \nbeen as conservative as you can be in this budget. We have used the \neconomic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office in terms of \ngrowth, in terms of all the other important indicators, and I believe \nthat that is among the lowest and most conservative set of estimates \nout there. I think blue chips' is higher than that. I think OMB is \nhigher than that. Most of the major companies who do it have higher \nones than we do. I think we are protecting the integrity of this budget \nas best we can by using that approach.\n  Once again, I commend my friend and colleague and neighbor for being \ngenuinely concerned and targeting some of the issues that we might look \nat more carefully and try to handle in a better way.\n  Let me suggest that the only other amendment after my good friend \nfrom Colorado completes his argument is Senator Hollings' amendment. I \nkind of made a mistake. I thought we were going to have a full half \nhour, starting at 7:30, for Senator Hollings, but it looks like we are \ngoing to vote at a quarter of. So I hope if somebody can get hold of \nhim and get him here earlier--I will not use much time in opposition to \nhis amendment, so he will have all the time once he gets here until the \nvote. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I again compliment the chairman and \nranking member. I know they have worked hard with the best figures they \nhad. I come from a State, the State of Colorado, that has a balanced \nbudget amendment. I have been involved in the legislative body in the \nState of Colorado when we went through good years and bad years. During \nthose good years, you look back and you build your budget based on what \nyou think is going to happen at some future point in time.\n  The fact is, we do go through economic cycles, and despite the best \nof intentions and how valid our figures are today, those cycles are \nunpredictable. I think at one point in time we will have an economic \ndownturn. This Congress needs to be prepared to address those \nunforeseen circumstances.\n  The point of my amendment addresses when those unforeseen \ncircumstances do happen, when revenues coming in do not meet what was \nforecast and we have a spending level up here and maybe the revenues \nare coming in lower than expected, we just bring down the spending \nlevel and say that we need to adjust our figures in the baseline so \nthat our budget reflects the change in economic conditions in this \ncountry. I think it is a commonsense type of amendment, and I ask the \nMembers of the Senate to vote yes on this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the Senator finished?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the floor, and if the Senator from New Mexico is \nwilling to yield back his time, I will yield back my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Colorado should not yield his time \nbecause we might get back to his amendment for a little bit. We are \nwaiting for Senator Hollings, and if the Senator doesn't mind, Senator \nDurbin would like to speak in opposition for a couple minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That will be fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Not being a high priest on the Budget Committee, I am not bound by \nsacred oath to the agreement, but I stand in opposition to this \namendment. I believe that the Senator from Colorado has raised an \nimportant issue.\n  We can see the fact that the economy has moved forward very nicely \nover the last 4\\1/2\\ to 5 years. Those on the Democratic side take \nparticular pleasure in saying that, but regardless of the reason, we \nare happy the economy has moved forward. As the Senator from New Mexico \nhas mentioned, it has generated more jobs, more revenue and, in fact, \nmore economic growth than even some of the experts suggested.\n  If I follow the suggestion of the Senator from Colorado, he is saying \nthat if at some future date the economy has a downturn, revenues to the \nFederal Government decrease, he would want us to cut spending programs \nto match those cuts in revenue. I stand in opposition to that for one \nvery obvious reason.\n  Since the late 1940s, we have noticed a very positive occurrence in \nthe economy of America. As we have gone into recessions, we have not \nseen those deep spikes that we had in years gone by. The recessions \nhave been milder, there has been less unemployment, less dislocation by \nbusinesses and families. It is no accident. It is known as automatic \nstabilizers, things in our Government and in our economy that step in \nin times of recession to try to bring us back into a time of economic \nexpansion.\n  For instance, if we have a recession and a business lays off workers, \nthere are Government programs available to help that working family get \nback on its feet. We have training programs, we have education \nprograms, we have safety net programs, whether it is food\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\nstamps or unemployment compensation, to make sure that family doesn't \nfall even deeper, but rather to keep them in a position and poised \nready for retraining and reemployment, and it has worked.\n\n  With these automatic stabilizers and this Government spending, we \nhave managed to moderate recessions. The Senator from Colorado has \nsuggested we remove the stabilizers. If you have a recession, if you \nhave a downturn, if your Government revenues have been reduced, then \ncut spending. Well, what about the family that needs a helping hand? \n``I am sorry, there is not enough Federal money to go around.''\n  We are more determined to balance the budget than recover from a \nrecession under the Senator's amendment, and I think that is a mistake. \nWe do not want to see a downturn in the economy become a recession. We \ncertainly do not want to see a recession become a depression. The \nSenator's amendment would make economic circumstances even worse for \nthe families out of work, worse for the businesses that have had to \nclose, worse for the family farmers who have had to give it up.\n  I would think that the Senator would want to go in the opposite \ndirection. We would want to get the American economy moving forward \nagain, help those families back to work, help that business back on its \nfeet, help those farmers, if we can, and the ranchers as well. But the \nSenator's amendment would have exactly the opposite effect. As a \nrecession hits, revenues go down, the Senator would say spend less and \nbring the economy back to its feet. I think that is the wrong, wrong \nmedicine.\n\n  As important as a balanced budget is, it is more important for \nAmerica to have an expanding economy, to recover from a recession, and \nto have the wherewithal to do it. So I respect the Senator for his \nsuggestion, but I respectfully disagree with his point of view.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the comments \nmade on the floor about our economy and what happens if we go through \nan economic downturn.\n  First of all, I think the biggest burden that the farmers and small \nbusinesspeople and the average American family has to deal with in \ntoday's world is this huge Federal debt that we are facing. When you \nlook at the amount of interest that we are paying on that debt and the \npotential liability to the budget, I believe--and this is a fundamental \ndifference being discussed here on the floor of the Senate--but I \nhappen to believe that the most important thing we can do to help our \neconomy, to help the farmers of this country, to help the small \nbusinesses and help the homeowner, to help the family businessperson, \nis to get that burden off their shoulders.\n  If you are born today, you are born with a $20,000 debt which each \nindividual in America burdens. How did we get to this point? We got to \nthis point because of the very arguments we just heard on how we need \nto continue to spend more and more believing that it is going to help \nour economy. But inevitably we are going to have to pay the price.\n  If we do not make the decisions today, the tough decisions today, we \nare going to have to make them tomorrow. If we do not make those tough \ndecisions, then our children and grandchildren are going to have to pay \nthe price. And I think that is unforgivable. I think it is morally \nwrong to pass those tough decisions off to the next generation.\n  I happen to feel that this is an important amendment because it is \nholding the Congress accountable, both the House and the Senate. I am \nsaying that if revenues do not measure up, we reduce spending. We have \nsome flexibility in there to protect the most needed programs. I think \nit is a commonsense amendment. I think it holds true to the agreement \ngenerally and the fact that we will hold our priorities together that \nwere agreed upon between the President and the Congress. I think it is \na good amendment, and I ask for an aye vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Both sides.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This vote will not occur at this time.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. May I move to table it at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may make that motion now, and the \nvote will occur at 7:45.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the Allard amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is set \naside, and the Senator from South Carolina is to be recognized to offer \nan amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Hollings is the one we have the \nconsent for. He is not here, but he is coming.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understood from the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee I have 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, we vote at a quarter of. You have \nthe time from now to a quarter of.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You said vote at 8 o'clock when I left the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The leader asked for 7:45.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that I have 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will not object.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 295\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nthe clerk to report it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 295.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: \n     ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, all \n     function levels, allocations, aggregates and reconciliation \n     instructions in this resolution shall be adjusted to reflect \n     elimination of tax cuts of $85 billion from baseline levels \n     and elimination of Presidential initiatives of $31.2 billion \n     and interest savings of $13.8 billion for a total saving of \n     $130 billion over five years.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this amendment does away with the \nsweetheart deal that will continue to increase the deficit instead of \ndecreasing the deficit that current budget laws allow. We have had 5 \nyears of decreasing deficits. This amendment continues the decrease of \nthe deficits and actually puts us on a steady path of a balanced budget \nwith no deficit whatsoever by the year 2007.\n  I measure my comments and words because we have been engaged in an \noutrageous charade for 15 years now. I speak advisedly having been on \nthe Budget Committee since its institution and as a former chairman of \nthe Budget Committee. That is one of the reasons I wanted to try to \ncooperate with the distinguished chairman because he has a tremendous \nburden of moving this bill along. It was not my intent to hold the \nlegislation up, but to bring into sharp focus the situation we have \ncreated for the American people.\n  I supported and worked on a balanced budget in 1968 with the chairman \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee. We did not have a Budget \nCommittee. We called over to the White House to ask President Lyndon \nJohnson if we could cut another $5 billion so that we could make sure \nthat we had a balanced budget. And he said, ``cut it.''\n  Mind you me, Mr. President. We had the war in Vietnam: guns. We had \nthe Great Society: butter. Guns and butter. President Lyndon Baines \nJohnson was\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\nawfully sensitive about paying the bill. Wherein, we have no idea in \nthis particular budget resolution of paying the bill. It is a \nsweetheart resolution, much like we had back in 1985.\n  In 1985, the Republicans, to their credit, brought former Senator \nPete Wilson to the floor in great pain. Senator Wilson had had an \nappendectomy, and they brought him in at 1 o'clock in the morning on a \nstretcher, and they voted to freeze spending, Social Security, and the \nother particular matters at the time.\n  We went over early the next morning to see President Reagan. At that \nparticular time, President Reagan said, ``Now, gentlemen, before we \nstart''--we were all gathered around the Cabinet table --he said, ``I \nwant to tell you, I had a little visit from the Speaker last evening, \nSpeaker O'Neill.'' And we went outside there, you see right underneath \nthat tree, and we had a little toddy, and we talked along, and we \nfinally agreed. The Speaker said, ``I'll take your defense if you take \nmy Social Security entitlements.''\n  I can see Senator Dole now. He threw down the pencil on the Cabinet \ntable and he said it was a whole waste of time.\n  We faced the fire. We did the job that was necessary. So did Senator \nDomenici. He remembers it. So there was a swap.\n  Now, here 12 years later in 1997, we have a swap. President Clinton \nsays, ``I'll take your tax cuts if you take my spending increases.'' \nAnd then everybody races around and hollers ``balanced budget.'' But \nfolks, there is no balance in this budget.\n  Like Patrick Henry might have said, ``But as for me, give me either a \nbalanced budget or give me a freeze.''\n  Let me show you exactly what is going on here. What we have here are \nthe actual budget realities. And underneath budget realities you can \nsee, Mr. President, the budgets for every President, from Truman right \non through President Clinton.\n  You see the United States budget, the borrowed trust funds in this \nparticular column, what they call the ``unified deficit,'' which is the \ngreatest deception of all. For years we have been acting like \n``unified'' meant ``net.'' Necessarily, the Government has income. It \nalso has spending. And the inference is this is a net deficit after you \ntake it all in. Absolutely false.\n  The real actual deficit is really listed in this column, because this \none here borrows the money and loots the trust funds.\n  We have been looting the Social Security trust fund, as of last year, \n$550 billion; by 1997, the end of this fiscal year, September 30, it \nwill be $629 billion; and under this budget resolution they take \nanother practically $500 billion, half a trillion bucks to $1.095 \ntrillion.\n  They say, ``Oh, watch out here in the next century with the baby \nboomers. The baby boomers are coming. We used to have five or six \nworkers per recipient or retiree. We're only going to have one worker \nper retiree.''\n  Do not watch the baby boomers in the next century. Watch the adults \non the floor of the U.S. Senate. Watch the adults that are looting the \nfund. We are causing the deficit. And it is not any charismatic formula \nthat changes now or in the next century. Incidentally, I voted and will \ncontinue to support Senator Kerrey on doing something about \nentitlements. I am not messianic that you cannot touch entitlements. I \nvoted already with the Danforth-Kerrey solution last Congress.\n  But be that as it may, we are using $1.095 trillion from the Social \nSecurity trust fund. We have been looting it. After 5 years, the \nmilitary retirees fund will owe $173 billion and the government will \nsay they ought to start contributing more. If there is any military \nretiree within the sound of my voice, watch out, because they are \nalready doing this with civilian retirement funds. We have a full $422 \nbillion surplus, and they are saying we have to increase the \ncontribution. Why? If you increase the contribution it goes to the \ndeficit, not civilian retirement.\n  It is the same with unemployment compensation and the highway trust \nfund. We are using $40 billion from the highway trust fund. I have been \ntrying to get funding for a bridge in South Carolina. You can build a \nbridge in every one of the 50 States with the money we are using to \nreduce the deficit.\n  We are going to continue the airport tax to make way for a net tax \ncut. So we continue this tax for all the air travelers, but this money \ndoes not go to airports. It goes to reduce the deficit. It takes \nunmitigated gall to extend the airport tax, and then put it toward the \ndeficit. In fact, you don't put it all toward the deficit. Some of it \nis put toward a tax cut for inheritance taxes or capital gains taxes. \nAnd everybody traveling in an airplane wonders why the planes are \nbumping into each other in the sky and the airport radar is broken down \nand communications go out and everything else--remember that we are \nsolving the deficit in Washington. We are giving them a unified deficit \ninstead of an actual deficit.\n  So turning to the resolution itself, Mr. President, I want you to \nshow me in this document I hold in my hand--Calendar 55, Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 27--where it says the budget is balanced. Do not \ngive me this nonsense about the conversation that is in the committee \nreport. That is a farce. Look at the actual law, the actual resolution \nthat we are going to pass. If you can find in here, by way of language \nthat there is a balanced budget by the year 2002, I will jump off the \nCapitol dome. I made that particular charge 4 years ago with the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, and I have not had to jump yet. Why?\n  Just turn to page 2, line 23, under the heading of deficits. ``For \npurposes of the enforcement of this resolution'' it says, deficit for \nfiscal year 2002--$108.7 billion. Then turn the page and get the actual \ndeficit. That only counts under the law of section 13301 about Social \nSecurity. But you see, you have all of the other trust funds in there. \nAnytime you want to add up the annual deficit, just subtract the annual \nincrease of the debt from the present year. In other words, you go here \nto page 5 and you will find that we have a debt of $6,301,200,000,000 \nin 1997 but then for the fiscal year 2002 the debt has gone up to \n$6,473,500,000,000, a deficit of 172 billion bucks.\n  Why did they have to borrow? Because that is what the deficit is. Now \nyou can see from this other chart that the deficit this year is $180 \nbillion. That is after 5 years of deficits going down. Under this \nbudget resolution, deficits go up in 1998, 1999, and the year 2000. \nThey go way up. They do not go down. Just look at the figures.\n  So after 5 years, instead of a deficit of $180 billion, we will have \na deficit of $172 billion. That is, if everything goes right. And then \nit is still back-end loaded, Mr. President. 72 percent of the spending \ncuts occur in the last 2 years. It is back-end loaded, as usual, and \nthe back-end loaders will say that those Congresses can do it in the \nyear 2001 and 2002. In any event, the deficit comes out $172 billion. \nThat is according to the Committee's facts and figures.\n  What we have to do--and that is why I proposed this amendment--is see \nif we can just take the entire spending cuts and tax increases and just \neliminate them. I want to be realistic. I would like to do away with \nthe so-called spectrum auctions. These are totally out of the question. \nWe got somebody to come in last year--and it was verified by the \nChairman of the Federal Communications Commission--and say that we can \nget $2.9 billion from this spectrum auction. We had a spectrum auction \n6 months later and we got $13.1 million. This is the kind of extreme \nexaggerated figures we are dealing with.\n\n  But aside from that, take all the figures in the work of the two \nBudget Committees and the agreement they have made. Eliminate the tax \ncuts and eliminate the spending increases--the Presidential \ninitiatives--and steady as you go. If we can do that--that is what my \namendment calls for--then you actually get a balanced budget. \nGovernment on a pay-as-you-go basis in fiscal year 2007. An honest \nbudget. Truth in budgeting.\n  Mr. President, we have had conscience. That is why we came back after \nthe Reagan deal with Tip O'Neill. We came back in here and we passed \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings. I got it through over on this side over the \nobjection of the majority leader, the majority whip, and the chairman \nof the Budget Committee. I got 14 votes up and down, the majority of \nthe Democrats joined with the Republicans, in\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\n1985, for that initiative. We could develop that kind of initiative \nnow, instead of this sweetheart deal.\n  What good really has occurred as a result of the 1993 vote? Give \nPresident Clinton credit. And give this side of the aisle credit, \nbecause we could not get a single vote on that side of the aisle. They \nsaid they were going to hunt me down in the street and shoot me like a \ndog. Majority leader Dole said it would cause a recession and the world \nwould end. I wish we had time to read those particular statements made \nby opponents of the 1993 plan.\n  Be that as it may, it worked. And that is the first President that \nhas come around here in the past 15 years, since we started that \nReaganomics, and has lowered the deficit.\n  To President Clinton's credit, he lowered the deficit in 1993, 1994, \n1995, 1996, and we are in the fifth year of lowered deficits, and this \nparticular instrument asks us to go turncoat and start increasing \nspending so that we can give the rich a tax cut. Inheritance taxes, \ncapital gains taxes, and all of these other things. Somewhere, \nsometime, Mr. President, we have to tell the American people that we in \nthe Congress have been giving them over 200 billion bucks a year in \nGovernment that we are not willing to pay for. We have been buying \ntheir votes.\n  They are talking about campaign finance reform: it starts on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate here this evening. If you really want campaign \nfinance reform, quit using the subterfuge to the taxpayers of America \nand offloading the debt to future years and vote to do away. Keep us on \na steady course, because that is exactly what we need to do.\n  We are moving this deficit over. I do not know if you can see this on \nthe chart, come up here to President Kennedy. We had already had all \nthe wars under President Kennedy, except the closing days of the war in \nVietnam. We had Korea, the world wars, the Revolutionary War and \neverything else, and we only ran up a debt that cost us $9 billion in \ninterest costs. Now, it is projected by CBO to be $359 billion. So you \ncan see where we have come.\n  We are spending $360 billion more--for what? For waste. The crowd \nthat came to town to do away with waste, fraud, and abuse has caused \nthe biggest waste of all. That $360 billion more we are spending is the \nbiggest spending item; it is like taxes. It is almost $1 billion a day. \nWe are sitting around here giving each other the good government award \nsaying, ``heavens above, balanced budget, balanced budget, balanced \nbudget,'' when we are increasing taxes, or the same as taxes, interest \non the national debt, of $1 billion a day.\n  Now Mr. President, let me just emphasize exactly the duplicitous \nconduct here of the Congress up here in Washington. Bob Reich, the \nSecretary of Labor, retired the other day and he wrote a book. I saw \nhim on TV. He was proud of two things. He said, ``You know, we passed \nthe Pension Reform Act of 1994, the Pension Reform Act of 1994.'' He \nsaid, ``In addition to getting the minimum wage, I am most proud of \nthat Pension Reform Act because corporate America has to fully secure \ntheir pensions so the workers of America moving from one place to \nanother are not going to lose their rights and their entitlements.''\n\n  Now what happens? Mr. President, I refer to the New York Times here \njust 10 some days ago, May 8, page 26: ``Former Star Pitcher Is \nSentenced to Prison.''\n\n       Denny McLain, the former star pitcher for the Detroit \n     Tigers, was sentenced today to eight years in prison and \n     ordered to pay $2.5 million in restitution for stealing from \n     the pension plan of a company he owned.\n       The two-time Cy Young Award winner, who was the last man to \n     win 30 games in a season, and his business partner were \n     convicted in December on charges that they had stolen $3 \n     million from the pension fund of the Peet Packing Co., then \n     used the money for company debts. . . .''\n\n  We make sure you get a criminal charge and a sentence, and a prison \nsentence if you steal from the fund, but up here in Washington, the \nsame crowd that passed that, whoopee, there it is. We get the good \ngovernment award. It is a wonderful thing. You can just steal from \nthese funds; the money is there. I do not see how you could in good \nconscience come around here with this budget without getting ashes in \nyour mouth. To say balanced budget when you know the instrument itself \nsays we have a deficit of $108 billion. Look on page 4, you can see \ndown there on line 23, the actual amount of $108 billion. Then you can \nsee where they list the debt for each year. As it increased, you can \nfind that the actual deficit in the fiscal year 2002 is 172 billion \nbucks.\n  So after all of this work, we have come from $180 billion--Mr. \nPresident, I see the distinguished ranking Member looking at the chart. \nThe actual deficit according for this year according to CBO is $180 \nbillion, not $70 billion. They are bragging about $67 billion. They \ngave us a figure of $70 billion a couple days ago because we use $110 \nbillion of the trust funds. We steal that money and give it to \nourselves, saying we have the deficit down to $70 billion and it is \nactually $180 billion; and after 5 years under this resolution, by \ntheir own figures, it is estimated to be $172 billion.\n  So, Mr. President, we have to stop the destruction of the economy of \nthis country. It is a 1 percent drag on economic growth when you run \nthese deficits and pay out all of this money when you don't pay for the \nGovernment you have. Here they have 12 million new jobs, low inflation, \nlow interest rates, and the finest growth for 5 years in a row. If we \ncan't stop look, listen, sober up, and begin to put this Government on \na pay-as-you-go basis tonight and this week in Washington, DC, in this \nU.S. Congress, it is never going to happen. And somehow, somewhere, we \nhave to get the free press, the media, to report the truth, because \nthey continue to report misleading figures. They don't quote the actual \ndeficit. All they have to do is read this bill. Find in here where they \nsay they balance the budget in the year 2002.\n  On the work sheet, they had the figures down here, Mr. President, of \na $1 billion surplus. But when they put out the actual resolution, that \nis not the case. They hide that in the descriptive language.\n  That is the way the system works. It is a cancer. We are spending \nmore money on waste. Interest payments cannot build a school, a \nhighway, and not 1 hour of research. There is no medical treatment. \nThere is nothing for the children of America that we are all concerned \nabout. There is nothing for Head Start, nothing for WIC, nothing for \nschool construction. We could build all the new school buildings all \nover the country for $360 billion.\n  That is how much we have increased our national interest payments \nwith this extravagance and this charade. It is a fraud on the American \npeople. The free press is supposed to keep us honest. They, as co-\nconspirators, unindicted, joined with us to defraud the American \npeople.\n  I hope we can vote for this amendment of mine this evening and stop \nthe fraud and get back to truth in budgeting. It is not too traumatic. \nEverybody is doing fine this year.\n  Just the other day, the Senate said rather than shut down the \nGovernment we could take this year's budget for next year. The mayor of \nany city in this situation would say, ``Let's not fire the policemen \nand firemen. We will just take this budget for the next year.'' A \nGovernor of any State would say, ``Let's just take this year's budget \nfor next year.''\n  We can save $50 billion by doing it. But we don't want to do that. We \nplay this game. We exact this fraud on the American people. Somehow, \nsomewhere it has to stop.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the distinguished chairman of our \nBudget Committee and our ranking member.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are due to vote, as I understand \nit, pursuant to the last unanimous-consent agreement at 10 minutes to \n8.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I know that the manager, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, wants to say something. I would like to make a quick \ncomment, if I might.\n  Few have the knowledge of the budget that the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina has. He understands it thoroughly, and he has been \na consistent purveyor of the alarm to be aware and to make sure that we \ndo the right thing.\n  It would be an ideal situation if we had the trust funds off budget, \nif we could deal with that in a quick moment like this. But the reality \nis that\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\nwe just can't do it, Mr. President. We have hammered out a budget. I \nused the term before. ``Hammer'' suggests the arduous effort that the \nbudget agreement took to get 5 million children covered under health \ncare, to make sure that impoverished seniors aren't further burdened by \nadditional premiums because we have moved the home health care from \npart A to part B.\n  There are a whole series of things. There are tax cuts for the middle \nclass. There are tax cuts for education. This bill was put together \nwith a lot of work and a lot of giving by many people, people who do \nnot like every part of this budget. I am one of them, I must tell you, \nbut I am determined that we see that we pass this budget.\n\n  I say to the Senator from South Carolina, a dear friend to many of us \nhere, that we ought to take a couple of these issues and work on them.\n  I agree with him on the trust funds on Social Security. I really do. \nI think we ought to take the time now--because we will be dealing with \na more solvent situation in several of the trust funds--to deal with \nthat. But it is not going to happen, I say here and now.\n  I will, unfortunately, be forced to vote against what the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina is proposing. I intend to do \njust that, to vote against it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina still has 3 \nminutes left.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President. The distinguished chairman said in an \nideal world that trust funds would be off budget. We live in an ideal \nworld with respect to Social Security. Section 13301, in accordance \nwith the Greenspan commission recommendation--President George Herbert \nWalker Bush signed legislation on November 5, 1990 that put Social \nSecurity off budget.\n  That is why, instead of a surplus in this document, you have a \ndeficit of $108 billion. We didn't get the rest of the trust funds off \nbudget like we should have. We should get the highways, airport, \nretirement trust funds, Medicare off budget. But this document uses the \nmoney on the deficit. You are allocating it to the deficit. So the \nideal world would be truth in budgeting.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has the Senator yielded back the remainder of his time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will use just 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about trust funds. But \nlet everybody understand that the amendment has nothing to do with \ntrust funds. The amendment has to do with just two things.\n  One, it strikes all of the tax cuts provided in this budget \nagreement, hammered out with the President and the Democratic leaders \nand the Republican leaders of both Houses. That is No. 1. Strike them \nall.\n  Second, it says that the $31.2 billion over 5 years of new \ninitiatives that we have hammered out with the President--and we cut \nhis initiatives almost in half to get there--but it says those \ninitiatives are gone, too.\n  So essentially the President got $31 billion in initiatives on \ncovering the little kids and things like that that most of us want. He \nwould take that out of this agreement, and at the same time, take out \nall of the tax cuts.\n  I don't intend to argue the substantive issue, which I think is \ntotally wrong for America today. I just suggest that nothing could more \nbasically attack the agreement than this, for the fundamentals of the \nagreement are gone if this amendment passes.\n  I yield any time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  Under the previous order, the Hollings amendment is set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 292\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on the motion to table the \nAllard amendment, No. 292. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Hollings amendment No. 295.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair. Right to the point, here is the \nconcurrent resolution. You will not find in this document anywhere a \nbalanced budget. Everyone is running hither and yon: ``Balanced budget, \nbalanced budget.'' The truth is, if you look on page 5, you have the \nfiscal year debt to the year 2001 and for the year 2002, the fiscal \nyear debt there going up to $172 billion. Actual deficit, without the \nuse of the trust funds, without looting all the pension funds, there is \n$172 billion.\n  This increases the debt each year every year for 5 years, whereby the \ninterest costs on the debt is a billion a day. We have spending on \nautopilot of $1 billion a day for absolutely nothing. Not for children. \nNot for highways. Not for research. Not for foreign aid. Not for \ndefense. We have total waste.\n  We have a cancer and it ought to be removed. My particular amendment \nsays do away with the tax cuts in this instrument; do away with the \nspending increases, the President's initiatives. We are on course for a \nbalanced budget by the fiscal year 2007. Truth in budgeting is the \nquestion put before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute. The \nSenate will please come to order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment takes out all of the tax \ncuts and all of the President's initiatives. Essentially it totally \nguts the entire agreement. There would be no tax cuts and there would \nbe no initiatives that we have agreed with the President on. I urge a \nno vote. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the amendment No. 295. \nA rollcall has not been requested.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the fiscal year 1998 \nbalanced budget resolution.\n  I congratulate the hard-working chairman of the Budget Committee for \nhis leadership and dedication in bringing us to this point, as well as \nour distinguished majority leader.\n  Am I especially happy to be able to use those 2 words, ``balanced \nbudget.''\n  This budget resolution represents a victory for the American people; \nfor sound, conservative principles; for those of us who have fought for \nyears for a balanced budget; for the seniors who will be protected by a \nsafer, sounder Medicare system; and for the workers of today and the \nchildren of tomorrow, who will benefit from a healthier economy and \nbetter jobs.\n  Some may be disappointed because this is not a ``perfect'' budget; \nbut it's a big improvement over the status quo; and there's a world of \ndifference between this budget and the big-government, tax-and-spend \nbudgets of just a few years ago.\n  Less than 2 years ago, President Clinton was saying we didn't even \nneed to balance the budget; then he said, maybe we could balance by \n2005; but the new Republican majority elected in 1994, and reelected in \n1996, insisted on a plan to a balanced budget by 2002--and now we've \ngot one.\n  Two years ago, when the first Republican Congress in 40 years took \noffice, we found a Medicare system ready to go bankrupt in 2001.\n  We said it was time to fix Medicare and we tried to slow its rate of \ngrowth to 6 or 7 percent a year, with pro-senior citizen, pro-consumer \nreforms.\n  Some from the other side tried to hit us with 30-second attack ads, \nclaiming that seniors' benefits would be slashed and burned.\n  But the American people didn't believe them.\n  Today, finally, we have a sober, responsible, bipartisan agreement \nthat says Medicare must be repaired--so that Medicare continues to be \nthere for our seniors who need it.\n  And yes, in this budget agreement, Medicare grows at about 6 percent \na year.\n  Under this budget, Medicare part A will be solvent for a decade.\n  The details that finally emerge later this year in a budget \nreconciliation bill will probably not contain all the structural, \nmarket-based reforms that Medicare needs for the long term, but this \nbudget should be a good start.\n  Four years ago, the President asked for, and Congress unfortunately \npassed, the biggest tax increase in history.\n  Today, this budget agreement includes real, pro-family, pro-growth, \ntax cuts.\n  We finally begin to roll back that last, huge tax increase.\n  The skeptics said you couldn't balance the budget, cut taxes, and get \nbipartisan agreement.\n  But this budget will do those things.\n  Let's remember: What this budget begins to do is let the people keep \nmore of their own money.\n  Under this budget, we will finally begin to get spending growth under \ncontrol.\n  Will the government still be too big and intrusive? Yes.\n  But the Federal Government will spend $1.1 trillion less over the \nnext 10 years than it would have spent under previous policies.\n  Spending growth will drop from 4.4 percent a year under previous \npolicies to 3.1 percent a year under this budget--just barely more than \ninflation.\n  The Government will finally begin to shrink relative to the size of \nthe economy.\n  Spending will still go up in nominal dollars, but it will drop from \n20.8 percent to 18.9 percent of gross domestic product, by 2002.\n  Of course, a lot depends on the enforcement provisions that will have \nto be part of the budget reconciliation legislation later this year.\n  I'll be watching that legislation closely.\n  We've learned from bitter existence in the past that permanent \nprocedures are needed to keep spending from running wild.\n  After all, the road to a $5.3 trillion debt was paved with good \nintentions.\n  That's why we should have passed--and still need--a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  But the budget enforcement rules called for under this budget \nresolution should help keep us on course to a balanced budget by 2002.\n  A majority of the people in America have seen the budget balanced \nexactly once or never in their lifetimes.\n  The last two balanced budgets were in 1960 and 1969.\n  A majority of Americans alive today were born after 1960.\n  It's time for that destructive trend to end.\n  It's time to create a better future for all Americans.\n  This budget resolution is the right beginning of that promising \nfuture.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes the budget resolution on Wednesday, there be an \nadditional 5 hours subtracted from the overall time constraints \nprovided for in the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I assume we have no further amendments \ntonight, but I think Senator Grassley would like to take some time, and \nI will yield that time to him at this point. How much time would the \nSenator like?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Can I have 20 minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator mind closing the Senate after his 20 \nminutes? Does the Senator from New Jersey have any objection? The \nSenator from Iowa is going to take 20 minutes, and we will let him \nclose the Senate if we are finished for the evening.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No, I certainly trust the Senator from Iowa. He is \nnot going to cut taxes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4744-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise to condemn in the strongest possible \nterms recent comments that have been attributed to Mr. Freih Abu \nMedein, the Justice Minister in the Palestinian authority.\n  In a May 17 article in the Washington Post, journalist Barton Gellman \nreported that Mr. Medein stated last month that ``five Zionist Jews'' \nare running the United States' Middle East policy and, in the words of \nthe article, he ``added that it is implausible that a\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\nnation the size of the United States can find no one else to maintain \ndiplomatic contacts with Palestinians.''\n  This statement, if quoted correctly, is deeply offensive on two \ncounts. First, it is patently anti-semitic, or more properly, anti-\nJewish. Its conspiratorial overtones reflect the worst traditions of \nhate-mongering that characterizes classical anti-semitism.\n  Second, it is a thinly veiled attempt to manipulate our sovereign \nright as a country to choose whoever we wish to represent us \ndiplomatically. It also evinces complete ignorance of the American \nsystem.\n  I am confident that the individuals to whom Mr. Medein refers were \nnot chosen for their religious beliefs, but rather on the strength of \ntheir qualifications for the jobs for which they were selected. Anyone \nwho thinks otherwise has great deal to learn about this country.\n  If Mr. Medein or anyone else in the Palestinian Authority has \ndifficulty meeting with American representatives who happen to profess \na particular religious faith, then that is their problem, not ours.\n  I would submit, Mr. President, that we have the right to choose a \nperson of any faith, any gender, and any race to represent us in any \nplace. Should we choose an American who happens to be a Muslim to \nrepresent us in Israel, a Hindu to represent us in Pakistan, a Jew in \nSyria, a Roman Catholic in Yugoslavia, a Greek Orthodox in Turkey, or a \nBuddhist in China, then that is our sovereign right as a nation. The \nonly criterion should be that the person be qualified for the job for \nwhich he or she is selected. Religious affiliation should have \nabsolutely nothing to do with it. Zero. Zilch.\n  That is what distinguishes us from the rest of the world. For \nunfortunately, Mr. Medein's views are not isolated ones. They reflect \nan all-to-common obsession with race, religion, and ethnicity that \nplagues much of the world.\n  We may not be perfect, but our guiding ideals are unassailable. And \nwe have successfully put those ideals into practice, with the result \nthat many others seek to emulate us.\n  Mr. President, the day we pause even for a fraction of a second to \ncontemplate the possible validity of remarks such as Mr. Medein's is \nthe day that we abandon our most fundamental beliefs.\n  Bigotry must be denounced, whether it is at home or abroad. American \nrepresentatives who are the object of bigoted attacks deserve to know \nthat their country stands four-square behind them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4745-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

He was \nemployed by the Department of Veterans Affairs in Bedford, MA as \ncoordinator and supervisor in the Social Work Service Department. Most \nrecently, he was program manager of the Veterans Homestead transitional \nhousing program in Leominster, MA. In addition, he served as an equal \nemployment opportunity Officer at Veteran Affairs Central Office in \nWashington, DC, and in several capacities in private practice as a \nlicensed independent clinical social worker.\n  Colonel Leary shared his many wide-ranging interests with his family \nand friends including politics, travel, golf, hockey, baseball, and \nsoccer. He was constantly involved in youth sport activities and was \nhis children's most avid fan. To all who knew him, he was a model \ncitizen and family member.

Further, pursuant to section 204(b) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) (IEEPA) \nand section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), I \nhereby report that I have exercised my statutory authority to declare a \nnational emergency to respond to the actions and policies of the \nGovernment of Burma and have issued an Executive order prohibiting \nUnited States persons from new investment in Burma.\n  The order prohibits United States persons from engaging in any of the \nfollowing activities after its issuance:\n  --entering a contract that includes the economic development of \n    resources located in Burma;\n  --entering a contract providing for the general supervision and \n    guarantee of another person's performance of a contract that \n    includes the economic development of resources located in Burma;\n  --purchasing a share of ownership, including an equity interest, in \n    the economic development of resources located in Burma;\n  --entering into a contract providing for the participation in \n    royalties, earnings, or profits in the economic development of \n    resources located in Burma, without regard to the form of the \n    participation;\n  --facilitating transactions of foreign persons that would violate any \n    of the foregoing prohibitions if engaged in by a United States \n    person; and\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\n  --evading or avoiding, or attempting to violate, any of the \n    prohibitions in the order.\n  Consistent with the terms of section 570(b) of the Act, the order \ndoes not prohibit the entry into, performance of, or financing of most \ncontracts for the purchase or sale of goods, services, or technology. \nFor purposes of the order, the term ``resources'' is broadly defined to \ninclude such things as natural, agricultural, commercial, financial, \nindustrial, and human resources. However, not-for-profit educational, \nhealth, or other humanitarian programs or activities are not considered \nto constitute economic development of resources located in Burma. In \naccordance with section 570(b), the prohibition on an activity that \nconstitutes a new investment applies if such activity is undertaken \npursuant to an agreement, or pursuant to the exercise of rights under \nan agreement that is entered into with the Government of Burma or a \nnon-governmental entity in Burma, on or after the effective date of the \nExecutive order.\n  My Administration will continue to consult and express our concerns \nabout developments in Burma with the Burmese authorities as well as \nleaders of ASEAN, Japan, the European Union, and other countries having \nmajor political, security, trading, and investment interests in Burma \nand seek multilateral consensus to bring about democratic reform and \nimprove human rights in that country. I have, accordingly, delegated to \nthe Secretary of State the responsibilities in this regard under \nsection 570(c) and (d) of the Act.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState, is authorized to issue regulations in exercise of my authorities \nunder IEEPA and section 570(b) of the Act to implement this prohibition \non new investment. All Federal agencies are also directed to take \nactions within their authority to carry out the provisions of the \nExecutive order.\n  I have taken these steps in response to a deepening pattern of severe \nrepression by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in \nBurma. During the past 7 months, the SLORC has arrested and detained \nlarge numbers of students and opposition supporters, sentenced dozens \nto long-term imprisonment, and prevented the expression of political \nviews by the democratic opposition, including Aung San Suu Kyi and the \nNational League for Democracy (NLD). It is my judgment that recent \nactions by the regime in Rangoon constitute large-scale repression of \nthe democratic opposition committed by the Government of Burma within \nthe meaning of section 570(b) of the Act.\n  The Burmese authorities also have committed serious abuses in their \nrecent military campaign against Burma's Karen minority, forcibly \nconscripting civilians and compelling thousands to flee into Thailand. \nMoreover, Burma remains the world's leading producer of opium and \nheroin, with official tolerance of drug trafficking and traffickers in \ndefiance of the views of the international community.\n  I believe that the actions and policies of the SLORC regime \nconstitute an extraordinary and unusual threat to the security and \nstability of the region, and therefore to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States.\n  It is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the \nUnited States to seek an end to abuses of human rights in Burma and to \nsupport efforts to achieve democratic reform. Progress on these issues \nwould promote regional peace and stability and would be in the \npolitical, security, and economic interests of the United States.\n  The steps I take today demonstrate my Administration's resolve to \nsupport the people of Burma, who made clear their commitment to human \nrights and democracy in 1990 elections, the results of which the regime \nchose to disregard.\n  I am also pleased to note that the Administration and the Congress \nspeak with one voice on this issue, as reflected in executive-\nlegislative cooperation in the enactment of section 570 of the Foreign \nOperations Act. I look forward to continued close consultation with the \nCongress on efforts to promote human rights and democracy in Burma.\n  In conclusion, I emphasize that Burma's international isolation is \nnot an inevitability, and that the authorities in Rangoon retain the \nability to secure improvements in relations with the United States as \nwell as with the international community. In this respect, I once again \ncall on the SLORC to lift restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi and the \npolitical opposition, to respect the rights of free expression, \nassembly, and association, and to undertake a dialogue that includes \nleaders of the NLD and the ethnic minorities and that deals with the \npolitical future of Burma.\n  In the weeks and months to come, my Administration will continue to \nmonitor and assess action on these issues, paying careful attention to \nthe report of the U.N. Special Rapporteur appointed by the U.N. Human \nRights Commission and the report of the U.N. Secretary General on the \nresults of his good offices mandate. Thus, I urge the regime in Rangoon \nto cooperate fully with those two important U.N. initiatives on Burma.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive order that I have issued. The \norder is effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern daylight time, May 21, 1997.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to further improve the safety and health of working environments, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 THE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADVANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am very pleased and proud to rise and \nspeak in support of S. 765, the Safety and Health Advancement Act that \nI have sponsored.\n  I thank all of the people who have been involved in the process of \ncoming up with an OSHA modernization bill. You notice I mentioned \nmodernization, not reform.\n  There have been a lot of people involved in this. My colleagues, my \nstaff members, and over 50 organizations have been involved in \nreviewing suggestions that we have had for modernizing the OSHA \nprocess.\n  Over the last 6 years, there have been bills introduced by both \nRepublicans and Democrats that wound up on the great scrap heap of \nunfinished business because they have been put in to make a statement, \na political statement.\n  For every time that a bill is put into committee, there is a \ncommittee report, an 8\\1/2\\ by 5\\1/2\\ inch booklet that lists a \nparagraph-by-paragraph analysis of the bill, the majority opinion, the \nminority opinion, every amendment that has been suggested for the bill, \nand how people voted on it.\n  We have gone back through the last 6 years of those bills, and we \nfound on the issues that there seem to be common ground, and we have \nput those in the bill. We have looked for the issues that were \nconscientious that were dividing, and we found some new approaches for \nsome of those things.\n  We have not been able to address everything. But we have a bill that \nwill help to move small business forward, that will give small business \na better chance to have safety in the workplace for their workers.\n  That is the main point of this bill.\n  Again, I thank all of the people who have helped me on it, and I look \nforward to working with everybody on what I think will be a very \nreasonable approach that can go through both bodies and help out the \nworkers in the workplace.\n\n  For 6 year's Members on both sides of the aisle have seen the need \nfor modernization. Unfortunately, its been approached each year as \nreform--and often as drastic reform. Big business and big union have \nseen the bills as an opportunity to make a statement--a political \nstatement. The workers and small business have needed some \nclarification and a lot of help that has gotten lost in the statements. \nThe issue of workplace safety and health is extremely important to a \nhealthy America. Advancing safety and health in the American workplace \nis a matter of great importance and it must be considered in a serious \nand rational manner by Congress, by the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, by employers, and yes, by employees too. This bill is \noverdue, common sense legislation.\n  When I began my service on the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, I was surprised to discover the volume of documentation and \nresources available to us and our staffs. Each time a bill is reported \nout of committee, a 5\\1/2\\- by -8\\1/2\\ booklet is made available to us \nthat lists every detail about that bill--a luxury I never had when I \nserved in the Wyoming State Legislature. Included in that booklet is a \nparagraph by paragraph analysis of the bill, with a majority and a \nminority opinion on each section. It shows every amendment, discusses \nthem at length and reports who voted for and against them in committee. \nWith this abundance of committee reports, I felt like a kid in a candy \nstore. I just picked up 6 year's worth of OSHA bills and began reading. \nSurprisingly enough, I found that the things that business and labor \nneeded to have done were pretty commonly agreed upon as necessary. Just \nthe politicized statements separated the two sides.\n  The fate of each bill was determined when such statements reared \ntheir ugly heads and squelched any chance of improving the safety and \nhealth of\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\nAmerica's workplaces. Each year, legislators in the House and Senate \nintroduce bills that appeal to a wide variety of special interests--\nsetting the stage for a lot of mudslinging. These bills contained good \nideas, but they eventually toppled from a barrage of political \nattacks--tossing them all onto the great scrap heap of Congress' \nunfinished business. It just goes to show that people who sling mud, \nlose ground. I found that both big businesses and big unions have made \na lot of statements over the years, but statements don't become law and \nthey certainly don't change things. Good legislation becomes law. It is \ntime that we tuck the statements back into our coat pockets and start \npassing some common sense legislation that advances the safety and \nhealth of the American workplace.\n  We all want a healthy and safe workplace. Legislation should \ntherefore revolve around not what we want, but how to get there in a \nmanner that is fair and equitable to all. There is no room for politics \nin the arena of human life. For this reason, I spent the last 14 weeks \npouring the foundation for a new, comprehensive OSHA bill. This \nfoundation does not consist of cement, but something stronger--the \nthoughts, suggestions and good ideas of employees, employers, and the \nindividuals that govern them. I want to be clear that this bill does \nnot include all the concerns of every interested party, but I do \nbelieve that it constitutes an important first step.\n\n  This bill sticks to a theme-- ``the advancement of safety and health \nin the workplace.'' I am proud to say that it has been crafted to \npromote and enhance workplace safety and health--rather than dismantle \nit. We are addressing an issue that affects people from all walks of \nlife. It is essential that we take each step with care.\n  To be successful and effective, a well-crafted bill must provide \nincentives for employers and employees to act more responsibly. We need \nto make the profit motive work for worker safety, not against it. This \nspirit of cooperation must overpower political polarization if true \nimprovements are to be achieved. OSHA must recognize that the vast \nmajority of employers are not heartless and cruel. Having played the \nwage payer role for over 26 years, I take great offense when employers \nare characterized as Ebenezer Scrooges or Simon Legrees. The majority \nof employers cherish their most valuable assets--their employees. It is \ntruly misleading and deceptive for anyone to say otherwise. For without \nthe employee, management will ultimately have no staff, no profits--and \nno business. Watching out for employees is just good business\n  When the Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted 27 years ago, \nits intended purpose was to make the workplace free from ``recognized \nhazards that are causing, or likely to cause death or serious physical \nharm to . . . employees.'' As is the case with many programs \nestablished by Congress over the years, OSHA strayed from its original \nmission of protecting people from occupational safety and health \nhazards through preventative measures. The focus has instead been \nheavily weighted toward and concentrating on penalties and enforcement. \nOSHA should retain the ability to punish employers who don't embrace \nworkplace safety and health, but it should reward those who do. The \ncarrot and stick approach has always worked before, but OSHA prefers \nusing the stick by itself--and they rarely walk softly. I want to be \nclear that this bill does not dismantle OSHA's enforcement \ncapabilities. That approach has been tried time and time again. But, \nenforcement alone cannot ensure the safety of our Nation's workplaces \nand the health of our working population. America would be better \nserved by an OSHA that places a greater emphasis on promoting employers \nand employees working together and this bill would strike that balance.\n  To continue the course set by Congress' original intent back in 1970, \nconsultative services must be drastically expanded. My bill calls for \nthat. Studies have shown that many sites where serious workplace \naccidents have occurred were not inspected by Federal OSHA inspectors \nfor several years prior to the accident. This lack of attention to \npotential problem areas is due in part to an overemphasis on \nenforcement. If just the inspectors are working on safety, you can't \npossibly have enough inspectors. Everyone has to be involved. My \nlegislation will allow OSHA greater flexibility in allocating its \nresources so it can give the most serious workplace problems its \nhighest priority and most careful attention.\n  This bill advances safety and health by allowing employers to \nactively promote employee/employer discussions concerning occupational \nsafety and health hazards. Voluntary compliance by employers would be \nencouraged as part of the solution, not as part of the problem--as part \nof the prevention, not as part of the penalty. Employers would have the \noption of implementing an alcohol and substance abuse testing program \nin order to ensure a safe workplace. I have had the opportunity to see \nfirst hand the benefits of this type of program. I have been tested and \ngiven tests and I know about validity and dignity. Employees would be \nheld accountable for misconduct in a site that has been determined by \nOSHA to be in compliance with existing regulations. Employees have the \nultimate control as to whether safety toes, hard hats or safety goggles \nare worn. Employers would receive incentives from OSHA for utilizing \nthe services of third party consultants. Moreover, continuing education \nand professional certification for OSHA consultants and inspectors \nwould be required to ensure that the rapid advancement of technology \ndoesn't surpass OSHA's ability to identify occupational safety and \nhealth hazards in the workplace.\n\n  Not only have 6 years of OSHA proposals been reviewed, Meetings have \nbeen held with over 50 interested groups from the National Federation \nof Independent Businesses to the AFL-CIO. Contact has been made and \nsome explanation given to every member of the Labor Committee. All \nsuggestions received have been considered. Those that meet the goal of \nsafety and health improvement without appearing contentious have been \nincluded. I am looking forward to a bipartisan effort to create the \nkind of workplace we want and need in America. This bill doesn't call \nfor radical change, but it does start the progress and the process to \nsafety. It makes changes small business can't wait any longer for.\n  The Safety and Health Advancement Act represents a clean, fresh start \nto addressing the problems that affect OSHA, employers and employees. I \nam quite eager to work with each of my distinguished colleagues as this \nissue winds its way through the legislative process. By working \ntogether, we can return OSHA to its original course as envisioned by \nCongress when it crafted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970. I urge my colleagues to give fair consideration to this bill and \nI welcome your support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 765\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to compliment my distinguished \ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for introducing this important \npiece of legislation. This bill addresses an issue that is critical to \nsmall businessowners across America. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor.\n  The Safety and Health Advancement Act is a commonsense approach to \nreining in an overreaching Federal agency.\n  I worked in Congress when the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration [OSHA] was created in the 1970's. Many people today \nwould find it hard to believe that OSHA was created to assist \nbusiness--especially small businesses. In its original intent, OSHA \nexisted not just to help enforce workplace safety laws, but to help \nsmall businessowners understand those laws and advise them on how to \ncomply.\n  What OSHA has grown into is an agency of confrontation and \nintimidation. The mere mention of OSHA strikes fear in the hearts of \nsmall businessowners everywhere.\n  The father of one of my staff members owns small heating and air-\nconditioning business in Nebraska. He's a good employer. He runs a safe \nworkplace and treats his employees fairly. But he faces the constant \nthreat that an unannounced visit by OSHA could shut him down because he \ndoesn't have the resources to appeal the high fines frequently handed \nout by OSHA.\n  I hear stories like this from small businessowners throughout \nNebraska. Businesses that are fined tens of thousands of dollars for a \nminor infraction of a regulation they frequently did not even know \nexisted. They are forced to close their doors and lay off their \nemployees because they can't afford to fight the fines that come \nthrough arbitrary process.\n  Mr. President, the safety of our workplaces must continue to be a top \npriority. Where there are those violating the law and creating unsafe \nworking conditions, we should go after them and persecute to the \nfullest extent of the law. Those are the individuals OSHA should be \ngoing after. But the Government should not be killing jobs by \nintimidating honest, hardworking small businessowners. We need to focus \non the real problems in the workplace.\n  The Safety and Health Advancement Act would help address this \nproblem. It gives OSHA the flexibility to prioritize its resources in \norder to target the worst offenders. It encourages voluntary compliance \nby rewarding employers who use third-party consultants. It holds \nemployees responsible for their misconduct at a site that is in \ncompliance with OSHA regulations.\n  This bill returns OSHA to its original intent and expands its \nconsultative services. Under this legislation, OSHA would actually work \nhand in hand with small businessowners to create safe workplaces, not \nmerely hand down punitive fines. It moves OSHA away from confrontation \nand back toward cooperation.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Safety and Health \nAdvancement Act. Not only will this bill help make America's workplaces \nsafer, it will go a long way in freeing America's small businessowners \nfrom the heavy burdens of Government regulation. I urge my colleagues \nto support this commonsense legislation.\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Abraham, Mr. Torricelli, Mrs. Boxer and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 768. A bill for the relief of Michel Christopher Meili, Giuseppina \nMeili, Mirjam Naomi Meili, and Davide Meili, to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                       PRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nFeinstein, Hatch, Dodd, Abraham, Torricelli, Biden, and Boxer to \nintroduce a bill to provide protection to Christophe and his family so \nthat they may stay in this country and that Christophe may be allowed \nto work and support his family.\n  Christophe Meili is the Swiss bank guard fired after he reported the \ndestruction of Holocaust era bank records at the Union Bank of \nSwitzerland, Zurich branch, on January 8, 1997. He is here along with \nhis wife Guiseppina, and his two children, Miriam and David.\n  For his bravery in saving historically important documents from the \nshredder, Christophe was fired and today is under investigation for \nviolating Swiss bank secrecy laws for disclosing the records, first to \nthe Zurich Jewish Community and then to the Swiss police. He has faced \npersecution and penalties for a deed that ennobles him in the eyes of \nthe world. Moreover, he and his family have faced hundreds of death \nthreats, including kidnaping threats made against his children. He is \ntruly a man without a country.\n  When we held a hearing on his plight in the Banking Committee, he \nmade two remarkable statements. First, when asked why he felt the \nrecords he saved were important, he responded,\n\n       ``A few months before, I had seen the movie `Schindler's \n     List.' And that's how, when I saw these documents, I realized \n     I must take responsibility; I must do something.''\n\n  When I asked him at the end of the hearing if he had anything to add, \nhe said,\n\n       Please protect me in the U.S.A. and in Switzerland. I think \n     I become a great problem in Switzerland. I have a woman, two \n     little children, and no future. I must see what goes on in \n     the next days for me. Please protect me. That is all.\n\n  Mr. President, we owe Christophe Meili this much. He has asked to be \nprotected and it is our duty to do so. We are in the presence of a very \ngood man, a man who has made a difference and will be remembered for \ngenerations to come.\n  Christophe Meili should be viewed as a hero, not a criminal. His \nactions in preventing the destruction of evidence are courageous and \nserve the cause of justice for the victims and survivors of the \nHolocaust and their families. It is a stain upon the victims' memory \nthat a\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\nyoung man who saved records to help their cause is now being made a \nvictim. It is unfortunate that the chairman of UBS, Robert Studer, has \neven made remarks questioning the motivation of Christophe for \npreventing the destruction of these records.\n  Moreover, while Christophe and his family have been persecuted for \nhis noble deed, it is a disgrace that the bank's archivist who ordered \nthe shredding at UBS, Erwin Haggenmuller, still has his job. I wrote to \nPeter Cosandey, the district attorney of Zurich who is investigating \nthis case, and I asked him to end his harassment of Christophe. I also \nasked him why he is not investigating Erwin Hagenmuller for his role in \nordering the shredding of the files.\n  Christophe has been unemployed since January and this hardship is \ntaking its toll on this brave young man and his family. Thankfully, \nEdgar Bronfman has come to the rescue once again by offering Christophe \na job. I am sure that this is a comfort to Christophe and his family.\n  Christophe Meili's story is one of a man dedicated to seeing that \njustice is achieved, yet persecuted because he tried to ensure it. His \ntreatment by the security firm that employed him and the bank that \nwants him prosecuted, is unjust and unfair.\n  This is a tragedy. Because he did his job, Christophe Meili was \nfired. Because he showed courage and integrity, Christophe Meili was \nfired. And now, they are threatening him with prosecution. The people \ndeserve better.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in granting this hero, \nthis righteous man, the sanctuary that he has requested and that he and \nhis family deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 768\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The actions of Swiss banks and their relations with \n     Nazi Germany before and during World War II and the banks' \n     actions after the war concerning former Nazi loot and \n     heirless assets placed in the banks before the war have been \n     the subject of an extensive and ongoing inquiry by the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the \n     Senate and a study by a United States interagency group.\n       (2) On January 8, 1997, Michel Christopher Meili, while \n     performing his duties as a security guard at the Union Bank \n     of Switzerland in Zurich, Switzerland, discovered that bank \n     employees were shredding important Holocaust-era documents.\n       (3) Mr. Meili was able to save some of the documents from \n     destruction and then turned them over to the Jewish community \n     in Zurich and to the Swiss police.\n       (4) Following Mr. Meili's disclosure of the destruction of \n     the Holocaust-era documents, Mr. Meili was suspended and then \n     terminated from his job. He was also interrogated by the \n     local Swiss authorities who tried to intimidate him by \n     threatening prosecution for his heroic actions.\n       (5) Since this disclosure, Mr. Meili and his family have \n     been threatened and harassed, and have received many death \n     threats. Mr. Meili also received a hand-delivered note \n     threatening the kidnapping of his children in return for the \n     ``Jewish money'' he would receive for his actions, and urging \n     him to emigrate to the United States or be killed.\n       (6) Because of his courageous actions, Mr. Meili and his \n     family have suffered economic hardship, mental anguish, and \n     have been forced to live in fear for their lives.\n\n     SEC. 2. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Michel Christopher Meili, Giuseppina Meili, Mirjam Naomi \n     Meili, and Davide Meili shall be held and considered to have \n     been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent \n     residence as of the date of the enactment of this Act upon \n     payment of the required visa fees.\n\n     SEC. 3. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.\n\n       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Michel \n     Christopher Meili, Giuseppina Meili, Mirjam Naomi Meili, and \n     Davide Meili as provided in this Act, the Secretary of State \n     shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by the \n     appropriate number during the current fiscal year the total \n     number of immigrant visas available to natives of the country \n     of the aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Graham, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 769. A bill to amend the provisions of the Emergency Planning and \nCommunity Right-To-Know Act of 1986 to expand the public's right to \nknow about toxic chemical use and release, to promote pollution \nprevention, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4748-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4753-S4760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n      THE RIGHT-TO-KNOW MORE AND POLLUTION PREVENTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today the Environmental Protection \nAgency is making public its annual inventory of toxic chemical \nreleases. This information is made available to the public under the \nEmergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act which I authored in \n1986.\n  EPA announced today a 45.6 percent decrease nationwide in the release \nof toxic chemicals since 1988, when these data were first collected. In \nmy State of New Jersey, which has a large chemical industry, releases \nwere reduced by a stunning 70 percent.\n  Mr. President, the right-to-know law has been an enormous success. \nShedding the light of day on toxic pollution has encouraged industries \nto find ways to reduce the threat of these cancer causing materials to \nour communities. We should build on that success.\n  Today I am introducing with Senators Torricelli, Boxer, Kerry, \nGraham, Kennedy and Wellstone the Right-to-Know More and Pollution \nPrevention Act of 1997, which will significantly expand the public's \nright-to-know about toxic chemicals in their homes, workplaces, and \ncommunities.\n  The landmark 1986 Right-to-Know Act requires companies to list the \namount of certain chemicals that leave their facilities as pollution \nand enter our air, water, or soil. It has often been cited as one of \nthe most effective environmental laws on the books. By shining a public \nspotlight on pollution, the public is better informed, and many \ncompanies have taken voluntary steps to reduce pollution.\n  In fact, without using traditional ``command and control \nrequirements,'' the publication of right-to-know data has led companies \nto voluntarily reduce their releases of toxic chemicals by almost 46 \npercent, or 1.6 billion pounds, between 1988 and 1994.\n  The bill I am introducing today significantly expands the community \nright-to-know reporting requirements by tracking toxic materials as \nthey move through a facility--to tell us what comes in, what is \ntransformed into product or waste, and what leaves a facility as \npollution. This tracking system, known as chemical use or materials \naccounting, can further decrease the use of toxic chemicals and their \nrelease into the environment.\n  When my own State of New Jersey began collecting information on toxic \nchemicals used by industries, in addition to recording toxic chemical \nreleases, the results were dramatic. Whereas the national decrease in \ntoxic emissions reported is 45.6 percent since 1988, in New Jersey it \nhas been 70 percent. The discrepancy between New Jersey and the rest of \nthe country, I believe, is due to the State requirement for materials \naccounting.\n  The reason that materials accounting data is so valuable is that it \nprovides information to industry and incentives to prevent pollution. \nWith this data, industrial facilities have the information necessary to \ndevelop pollution prevention plans.\n  Pollution prevention is the highest priority in managing waste, and \nfalls at the top of the ladder of steps industry can take to reduce \npollution--starting with prevention, then recycling, and then \ntreatment, with disposal or release into the environment the least \ndesirable last step. This so-called hierarchy of waste management has \nbeen endorsed by the Environmental Protection Agency as well as many \nFortune 500 companies and the armed services.\n  Materials accounting makes pollution prevention planning possible. \nYou can't reduce toxic use if you don't know the quantity of toxics \nused and how they're used. That's why materials accounting data is so \nimportant. The bill requires companies which collect materials \naccounting data to prepare pollution prevention plans to decrease their \nuse of toxics to protect those who might be exposed to them and can \nhelp companies improve their bottom line.\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\nIt represents a strong marriage between environmental concerns and \neconomic efficiency.\n  A recent New Jersey study found that for every dollar spent on \nadditional reporting, companies actually saved between five and eight \ndollars in reduced costs. By reducing waste, companies reduce their \ncost of doing business.\n  Mr. President, materials accounting provides a framework for \nidentifying opportunities to reduce pollution at the source through \nchanges in production, operation and raw materials use. A random survey \nof 42 New Jersey facilities showed that 62 percent of the companies \nquestioned anticipated that pollution prevention initiatives, based on \ninformation gleaned from materials accounting data, could save them \nmoney. Business wins, the public wins, and the public health and \nenvironment wins.\n  Mr. President, my bill directs the EPA to expand right-to-know \nreporting to include information on toxic chemicals being transported \nthrough communities and used by industries in their products and \nworkplaces.\n  It would fill reporting gaps in the existing law by requiring all \ncompanies that have more than the stipulated threshold amounts to file \nreports, regardless of the industrial classification in which they \nfall. EPA could exempt categories of industry groups if the benefits \nand paperwork requirements are disproportionate to any benefit.\n  Finally, the bill requires businesses to prepare pollution prevention \nplans based on the materials accounting data they collect.\n  Mr. President, EPA has proposed requiring materials accounting data \nunder existing authorities of the Emergency Planning and Community \nRight-To-Know Law [EPCRA] and other statutes.\n  I believe the law gives them that authority. However, some industry \ngroups have challenged literally every action by the office that \nimplements the Right-to-Know Law. To avoid continuing court fights and \navoid needless delays, this law would clarify congressional intent.\n  Mr. President, this bill will help ensure a healthier environment for \nall of us, and can save industry money, making our economy and chemical \nindustry more cost competitive. It makes good environmental sense and \ngood business sense. And it's legislation that the public wants. I hope \nwe will move to enact it in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \ninserted in the Record, along with letters from EPA Administrator \nBrowner and USPIRG and the Environmental Information Center supporting \nthe bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

As you are aware, \n     expanding the public's right to know about harmful pollutants \n     in our communities is a top priority for this Administration. \n     We understand that your bill, The Right to Know More and \n     Pollution Prevention Act of 1997, seeks to advance community \n     right to know, pollution prevention planning and the \n     information available to the public on chemical use.\n       This Administration believes that putting environmental and \n     public health information into the hands of the American \n     people is one of the most effective ways to reduce local \n     pollution and prevent it from occurring in the future. In \n     fact, the Agency recently made final a rule to add seven new \n     industry categories to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), \n     increasing the number of covered facilities to 31,000--a \n     thirty percent increase. During the coming year, we will be \n     working on ways to further improve TRI, including a \n     stakeholder process to address reporting burdens, an \n     examination of types of data collected, consideration of new \n     thresholds for persistent, bioaccumulating toxic chemicals \n     and developing options regarding chemical use information.\n       I look forward to working with you in the future to further \n     the public's right to know about environmental health threats \n     in their homes, schools and communities.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carol M.

This bill will \n     dramatically improve the amount and quality of information \n     that citizens count on to keep themselves and their children \n     safe. This bill will also encourage pollution prevention. The \n     reduction of toxic chemical use and waste is urgent while \n     waste generation is steadily increasing nationwide, except in \n     New Jersey and Massachusetts where companies are required by \n     state law to collect and report toxic use data. The Right to \n     Know More and Pollution Prevention Act of 1997 will reverse \n     the dangerous trend for the rest of the nation.\n       The Community Right to Know Act is the best source of \n     public information about toxic pollution and is lauded by the \n     administration, environmentalists, and often industry leaders \n     as one of the most effective environmental protections. \n     Unfortunately, reporting under this law is woefully \n     inadequate. Less than 5% of pollution information is reported \n     to the public. We need to protect and expand the public's \n     Right to Know. The Right to Know More and Pollution \n     Prevention Act of 1997 will expand the public's Right to Know \n     to include:\n       1. Toxics use reporting which tells the public about toxic \n     chemicals transported through their neighborhoods; produced, \n     used and stored in the work place and put into consumer \n     products.\n       2. More complete data on toxic emissions including \n     information from all major industrial sources of toxic \n     pollution and data on extremely hazardous substances like \n     dioxins and mercury which are currently not collected under \n     the law.\n       3. Pollution Prevention Planning which will direct \n     companies to develop pollution prevention plans by setting \n     their own goals for pollution reduction.\n       The public has a right to know more than they currently do \n     about toxic chemicals. In addition, preventing pollution must \n     be our\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\n     goal in light of the data revealing the steady rise in waste \n     creation throughout the nation. We hope each Senator makes \n     this legislation a top environmental priority.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carolyn Hartmann,\n       Environmental Program Director.\n     Andrea Askowitz,\n       Right to Know Campaign Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Environmental Information Center,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1997.\n     Hon.

In addition, bill language aimed at improving \n     pollution prevention will help to eliminate problems before \n     they occur.\n       We will support early consideration and passage of this \n     legislation and look forward to working with you on this \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Philip E.

A bill to encourage production of oil and gas within the \nUnited States by providing tax incentives, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          the domestic oil and gas production and recovery act\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Domestic \nOil and Gas Production and Preservation Act. This legislation is an \neffort to help revive our domestic oil and gas industry which plays \nsuch a vital role in our national security. If our domestic industry is \nto survive, then Congress needs to act now to provide tax incentives to \nencourage production in America.\n  Since the early 1980's, oil and gas extraction employment has been \ncut in half. Employment in the oil and gas industry has declined by \n500,000 since 1984. Imports of crude oil products were $68 billion in \n1996, up 24 percent over last year and the import dependency ratio now \nexceeds 50 percent. From 1973 to 1996, crude oil production dropped 44 \npercent in the lower 48 States. We must take action now to save \ndomestic production not only for the sake of the oil and gas industry \nbut for the sake of the national security of this Nation.\n  To date, the Clinton administration has done nothing to encourage \ndomestic production. In fact, in 1996, crude oil reserves continued to \ndecline by 788 million barrels. Natural gas reserves fell by 2,600 Bcf \nto 162,415 Bcf. In the President's budget there is nothing to aid this \nindustry. That is why I am introducing this bill today.\n  The Domestic Oil and Gas Production and Preservation Act is intended \nto do just what its name implies--encourage oil and gas production and \npreserve and revitalize the domestic oil and gas industry. This bill \nwould accomplish these goals through specific tax proposals. Section 2 \nof the bill would allow current expensing of geological and geophysical \ncosts incurred domestically including the Outer Continental Shelf. \nThese costs are an important and integral part of exploration and \nproduction for oil and natural gas, and should be expensed.\n  In addition to the G expensing, this bill provides for the \nelimination of the net income limit on percentage depletion. Currently, \nthe net income limitation requires percentage depletion to be \ncalculated on a property-by-property basis and disallows depletion to \nthe extent it exceeds the net income from a particular property, thus \ndiscouraging producers from investing income from other oil and gas \nproperties to maintain marginal wells.\n  Furthermore, this bill clarifies that delay rental payments are \ndeductible, at the election of the taxpayer, as ordinary and necessary \nbusiness expenses. This clarifies an otherwise gray area in Treasury \nregulations and eliminates costly administrative and compliance burdens \non both taxpayers and the IRS. It would also extend the 90-day \nprepayment period to 180 days for determining when deductions may be \ntaken on certain oil and gas investments. Harsh winter conditions in \nmany States make the current 90-day limitation for commercial drilling \nimpractical.\n  Lastly, section 6 includes hydro injection as a tertiary recovery \nmethod for purposes of the enhanced oil recovery credit. Although the \nTreasury Department is tasked with continued evaluations and editions \nto the list of recovery methods covered under the EOR, they have proven \nnotably lax in pursuing this objective. By legislating this outcome, \nthis bill keeps domestic production of our endangered marginal wells on \nthe cutting edge of available technology.\n  Collectively, the provisions of this bill provide much-needed \nincentives to an industry that is vital to our national security. The \nsooner the administration and Congress acknowledge the critical \nimportance of the domestic oil and gas industry and stop burdening this \nindustry with high taxes and regulatory obstacles, the sooner we can \ntake the necessary actions to preserve and revitalize this important \nsector of our economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n    Summary of the Domestic Oil and Gas Production and Recovery Act\n\n\n Section 2. Election to expense geological and geophysical expenditures\n\n     Current law treatment\n       G costs are not deductible as ordinary and necessary \n     business expenses but are treated as capital expenditures \n     recovered through cost depletion over the life of the field. \n     G expenditures allocated to abandoned prospects are \n     deducted upon such abandonment.\n     Reasons for change\n       These costs are an important and integral part of \n     exploration and production for oil and natural gas. They \n     affect the ability of domestic producers to engage in the \n     exploration and development of our national petroleum \n     reserves. Thus, they are more in the nature of an ordinary \n     and necessary cost of doing business. These costs are similar \n     to research and development costs for other industries. For \n     those industries such costs are not only deductible but a tax \n     credit is available.\n       Crude oil imports are at an all-time high which makes the \n     U.S. vulnerable to sharp oil price increases or supply \n     disruptions. Domestic exploration and production must be \n     encouraged now to offset this potential threat to national \n     security and our economy. Allowing current deductibility of \n     G costs would increase capital available for domestic \n     exploration and production activity.\n       The technical ``infrastructure'' of the oil services \n     industry, which includes geologists and engineers, has been \n     moving into other industries due to reduced domestic \n     exploration and production. Stimulating exploration and \n     development activities would help rebuild the critical oil \n     services industry.\n       Encouraging the industry to use the best technology \n     available and to reduce its environmental footprint are \n     important public policy reasons to clarify that these \n     ordinary and necessary business expenses for the oil and gas \n     industry should be expensed.\n\n\nSection 3. Elimination of net income limitation on percentage depletion \n                            for oil and gas\n\n       The net income limitation severely restricts the ability of \n     independent producers to use percentage depletion. Depletion \n     is subject to many other limitations. First, it may only be \n     taken by independent producers and royalty owners and not \n     by integrated oil companies. Also, depletion may only be \n     claimed up to specific daily production levels (1,000 \n     barrels of oil or 6,000 mcf of natural gas). The depletion \n     allowance is further limited to 65% of taxable income.\n       The net income limitation requires percentage depletion to \n     be calculated on a property by property basis and disallows \n     percentage depletion to the extent it exceeds the net income \n     from a particular property. The current requirement creates a \n     nightmarish quagmire of record keeping, paperwork and \n     compliance for taxpayers and the IRS. The typical independent \n     producer can have numerous oil and gas properties, and many \n     of them can be marginal properties (with high operating costs \n     and low production yields). During periods of low prices, the \n     producer may not have net income from a particular property, \n     especially from these marginal properties. In this situation, \n     when domestic production is most susceptible to being plugged \n     and abandoned, the net income limitation discourages \n     producers from investing income from other oil and gas \n     properties to maintain marginal wells.\n\n\n proposal: eliminate the net income limitation on percentage depletion\n\n     Reasons for change\n       The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) \n     estimates there are more than 433,000 marginal wells in the \n     U.S. which produced more than 333 million barrels of oil in \n     1995. This represented more than 18% of all the oil produced \n     in the U.S. (excluding Alaska). The United States is the only \n     country with significant production from marginal wells. They \n     represent the ultimate in\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\n     conservation, since once wells are plugged and abandoned \n     access to the remaining resource is often lost forever. \n     Eliminating the net income limitation on percentage depletion \n     will encourage producers to keep marginally economic wells in \n     production and enhance optimum oil and natural gas resource \n     recovery. Relief would be focused to independent producers \n     and royalty owners.\n       Eliminating the net income limitation on percentage \n     depletion would simplify record keeping and reduce the \n     administrative and compliance burden for taxpayers and the \n     IRS.\n\n\n          section 4. election to expense delay rental payments\n\n       Delay rental payments are made by producers to an oil and \n     gas lessor prior to drilling or production. Unlike bonus \n     payments (made by the producer in consideration for the grant \n     of the lease) which generally is treated as an advance \n     royalty and thus capitalized, producers have historically \n     been allowed to elect to deduct delay rental payments \n     under Treasury Regulations 1.612-3(c). However, in \n     September, 1995, the IRS issued a technical advice (LTR \n     9602002) stating that such payments are preproduction \n     costs subject to capitalization under Section 263A of the \n     Internal Revenue Code. The legislative history of Section \n     263A is unclear and subject to varying interpretation.\n\n\n  Proposal: Clarify that delay rental payments are deductible, at the \n election of the taxpayer, as ordinary and necessary business expenses\n\n     Reasons for change\n       In passing the Section 263A uniform capitalization rules, \n     Congress broadly intended to only affect the ``unwarranted \n     deferral of taxes.'' Congress did not intend to grant the IRS \n     the authority to repeal the well-settled industry practice of \n     deducting ``delay rentals'' as ordinary and necessary \n     business expenses.\n       Treasury Reg. 1.612-3. states that, ``a delay rental is an \n     amount paid for the privilege of deferring development of the \n     property and which could have been avoided by abandonment of \n     the lease, or by commencement of development operations, or \n     by obtaining production.'' Such payments represent ordinary \n     and necessary business expenses, not an ``unwarranted \n     deferral of taxes.'' Given the clear disagreement over the \n     legislative history and the likelihood of costly and \n     unnecessary litigation to resolve the issue, clarification \n     would eliminate administrative and compliance burdens on \n     taxpayers and the IRS.\n\n\n                 section 5. extension of spudding rule\n\n       The Internal Revenue Code provides a ``spudding'' exception \n     to the ``economic performance rule'' in determining the year \n     in which deductions may be taken on certain oil and gas \n     investments. The economic performance rule will be satisfied, \n     in certain circumstances, when amounts are paid during the \n     preceding tax year so long as the well is spudded (the \n     initial boring of the hole) within 90 days of the beginning \n     of the following year.\n\n\n       proposal: extend the 90 day prepayment period to 180 days\n\n     Reasons for change\n       Harsh winter weather conditions in many states and \n     locations make the 90 day limitation for the commencement of \n     drilling impractical. Moreover, the current shortage of \n     skilled drilling rig personnel and the high utilization rate \n     of land-based drilling equipment, make it difficult, and in \n     some parts of the country impossible, to meet the 90-day \n     requirement. This personnel shortage has resulted from \n     skilled workers moving into other industries due to vastly \n     reduced domestic exploration and production activity over the \n     past few years.\n       Expanding the 90 day prepayment period to 180 days would \n     ease the industry's ability to attract capital.\n\n\nseciton 6. include hydro injection as a tertiary recovery method under \n                  the enhanced oil recovery tax credit\n\n       Marginal wells are our most endangered domestic energy \n     resource. By providing incentives for new methods for \n     enhanced recovery, we ensure domestic production of the \n     marginal wells remains on the cutting edge of available \n     technology.\n\n

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FAMILY VIOLENCE OPTION \n                   CLARIFYING AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Domestic violence is the leading cause of physical \n     injury to women. The Department of Justice estimates that \n     over 1,000,000 violent crimes against women are committed by \n     intimate partners annually.\n       (2) Domestic violence dramatically affects the victim's \n     ability to participate in the workforce. A University of \n     Minnesota survey reported that \\1/4\\ of battered women \n     surveyed had lost a job partly because of being abused and \n     that over \\1/2\\ of these women had been harassed by their \n     abuser at work.\n       (3) Domestic violence is often intensified as women seek to \n     gain economic independence through attending school or \n     training programs. Batterers have been reported to prevent \n     women from attending these programs or sabotage their efforts \n     at self-improvement.\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\n       (4) Nationwide surveys of service providers prepared by the \n     Taylor Institute of Chicago, Illinois, document, for the \n     first time, the interrelationship between domestic violence \n     and welfare by showing that from 34 percent to 65 percent of \n     AFDC recipients are current or past victims of domestic \n     violence.\n       (5) Over \\1/2\\ of the women surveyed stayed with their \n     batterers because they lacked the resources to support \n     themselves and their children. The surveys also found that \n     the availability of economic support is a critical factor in \n     poor women's ability to leave abusive situations that \n     threaten them and their children.\n       (6) The restructuring of the welfare programs may impact \n     the availability of the economic support and the safety net \n     necessary to enable poor women to flee abuse without risking \n     homelessness and starvation for their families.\n       (7) In recognition of this finding, the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate in considering the 1997 Resolution on \n     the budget of the United States unanimously adopted a sense \n     of the Congress amendment concerning domestic violence and \n     Federal assistance. Subsequently, Congress adopted the family \n     violence option amendment as part of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996.\n       (8) The family violence option gives States the flexibility \n     to grant temporary waivers from time limits and work \n     requirements for domestic violence victims who would suffer \n     extreme hardship from the application of these provisions. \n     These waivers were not intended to be included as part of the \n     permanent 20 percent hardship exemption.\n       (9) The Department of Health and Human Services has been \n     slow to issue regulations regarding this provision. As a \n     result, States are hesitant to fully implement the family \n     violence option fearing that it will interfere with the 20 \n     percent hardship exemption.\n       (10) Currently 15 States have opted to include the family \n     violence option in their welfare plans, and 13 other States \n     have included some type of domestic violence provisions in \n     their plans.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the provisions of this \n     Resolution assume that--\n       (1) States should not be subject to any numerical limits in \n     granting domestic violence good cause waivers under section \n     402(a)(7)(A)(iii) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     602(a)(7)(A)(iii)) to individuals receiving assistance, for \n     all requirements where compliance with such requirements \n     would make it more difficult for individuals receiving \n     assistance to escape domestic violence; and\n       (2) any individual who is granted a domestic violence good \n     cause waiver by a State shall not be included in the States' \n     20 percent hardship exemption under section 408(a)(7) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 608(a)(7)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 ALLARD (AND INHOFE) AMENDMENT NO. 292\n\n  Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the topic \nof North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] enlargement and U.S. \nsecurity. Now that there is agreement on the Founding Act on Mutual \nRelations, Cooperation and Security Between NATO and the Russian \nFederation, a significant obstacle to NATO enlargement has been \nremoved. I have said before and say again that NATO enlargement is good \nfor the United States, good for our NATO allies, good for the candidate \nstates, and good for Russia.\n  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is scheduled to announce at \nits July 8 and 9 summit meeting in Madrid, Spain, which candidate \nstates will be invited to engage in negotiations leading to accession \nof these states to the Washington Treaty by 1999. Each of the states \nthat have expressed interest in consideration for accession are \nparticipating states in the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe [OSCE].\n  As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nI have led the Commission through a series of hearings on NATO \nenlargement which we will complete with a final hearing next Tuesday. \nWe have invited official representatives of states to present their own \npositions to the Commission at these hearings to help meet the \nCommission's responsibility to the Congress and the American people to \noversee implementation of the Helsinki Accords and subsequent Helsinki \nprocess documents, with a particular emphasis on human rights and \nhumanitarian affairs. Congress and NATO have both recognized the \nsignificance of candidate states' compliance with OSCE principles in \nvarious official documents.\n  The Commission's approach to this series of hearings is focused on \nhow well these candidate states have implemented OSCE agreements and \ncomplied with OSCE principles. Commissioners ask questions relating to \nother areas of candidate states' policies and conduct that have been \nidentified as critical to acceptance into NATO, but we are not \ncompeting with the committees having legislative jurisdiction in these \nareas, who will examine those issues more thoroughly and with greater \nexpertise.\n  Let me make it very clear that I am a supporter of NATO enlargement. \nI think that, in principle, every candidate state should be included in \nNATO when they meet the standards for accession. I do not believe that \nNATO enlargement should end with the Madrid announcement of the states \ninvited to participate in accession negotiations.\n  I believe that it is very important that the United States, and our \nNATO allies, make very clear to those states\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\nnot invited to join in the first round that the door is not closed, \nthat the process has not ended, and that we and our allies encourage \nthem to press ahead to meet the standards so that they can join when \nthey are ready.\n  We must, with our allies, establish a clearly defined process for \nachieving membership. If we don't, we run the risk of cutting the legs \nout from under the reform movements just now taking control of some of \nthe Eastern European countries that have failed to reform their \npolitical, military, and economic systems fast enough to meet NATO \nmember country standards. These reform governments must be given a \nclear, strong signal that when they meet the standards, they will be \nallowed to join.\n  We must not create in Eastern Europe a gray zone between NATO and \nRussia where the old spheres of influence and balance of power politics \ncould give rise to lasting political instability, poverty, and \nisolation. While I have not yet seen the text of the new Founding Act, \naccording to news reports it does not create a group of second class \nNATO members whose security guarantees are diluted and undermined. NATO \nenlargement does not threaten Russia's security.\n  An Eastern Europe without NATO could become a black hole of unrest, \npoverty, ethnic conflict, and extremism of the worst kinds. This would \nlikely attract overt and covert Russian intervention in the affairs of \nthe states in this area, pulling Russia into rebuilding its military \nmachine and deploying it westward, and triggering United States and \nallied reaction. Neither the United States nor Russia want that to \nhappen.\n\n  An eastern Europe without NATO would threaten Russia's security by \npreventing Russia from changing its thinking about NATO and about \nEuropean political and economic relations, preventing constructive \nchanges in Russian policy, and delaying or blocking Russia's full \nintegration into the community of nations.\n  NATO enlargement is good for Russia. Russian agreement to the \nFounding Act signals that the Russian foreign policy elite recognizes \nthat fact. Now, Russian energies can focus on driving political and \neconomic reform to a successful conclusion instead of battling NATO \nenlargement. Russia should be pleased that one of its strategic flanks \nwill be secured by a strong, friendly defensive alliance.\n  Russia should take note that the political, economic, military, and \nforeign policy changes NATO is insisting upon in successful candidate \nstates will build stable, democratic, free market countries that will \nnot themselves engage in aggression against Russia and that will not \nallow themselves to become participants in some other state's \naggressive designs. Russia should want states with these \ncharacteristics on its borders.\n  The Russian foreign policy elites should climb up in the Kremlin's \ntowers and look hard at the situations on Russia's other borders. \nAgreement with the Final Act signals some understanding that it is not \nin Russia's best long term interests to keep eastern Europe unstable \nand economically backward. After Russia's experiences in Afghanistan \nand Chechnya, does Russia really think that any threat, much less the \nmain threat, to its independence and territorial integrity comes from \nNATO?\n  Russia's leaders have a question to which they need an answer--when \nRussia gets into trouble, who can Russia call upon for help? Recent \nreports of closer relations between Russia and China should not lead to \nthe conclusion that Russia has a friend or an ally in China.\n  The only nations Russia can count on for help are the nations with \nthe capacity to help. The only nations with that capacity are the \ndeveloped nations of the West, the most powerful of whom are NATO \nmembers, and Japan.\n  For that help to be available, Russia now needs to press ahead with \nthe same agenda of reforms that the NATO candidate states are \nimplementing. It would be far easier to convince the western republics \nthat Russia deserves help when it needs it if Russia is a democratic, \nrule-of-law state with a free market economy.\n  Reportedly under the new Founding Act, Russia does not have a veto \nover NATO enlargement and no state's candidacy is foreclosed. Russia \nneeds leaders who can discard cold war thinking and stop seeing NATO \nenlargement as a victory for the West and a defeat for Russia. Boris \nYeltsin is such a leader.\n  NATO enlargement is good for the United States, good for NATO's \ncurrent member states, good for the candidate states, and, finally, \ngood for Russia.\n  Wednesday's agreement on the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, \nCooperation and Security Between NATO and the Russian Federation \nbetween NATO Secretary General Solana and Russian Foreign Minister \nPrimakov proves that Russia's current leaders are not as opposed in \nfact as they sounded in rhetoric to NATO enlargement. The agreement \nreportedly was put before the North Atlantic Council, NATO's highest \nbody, earlier today, and was approved.\n  Among other things, it draws Russia into closer collaboration with \nNATO on matters of mutual concern. The new NATO-Russia Council will \ngive Russia insight into NATO processes and input into NATO \nconsideration of issues without allowing Russia to block measures the \nalliance agrees must be taken for our mutual security.\n  Perhaps the best part of this enlargement process is not the military \nsecurity guarantees that go with it to successful candidate states, but \nthe leverage that the enlargement process exerts for basic change in \neach candidate state that will result in better, safer, and more \nprosperous lives for each of their citizens. The impact of that \nleverage has been on view during the course of the Commission's hearing \nprocess, as ambassadors of candidate states discuss their progress in \nmeeting the standards for membership.\n  Even better, there may be the beginning of a halo effect on the \nsurrounding countries. As they see their neighbors moving into closer \nintegration with the West, they are becoming concerned about their own \nfutures. They can see NATO membership being followed by European Union \nmembership for these successful neighbors. They can see them pulling \nahead in the competition for foreign investment, trade, and market \naccess, growing in prosperity and stability behind NATO's shield. And \nthey understand that there is no alternate path that they can follow \nthat will get them to the same place any time soon.\n  Thus, even those states that are not now candidates for NATO \nmembership are influenced in the direction of political and economic \nreform by the process of NATO enlargement. This will have a very \npositive and long-lasting impact on Europe's political stability, \nprosperity, and freedom, and decrease the chances that the security \nguarantees we solemnly extend to new NATO members will ever have to be \ninvoked in crisis or in conflict. This, in the end, is a tremendous \nbenefit for the security of the United States.\n  I believe that we must be resolute in pursuing our aim of expanding \nNATO to encompass all candidate states that meet the standards for \nmembership. We must make it clear that the enlargement is a continuing \nprocess that will not end with the first group announced at Madrid, and \nthat NATO membership remains open to states as they improve conditions \nfor their people. In the end, this effort will move European security, \nprosperity, freedom, and human rights ahead more rapidly than any other \ncourse of action.\n  In closing, I want to briefly say something to those Americans who \ncan trace their roots to those countries now being considered for NATO \nmembership. Thanks in part to the hopes and beliefs that you would not \nlet die even when times were very bad, and to your hard work in the \nAmerican political system, these countries are free and independent \nagain, something the realists of 10 years ago would have said couldn't \nhappen, and would never happen. Keeping the faith, making sure that the \nUnited States never recognized the incorporation of the Baltic States \ninto the Soviet Union, making sure that we supported Solidarity, \nsustaining support for Charter 77, keeping the life lines open to the \nmany struggling Helsinki groups, making your voices heard here in \nWashington, those were key events that helped pave the way to where we \nare today. Thank you for your efforts and know that the futures of \nthese countries could have been much worse but for your active support \nfor their sovereign independence, and for freedom and human rights for \ntheir citizens.\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4763-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4763-S4765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   NATO ENLARGEMENT AND U.S. SECURITY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the topic \nof North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] enlargement and U.S. \nsecurity. Now that there is agreement on the Founding Act on Mutual \nRelations, Cooperation and Security Between NATO and the Russian \nFederation, a significant obstacle to NATO enlargement has been \nremoved. I have said before and say again that NATO enlargement is good \nfor the United States, good for our NATO allies, good for the candidate \nstates, and good for Russia.\n  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is scheduled to announce at \nits July 8 and 9 summit meeting in Madrid, Spain, which candidate \nstates will be invited to engage in negotiations leading to accession \nof these states to the Washington Treaty by 1999. Each of the states \nthat have expressed interest in consideration for accession are \nparticipating states in the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe [OSCE].\n  As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nI have led the Commission through a series of hearings on NATO \nenlargement which we will complete with a final hearing next Tuesday. \nWe have invited official representatives of states to present their own \npositions to the Commission at these hearings to help meet the \nCommission's responsibility to the Congress and the American people to \noversee implementation of the Helsinki Accords and subsequent Helsinki \nprocess documents, with a particular emphasis on human rights and \nhumanitarian affairs. Congress and NATO have both recognized the \nsignificance of candidate states' compliance with OSCE principles in \nvarious official documents.\n  The Commission's approach to this series of hearings is focused on \nhow well these candidate states have implemented OSCE agreements and \ncomplied with OSCE principles. Commissioners ask questions relating to \nother areas of candidate states' policies and conduct that have been \nidentified as critical to acceptance into NATO, but we are not \ncompeting with the committees having legislative jurisdiction in these \nareas, who will examine those issues more thoroughly and with greater \nexpertise.\n  Let me make it very clear that I am a supporter of NATO enlargement. \nI think that, in principle, every candidate state should be included in \nNATO when they meet the standards for accession. I do not believe that \nNATO enlargement should end with the Madrid announcement of the states \ninvited to participate in accession negotiations.\n  I believe that it is very important that the United States, and our \nNATO allies, make very clear to those states\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\nnot invited to join in the first round that the door is not closed, \nthat the process has not ended, and that we and our allies encourage \nthem to press ahead to meet the standards so that they can join when \nthey are ready.\n  We must, with our allies, establish a clearly defined process for \nachieving membership. If we don't, we run the risk of cutting the legs \nout from under the reform movements just now taking control of some of \nthe Eastern European countries that have failed to reform their \npolitical, military, and economic systems fast enough to meet NATO \nmember country standards. These reform governments must be given a \nclear, strong signal that when they meet the standards, they will be \nallowed to join.\n  We must not create in Eastern Europe a gray zone between NATO and \nRussia where the old spheres of influence and balance of power politics \ncould give rise to lasting political instability, poverty, and \nisolation. While I have not yet seen the text of the new Founding Act, \naccording to news reports it does not create a group of second class \nNATO members whose security guarantees are diluted and undermined. NATO \nenlargement does not threaten Russia's security.\n  An Eastern Europe without NATO could become a black hole of unrest, \npoverty, ethnic conflict, and extremism of the worst kinds. This would \nlikely attract overt and covert Russian intervention in the affairs of \nthe states in this area, pulling Russia into rebuilding its military \nmachine and deploying it westward, and triggering United States and \nallied reaction. Neither the United States nor Russia want that to \nhappen.\n\n  An eastern Europe without NATO would threaten Russia's security by \npreventing Russia from changing its thinking about NATO and about \nEuropean political and economic relations, preventing constructive \nchanges in Russian policy, and delaying or blocking Russia's full \nintegration into the community of nations.\n  NATO enlargement is good for Russia. Russian agreement to the \nFounding Act signals that the Russian foreign policy elite recognizes \nthat fact. Now, Russian energies can focus on driving political and \neconomic reform to a successful conclusion instead of battling NATO \nenlargement. Russia should be pleased that one of its strategic flanks \nwill be secured by a strong, friendly defensive alliance.\n  Russia should take note that the political, economic, military, and \nforeign policy changes NATO is insisting upon in successful candidate \nstates will build stable, democratic, free market countries that will \nnot themselves engage in aggression against Russia and that will not \nallow themselves to become participants in some other state's \naggressive designs. Russia should want states with these \ncharacteristics on its borders.\n  The Russian foreign policy elites should climb up in the Kremlin's \ntowers and look hard at the situations on Russia's other borders. \nAgreement with the Final Act signals some understanding that it is not \nin Russia's best long term interests to keep eastern Europe unstable \nand economically backward.

(Jim) Mellor, who retires next week from his position as chief \nexecutive officer and chairman of the board of General Dynamics Corp., \na position he has held for 3 years. Jim has been with General Dynamics \nfor a total of 16 years. Prior to becoming CEO and chairman, he was the \npresident and chief operating officer and before that, the executive \nvice president--Marine, Business Systems and Corporate Planning. Jim \nMellor is completing an illustrious 42 year career in the defense \nindustry having worked at Litton Industries and Hughes Aircraft Corp. \nbefore joining General Dynamics.\n  During his time with General Dynamics Jim took part in the delivery \nof 18 Trident ballistic missile submarines, the upgrade of the Army's \nM1 tank to the state-of-the-art M1A2, and the development and \ntransition into production of the Tomahawk cruise missile. The Trident \nsubmarine played a major role in bringing about the end of the cold \nwar, and we are all familiar with the important contributions made by \nthe M1 tank and the Tomahawk cruise missile in our overwhelming success \nin Desert Storm.\n  Jim is a graduate of the University of Michigan, earning both \nbachelor of science and master of science degrees from that \ninstitution. He served in the U.S. Army from 1952 to 1955. While at \nHughes & Litton he received three patents relating to large screen \ndisplay and digital computing technology. He has also authored more \nthan 30 articles in national and international publications covering a \nwide range of management and technical subjects.\n  In addition to these accomplishments, Jim has been active in many \ncharitable and community causes. He is a member of the University of \nSouthern California Business School Board of Councilors, a member of \nthe National Advisory Committee of the University of Michigan, and a \ntrustee of Ford's Theater. Under his leadership for the past 7 years, \nGeneral Dynamics has sponsored the annual Memorial Day Concert held \nright here on the Capitol Grounds. Jim has also been an active sponsor \nof and participant in the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's annual walk on \nthe Mall. Jim and his wife, Suzanne, will be moving to California to be \nnear their three children and nine grandchildren, but will maintain a \nresidence in the Washington area and will remain active in business and \ngovernmental issues.\n  Please join me in paying tribute to this distinguished engineer, \nbusiness leader, civic sponsor, and family man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4765-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF U.S. ARMY SPACE AND MISSILE \n                                DEFENSE\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to recognize the celebration of the 40th anniversary of U.S. \nArmy Space and Missile Defense.\n  During this week, May 19-22, 1997, a number of special events will be \ntaking place in Huntsville, AL, to celebrate this important \nanniversary. I wish to express my congratulations to the Army community \nin Huntsville for their splendid record of achievement in space and \nmissile defense, and to ask my colleagues to join me saluting them for \nwhat this has meant to our Nation's security.\n  The U.S. Army led the nation into space and ballistic missile defense \n[BMD] in 1957 with the authorization to proceed with the launch of an \nartificial satellite and the start of development of the Nike Zeus BMD \nsystem. The Army Ballistic Missile Agency successfully launched the \nfree world's first artificial satellite in 1958, only 89 days after \nreceiving the go-ahead, restoring America's leadership in space \nexploration following the Soviet Sputnik launch 3 months earlier.\n  The Huntsville BMD team performed the first demonstration of a \nsuccessful intercept of an ICBM class ballistic missile in 1962, \ndeployed the first and only BMD system in the United States, conducted \nthe first nonnuclear intercept of an ICBM in 1984, and carried out the \nfirst and the largest number of intercepts of tactical ballistic \nmissiles, including the spectacular performance of the Patriot system \nagainst Scud rockets during Desert Storm.\n  The U.S. Army role in space has continued to provide significant \ncontributions to battlefield communications, precise detection, \ntracking of threatening missiles, and a host of space-based \ncapabilities tailored for the war-fighter on the ground.\n  The Huntsville team has made significant contributions to BMD \ntechnology, including development of nuclear and nonnuclear \ninterceptors and kill vehicles; advanced BMD radar and optical sensors; \nthe first BMD computer, associated software and a long progression of \ninnovations in BMD computational capabilities; and lastly, a wide range \nof BMD phenomenology, components and techniques.\n  In view of their long record of outstanding achievements, the future \nof military space and BMD lies to a large extent in the hands of the \nmen and women who work in the Army organizations in Huntsville, \ntogether with their industry team mates.\n  Mr. President, I salute Huntsville and the hard-working men and women \nof that great community. Most importantly, I wish to extend a warm and \nhearty congratulations to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense team \nfor a job well done, and best wishes for its continued success now and \nduring the next 40 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4765-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4765-S4766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO EDWARD P. SCOTT, VA ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR CONGRESSIONAL \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with a mixture of \nhappiness and sadness that I pay tribute to Edward P. Scott, VA's \nAssistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs, as he retires from \nFederal service--happiness for Ed and his family as they embark on a \nnew phase of their lives, and sadness for those of us who will miss \nEd's wise counsel and assistance as we carry on our work on veterans \nissues.\n  Mr. President, Ed has had a long and distinguished career, including \n16 years here in the Senate where he served on the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee as general counsel, minority general counsel, and in the 102d \nCongress, as chief counsel and staff director. I first became familiar \nwith Ed's work when I joined the Veterans' Affairs Committee in 1985 \nwhen I first came to the Senate; I have recognized and relied on his \ngreat professionalism and integrity ever since. I particularly \nappreciated his assistance in 1993 when he worked tirelessly to ensure \nthat my transition to the chairmanship of the committee went as \nsmoothly as possible.\n  For the past 4 years, Ed has served ably in the often challenging job \nof Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. He is enormously knowledgeable about veterans' \nprograms and laws, and both the committee and the Department have \nrelied heavily on his expertise and keen insight. He has worked hard to \nkeep his various constituencies--most particularly, Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, Jesse Brown and the authorizing and appropriating \ncommittees of both the House and Senate--informed and working together. \nOn any number of occasions, Ed has kept the train on the tracks when it \nwas threatening to tumble off.\n  During these 4 years, Ed has played an important role in working with \nCongress to ensure passage of significant legislation to improve \nbenefits and services for the service men and women who have sacrificed \nso much for our great country. He was particularly instrumental in \nworking with the Congress last year to enact health care eligibility \nreform legislation, Public Law 104-262. Ed has also been in the middle \nof efforts to make sure that the Congress understood what the \nadministration was doing in response to the concerns of veterans of the \nPersian Gulf.\n  Ed's high standards--in doing the job and doing it right, in being a \nperson of unassailable integrity, and in working with all parties \nconcerned to find solutions that all could embrace--have inspired all \nwho have worked with him.\n  Mr. President, Ed's earlier career was equally distinguished. He \ngraduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania Law School \nwhere he was an editor of the law review. Following a clerkship with a \njustice of the New Jersey Supreme Court, he entered active duty in the \nAir Force and served\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\nas assistant staff judge advocate at Keesler Air Force Base, MS. He \nthen served with the Peace Corps, first in the Office of General \nCounsel, where he served as the deputy general counsel, and then as the \nPeace Corps country director in Korea. Ed also worked at the Mental \nHealth Law Project here in Washington, an experience that gave him \nsignificant expertise on mental health issues which he has brought to \nbear on any number of VA mental health matters.\n  Mr. President, I am certain that all in the Senate who have had the \nprivilege of knowing and working with Ed Scott join me in wishing him \nwell as he retires from a distinguished career of Government service. \nWe will be the poorer for his going, but the richer for his having \nworked among us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4765-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National \nEmergency Medical Services Week and the heroic and courageous work our \nemergency medical service providers perform everyday.\n  As an author of the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act, I have \nhad the opportunity to meet with many EMS providers both in Minnesota \nand Washington to hear firsthand the problems they face every day--and \ntheir suggestions on how those problems can be resolved. The meetings \nwere constructive, and we identified specific areas of concern and ways \nin which Congress can address them. I hope that the Emergency Medical \nServices Efficiency Act will serve as a blueprint for helping these \ndedicated public servants make the system more efficient.\n  Mr. President, emergency medical services have come a long way since \nthe 1860's when the first civilian ambulance service was begun in \nCincinnati and New York City. Now we have sophisticated medical \nequipment on ambulances around the country, and the American people \nhave come to rely on the readiness, efficiency, and quick response of \nthe EMS system. Yet many Americans--including Members of Congress--take \nthese crucial services for granted.\n  Mr. President, I have a great admiration and respect for those who \ndedicate their time and talents to the emergency care profession, \nwhether as a career or through volunteering. It's a field that offers a \ngreat many rewards. And yet along with those rewards often come great \nchallenges. EMS professionals are often thrust into dangerous \nsituations--situations that set their profession apart from most any \nother 9-to-5 job. It's a difficult, sometimes terrifying time to be \npart of the public health and safety professions.\n  I'm reminded of a frightening example of the terrors EMS \nprofessionals face that happened here in Washington just 5 months ago \nwhen a paramedic team was attacked by a gunman. Emergency workers were \ntransporting a shooting victim to the hospital when the gunman stormed \nthe ambulance, killing the victim and wounding one of the paramedics. \nThat followed another violent incident just a month earlier, when a man \nwho had been shot was stalked by his attacker to the hospital and was \nfatally wounded as he sought treatment.\n  Despite these risks, there are many thousands of Americans who serve \ntheir communities with determination and compassion as paramedics and \nemergency medical service personnel. Last night, they honored those who \nexemplify the best of their profession as ``Stars of Life.'' I was \nasked to speak to their group, but was unable to attend due to the \nBudget Committee's markup of the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution.

We cannot wait for a crisis to occur before we \nrespond to the needs of our emergency medical system.\n  It's ironic that we expect so much from our EMS providers and yet, \nwhen they seek assistance, we continue to ignore their 9-1-1 call for \nhelp. In recognizing and celebrating National EMS Week, we should all \ntake the time to congratulate the ``Stars of Life,'' and their \ncolleagues, who receive no special recognition and yet answer every \ncall, every day, because they have chosen to serve.\n  The names follow:\n\n                     Stars of Life Recipients 1997\n\n       Irene Acquisto, NY.\n       Mike (Dewey) Albritton, MS.\n       Josh Alger, MI.\n       Thomas Anderson, CT.\n       Jim Bard, OR.\n       Robert Barmore, KY.\n       Sue Beals, ME.\n       Trish Beckwith, NV.\n       Walter Bedward, NJ.\n       Jeffrey Blank, WA.\n       Charles Blattner, CA.\n       Andy Bowersox, IN.\n       Terry Bracy, AR.\n       Ken Bradford, CA.\n       Tim Braithwaite, SD.\n       Bernie Callahan, PA.\n       Marty Carlson, OR.\n       Bryan Clark, GA.\n       Mike Coburn, NV.\n       Keith Cooper, PA.\n       David Curran, RI.\n       Virginia Davis, CA.\n       Vito DePietro, PA.\n       Jeffrey DeVine, MA.\n       George Drum, AZ.\n       Dave Elle, OR.\n       David Ellis, MO.\n       Linda Emery, OH.\n       Clarence Ervin, MI.\n       Ramona Fincher, LA.\n       Wayne Gilbert, MA.\n       Tom Gottschalk, MI.\n       Dave Green, NY.\n       Robert Gregory, CT.\n       Julian Guerrero, TX.\n       Marlene Guillory, LA.\n       David Hahn, IL.\n       Paul Haynie, CA.\n       Margaret Heckmann, IL.\n       Leigh Hennig, NY.\n       Victor Hoffer, OR.\n       Lynda Hoffman, NY.\n       Gregory Hogan, MA.\n       Dennis Hogges, GA.\n       Sharon Houghton, MO.\n       Shane Husted, MI.\n       Christopher Imm, NY.\n       Brent James, NE.\n       Charles Jarmon, CT.\n       Wilson Jean, FL.\n       Leonard Joseph, NY.\n       Shelly Kaczynski, MI.\n       James Lanier, FL.\n       Tony Lee, MA.\n       Carl Lind, AZ.\n       Thomas Lindgren, MA.\n       William Lindsay, OK.\n       Alvin Lynn, VA.\n       Tonia Mack, MA.\n       Steve Madrid, AZ.\n       Quijuan Maloof, CA.\n       Michael Mangan, MD.\n       Kerry Mariano, PA.\n       Donald Marsh, MI.\n       Greg Martino, CO.\n       Vicky McClanahan, TN.\n       Ed (Hunter) McKeever, CO.\n       Chris Mixon, LA.\n       Edward Moser, NY.\n       Jim Neal, ME.\n       Rella Neal, ME.\n       Keith Overcash, NC.\n       Cheryl Pasquarella, MN.\n       Thinh Pham, LA.\n       Ron Piel, FL.\n       John Piombo, FL.\n       Maye Pittman, CA.\n       Suzanne Pluskett, CA.\n       Judy Rains, VA.\n       Richie Ray, TX.\n       John Rivas, FL.\n       Jodi Roberts, OK.\n       Stephen Roberts Jr., TN.\n       Earl Ruberts, NJ.\n       Todd Sadler, OH.\n       Orlando Segarra, FL.\n       Mia Shelton, NY.\n       Penny Shuler, GA.\n       Todd Sims, NC.\n       Randy Sizelove, IN.\n       Mary Sloan, GA.\n       Carroll Smeltzer, AR.\n       Brent (Michael) Smith, TX.\n       Robert L.

Mr. President, I was profoundly disturbed to learn \nthat the Palestinian Authority has adopted a policy that any \nPalestinian caught selling land to a Jew will receive the death \npenalty. Only days after the announcement, the New York Times reported \nthe brutal abduction and murder of Mr. Farid Bashiti, a 70-year-old\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\nPalestinian real estate dealer who had been interrogated 2 weeks before \nhis murder by the Palestinian police for allegedly selling land to Jews \nin and around Jerusalem.\n  Palestinian authorities have denied any involvement in Mr. Bashiti's \ndeath, and I understand an investigation is underway by Palestinian and \nIsraeli police. I do not seek to prejudge that. But it is noteworthy \nthat Palestinian officials have not condemned his death and have openly \ncalled Mr. Bashiti a traitor. I hope that his family is able to learn \nthe truth, and that those responsible are brought to justice. This was \na horrendous crime whatever the motive, and whoever was behind it \nshould be severely punished.\n  But apart from Mr. Bashiti's murder, the policy of imposing a death \nsentence for the sale of land is nothing short of barbaric. It cannot \nbe justified under any circumstances. I am very aware that Palestinians \nfervently disagree with the Israeli decision to proceed with the \nconstruction of Jewish housing in Har Homa. I disagree with that \ndecision as well. And I am disturbed by the reports that torture is \nused by Israeli police. But executing someone because he or she sold \nland to Jews is beyond comprehension.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken many times about the fragility of the \npeace process in the Middle East. I am very disappointed by any actions \nthat exacerbate the situation, when the focus should be on easing \ntensions and seeking common ground.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4766-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4767-S4770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT\n\n Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMr. Larry Doby, originally of Camden, SC, who was the first African-\nAmerican to play in the American League. Mr. Doby's contributions to \nbaseball and the American cultural conscience are of ineffable \nimportance. He exemplified grace under fire, showing tact, resilence, \nand dignity in the unforgiving arena of a segregated nation. In light \nof his personal qualities and his professional achievements, I ask that \nthe following editorial from the Chronicle Independent be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n\n                               Larry Doby\n\n       During this 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Major \n     League Baseball, Jackie Robinson has again become a household \n     name. Perhaps now more than ever, people--and not only \n     baseball fans --are stopping to consider the true impact that \n     Mr. Robinson had, not only as a baseball player but as a \n     social pioneer. For indeed, that's what he was--a pioneer. \n     When Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey broke the color \n     line by bringing Jackie Robinson up to the big leagues, he \n     knew Mr. Robinson would face abuse. He also knew that the \n     talented player had the character and the savoir faire to \n     handle the situation.\n       Somewhere lost in the shuffle has been Kershaw County's own \n     Larry Doby, who became the first black player in the American \n     League. Few people realize that Mr. Doby, who was born in \n     Camden and moved to New Jersey after the death of his father, \n     followed Mr. Robinson into the major leagues by only 11 \n     weeks. As in other phases of U.S. history, we usually \n     remember the first person to do something, but those who \n     follow shortly thereafter often get forgotten. That's been \n     the case with Mr. Doby.\n       He was, after all, an excellent baseball player and \n     athlete. He led the American League in home runs in 1952, and \n     during a 13-year career, most of them with the Cleveland \n     Indians, he batted .283 and made six consecutive American \n     League all-star teams. Five times in a seven-season span, he \n     drove in more than 100 runs. A player who posts those kinds \n     of statistics today receives millions of dollars a year, but \n     that wasn't the case back then. But Larry Doby was more than \n     a great baseball player; just as Mr. Robinson did, he blazed \n     a trail that made baseball at its highest level open to \n     everyone, not just white players. And in doing so, he \n     gracefully endured abuse that would be difficult to imagine \n     today.\n       It is only proper that Mr. Doby is finally receiving his \n     due for his accomplishments. This year's all-star game will \n     be dedicated to him, and the Indians will honor the 50th \n     anniversary of his debut before their July 5 game against \n     Kansas City. He is now special assistant to the president of \n     the American League.\n       Those who have reflected with Mr. Doby on his achievements, \n     including the sports editor of this newspaper, have been \n     impressed with his recall of the events of 50 years ago. Like \n     Jackie Robinson, he struggled through a difficult time to \n     open doors for all people.\n       Baseball fans--and yes, Americans who really don't give \n     much of a hoot for the national pastime--should pay tribute \n     to Jackie Robinson this year, a man whose courage and talent \n     have made him a household name. But at the same time, let \n     those of us in Kershaw County not forget one of our own: \n     Larry Doby, a true champion in every sense of the \n     word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4771-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4771-S4772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MASS TRANSIT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join with my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Arlen Specter, in supporting the \nMass Transit Amendments Act of 1997. This bill is a bipartisan effort \nto support investment in our Nation's mass transit systems and \nindustry. But more important, this bill will ensure that a critical \npart our Nation's transportation infrastructure--transit--will receive \nadequate investments into the 21st century. A healthy transit system \nwill go a long way toward reducing congestion and increasing mobility \neven when vehicle miles traveled is increasing.\n  Good public transit increases the efficiency of existing roadways, \nespecially in congested regions where many people live. Transit is \nessential to rural, suburban, and urban residents, it is a cost-\neffective solution to healthcare access, a key to successful welfare \nreform, and an environmentally sensible way to meet the commuting \nneeds. It is an increasingly important service for the elderly, for \npersons with disabilities, for students, and for those who cannot \nafford a car.\n  Mr. President, anybody who questions the necessity for transit \nservices only has to visit my home State of New Jersey. The most \ndensely populated State in the Nation, it also has the most vehicle \ndensity on its roads. Located between two heavily populated \nmetropolitan areas, New Jersey is known as the Corridor State. Over 60 \nbillion vehicle miles are traveled on New Jersey's roads annually. The \nability of trucks and cars to move freely on New Jersey's roads \ndirectly affects New Jersey's economy--congestion has dramatic effects \non the economy.\n  New Jersey is also a commuter State. Millions of New Jerseyans face \nserious commuter problems every day. In many areas in New Jersey, there \nis nowhere else to lay new roads. We simply cannot build ourselves out \nof congestion. That's why New Jersey is heavily reliant on mass \ntransit. The Midtown Direct, an Urban core project, was inaugurated 1 \nyear ago. Within weeks, the ridership doubled in its projections. \nTransit in New Jersey is well used and well supported.\n  Nationally, transit has also proven to reduce congestion, and transit \nsaves dollars. A 1996 report conducted by the Federal Transit \nAdministration found that the annual economic loss to U.S. business \ncaused by traffic congestion is $40 billion, and the additional annual \neconomic loss if all U.S. transit commuters drove instead would be $15 \nbillion.\n  It's also good for the environment. According to the FTA, transit use \nsaves 1.5 billion gallons of U.S. auto fuel consumption every year. \nTransit is energy efficient, and the less gasoline used, the less the \nUnited States is dependent on foreign oil.\n  Mr. President, Americans also see direct public health benefits from \ntransit use. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, up to \n110 million Americans breathe air that is unhealthful. The American \nLung Association estimates the national health care bill for air \npollution-related illness is $40 billion a year. Transportation sources \ncause 40-60 percent of pollution that produces ozone, and 70-80 percent \nof carbon monoxide emissions. Nearly one-third of carbon dioxide--the \nmost significant greenhouse gas--comes from transportation sources. The \nfastest growing source of carbon dioxide emissions is the \ntransportation sector.\n  Mr. President, transit produces real environmental benefits. On \naverage, riding transit instead of driving cuts hydrocarbon emissions \nthat produce smog by 90 percent and carbon monoxide by more than 75 \npercent. One person using mass transit for a year instead of driving to \nwork saves our environment 9 pounds of hydrocarbons, 62 pounds of \ncarbon monoxide and 5 pounds of nitrogen oxides.\n  It doesn't stop there. Over the past 30 years, the U.S. transit \nindustry and its riders have prevented the emission of 1.6 million tons \nof hydrocarbons, 10 million tons of carbon monoxide, and 275,000 tons \nof nitrogen oxides into the air; the importation of 20 billion gallons \nof gasoline; and the construction and maintenance of 20,000 lane-miles \nof freeways and arterial roads and 5 million parking spaces to meet \ndemands, saving at least $220 billion.\n  Transit is an important part of our Nation's transportation system, \nand we ought to ensure that it is afforded the same priority as other \nmodes of transportation.\n  Mr. President, this bill does just that. It increases the \nauthorization level for transit programs to provide $34.4 billion over \n5 years. It increases\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\ndiscretionary capital grants and formula capital grants. It preserves \noperating assistance within formula programs for all areas and it \ncontinues funding for transit planning and research. It also makes a \nnumber of technical changes in the program to ensure better flexibility \nand streamlining, allowing transit managers to administer the program \nmore effectively.\n  Mr. President, this bill does a few more things. It includes a \nprovision which shifts the 4.3 cents of gas taxes per gallon currently \nallocated to deficit reduction, into transportation trust funds. One-\nhalf cent of the 4.3 cents is allocated into a new intercity passenger \nrail trust fund to fund Amtrak capital expenses; the rest--the 3.8 \ncents--is divided along the traditional 80 percent/20 percent split of \nhighways/mass transit, respectively. Thus, 3.04 cents will go into the \nhighway account of the highway trust fund, and 0.76 cents will go into \nthe mass transit account of the highway trust fund. This is the fair, \nequitable way to divide any new trust fund revenue that would be \nallocated for transportation.\n  However, Mr. President, until a mechanism is provided to actually \npermit the expenditure of that additional funding, we will not see the \ninvestment we seek. Instead, the trust fund balances will only grow. As \nparty to the budget negotiations just completed, I know as well as any \nSenator how hard it will be to make the necessary investments as we \nmove to a balanced budget by 2002. However, I think it is important to \nlay out this principle and do our best to work toward it.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, the balanced budget agreement reached \nlast week will make it difficult to fund mass transit at the levels \nprovided in this bill. As ranking Democratic member of the Budget \nCommittee, I fought hard to ensure that we will be making an adequate \ninvestment within the context of the balanced budget agreement. I must \nsay, it will be difficult to fund transportation at the levels I \nsupport over the next few years. However, as ranking Democratic member \nof the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I will work to \nensure continued, adequate funding over these years.\n  Mr. President, the Mass Transit Act Amendments of 1997 represent what \nI believe, and what transit advocates believe, is necessary to provide \nfor transit's growing needs into the 21st century. As Congress \nconsiders funding for transportation, I look forward to discussing ways \nthat transit, and other modes of transportation, can benefit.\n  Mr. President, this bill also includes a Reverse Commute Pilot \nProgram which intends to assist individuals in both urban and rural \nareas receive employment and job training. This annual $250 million \ndiscretionary program reflects the growing needs of the work force, \nparticularly those in urban and rural areas who do not have access to \nsuburban jobs. A 1996 report conducted by the Eno Transportation \nFoundation, ``Commuting in America II,'' found that ``today, the \ndominant commuting flow pattern is suburban, with 50% of the Nation's \ncommuters living in the suburbs and over 41% of all jobs located there, \nup from 37% in 1980.'' Suburban areas are now the main destination of \nwork trips. The report also found that there was a substantial increase \nin reverse commuting--the central city-to-suburb commuting rose from a \n9-percent share of growth over the decade from 1970 to 1980, to 12 \npercent from 1980 to 1990.\n  Mr. President, reinvesting in our cities is important. However, if \njobs are in the suburbs, we should provide mechanisms for employers, \nlocal and State employment and transportation agencies to assist those \npotential employees to simply get to where the work is. For those of us \nwho are concerned about the effects of the Welfare Reform Act signed \ninto law last year, we need to do all we can to ensure that the \nunemployed can move from welfare to work quickly and easily. The \nReverse Commute Pilot Program makes sense.\n\n  Mr. President, we all know that the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act--ISTEA--will expire on September 30. That law was far-\nreaching and visionary. It recognized that good transportation policy \ndoes not mean simply pouring more concrete and asphalt. Instead, it \nfocused on moving goods and people--in a way that makes the most sense \nfor our Nation, our States, our communities, and our economy. Its very \ntitle acknowledged a simple, yet important, aspect of transportation \nwhich had been previously overlooked--intermodalism. During this year's \ndebate over reauthorization of ISTEA, it is imperative that we continue \nthis tradition of intermodalism. We must continue the strong \ninvestments in transit and the flexibility provided in the first ISTEA.\n  Mr. President, this bill continues that tradition. I support it and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in doing so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4771-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4772-S4773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President with the \n     request that he further transmit such copy to the United \n     Nations and relevant parties in Afghanistan.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \nfor Senate Concurrent Resolution 6--a resolution disapproving the \nalarming human rights conditions in Afghanistan and highlighting the \ndeleterious effects increased political strife has had on Afghan women \nand girls.\n  Intensification of armed hostilities and the proliferation of human \nrights abuses have characterized Afghanistan for too long. In both the \ncountryside and in urban areas nearly two decades of civil conflict and \nchaos have wreaked havoc and disaster on innocent Afghan civilians. \nAnd, unfortunately the likelihood of peace for Afghans seems to grow \ndimmer with each new political development.\n  After successfully ousting the Soviet military in 1992, foreign \nthreats to peace were almost immediately replaced by civil threats. \nRivalries among political and military Afghan intensified the civil \nturmoil. Regional conflicts reached a new level of severity in \nSeptember 1996, after the Taliban coalition seized the capital city of \nKabul.\n  Upon seizure of Kabul and approximately two-thirds of Afghanistan, \nthe Taliban imposed extreme restrictions on civilians including banning \nmusic and books, and specifically prohibiting women and girls from \nworking or attending school. Penalties for those who do not observe the \nTaliban's strict code of conduct have been extreme ranging from verbal \nabuse, street beatings, amputations, to death. Western journalists were \nquick to report the upsurge of human rights abuses, writing about the \nsummary justice used to punish Afghans, and the unusually brutal \nmethods by which the Taliban killed Mr. Najibullah the former \nPresident. Amnesty International and other non-governmental \norganizations reported on the severity of the human rights situation in \nAfghanistan and urged greater international attention. The United \nNations created a special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan to \nmonitor the situation more closely.\n  Among all the accounts of human rights abuses in Afghanistan what has \nbeen particularly disturbing to me is the treatment of women and girls. \nThough under the Taliban women are no longer treated as spoils of war, \nwomen and girls have been subjected to a series of extreme restrictions \nincluding the prohibition to work, attend school, or leave one's home \nduring the day. Without the ability to work, mothers, many widowed due \nto armed conflict, have no means to support their families. Without the \nability to leave their homes to buy food, clothing, attain medical \nattention, women are unable to care for themselves and their families. \nWithout education, girls are not being taught how to read or write--\nbasic skills necessary for adulthood. The conditions under which Afghan \nwomen and girls live is unacceptable, and I can think of no reasonable \njustification for such circumstances.\n  Taliban leaders have been quick to point out in their defense that \nother political and military factions have committed numerous other \nhuman rights abuses. The Taliban is right to point this out. And while \nit is true that, none of the political factions vying for power in \nAfghanistan have thus far demonstrated a commitment to uphold \ninternational standards of human rights or decency. This does not \ndiminish the gravity of those abuses committed by the Taliban, or the \nobligation of the international community to speak out against such \nabuses.\n  The need for peace in Afghanistan is clear, but it is equally clear \nthat peace\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nwill not be sustainable in an environment where human rights are \nroutinely violated and disregarded. Internationally recognized rights \nsuch as freedom from torture, freedom of expression, and equality \nbefore the law regardless of race, gender, religion, or beliefs have \nlong been absent in Afghanistan. Any ruling coalition, must know that \nthe international community, and the United States in particular, will \nnot turn a blind eye to a rights-abusive regime.\n  Though, we, in the United States, can not singlehandedly solve the \ncrisis in Afghanistan, for that is a process which must take place \ninternally, we can and should do something. As a first step I have \noffered this resolution--a sense of the Congress which emphasizes the \nplight of Afghan women and girls, expresses support for the United \nNations-led peace negotiations, and recommends that the administration \nre-evaluate United States policy toward Afghanistan.\n  I believe this resolution will send a strong message to the warring \nfactions in Afghanistan that the United States is deeply concerned \nabout the deteriorating human rights conditions. Further I hope this \nresolution will provide some hope to Afghan women and girls who \nsilently disagree with the Taliban's code of conduct.\n  As the United States strongly supports an end to the armed conflict, \nwe should emphasize that peace is not only defined by the absence of \narmed conflict but also the absence of human rights abuses. It has long \nbeen the experience of many other states that only with a rights-\nprotective regime can there be any lasting prospects for peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4773-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4775-S4776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 6, a resolution expressing concern over the \ncontinuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Afghanistan \nand calling on the United States and the international community to \nredouble efforts to bring peace to that war-torn land.\n  Indeed, with yesterday's announcement that the Taliban militia have \napparently seized power in the northwestern province of Faryab, it is \nespecially fitting that we consider this resolution today.\n  I am particularly concerned about the situation in Afghanistan \nbecause, with the seizure of power by the Taliban militia, it appears \nthat another tragic chapter in the story of the suppression of women's \nrights is being written. Worse still, this situation has unfolded with \nscant international attention, let alone condemnation.\n  Afghanistan has been embroiled in an almost constant state of war for \nclose to two decades.\n  From 1979 to 1989 the Mujahedeen fought and finally outlasted the \ninvading army of the Soviet Union. Then the Muslim warriors turned on \neach other. Since 1979 more than 1 million of Afghanistan's 16 million \ninhabitants have been killed, and millions more have become refugees. \nThe capitol city of Kabul has been obliterated by the factional \nfighting, with over 45,000 civilians killed, and almost every prominent \nbuilding damaged or destroyed.\n  In the last 2 years of the seemingly endless Afghan civil war the \nTaliban--who grew from a movement of former religious students and \nIslamic clerics along the Afghan-Pakistani border --have emerged as the \nstrongest of the five major factions. After beating back its rivals, \nthe Taliban movement now control more than two-thirds of Afghanistan, \nincluding Kabul, which they captured last September.\n  With the ascendency of the Taliban, Afghanistan is experiencing a new \nconflict: What some warriors call true Islam, others, including the \nU.N. General Assembly, say is an abuse of human rights.\n  Although the peculiar version of Islamic religious Sharia law \nespoused by the Taliban has fallen harshly on many in Afghanistan--in \nKandahar this past July a man and woman accused of adultery were stoned \nin public, men have been forced to grow beards, and Taliban militia \nmembers harass men in the streets if they do not rush to the mosques \nfor prayers--women, in particular, have come to feel the full brunt of \nthe new extremism.\n  Afghani women have been banned from work.\n  Women have been banished from school.\n  Reportedly, Taliban soldiers have been so threatening that some women \nhave not left their homes for months.\n  But there is nothing in Afghan tradition that can account for the \nTaliban phenomenon. The type of secret-police state that they are \nfostering and the widespread denial of women's basic human rights has \nlittle precedent in Afghan culture or history.\n  The new brand of extremism fostered by the Taliban and their gross \nviolations of women's basic human rights have pushed an already war-\ntorn and war-weary Afghanistan to the brink of disaster.\n  It is estimated, for example, that close to 500,000 to 800,000 war \nwidows have been forced out of their jobs and have no opportunity to \nearn money for food, clothing, or shelter for either themselves or \ntheir children.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 6, a resolution expressing concern over the \ncontinuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Afghanistan \nand calling on the United States and the international community to \nredouble efforts to bring peace to that war-torn land.\n  Indeed, with yesterday's announcement that the Taliban militia have \napparently seized power in the northwestern province of Faryab, it is \nespecially fitting that we consider this resolution today.\n  I am particularly concerned about the situation in Afghanistan \nbecause, with the seizure of power by the Taliban militia, it appears \nthat another tragic chapter in the story of the suppression of women's \nrights is being written. Worse still, this situation has unfolded with \nscant international attention, let alone condemnation.\n  Afghanistan has been embroiled in an almost constant state of war for \nclose to two decades.\n  From 1979 to 1989 the Mujahedeen fought and finally outlasted the \ninvading army of the Soviet Union. Then the Muslim warriors turned on \neach other. Since 1979 more than 1 million of Afghanistan's 16 million \ninhabitants have been killed, and millions more have become refugees. \nThe capitol city of Kabul has been obliterated by the factional \nfighting, with over 45,000 civilians killed, and almost every prominent \nbuilding damaged or destroyed.\n  In the last 2 years of the seemingly endless Afghan civil war the \nTaliban--who grew from a movement of former religious students and \nIslamic clerics along the Afghan-Pakistani border --have emerged as the \nstrongest of the five major factions. After beating back its rivals, \nthe Taliban movement now control more than two-thirds of Afghanistan, \nincluding Kabul, which they captured last September.\n  With the ascendency of the Taliban, Afghanistan is experiencing a new \nconflict: What some warriors call true Islam, others, including the \nU.N. General Assembly, say is an abuse of human rights.\n  Although the peculiar version of Islamic religious Sharia law \nespoused by the Taliban has fallen harshly on many in Afghanistan--in \nKandahar this past July a man and woman accused of adultery were stoned \nin public, men have been forced to grow beards, and Taliban militia \nmembers harass men in the streets if they do not rush to the mosques \nfor prayers--women, in particular, have come to feel the full brunt of \nthe new extremism.\n  Afghani women have been banned from work.\n  Women have been banished from school.\n  Reportedly, Taliban soldiers have been so threatening that some women \nhave not left their homes for months.\n  But there is nothing in Afghan tradition that can account for the \nTaliban phenomenon. The type of secret-police state that they are \nfostering and the widespread denial of women's basic human rights has \nlittle precedent in Afghan culture or history.\n  The new brand of extremism fostered by the Taliban and their gross \nviolations of women's basic human rights have pushed an already war-\ntorn and war-weary Afghanistan to the brink of disaster.\n  It is estimated, for example, that close to 500,000 to 800,000 war \nwidows have been forced out of their jobs and have no opportunity to \nearn money for food, clothing, or shelter for either themselves or \ntheir children. In Kabul's stark ruins hordes of children--12,000 \naccording to one estimate--paw each day through the shattered bricks \nand masonry in search of scrap metal that can be sold. And their \nmothers, many who previously worked in professional jobs, have been \nreduced to begging in the hopes of being able to feed their children.\n  The ban on women in the workplace has also compounded the already \nprecarious food situation. With the war having killed more than 9 \nmillion head of cattle and sheep and destroyed much of Afghanistan's \ncroplands, irrigation systems, and roads, the average Afghan has a \ncaloric intake equal to less than a pound of bread a day.

Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on the \nplan to pump up the Pentagon budget. This resolution jacks it up by \n$2.6 billion in budget authority.\n  Last year, by comparison, we were staring at a $10 to $12 billion \nincrease in the defense budget.\n  I was very much opposed to such a large increase and did everything I \ncould to block it all the way through the process. In the end, I \nfailed.\n  This year's proposed defense add-on of $2.6 billion is relatively \nmodest.\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to offer an amendment to kill the $2.6 \nbillion add-on.\n  I know defense is a top priority in the agreement and the defense \nnumber constitutes a carefully crafted consensus. Like last year, \nhowever, I still think we should stick with the President's request.\n  The $265 billion requested by the President for defense is plenty to \nmaintain a strong national defense--if the money is spent right. \nUnfortunately, that's not what happens. Some of it will be wasted.\n  The Pentagon is like a ravenous monster that has an insatiable \nappetite for money. I am afraid the $2.6 billion add-on will be \nfrittered away on cold war relics.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to give the Pentagon some strict \nguidance about how the extra money may be spent. The Budget Committee \ncould do it. The Armed Services Committee could do it. Or the \nAppropriations Committee could do it. Somebody needs to do it.\n  The language should stipulate that the extra money be used \nexclusively to maintain the force structure and combat readiness. \nOtherwise, the Pentagon bureaucrats are going to rob the readiness \naccounts to pay for modernization.\n  In recent years, DOD has consistently promised to pay for \nmodernization with savings derived from lower infrastructure costs. But \nthe promised savings have never materialized. So they rob the readiness \naccounts to get the money. We should not let that happen.\n  Mr. President, the highly touted Quadrennial Defense Review or QDR \nwill not solve this problem. The QDR is just a smoke screen for the \nstatus quo. It's another cover for robbing the readiness accounts to \npay for modernization. The QDR is simply a repeat of the Bottom-Up \nReview.\n  They douse the cold war programs with perfume to make them smell \nbetter, but it is still the same old stuff. We still have cold war \nprograms hooked up to a post-cold war budget. This is a recipe for \ndisaster.\n  The QDR tells us to keep spending money on all the cold war relics--\nlike the F-22 fighter. The F-22 is an excellent case in point. The F-22 \nwas designed to defeat a Soviet military threat that is now ancient \nhistory. And it's cost is spinnning out of control.\n  In 1991, we were told that we could buy 750 F-22's for $58 billion. \nNow we are told that far fewer F-22's will cost $6 billion more. The \nquantity drops by 40 percent and the price goes up by 10 percent. \nThat's the Pentagon way.\n  Four hundred thirty-eight F-22's are now estimated to cost $64 \nbillion total, and production hasn't even started yet. If current \ntrends continue, the Air Force will be lucky to get 200 F-22's for $100 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, I think the F-22 is the threat. The F-22 has the \npotential for ruining the Air Force. It will eat away at Air Force \nfighter muscle and will totally demolish plans to modernize the fighter \nforce.\n  With the F-22, the Air Force will be lucky to have 2 or 3 wings--\ntotal, versus its force of 20 wings today. During the Reagan years, we \nactually had 40 wings and planned for more.\n  Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine put this problem in perspective \nin his book ``The Defense Revolution.''\n  I would like to quote from his book. He is an authority. He should \nknow. This is what Mr. Augustine said:\n\n       If the cost of tactical aircraft continues to increase as \n     it has since the World War I Spad [airplane], a projection of \n     the history of the defense budget over the past century leads \n     to the calculation that in the year 2054 the entire U.S. \n     defense budget will purchase exactly one aircraft.\n\n  The F-22 is a prime candidate for fulfilling Mr. Augustine's \nprophecy.\n  Mr. President, we need to reverse this trend. We should make sure the \nextra money is used to maintain combat readiness. The extra money \nshould be used to buy more training, fuel, spare parts, and \nmaintenance. And that's it.\n  Mr. President, we need to take some drastic action. The centerpiece \nof Mr. Cohen's QDR is the plan to retain a capability to fight two \nmajor regional\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nconflicts or MRC's simultaneously. If we fail to protect readiness and \nforce structure, Mr. Cohen's two MRC's will be nothing but a pipe \ndream.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues on the defense committees will \nfind a way to strike a better balance between readiness and \nmodernization.\n  We must put well-trained, combat-ready troops ahead of obsolete \nprograms.\n  That is the real choice. It is the only choice.\n  Mr. President, when I look at this budget agreement, I find myself \nplaying Hamlet. I go back and forth, between all the good things, and \nall the bad things. And then I agonize over which way to go. To agree \nor not to agree. That is the question.\n  Usually when the leaders of the two parties get together on a budget \nagreement, it ends up being bad news. It means spending goes up for \nprograms favored by each side. It is like a rising tide lifting all \nboats. And then the deficit is made to look OK. A little fairy dust \nproduces a sudden windfall of revenues. This time it happens to be 225 \nbillion dollars' worth.\n  I think back to the Rose Garden Budget in 1984 under President \nReagan. And, the Andrews Air Force Base agreement in 1990. They were \nsimilar.\n  ``Rising Tide'' agreements do two things. First, all the sacred cows \nget more money than they should. Second, accountability for those \nprograms goes out the widow. Desperately needed reforms do not take \nplace.\n  In 1984, we should have frozen the defense budget and demanded \nreforms. Instead we looked the other way. The freeze did not occur \nuntil the next year--with my amendment--and the reforms did not take \nplace until 3 years later--with Nunn-Goldwater and the Packard \nCommission. By that time, we had already poured lots of money down a \nrathole.\n  In addition, with rising tide agreements, the budget enforcements we \nput in place are then violated. We saw that in 1990, when we gave \nGramm-Rudman a fix. The only thing we fixed in that budget was the \nability to overtax and overspend. Now, we're seeing another enforcement \nviolated to accommodate the rising tide--and that's Exon-Grassley. If \nwe violated budget enforcement before, why should we believe it won't \nhappen again?\n  Meanwhile, in this budget, the absence of Medicare reform is \ndeafening. A colossal structural nightmare is facing us just 15 years \ndown the road. Especially in Medicare. Long-term reform is needed. Does \nthis budget address that? No.\n  And the sacred cows? Two examples. One supported by my side of the \naisle, another by the other side.\n  The cold war is over. But we need to spend an extra $2.6 billion this \nyear for a defense budget that's still geared toward fighting the cold \nwar. The same cold war that disappeared 10 years ago.\n  What the Pentagon should not do--but will do with this money--is buy \na bunch of cold war relics, like the F-22 fighter. That money should be \ngoing into the readiness and training accounts. But it won't be. \nBecause politics is more powerful than commonsense.\n  The Quadrennial Defense Review is simply a repeat of the Bottom-Up \nReview. It's a smokescreen to maintain the status quo, to plan for an \nobsolete war. Meanwhile, this is the same defense budget with 50 \nbillion dollars' worth of unmatched disbursements, which cannot pass an \naudit, and whose financial records are in absolute chaos. We do not \nknow what anything costs. It is hard to make rational decisions on bad \ninformation. It is a budget crying out for reform.\n  But that is OK. Because the other side of the aisle also has a few \nsacred cows crying out for reform. But we'll pump those up, too. Take \nAmeriCorps. Cannot pass an audit. Cannot even be audited. No \naccountability. In bad need of reform. We were shelling out $27,000 per \nvolunteer. That is crazy.\n  So, last year we froze AmeriCorps and pushed for reforms. They have \nbeen promised, but not yet delivered. But this agreement would \njeopardize reform and accountability at AmeriCorps. Instead of a \nfreeze, plus reforms, this program will get an extra three-quarters of \na billion dollars, plus no incentive to implement the promised reforms. \nAnd that hurts the efforts of many of us who have tried to save this \nprogram, but make sure the taxpayers are getting their money's worth.\n  Finally, there is the matter of the deficits. Under this agreement, \nthey go up, and then they fall off the table. In other words, the only \nprogress on deficit reduction comes in the last 2 years. This reflects \nthat phenomenon I call the narcotic of optimism. We're still addicted \nto it. It is simply not realistic. But it sure feels good.\n  So that is a mountain of reasons why this agreement is bad. The \nreasons on the good side are not as impressive-sounding. But there are \na couple of reasons.\n  First, even though the tide is rising, it does not mean we cannot \npush even harder for reforms, to make sure they take hold. We \ndesperately need long-term Medicare reform. We have a responsibility to \nprovide it. We cannot duck it. If it takes a bipartisan commission \ninstead of a budget agreement, so be it.\n  But the most powerful reason, in my mind, in favor of this agreement, \nis that it is a bipartisan agreement of the leaders. When's the last \ntime we saw that in this town? This is a first step, and only a first \nstep. But it represents clearing a major, major hurdle--which was a \nlack of bipartisan cooperation. The importance of that accomplishment \ncannot be underestimated. And the desire of the American people to have \nus working together instead of fighting all the time also cannot be \nunderestimated.\n  And so that means, even though I have a mountain of reasons to oppose \nthis agreement, and even though the reasons for supporting it are the \nsize of a mouse by comparison, it is a mouse that roars for us to take \nthe first step.\n  And if we take that step, it means we are all the more obliged to \npursue reforms in the meantime, and make sure we stick to the \nenforcement measures.\n  And so, Mr. President, I think ultimately the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, and the other leaders on both sides of the \naisle are to be commended for taking a positive, yet very difficult \nfirst step toward addressing our fiscal problems. Even though I might \ndisagree with much of this agreement, I look forward to supporting it, \nand then appealing to my colleagues over the next 5 years to keep us on \ntrack for two things: a balanced budget, and much needed program \nreforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4777-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4778-S4779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS II\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, recently I spoke about the annual \ncertification process on drug cooperation. I wanted to follow up on \nthose remarks. As I noted then, I believe it is important to address \nsome of the myths that have grown up around certification. I also \nbelieve that it is important to put on record why we need to keep this \nprocess.\n  One of the reasons often advanced for doing away with the \ncertification process is that it just makes administrations lie.\n  Now, in the first place, I don't believe that this is true. But even \nif it were, I do not see changing a valid oversight requirement by \nCongress on the premise that compliance makes liars out of the \nadministration. It seems to me that if there is a law and the \nadministration isn't being honest, then you take steps to hold it \nresponsible. You don't shrug your shoulders and throw away the law. \nWhere would we be if we did that routinely? We might as well forget \nabout oversight. We might as well legalize lying.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have had problems with the executive \nbranch. I am aware of misconduct, misfeasance, and downright lying by \nexecutive branch agencies and agents.\n  But I do not believe that simple differences of opinion or \ninterpretation necessarily constitute lying. It is even possible to \ndisagree over policy without calling someone a liar for disagreeing. \nMisguided perhaps.\n  It is possible, then, that the administration and Congress might \ndisagree over a particular certification decision without jumping to \nconclusions about motive. It is also possible to have such differences \nwithout concluding that the only proper recourse is to scrap oversight \nefforts. Accountability is essential to our political process. This \nholds true even when there are serious disagreements about outcomes and \nprocedures.\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\n  The recent certification decisions on Mexico and Colombia are cases \nin point. This last March 1, the President decided to again decertify \nColombia. At the same time, he decided to fully certify Mexico. Both \ndecisions caused concern in Congress. It is important to understand \nthat there were lots of different concerns. Additionally, many of these \nconcerns arose from contradictory opinions.\n  Some felt that if Colombia was decertified Mexico should have been. \nOthers believed that if Mexico was certified then Colombia should have \nbeen. Still others believed that both should have gotten national \ninterest waivers. Because none of these views were vindicated in the \nactual decision, many have drawn the conclusion that certification \ndidn't work. Or they have concluded the administration lied. The answer \nin either case seems to be, ``dump certification.''\n  As I have already said, I don't think this is the right course. I \nbelieve the view is wrong on both substance and process.\n  In the first place, when we in Congress created the certification \nprocess, we did not create a pass/fail system. Nor did we create a \nsystem of shared outcomes. That is, we created a process that evaluated \neach country on its own merits in fighting drugs. Just like we don't \ngive everyone in school the same grade if they performed differently, \nwe don't base certification decisions on group behavior. We designed \nthe process to permit nuanced decisions. We recognized the need to draw \nconclusions based not on single issues or purely momentary situations.\n  At the same time, we realized that without the push of law the \nadministration, any administration, would likely not have made drugs a \nmajor foreign policy concern. In that sense, Congress had a healthy \nincredulity of administration motives. I remind my colleagues that it \nwas a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-controlled Senate \nthat first passed certification during the tenure of a Republican \nPresident. We had a bipartisan wariness of the executive branch. It is, \nafter all, the business of Congress to give administrations heck from \ntime to time.\n  Initially, the administration resisted certification. It chose not to \napply the standards in the law with any vigor. Indeed, the first \ncountries to get decertified were all soft targets. Countries like \nBurma, Iran, and Syria.\n  These were countries we already disliked and with whom we had only \nlimited dealings. Initially, no serious countries got decertified. \nBecause of this history, a certain cynicism grew up around \ncertification. There is also today an evident impatience with what is \nand must be a complex decision-making process.\n  That process has been around for 10 years. As with other cases, the \nlonger the requirement has been on the books and the more Congress has \ninsisted it be taken seriously, the more used and useful it has become. \nThe process has gathered momentum. Last year, in fact, I asked the \nCongressional Research Service to review the merits of the \ncertification process. That review, which is still available, makes \nclear how the certification process has matured and proved effective.\n  In the past several years, in fact, the list of countries decertified \nor given a national interest waiver has grown to include some real \ncountries. Such countries as Nigeria, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and \nPakistan. Countries with which we have a wide variety of interests \napart from drugs. Just a few years ago, no one in Congress believed \nthat any administration would ever decertify Colombia. Certainly there \nwas a lot of sentiment in Congress that believed the evidence justified \ndecertification. But the conviction was that it wouldn't happen. It \ndid.\n  Not only has the standard been applied with more rigor, it has also \nencouraged greater cooperation from certified countries. All in all, \nmore countries now take as a given that drug control must be an \nimportant element in their thinking.\n  That list includes the United States. To voluntarily choose to \nabandon such a tool out of a passing frustration is not very sound \npolicy.\n  But, as the list of affected countries has grown to include more \nsignificant U.S. partners, the more controversial certification has \nbecome. This was to be expected. When Burma squawked, few in this \ncountry cared. Few people cared internationally. The military rulers of \nBurma had few friends. With Colombia affected and Mexico implicated, \nhowever, the noise level has gone up considerably. Both here and \nabroad.\n  To me, this indicates that certification is working. As I noted in an \nearlier statement, the fact that countries such as Colombia are \ncomplaining about our process is no sufficient reason to change it, \nmuch less throw it overboard.\n  Conversely, the fact that there was a difference of opinion on \nwhether to certify Mexico or not, is also no sufficient reason to \nscuttle the boat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/20/senate-section/article/S4778-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
