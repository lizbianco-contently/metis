NEW TACTICAL FIGHTER AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to Congress a report containing the Secretary's \n     recommendation on which one of the three new tactical fighter \n     aircraft programs should be terminated if only two of such \n     programs were to be funded. The report shall also contain an \n     analysis of how the two remaining new tactical fighter \n     aircraft programs (not including the tactical fighter \n     aircraft program recommended for termination), together with \n     the current tactical aircraft assets of the Armed Forces, \n     will provide the Armed Forces with an effective, affordable \n     tactical fighter force structure that is capable of meeting \n     projected threats well into the twenty-first century.\n       (b) Covered Aircraft Programs.--The three new tactical \n     fighter aircraft programs referred to in subsection (a) are \n     as follows:\n       (1) The F/A-18 E/F aircraft program.\n       (2) The F-22 aircraft program.\n       (3) The Joint Strike Fighter aircraft program.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \ninstructing the Pentagon to recommend the cancellation of one of the \nthree aviation programs currently under development to modernize our \ntactical fighter force. Canceling one of these three programs would \nsave American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, and by all \naccounts still provide our Armed Forces with an effective yet \naffordable state-of-the-art tactical fighter fleet.\n  This amendment which I am offering on behalf of myself and the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, focuses on the Pentagon's current \nacquisition strategy for three new tactical fighter programs: The Air \nForce's F-22, the Navy's F/A-18E/F, and the multiservice joint strike \nfighter.\n  DOD is currently planning on purchasing some 4,400 new fighters from \nthese three programs at a total cost of at least $350 billion according \nto the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Numerous experts, including the CBO and the General Accounting Office \nhave concluded that given our current fiscal constraints and likely \nfuture spending parameters, the current acquisition strategy is just \nplain unrealistic and unwise and untenable.\n  The recently released Quadrennial Defense Review, a collaborative \neffort by the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nthe individual services to reassess our strategic blueprints for our \nArmed Forces, as well as to review our inventories and projected needs, \nhas recommended sharp reductions in two of these three jet fighter \nprograms already, the F/A-18E/F and the F-22.\n  The QDR proposed recommendations are a promising step in the right \ndirection. But the problem is that the QDR still clings to the \nassumption that somehow we can adequately control a program's cost by \nsimply scaling it back, just having fewer of each of the three kinds of \nplanes rather than taking the tough and more wise step of simply \nterminating one of them.\n  Mr. President, to understand just how serious this budget shortfall \nwill be, we have to take a look back for a minute and look at the \nentire defense procurement budget comprised of a number of weapons \nsystems and technology programs. But it is currently dominated by these \nthree separate fighter programs.\n  First, the Navy's F/A-18E/F program.\n  All though the current C/D model of this airplane performed \nextraordinarily well--very well in the gulf war--and has the capability \nof achieving most of the Navy's requirements with some retrofitting, \nthe Pentagon is currently still asking for 1,000 of these expensive E/F \nairplanes, with a cumulative program cost of about $89 billion, \naccording to the GAO.\n  The second program is the Air Force's F-22, a stealthy fighter \nintended to provide air superiority but at an extraordinary cost. This \naircraft, which one Navy official has referred to as gold-plated, will \ncost as much as $161 million per airplane making it the most expensive \nplane in our history. In all, the F-22 program, slated to provide 440 \nairplanes to the Air Force, will cost at least $70 billion.\n  The final one of the three fighters is truly still in its infancy. \nThe joint strike fighter, expected to provide common, affordable 21st \ncentury strike aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, is \nactually still on the drawing boards with two major contractors dueling \nfor what is expected to be at least--at least--Mr. President, a $219 \nbillion contract for close to 3,000 airplanes.\n  Although the amendment I am offering today focuses on tactical \nfighters, I think to put this in context we should mention a few of the \nother programs on the Defense Department's wish list.\n  We have focused on these because these programs will also have to \ndraw on a limited procurement budget over the next few years. And it \njust seems impossible that all of these programs can go forward without \nsome changes. In fact, it is likely that many of these nontactical \nfighter programs will receive reduced funding in the coming years as a \nresult of the drain on our limited procurement dollars, particularly \ndue to going forward with all three of these jet fighters.\n  These programs include the $47 billion V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft being \nbuilt primarily for the Marine Corps and Navy. There is the $25 billion \nComanche reconnaissance and attack helicopter program for the Army. \nThere is the Air Force's $18 billion request for 80 more C-17 cargo and \ntransport airplanes.\n  Mr. President, in addition to these new aviation programs, we must \nalso factor into account the costs of the necessary replacement of \nother aging aircraft, such as the KC-135 refueller, the C-5A, the F-\n117, and the Navy's EA-6B aircraft. These are all important air assets \nthat must be replaced in the next few years, Mr. President.\n  That, Mr. President, is just the portion of the procurement budget \nrelated to aviation spending. The Navy, for example, is looking to \nincrease the procurement of their surface ships, starting with another \naircraft carrier, CVN-77, and 17 of the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke \ndestroyers, as well as four new attack submarines.\n  In fiscal year 1999, the Navy would like to begin procurement of the \nnew San Antonio-class amphibious landing ships for our Marine \nexpeditionary forces.\n  Unless, Mr. President, we take immediate action to avert this train \nwreck, with respect to tactical fighter spending, there simply will not \nbe enough procurement dollars to fund all of these additional aviation \nand shipping programs.\n\n[[Page S7229]]\n\n  And a number of experts, Mr. President, in recent months, experts on \nmilitary spending, have tried to warn the Department of Defense of this \nimpending fiscal disaster.\n  CBO, GAO, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle--even high-\nranking Pentagon officials--have all forewarned the Defense Department \nthat they will not receive the procurement funding level it has \nprojected and will not be able to sustain these tactical fighter \npurchases at their planned acquisition levels.\n  Here, for example, is what the GAO says:\n\n       DOD's aircraft investment strategy is a business as usual \n     approach that is wasteful--adding billions of dollars to \n     defense acquisition costs and delaying delivery of weapon \n     systems to the operational forces.\n\n  GAO goes on to say:\n\n       We found the DOD's aircraft procurement plans will reach \n     unsustainable levels of the procurement budget if the \n     procurement and the total DOD budgets do not increase.\n       The aircraft procurement plans, if implemented as planned, \n     will require drastic reprioritization of the procurement \n     budget that will require significantly reducing the amount \n     spent on other types of procurement (ships, tracked and \n     wheeled vehicles, missiles, etc.)\n\n  Mr. President, I understand that many of my colleagues are either \nstrong proponents or opponents of one or more of these individual \nfighter programs. That is why, Mr. President, my amendment is careful \nnot to target any one specific program for termination. The language in \nthis amendment merely states the obvious, that the Pentagon's \nprocurement budget over the next several years will not be able to \nsupport three costly tactical fighter programs and that the Pentagon \nmust start the process of making the tough decisions.\n  Let me read exactly what my amendment does. It says:\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a \n     report containing the Secretary's recommendation on which one \n     of the three new tactical fighter programs should be \n     terminated if only two of such programs were to be funded.\n       The report shall also contain an analysis of how the two \n     remaining new tactical fighter programs (not including the \n     tactical fighter aircraft program recommended for \n     termination), together with the current tactical aircraft \n     assets of the Armed Forces, will provide the Armed Forces \n     with an effective, affordable, tactical fighter force \n     structure that is capable of meeting projected threats well \n     into the 21st century.\n\n  That's it, Mr. President. My amendment merely requires the Pentagon \nto send us a report within 60 days with a recommendation for canceling \none of these programs. It also requires the Pentagon to provide an \nanalysis of how our current tactical fighter assets, including the F-\n15, the F-117, the F/A-18C/D and others might be utilized to continue \nto provide us with air superiority should one of the costly programs be \ncanceled.\n  My amendment does not single out any one program. That is the \nPentagon's responsibility. It does not cancel funding for one single \nfighter aircraft. It merely calls for a recommendation. Once that \nrecommendation is made, it will be up to Congress to determine if we \nare going to follow through on that recommendation. It does not lock in \nthe Congress.\n  That is what my amendment is about, Mr. President, making some tough \ndecisions. We must have an acquisition strategy for tactical aviation \nthat is affordable and tenable and consistent with the goal of Congress \nto achieve a Federal balanced budget in the coming years. My amendment \nis an attempt to force the Defense Department to understand the gravity \nof this situation. I hope we can get back to the path of fiscal \nresponsibility in this area, as well, as we have sought so hard to do \nin so many other areas.\n  I reserve the balance of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wonder if I could inquire of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin if he has any additional speakers?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, not that I know of.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COATS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 9 minutes and \n52 seconds.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me yield myself 4 minutes, and then \nadvise me when that 4 minutes is up.\n  First of all, I want to tell the Senator from Wisconsin that those of \nus on the Armed Services Committee understand and, in fact, have raised \nmany of the same questions that he has raised. These are legitimate \nquestions to raise in terms of where we are going with our tactical air \nfor the future, what the cost is going to be, what the need is, \nassessment and so forth. In fact, as chairman of the Airland Forces \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, we held two hearings \nwherein we brought experts from the Department of Defense and outside \nthe Department of Defense to come in and answer some of the very \nquestions--in fact, all of the very questions--that the Senator from \nWisconsin proposes here this morning.\n  Because we share that concern, we know that unless we can \nintelligently decide on how we budget for the future, if we concentrate \ntoo much effort in the tactical air modernization category, we will be \nshorting other categories, because it looks like we are going to, for \nsome time in the future, have a pretty fixed cost in terms of what we \nare spending for defense.\n  Many of the questions that were asked by the Senator from Wisconsin \nwere posited to those who came before our committee, and we have had \npersonal discussions with the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the \nAir Force, Secretary of the Navy, and others on this very question.\n  As the Senator stated, the Department has just concluded a major \nstudy called the Quadrennial Defense Review, and as a result of that, \nthe Secretary of Defense, former Senator Cohen, now Secretary Cohen, \nrecommended very significant changes to the tactical air. He called for \na significant reduction in the amount of F-22 buys, from 448 planes to \n339. Even more, for the F-18E/F, from 1,000 to 548--about a 50 percent \nreduction, and then a significant reduction and decrease of the joint \nstrike fighter.\n\n  Now, in addition to that, the Secretary acknowledged that a process \nthat was initiated by Senator Lieberman and myself, with the support of \nSenator McCain and then-Senator Cohen and others, acknowledged that we \nare waiting for the review of the National Defense Panel, which is an \noutside group of experts which will give us a separate assessment from \nthe Department of Defense in terms of this question and a number of \nother questions. It is a look into the future in terms of what we need, \nall throughout our defense posture and structure, but particularly in \nrelationship to our tactical air needs.\n  This report for the National Defense Panel will be forthcoming around \nDecember 15, and the committee awaits that with great anticipation. We \nare working hand in hand with the Secretary of Defense, with the \nDepartment of Defense, the Joint Chiefs, with the National Defense \nPanel, through the committee efforts, to try to address the very \nquestions that the Senator from Wisconsin raised.\n  The reason why we object to this particular amendment at this \nparticular time is that if we do a short-term study on the termination, \nrecommending the termination of one of three programs, we place any one \nof those three in jeopardy. It may be that the National Defense Panel, \nthe Secretary of Defense, the future analysis will conclude a different \nkind of a mix or moving forward with a different balance in order to \nachieve the cost savings.\n  If we go forward and precipitously cancel one of those programs, we \nput one of our services in great jeopardy. If we cancel F-22 on a \nshort-term analysis, we leave the Air Force naked in terms of providing \nfor tactical air defenses for the future. If we cancel F/A-18E/F, we \nleave the Navy--who made a decision not to go forward immediately--we \nleave them, as we are retiring F-14's, without carrier capability with \nthe F/A-18E/F. If we cancel joint strike fighters, we leave the Marine \nCorps totally without resources for the future because they are betting \ntheir whole future on JSF's.\n  It would be an egregious mistake at this time to, within a 60-day \nperiod of time, require the Secretary to do something that they have \nspent months and months and months of analysis on, then requiring \nadditional months of analysis to come up with that conclusion.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend from \nIndiana.\n  I rise to express my opposition to the Feingold amendment. I \nunderstand, as the Senator from Indiana does, the need to deal with the \nfiscal problems the Department of Defense will face in coming years. We \nare all very much aware of those, and we know that choices have to be \nmade. We know we have to operate within a budget.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense has just completed its \nQuadrennial Defense Review. Not all of us like what the QDR had to say, \nbut it was a strategy-based plan and decision for the future. This fall \nand early this winter, as the Senator from Indiana has just pointed \nout, the National Defense Panel will come out with another review of \nthe Department's future. Just how many strategic essays does the \nsponsor of this amendment want? We can run around and order more \nstudies conducted. Somehow, conducting studies makes thin soup. We can \ncontinue to put more of a paperwork burden on the Department of \nDefense, but that does not change the need for us to stay within the \nbudget that has already been adopted by this Congress, to put us on a \npath to balance the budget by the year 2002, or sooner, I hope. We know \nthose numbers. We know the maximum we can allot, and another study does \nnot change the obligation of Congress to make tough choices based on \nwhat the Department of Defense has told us.\n  The Armed Services Committee has held hearings. They have asked these \nquestions. I say for my friends that the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee has also held hearings. We have also gone over all of \nthese items and asked these questions. The sponsor and other Members \nare interested in where we stand and what the best thinking of the \nDepartment of Defense is today. I invite them to review the testimony \nthat has been presented at those hearings and also to review the \nrecommendations of the National Defense Panel.\n  Technology moves on. We need to provide our military personnel with \nthe finest equipment available in the present, as well as in the short- \nand long-term future. Technology is not cheap. But it does save lives. \nIt protects our freedom; it protects our national security and \ninternational peace. These goals are worthy objectives. It is worth the \ncost. If some in this body do not believe it is worth the cost, I \nstrongly disagree with them, and I will fight them on that.\n  We are currently in the process of procuring the Navy's No. 1 \npriority. It happens to be tactical aircraft for its carrier fleet. \nThis is a fleet which the Armed Services Committee, and I predict the \nfull Senate, will shortly show its support by advancing $345 million in \nthis bill in order to bring the ship online and to do it faster and \ncheaper. This is a commitment to naval aviation. We need the carriers \nand the airplanes on the deck. Enough strategic studies. Let's get on \nwith the program.\n\n  I appreciate the time. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me again remind the body that this \ndoes not require the termination of any one of the three jet fighters. \nIt asks for a recommendation from the Department of Defense within 60 \ndays as to which of the three should be terminated, if that became \nfiscally necessary.\n  Second, it is simply not the view of everyone who knows a lot about \nthis subject that this would jeopardize our national security or the \ndefense capability of our Armed Forces. Take a look at the GAO reports, \nthe CBO reports, the analysis of a number of military experts--that is \njust not the case. I hope the folks who have urged me to look at the \nhearing testimony which I and my staff have looked at with regard to \nthe merits of these airplanes, would give the same kind of attention to \nthe analysis, fiscal analysis and other analysis of others who we often \nrely on to give us advice about the effectiveness and cost efficiency \nof various programs, including the GAO and the CBO, as well as military \nexperts.\n  Look, I don't think anyone thinks these are not good planes. These \nare great planes that are being proposed. I went down and spent part of \na morning seeing the wonderful E/F planes, but what we see here is a \ncredit card mentality that somehow we can just have it all. There is no \nreal plan here to make sure that we don't end up trying to have all of \nthese things and, as a result, not end up being able to truly pay for \nthe ones we most need.\n  One of the arguments that came out of the QDR that was cited by the \nSenator from Indiana is that there are ideas about bringing down the \ncost of each of these by reducing the number of E/F's, reducing the \nnumber of F-22's, and reducing the number of joint strike fighters. It \nis suggested significant savings can be achieved by reducing the size \nand scope of the fighter programs. I certainly do not question the \nmotives of those who say that. But the idea we can maintain all three \nof these fighter programs is simply inconsistent with balancing the \nFederal budgets.\n  Two months ago, the Senate Armed Services Committee received \ntestimony from CBO with respect to proposals to merely reduce, as has \nbeen suggested by QDR, rather than cancel these tactical fighter \nprograms. In that testimony, CBO explained how the Air Force had \nproposed last year to buy 124 F-22's over the 1998 to 2003 period. This \nyear, the Air Force has revised that estimate and proposed purchasing \njust 70 F-22's during the 5-year period. That is a reduction in terms \nof numbers of over 40 percent of the number of airplanes. But despite \nbuying 54 fewer airplanes and reducing the buy by over 40 percent, CBO \nnoted this, and I think it is very significant, that the funding level \nfor this buy remained almost the same, at about $20.4 billion now \ncompared with $21.5 billion in last year's estimate. Why? Unit cost. If \nyou don't build more airplanes up to a high level, then you don't get \nthe benefit of the reduced cost. You end up paying almost the same for \nmuch fewer airplanes.\n\n  CBO pointed out that is a savings of about $1.1 billion, despite \nbuying 54 fewer planes. In other words, we reduced the F-22 buy by over \n42 fewer airplanes, but saved only about 5 percent of the funding.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the Pentagon's track record and the \ncountless aviation programs that have promised so much in terms of cost \nsavings and have delivered so little in terms of cost savings. In fact, \nthe GAO estimates that the Pentagon's projections with respect to \naircraft procurement typically have cost overruns of 20 to 40 percent.\n  Clearly, that is not enough--and this may even exacerbate our budget \nproblems--to simply propose reducing any one of these three planes \nwithout eliminating one.\n  Time and time again, the Pentagon has promised an aviation program, \npromising large quantities of new aircraft at a given price, only to \ncontinually scale back the size of such program until we are receiving \nsmall quantities of aircraft but paying huge sums of money for those.\n  The B-2 is a tremendous example. In 1986, the Reagan administration \ntold us we were going to get 132 B-2's at a cost of $441 million per \nairplane. In 1990, the Bush administration revised this number and \nsaid, let's only have 75 B-2's, but at a cost of $864 million per \nairplane.\n  Of course, by late 1996, we were on track to buy 20 B-2's at a cost \nof roughly $2.3 billion per copy. This isn't saving money. Over the \ncourse of a decade, Mr. President, we received less than one-sixth of \nthe number of airplanes originally proposed, and we paid more than five \ntimes the original price quoted per airplane.\n  Of the three tactical fighter programs identified in my amendment, \nthe two programs currently under production, the F-22 and E/F, have \nalready experienced this sort of program instability. In 1986, the Air \nForce originally proposed we buy 750 F-22's. That number was reduced to \n648 in 1991, 440 in 1996, and now, in 1997, the QDR proposes purchasing \njust 339 of these aircraft.\n  Likewise, the Pentagon claims that the Navy and Marine Corps \noriginally intended to purchase 1,300 Super Hornets. In 1992, with the \nMarine Corps dropout, this figure went to 1,000, and now the QDR is \nrecommending this number be dropped to as low as 548 of these \nairplanes.\n  Again, we are buying fewer and fewer of these airplanes and we are \npaying more and more for them. That is precisely, Mr. President, why \nmerely reducing the quantities of the tactical fighters, just reducing \nthe numbers, will not avert the fiscal train wreck\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\nthat is certain to occur if we continue to fund all three of these \nprograms.\n  That is why GAO has called this ``business as usual,'' and that is \nwhat it is. It completely shirks responsibility for how we are possibly \ngoing to afford all three of these programs 5 years from now.\n  I hope my colleagues will not follow this road to fiscal \nirresponsibility and instead will support my amendment that simply \nsays: Have the Pentagon tell us, within 60 days, which of these planes \nyou can most do without, how they would go forward without one of these \nplanes, and give us guidance on this so we can make the best decision \nhere. Mr. President, we cannot afford these three fighters, and we have \nto make a decision at some point in the future about it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I inquire how much time remains on each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 3 minutes 4 \nseconds. The Senator from Indiana has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask the Senator from Wisconsin if he has any additional \nspeakers. If so, we can let them go ahead and we can both wrap up.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have no additional speakers.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, my understanding is that we have 2 minutes \nleft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me try to wrap up quickly in 2 minutes \nhere for those Senators who are listening.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin says that essentially makes the argument \nthat a decision has to be made now regarding the future of tactical air \npurchases that will provide air defense security for the United States \nfor 15 to 20 years in the future. He said we need a recommendation. He \nsaid we need a recommendation now as to what that decision ought to be. \nHe says we are trying to have it all.\n  Those arguments are based on the situation as it existed before the \nQuadrennial Defense Review. The QDR was reported and the Secretary of \nDefense, former Senator Cohen, certified that changes needed to be made \nalong the lines of what the Senator was stating, except instead of \nsaying ``cancel one,'' the Secretary said we need to dramatically \nreduce the amount. The threat isn't such that we need the same amount \nas we formerly had. That is going to save a very significant amount of \nmoney. But a balanced approach allows us to address the needs of Marine \ntactical air, Navy tactical air and Air Force tactical air.\n  If you go forward and cancel one of those, one of those services is \ngoing to be left naked, without adequate tactical air. So the balanced \napproach that dramatically reduces the number of F-18's, the number of \nF-22's, and the joint strike fighter number, is the approach they want \nto take.\n  Second, the final decision hasn't been made. The QDR report is 4 \nyears. The panel will look out into the future and give us more \ninformation on that decision. Secretary Cohen has only been there 6 \nmonths; give him time to work the process. We are aware of this \nproblem. As chairman of the Air-Land Committee, we have held hearings. \nWe deny that we have put severe cost caps on the F-22. So we have \nalready taken that action.\n  So I urge our Members to support the efforts of the committee in \nrecognizing the problem and going forward and addressing it, but not in \nthe draconian way the Senator from Wisconsin advocated.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am just a little puzzled as to how the \nterm ``draconian'' can be applied to my amendment. What does my \namendment actually call for? The Defense Department, on this issue--or \nat least the advocates--seem so nervous about talking about this \nproblem that we can't afford these three airplanes that they are \nreferring to an amendment as ``draconian,'' which only asks the Defense \nDepartment to give us their opinion, tell us what they think. If you \nhad to give up one of these three airplanes, which one would it be and \nhow would you proceed?\n  I would understand if this was a ridiculous question and why ask it \nof them. But it isn't. The GAO has said that the E/F is a good \nairplane, but it is not that much better than the C/D, and it is going \nto cost $17 billion more. There are others who are really questioning \nwhether this is a good idea. How can it possibly be termed \n``draconian'' to simply ask the Defense Department to give us their \nopinion? It doesn't require a decision.\n  If the crisis that the Senator from Indiana and I both agree may be \ncoming has to be dealt with later, this is the kind of information that \nwould be useful for us to have. We are not required to act on it. The \nDefense Department is not required to change their mind. How can this \nbe described as draconian? What troubles me about that characterization \nis, what are we afraid of here as Members of Congress? Openly \ndiscussing the fact that there are some questions about whether we can \nafford this and whether we really need all three of these planes?\n  This is really a business-as-usual attitude. The Defense Department \nwill be better off and this country will be better off if it starts to \njoin in the fiscal responsibility that all of us have been calling for. \nSo I am very concerned that the Members of the Senate, who will vote on \nthis soon, know that all this does is ask for a report within 60 days. \nIt is asking for an advisory opinion from the Defense Department: If we \nhad to cut one of these three planes, which one would it be? What \npossible harm would that be? I ask my colleagues to support this and \nhelp us solve what we all agree is an impending problem with regard to \nfiscal spending. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Has all time expired except for that 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 799, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now recurs on amendment No. 799. \nThere are 15 minutes for debate, evenly divided.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. My hope is that we will \napprove this amendment and save the $118 million that has been added to \nthis bill for something called the space-based laser program. In \nsupporting the Senator from New Mexico, I want to point out to my \ncolleagues that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization has reported \nto the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, ``There is no validated \nmilitary requirement for space-based laser.''\n  I will read that again because I think it is critically important. \nThe Ballistic Missile Defense Organization has reported to the \nappropriations subcommittee, ``There is no validated military \nrequirement for space-based laser.''\n  Yet, $118 million is added to this authorization bill for the space-\nbased laser program. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office \nreported that the cost of deploying 20 space-based lasers, starting in \nthe year 2006, would be $24.6 billion. According to Defense Week, \nhowever, the Pentagon's Program Analysis and Evaluation Office \nestimates the cost of the space-based laser at closer to $45 billion. \nNeither estimate includes the annual cost of replacing the space-based \nlaser satellites. The Congressional Budget Office pegged those expenses \nat $1.6 billion per year.\n  The question is, do we need it and can we afford it? That is a \nquestion we ought to ask about almost everything, I suppose. Do we need \nit and can we afford it? In answer to the first question--do we need it \nat this point?--it seems to me that the answer is no.\n  The experts themselves tell us we don't need it, and the adding of \n$118 million continues the incessant desire by the Congress, over many, \nmany years, to throw money at this program. And $100 billion has been \nspent on national missile defense in over four decades. The question \nis, what have we\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\ngotten for the $100 billion? What would $100 billion have done invested \nin other areas of our country or spent for other purposes? Then, what \nhave we gotten for our $100 billion invested in national missile \ndefense?\n  In North Dakota, we have the remnants of what was the free world's \nonly antiballistic missile program. It was opened after the Nation \nspent billions and billions of dollars on it. Then we mothballed it \nwithin 30 days of its being declared operational.\n  America's taxpayers have a right to question and wonder whether this \nis a wise use of their money? If I felt this program was a critical \nelement of what is necessary for this country's defense, I would be \nhere supporting it. But the Pentagon doesn't feel it is a critically \nimportant program, necessary for our country's defense. That is why \nthey didn't ask for the $118 million. That is why the $118 million is \nnow being added here in the authorization bill.\n  The Senator from New Mexico asks that we take this $118 million out \nof this bill. I support the Senator from New Mexico on the question of, \ndo we need it and can we afford it? The answer is no on both counts. It \nis not just an answer that I give; it is an answer that comes from \nmilitary officials themselves who say there is no validated military \nrequirement for the space-based laser.\n  Mr. President, I hope that when we vote on this amendment, those who \nwish to save money, those who wish to stop spending money that we don't \nhave on things we don't need will decide that we will approve the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico and cut the $118 \nmillion for this program, which has been added to this program in this \ndefense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for yielding me \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  It would be awful difficult to try to express my beliefs on this in 2 \nminutes. I would only say that this euphoria that we seem to enjoy \naround here that there is no threat is one that is of more concern to \nme than anything else we talk about.\n  When you say, can we afford it, I often wonder can we afford not to \ndo it. The whole argument that has been made on this space-based \namendment by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has been that \nright now there is nothing targeted at the United States. And I know \nthe President has said in his State of the Union Message that there is \nnothing targeted at the United States for the first time in \ncontemporary history when in fact we do not have any way of knowing \nthat.\n  I suggest you might remember the hearings on Anthony Lake when he was \ntrying to become the Director of Central Intelligence. We made a very \nconclusive point that right now there is no way of telling. There is no \nverification. I would suggest you remember what Gen. John Shalikashvili \nsaid. He said there is no verification process. Then he went on to say, \n``But I can tell you we don't have missiles pointed at Russia.''\n  That is really comforting, isn't it, to think it is just kind of a \ngentleman's agreement that you do not aim at us and we will not aim at \nyou. But let us assume that we could verify today or at the beginning \nof this debate that there is nothing aimed at the United States. It can \nbe retargeted in a matter of minutes.\n  I would like to quote from Gen. Igor Sergeyev, the Commander in chief \nof the Russian Strategic Forces. He said, ``Missiles can be retargeted \nand launched from this war room mostly in a matter of minutes.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by \nthe Senator from New Mexico to reduce funding for the space-based laser \nprogram. The space-based laser program is one of the most important \ntechnology development programs in the Department of Defense. It could \nprovide for global boost phase defense against all types of ballistic \nmissiles from short-range tactical missiles to long-range strategic \nmissiles.\n  It would be shortsighted for the United States to constantly abandon \nthis development effort at a time when the long-range missile threat is \ngrowing. The space-based laser program is the only future oriented \nprogram remaining at the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. With \nthe exception of space-based laser, BMDO is focused almost exclusively \non near-term development and deployment efforts.\n  This is an unbalanced approach which mortgages our future for near-\nterm capability, and in my view we should have a more balanced \napproach, one which continues to invest in high payoff future systems \nwhile deploying near-term capability.\n  Mr. President, the space-based laser program has been one of the best \nmanaged programs in the history of the Department of Defense. \nUnfortunately, the department has only requested $30 million for this \nimportant program in fiscal year 1998. The Armed Services Committee did \nthe responsible thing by adding additional funds to ensure that this \nprogram continues to make technical progress. It would be highly \nirresponsible to cut this funding at this time.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time remains on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 19 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong \nopposition to the Bingaman amendment. It would cut funding that is \nnecessary for the space-based laser program. This program is making \ntremendous technical progress. DOD acknowledges that additional funds \nare required for this purpose and is working to identify those \nadditional funds in the outyears.\n  This has been one of the best managed programs in the history of U.S. \nballistic missile defense efforts. You cannot often say that, that the \nprogram is on budget, on time, reliable, and even under severe funding \nconstraints it has continued to make remarkable technical progress. It \noffers the best hope for the future of providing highly effective \nglobal boost phase defense against ballistic missiles of all ranges.\n  There was an independent review team appointed by the directer of \nBMDO to study the future of the SBL Program that has recommended that \nthis program transition to the development of a space technology \ndemonstrator for launch in the year 2005. And the funding contained in \nthis bill supports the recommendation. It does not violate the ABM \nTreaty, for those who may be concerned. It keeps our options open to \ndeploy this system.\n  I get very concerned, Mr. President, when year after year--and this \nthe seventh straight year--there has been opposition expressed on the \nfloor in spite of the full support of the committee on this program. \nThis is a tremendously important program, and I think my colleagues \nneed to understand that there is an expansion of the number of \ncountries possessing ballistic missiles, not only nuclear but chemical \nand biological. These warheads present a serious challenge to the \nsecurity of the United States. They are all over the world--North \nKorea, Iran, Iraq, just to name a few--China. They threaten our troops \nand they threaten our cities, and to take away a technology that can \nprotect those cities, protect those troops in the field is outrageous. \nIt is outrageous. It is immoral. I do not understand the intensity of \nthe effort to do this year after year after year.\n  As the number of countries with these ballistic missiles continues to \nincrease and as the range of those missiles increases, the expansion in \nthe number of targets to defend will dramatically increase. With this \ntechnology, we are able to get these missiles in their boost phase and \nmake the\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\ndebris from those missiles fall back on the aggressor or the firer of \nthe missile.\n  That is what this technology is all about. That is why it is so \nimportant, Mr. President. And to come down here year after year, time \nafter time, and arbitrarily try to kill a program that has been on \nbudget, on time, supported by the defense people and protecting our \ntroops, protecting our cities is flat out irresponsible. There is \nabsolutely no justification for it anywhere.\n  I urge my colleagues to look very, very carefully at what they are \ndoing here because if this vote were to prevail and this amendment were \nto be passed, it would do serious damage to our security and, frankly, \nput our cities at risk, our bases at risk and our troops at risk \nthroughout the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first I would like unanimous consent to \nadd Senator Moseley-Braun as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first just clarify what we are \nabout here. The amendment that Senator Dorgan and Senator Moseley-Braun \nand I have offered is not an amendment to cut out the funding that the \nadministration has requested in this area. It is to support the funding \nthat the administration is requesting in this area. The administration \nin its budget said that it wanted $28.8 million in the space-based \nlaser program this year, and that is exactly what we are proposing.\n  Now, at the committee level and the subcommittee level an additional \n$118 million, or essentially five times as much funding, was added to \nthe request of the administration. What we are trying to do is say let \nus go with what the Pentagon requested. That is not an unreasonable \nposition.\n  Last evening, Senator Lott spoke in opposition to our amendment, and \nhe said clearly in his view the space-based laser was, and I think this \nis an exact quote, ``the national missile defense option of choice.''\n  That is just flat wrong. The Pentagon has made it very clear that \ntheir option of choice is the ground-based interceptor which we are \nfunding through the National Missile Defense Program in this budget. In \nfact, we are funding it at twice the level that the administration had \nearlier requested. Instead of the plan of spending $2.3 billion over \nthe next 5 years, we are going to spend $4.6 billion on that.\n\n  I support that, and our amendment does nothing to interfere with \nthat. So the option of choice is the ground-based program which we have \nalready agreed to go ahead and fund.\n  The real question here is where is the money coming from? If we are \ngoing to do this space-based laser, where is the money coming from? We \nwould think it totally irresponsible for the administration to come in \nwith this kind of request in 1998 if they could not tell us what they \nwere going to do in future years to follow on in building this so-\ncalled demonstrator. But we think nothing of just adding it ourselves \nand saying, well, we will worry later about how we are going to fund \nthis thing. So that is the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

The question now is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 677 offered by Senator Feingold. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, is there supposed to be an explanation of \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no time allowed for further debate \non the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nminutes equally divided for purposes of explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senate will be in order.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Madam President.\n  This amendment asks that the Defense Department, within 60 days, \nissues a report to tell us which of the three planned jet fighters \nshould be terminated because of the obvious problem that we don't have \nenough money in the procurement budget to have all three of these--the \nF-22 of the Air Force, the F-18E/F of the Navy, or the joint strike \nfighter that is being planned as a commonality plane for three branches \nof our armed services.\n  The GAO, CBO, many military experts, and others agree that it is not \npossible for us to afford all three of these, and it is also not an \nanswer, as the QDR suggests, to simply reduce each of the three, \nbecause the problem is that the unit cost of each plane is so high that \nat the lower number of planes that are produced, you don't get the \nsavings. This is what happened with the B-2 bomber.\n  We are facing a train wreck with regard to this, and we need some \nguidance from the Defense Department about which of the three should \ngo, if that is what we have to do in order to continue to balance the \nbudget.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, the Senator from Wisconsin has raised \nlegitimate questions about the cost of future tactical air purchases. \nThe Senate Armed Services Committee has raised these questions \nrepeatedly with the Department of Defense, holding hearings, and \nreceived a great deal of testimony. The Secretary of Defense, former \nSenator Bill Cohen, has recommended a balanced approach by dramatically \nreducing the number of planes purchased for each of the three \ncategories--F-18E/F, joint strike fighter, and the F-22.\n  No final decision has been made. The committee has put severe cost \nconstraints on engineering, manufacturing and development for the F-22. \nWe are\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\nworking on this problem. We have a national defense panel that will \nreport to us in December. To make a precipitous decision, or even a \nprecipitous recommendation, of canceling one of those programs puts \none, either the joint strike fighter, F-22, or F-18E/F, in jeopardy. It \nleaves the services in jeopardy. If you cancel one, you either leave \nthe Navy, Marines, or Air Force naked without tactical air capability \nthey need for the future.\n  I don't think now is the time to take this approach. I think we will \nbe making these decisions over the next several months, but we need to \nrely on the Secretary and others and the bipartisan recommendation of \nthe Armed Services Committee before moving on this. So I recommend a \nvote against the Feingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

FINAL SETTLEMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY COMMUNITY \n                   ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS TO LOS ALAMOS COUNTY UNDER \n                   AUSPICES OF ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY ACT OF \n                   1955.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of Energy on behalf of the federal \n     government shall convey without consideration fee title to \n     government-owned land under the administrative control of the \n     Department of Energy to the Incorporated County of Los \n     Alamos, Los Alamos, New Mexico, or its designee, and to the \n     Secretary of the Interior in trust for the Pueblo of San \n     Ildefonso for purposes of preservation, community self-\n     sufficiency or economic diversification in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b) In order to carry out the requirement of subsection (a) \n     the Secretary shall--\n       (1) no later than 3 months from the date of enactment of \n     this Act, submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a \n     report identifying parcels of land considered suitable for \n     conveyance, taking into account the need to provide lands--\n       (A) which are not required to meet the national security \n     missions of the Department of Energy;\n       (B) which are likely to be available for transfer within \n     ten years; and\n       (C) which have been identified by the Department, the \n     County of Los Alamos, or the Pueblo of San Ildefonso, as \n     being able to meet the purposes stated in subsection (a),\n       (2) no later than 12 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, submit to the appropriate Congressional committees \n     a report containing the results of a title search on all \n     parcels of land identified in paragraph (1), including an \n     analysis of any claims of former owners, or their heirs and \n     assigns, to such parcels. During this period, the Secretary \n     shall engage in concerted efforts to provide claimants with \n     every reasonable opportunity to legally substantiate their \n     claims. The Secretary shall only transfer land for which the \n     United States government holds clear title.\n       (3) no later than 21 months from the date of enactment of \n     this Act, complete any review required by the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4375) with \n     respect to anticipated environmental impact of the conveyance \n     of the parcels of land identified in the report to Congress; \n     and\n       (4) no later than 3 months after the date, which is the \n     later of--\n       (A) the date of completion of the review required by \n     paragraph (3); or\n       (B) the date on which the County of Los Alamos and the \n     Pueblo of San Ildefonso submit to the Secretary a binding \n     agreement allocating the parcels of land identified in \n     paragraph (1) to which the government has clear title,\n\n     submit to the appropriate Congressional committees a plan for \n     conveying the parcels of land in accordance with the \n     agreement between the County and the Pueblo and the findings \n     of the environmental review in paragraph (3).\n       (c) The Secretary shall complete the conveyance of all \n     portions of the lands identified in the plan with all due \n     haste, and no later than 9 months, after the date of \n     submission of the plan under paragraph (b)(4).\n       (d) If the Secretary finds that a parcel of land identified \n     in subsection (b) continues to be necessary for national \n     security purposes for a period of time less than ten years or \n     requires remediation of hazardous substances in accordance \n     with applicable laws that delays the parcel's conveyance \n     beyond the time limits provided in subsection (c), the \n     Secretary shall convey title of that parcel upon completion \n     of the remediation or after that parcel is no longer \n     necessary for national security purposes.\n       (e) Following transfer of the land pursuant to subsection \n     (c), the Secretary shall make no further assistance payments \n     under section 91 or section 94 of the Atomic Energy Community \n     Act of 1955 (42 U.S.C. 2391; 2394) to county or city \n     governments in the vicinity of Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, since the 1950's, the Department of \nEnergy and its predecessors have made assistance payments to the county \nof Los Alamos, NM. Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1955, this was \naccomplished in recognition of the dependence of the community on the \nAtomic Energy Commission's, and later the DOE's, facilities. Their \nfacilities, worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars, paid no taxes \nto this community. Now only Los Alamos County and schools receive any \nassistance, and all other communities are off assistance, many via \nbuyouts.\n  It is very difficult for Los Alamos to reach self-sufficiency and to \ncontinue into the next century as a viable community unless something \nis done about the fact that there is no longer any land within the city \nand county of Los Alamos that can be developed, for the excess land is \nall in the hands of the Department of Energy.\n  Last year, we agreed to end assistance to Los Alamos County through \nan agreement that coupled a very moderate buyout amount with transfer \nof excess land to the city. The land considered for transfer now is \nunder the control of the DOE and cannot be used by the city until \nownership is transferred.\n  This amendment will eventually return land to the county that can be \nused for normal county growth and to the Pueblo of San Ildefonso that \nhas strong historic claims to portions of the land. The amendment also \ncarefully prescribes a study of other claims for these lands that are \nnow largely part of this county but still under the\n\n[[Page S7235]]\n\ncontrol of the Department of Energy. The Secretary of Energy is \nchartered to conduct a record search of all legal claims and to use \nevery reasonable effort to determine whether there are any claims to \nthese pieces of property considered for transfer.\n  It ends assistance payments to Los Alamos and provides for the future \ngrowth of Los Alamos by enabling opportunities for economic diversity. \nUltimately, we believe this is in the best interests of the Federal \nGovernment and the many thousands of people that live in northern New \nMexico. Without this amendment, we continue to have a land-locked city, \nwithout opportunity for economic development. And in that environment, \nthere is also no room for housing projects, which leads to some of the \nhighest housing costs in America. Without this amendment, assistance \npayments would have to continue. This amendment starts the forces of \nchange that allow us to stop the assistance payments.\n  In summary, Madam President, this amendment is critical to complete \nthe mandate of the last Congress to stop assistance payments to the \ncounty of Los Alamos, NM, under the auspices of the Atomic Energy \nCommunity Act of 1955.\n  The Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 enabled assistance payments \nfor communities impacted by the presence of major atomic energy \nfacilities. These facilities were primarily located in remote areas, to \naddress the security concerns accompanying their missions and none were \nmore remote than the site at Los Alamos. Assistance payments to \nmaintain community services were required in recognition of the nearly \ncomplete dependence of these cities on the then-AEC facilities that did \nnot pay local taxes.\n  Over the ensuing years, most of these communities moved to either \nattain economic self-sufficiency or were close enough to self-\nsufficiency that they could accept various buyout provisions to enable \ntheir self-sufficiency. As they attained economic self-sufficiency, \ntheir assistance payments could stop. But, Los Alamos remained the \nexception, partly because it had virtually no land suitable for \ndevelopment for any commercial opportunities--virtually all usable land \nin the county was under the control of the Department of Energy.\n  Last year, we developed an agreement to end the assistance payments \nto Los Alamos County. That agreement coupled a buyout payment of $22.6 \nmillion that we appropriated last year along with provision of land to \nthe county to enable commercial and residential development. It was \nessential to couple both the payment and the land together. Without the \nland with its potential for economic and housing development, a far \nlarger payout amount would have been essential for the County to \nachieve self-sufficiency.\n\n  This amendment directs the Department of Energy to evaluate the land \nunder its control to determine what can be released without impacting \nthe national security mission of the Laboratory. Now, some of that land \nwill not be appropriate for economic or housing development, but does \nrepresent lands that were part of the San Ildefonso Pueblo at the time \nof the Manhattan Project. Many sacred sites of the San Ildefonso Pueblo \nare located on that property. During the Manhattan Project, those San \nIldefonso lands became part of Los Alamos County, but no compensation \nwas ever provided to San Ildefonso Pueblo. This current evaluation of \nDOE's land requirements provides an ideal opportunity to return to the \nPueblo some of that land that they previously used.\n  Our amendment recognizes that other parties have raised claims to \nsome of these lands. Most of these claims result from homesteaded lands \nthat were condemned when the Manhattan Project began, and compensation \nto the owners should have been provided at that time--but that must be \ncarefully researched. The Department of Energy and the Corps of \nEngineers have been evaluating the legal basis for these claims over \nthe past months, but this amendment asks that they go still further to \nprovide every reasonable opportunity for these claimants to \nsubstantiate their claims. And the amendment precludes transfer of any \nland for which the U.S. Government does not hold clear title.\n  This amendment then enables Congress to finish the agreement with Los \nAlamos County, by coupling land for commercial and residential \ndevelopment to the payout funds. It provides for return of lands to San \nIldefonso Pueblo for which no compensation was provided. It further \nprovides for a careful process to evaluate the legality of any \noutstanding claims on this land. And finally, through this amendment, \nCongress no longer will be asked to provide assistance payments to the \ncounty of Los Alamos.\n  Madam President, I conclude by saying that there are many people in \nand around New Mexico that had previously owned lands in Los Alamos \nthat were purchased during the Manhattan Project's location there.\n  This amendment says, as to the land that may be conveyed, that if \nthere are claimants, their claims will be evaluated and perhaps in some \nway resolved.\n  I am delighted to have worked on that. I think it is very important \nto everybody in our State to know that will occur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of \nSenator Domenici's amendment to establish a framework for a final \nsettlement of the assistance payments to the county of Los Alamos under \nthe Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955. As Senator Domenici has \npointed out, the Congress has already implemented the first part of a \ntwo-step process to end these payments and to provide the County with \nthe ability to develop a commercial tax base--last year the Congress \nappropriated $22.6 million buyout payment for the county. This \namendment implements the second part of the agreement, by transferring \nexcess land from Los Alamos National Laboratory to the county for \npurposes of economic development. This development will mean jobs for \nnorthern New Mexicans and improved economic self-sufficiency for the \nCounty.\n  In crafting the language being offered today, Senator Domenici and I \nhave worked to address the concerns of a number of parties in New \nMexico who have expressed interest in any land transfer involving the \nLos Alamos National Laboratory.\n  The language will ensure that land needed for national security \npurposes will be retained by the Department.\n  The language ensures that an environmental review of any transfer \nwill take place, and that land in need of environmental remediation \nprior to transfer is cleaned up.\n  The San Ildefonso Pueblo, which was originally supposed to receive \nlands that subsequently were withdrawn for the use of the Department of \nEnergy, will participate in the process and have some of these lands \nreturned, including sites that are sacred to the Pueblo.\n  Finally, the language addresses the interests of the Homesteaders \nAssociation of the Los Alamos Plateau, which represents former owners \nand descendants of former owners of land that was condemned by the \nFederal Government for the Manhattan Project. The homesteaders are now \nresearching their claims to the land that was condemned in the 1940's, \nand have asked for assistance from the Department of Energy in \ndocumenting their case. The language that we are considering today \nrequires the Department of Energy to take several actions with respect \nto these claims.\n  First, after the list of parcels of lands that are to be considered \nfor transfer is drawn up, the Department is to submit a report to \nCongress with the result of a title search on those parcels.\n  Second, the Department is also required to provide Congress with an \nanalysis of any claims of former owners, or their heirs and assigns, to \nsuch parcels.\n  Third, during the year after passage of this act, the Secretary shall \nengage in concerted efforts to provide claimants with every reasonable \nopportunity to legally substantiate their claims. The Department, in \nthe past, has provided assistance to other groups and communities to \nenable them to fully exercise their rights to participate in \ndepartmental decisions affecting their vital interests. It is our \nintention that, within the bounds of reasonableness and \nappropriateness, the Department provide assistance to the homesteaders, \nas well.\n  Finally, the language states, in two places, that the Department is \nonly to transfer land to which the Government\n\n[[Page S7236]]\n\nhas clear title. If a former owner has a valid legal claim to a parcel, \nthis land transfer amendment provides the Department with no new \nauthority to extinguish that claim. In such a case, the Department must \nreport back to Congress on the claim and remove the affected parcel \nfrom consideration for transfer under this section, unless the \nDepartment and the former owner or the descendants of the former owner \narrive at a mutually agreeable settlement of the claim.\n  I believe that this amendment strikes the appropriate balance between \nthe interests of Los Alamos County and the San Ildefonso Pueblo in \nhaving access to lands that are no longer needed by the Department and \nthat are not in dispute, and the interests of the former owners of \nlands on the Los Alamos plateau in having their legal claims fairly \nexamined and respected. I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, the amendment is cleared on this side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the amendment is supported on this side, \nas well. We support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today, I offer this amendment for \nmyself and currently 46 Members of the Senate. This amendment will \nchange the status of the Chief of the National Guard. Our amendment \npromotes the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to a 4-star general and \nwill include that position as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nNow, the Joint Chiefs are the senior leadership within our military. \nThis position for the Guard would rotate between the Army National \nGuard and the Air National Guard.\n  I know this will become controversial with the members of the Armed \nServices Committee and members of the committee here in the Senate.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent Senators Gregg, Roberts, \nCampbell, McConnell, Faircloth, Boxer, Murray, Craig, Baucus, \nHutchison, Daschle, Dorgan, Sessions, Lautenberg, and any other Senator \nwho wishes to become sponsor, be listed as original cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the basis of this amendment is our belief \nthat members of the National Guard are an essential part of our \nnational security team. They are active participants now in the full \nspectrum of operations from the very smallest contingencies to the \nmajor actions we have been involved in. Theater wars, such as the \nPersian Gulf, no major military operation can be successful today \nwithout the National Guard.\n  There are now 474,673 men and women in the National Guard. They are \napproximately 20 percent of our total Armed Forces and they represent \nparticipants from all 50 States and the 4 territories. These guardsmen \ntruly embody our forefather's vision of the American citizen soldier. \nGuardsmen in uniform come in contact with the members of their \ncommunity on a daily basis. As part of their community they attend \ntheir church, they serve on the PTA, they are actively involved in \ncommunity and regional and State activities, they have civilian jobs in \ntheir communities. But they are citizen soldiers and they report for \nduty immediately.\n  As a matter of fact, in my State, we now have an Air National Guard \nrefueling unit that serves as the refueling unit for the whole Pacific \ntheater. It is a National Guard unit. It is now fulfilling the complete \nfunctions of its predecessor, which was an active duty unit.\n  Many Americans form their impressions about our people in military, \nparticularly those in uniform, from their contact with members of the \nGuard. As we continue to downsize the active forces, I believe it is \ncritical we maintain this strong communities-based military presence in \nevery community. That citizen soldier is our link to the future, as far \nas support of military activities in this country, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I have served now for many years on the Defense \nAppropriations Committee. One of my great privileges was to serve with \nSenator John Stennis who, at that time, was chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and chairman of the Appropriations Committee. That \ncan't happen\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\nagain under our changed rules in the Senate.\n  But in those days, we talked very long and often about the National \nGuard and the way we might integrate the National Guard into the active \nforces so that they would get, during peacetime, the type of exposure \nthey need to be very proficient and efficient members of our team when \nwe are at war. We pioneered the concept of sending to Europe, to NATO, \nand to our forces in Europe, guardsmen who actively performed the roles \nof our military in that theater, even though they were National \nGuardsmen on temporary duty. That is a few years back now, but that \nproved to be very cost-effective, Mr. President. At a cost of about 25 \npercent, we can maintain a person who is able and ready to perform \nmilitary duties as a guardsman, compared to the active duty force. I am \nnot saying they can ever replace them; that is not the idea. But the \npurpose of our amendment is to assure that there is recognition now of \nthe role, on a constant basis, of the citizen soldier in the \nformulation of military policy in this Nation.\n  The National Guard is not consulted now on a regular basis on major \nforce structure decisions, or on matters concerning resource allocation \nand priorities. During the Quadrennial Defense Review, it is my \njudgment that the National Guard was not fully considered, as far as \nthe deliberations concerning defense strategy, force readiness, and the \nallocation of funding. There were important decisions made concerning \nthe future of the Guard within the military structure, without the \nGuard having any participant there.\n  I think the Guard represents such a significant portion of our forces \nthat the rank now held by the highest member in the National Guard, a \nthree-star general, should become a four-star general, and that person \nrepresenting, at times, the Army National Guard, and at other names the \nAir National Guard, rotating, as I said, should have a seat at the \ntable where the decisions are made that vitally affect the future of \nthe participants in the National Guard.\n  Now, these Joint Chiefs--and I have a high regard for them --are the \nsenior military advisers to the President, and they are the \ndecisionmaking body of military strategy, as far as our system is \nconcerned. Within the Department of Defense, they speak for those in \nuniform. But the National Guard, who constitutes 20 percent of our \ntotal military and one-fifth of the people who could be called into any \ncrisis to come forward and participate in the defense of our Nation, \nare not represented at that table.\n  It is my strong view that they should be part of that Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. The National Guard Bureau has no access to the chain of command \ndirectly to that staff, or to the Secretary of Defense, or to the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs. I believe our amendment would correct \nthat situation. And if it is not corrected, it could impair our future \nreadiness and the survival of the Guard itself.\n  Now, I want to state very clearly, I know that Secretary Cohen, who \nis not only a great Secretary, but he is a personal friend, and General \nShalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are not \nparticularly pleased with this suggestion. Their counsel, I am sure, \nwill come to the Congress with regard to this. But I remember that at \nthe time we suggested that the Guard start performing regular duty \nfunctions, the Secretary and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs were opposed \nto that, too. Yet, when it came to the Persian Gulf, Mr. President, \nwhen we had to send our forces there to restrain the forces of Saddam \nHussein, the call was answered by almost 75,000 National Guardsmen. \nAlmost, as I understand it, about 25 percent of the thousands and \nthousands that were on active duty there were National Guardsmen.\n  Now, it is high time, I believe, that the Guard forces who were \ncalled upon to serve our Nation have their interests fully considered \non a day-to-day basis when the decisions are made that affect their \nfuture. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  I believe this is an amendment that must become law. It will take \nsome time to work it out. I am not saying this will happen overnight. \nBut I do believe it is our role, as members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, to raise this issue. A cost-effective military for this \ncountry in the 21st century requires the participation of the National \nGuard.\n  We are constantly faced with decisions to reduce our force structure. \nThe way to increase our force structure is to bring more citizen \nsoldiers into the Department of Defense structure now. We will do that \nif they realize that we are going to emphasize their participation, we \nare going to emphasize their role, and we are going to do that by \nhaving a member of the Joint Chiefs be a representative of the National \nGuard of the United States. I consider this to be one of the major \nchanges that must be made in the realignment of our forces and \nthe command of our forces in this country. And I am hopeful that others \nwill speak very forcefully on it. I might add, Mr. President, I see \nthat the cochairmen of the National Guard Caucus are here. I am \ndelighted that they support this proposal.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank my good friend from Alaska. As \nhe says, this will not be an easy decision, but he is not one that \nbacks off when he thinks it is right. So, Mr. President, as cochairman \nof the Senate National Guard Caucus, I rise to ask my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment of the senior Senator from Alaska, elevating the \nNational Guard Bureau to a four-star general and including that \nposition as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I pointed out to my colleagues the Army's \nrefusal to consult with the leadership of the National Guard Bureau or \nthe leadership of the Army Guard during the consideration of the QDR. \nWhen asked about this oversight by the press, the Army spokesman \nresponded, ``There is an Army Reserve colonel and a Guard colonel here \nin our offices. They get to weigh in on the issues.''\n  You do not need extensive knowledge of military affairs to realize \nthat a colonel does not pull much weight against a group of active duty \nArmy generals protecting their turf. Mr. President, there is no excuse \nfor the poor working relationship between the active Army and the Army \nNational Guard. However, I believe the leadership of the active Army \ndoes not consider members of the Army National Guard as soldiers on \nequal footing. Instead, they treat the men and women of the Army \nNational Guard with indifference. The active duty generals seem to \nforget that the men and women of the Army Guard have undergone the \nsame--I repeat, the same--training as their counterparts. The situation \nis even more ridiculous when you consider that 50 percent of the entire \nArmy National Guard are men and women coming off active duty with the \nArmy.\n  I also believe that, if this amendment becomes law, there would not \nbe a constant need for offsite agreements between the Army and the \nNational Guard. Just recently, I was briefed by the Army on the latest \noffsite meeting between the Army and the Guard--an off-site meeting \nthat was held after it was brought to Secretary Cohen's attention by \nSenator Bond and I that the Guard had been left out of the QDR process. \nIn that briefing, I was told the Army and the Guard had reached an \nagreement. But I pointed out to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, \nwho briefed me, ``I have little faith in the outcome of such an \nagreement when the Army still hasn't lived up to the 1993 off-site \nagreement.'' Of course, that point may be moot, as I now have been \ninformed that the Chief of Staff of the Army is unhappy with the \nagreement and, to date, has refused to sign off.\n  So, Mr. President, this kind of runaround is exactly why we need \nSenator Stevens' amendment. The Army National Guard currently--I want \nmy colleagues to listen to this--provides more than 55 percent of the \nground combat forces, 45 percent of the combat support forces, 25 \npercent of the Army's combat supply units, while receiving--guess \nwhat?--only 2 percent of the Department of Defense budget. Now, let me \nrepeat that. The Army National Guard currently provides more than 55 \npercent of the ground combat forces, 45 percent of the combat support \nforces, and 25 percent of the Army's combat supply units, while \nreceiving only 2\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\npercent of the Department of Defense budget.\n  You will hear from some of our colleagues that the Army National \nGuard divisions have no fighting missions. They will be telling the \ntruth, but they won't be telling all the truth. That is because the \nactive duty Army leadership has simply refused to give the Guard a war \nfighting mission. They have refused to do so despite the fact that the \nactive Army's attrition rate--get this--is 36 percent. About half of \nthose are joining the National Guard. They have been trained. The \nattrition rate in the Army Guard is somewhere around 15 percent. The \nquestion my colleagues should be asking is, How many active duty Army \ndivisions are at full strength versus the Army Guard divisions?\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment will ensure that the National Guard \nand all its attendant forces will have a voice in the Department of \nDefense's senior decisionmaking process when it comes to defense \nstrategy, force readiness, and allocation of resources. In the end, I \nhope that when my colleagues hear arguments like, ``there are two \ncolonels here in our offices that weigh in on issues,'' they will \nremember that their simply being in the room isn't enough. You have to \nhave a seat at the table and a voice that carries some weight. That is \nexactly what this amendment we have before us today does.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support the amendment and help us pull \nup a chair for the National Guard Bureau and give them a voice that can \nbe heard loud and clear at the Defense Department's decisionmaking \ntable.\n  I want to underscore one other thing. Already 47 Senators have \ncosponsored this amendment, and many more will come on board. I hope \nthat we understand that the overwhelming sentiment of this body is to \nsupport Senator Stevens' amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very proud to join my cochair of the \nNational Guard Caucus, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, in \nsupport of a very long overdue and very important provision offered by \nthe chairman of our Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and the full \ncommittee.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this measure to elevate the Chief \nof the National Guard Bureau to a rank of four-star general and to give \nthat general a seat at the table as a member of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff.\n  As has already been pointed out, the National Guard has been \nincreasingly called upon to perform overseas deployments and other \noperational tasks in its role as a national defense component. The \nNational Guard is unique from all other services in that it has a \nState-oriented mission as well as a national mission. The National \nGuard maintains a force of over 350,000 soldiers and airmen and women, \nfully 20 percent of our total fighting force. It is a force greater, \nalmost double that of another military component already represented on \nthe JCS.\n  The current administrative chain of command for the National Guard at \nthe highest levels is confusing, to say the least. Component Air Force \npersonnel of the National Guard, who are integrated into the Air Force \nstructure in an enlightened and seamless way, fall under the umbrella \nof the Chief of the Guard Bureau, specifically to address the unique \nrequirements faced by the National Guard personnel, but the Chief of \nthe National Guard Bureau is responsible to the Chief of the Army.\n  By placing the Chief of the Guard Bureau on the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, this convoluted chain of command will be rationalized. By \nplacing the Chief of the Guard Bureau on the JCS, the unique \ncharacteristics of the Guard will receive their just due.\n  As former Governors, my cochairman and I recognize as much as anyone \ncan the truly vital State mission that the Guard provides. I have come \nto know and appreciate what the Guard must do in its civilian mission \nand its State militia role. This is a unique mission, unlike any of the \nmissions of the other branches of the service, and for this reason as \nwell it commends a seat at the table with the Joint Chiefs of Staff for \nthe head of the Guard Bureau.\n  My colleagues from Alaska and Kentucky have already pointed out how \nthe Guard gets short shrift when major decisions are made. We have a \ncouple of colonels in the room when the generals are making the \ndecision. That does not carry a lot of weight. We have seen time and \ntime again where agreements are reached, supposedly taking account of \nand recognizing the role the Guard plays, only to have the higher-ups, \nthose people who have a membership on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \noverturn or ignore those agreements.\n  The President, who is advised by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gets, in \nmy view, a biased view, and as a result the Office of the President \ntraditionally has habitually disregarded the legitimate procurement \nneeds of the Guard, and the recommendations that come to us from the \nPresident do not reflect what we in this body have continually \nrecognized as the important role of the Guard. Rather than having us \ntry to fight that battle every time, it makes sense, in my view, to \nhave a four-star general as head of the Guard and have that person \nrepresented on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This will force the Defense \nDepartment to recognize the needs and the unique mission of the Guard \nin its budget requests and incorporate them into its financial plans as \nwell as incorporating the Guard in its utilization plans. This action \nwill go a long way to making sure that we have a fully integrated and \neffectively utilized civilian militia as we meet the changing needs \nwith tight budgets for the future.\n  As well, there are those of my colleagues who have had concerns about \nthe politicization of National Guard requirements and resources. The \nadministration has yet to recognize the legitimate procurement needs of \nthe National Guard. Not once has one penny been requested for the \nNational Guard's procurement requirements. The Department of Defense \nhas relied upon the largess of the Congress to support it. So, to my \ncolleagues who will use the argument in the coming days during \ndiscussions on the Defense authorization and appropriation bills, that \n``the Pentagon has not even asked for so many dollars,'' the Pentagon, \ndoesn't do the asking, it is the President, and he has seen fit to \ndisregard habitually, the legitimate procurement needs of the Guard. By \nhaving the Guard represented on the JCS, the Defense Department will be \nforced to recognize these needs in its budget and incorporate them into \nits financial plan. And this action will relieve a lot of that \npoliticization we keep hearing about.\n  This amendment will not increase the size of the National Guard, nor \nincrease the administrative staffs. The rules and requirements met by \nthe other Joint Chiefs will have to be met by the National Guard Chief.\n  This is an amendment whose time has come. It is forward thinking, it \nrecognizes the changing world situation and the subsequent change to \nour Nation's military force structure and requirements. It is an \nimportant step in the right direction of modernizing the military \nparadigms we have lived with through the cold war and goes a long way \nto addressing QDR concerns for the direction of our Nation's military \nforce.\n  I say again, I urge Members who have not yet cosponsored it--and \nthere are only 53 left--to join us in cosponsoring this measure because \nthis is an idea whose time has come.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the matter that is before us is of \nimportance, and I know we all want to continue the discussion on our \ndefense authorization bill, but there is another matter that is also \nunder consideration as we are meeting here this morning, and that is \nthe reconciliation, the proposal to bring together those elements of \nthe House and Senate bills that will relate to the economy and relate \nto child health, education, Medicare, and other matters that really \ndefine where we are going as a country over the period of the next 5 \nyears. And as we are getting into that particular issue, I want to \naddress one other item that is not unrelated to that and is related to \nthe issues of fairness in our economy and fairness in our society. I \nwill speak briefly to that and then introduce legislation and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, a point of order. Will the Senator yield \nfor a point of order?\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a point of order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I would like to finish our amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that the rule established by the late Senator Pastore \nprevents introduction or speaking of nongermane matters during this \nperiod of consideration of this bill.\n  I would like to finish this amendment. It is going to be accepted, I \nmight say to the Senator from Massachusetts. I would like to finish the \nbusiness. Will the Senator permit us to finish at this time so I would \nnot have to make that point of order?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, the Pastore rule goes for a 2-hour \nperiod from the time we come in, which would be another 6 minutes, I \nguess. I am glad to accommodate if you think it is not going to go \nfurther. I would like to be able to speak. I will speak 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Pastore rule will be in order until 12:04.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw the point of order. The Senator is not going \nto take long.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will ask to speak for 5 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy pertaining to the introduction of S. 1009 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The able Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am very concerned about this \namendment. I realize that the amendment has nearly 50 cosponsors. I \nhave been in the Senate long enough to know that any provision with \nthat many cosponsors will pass. However, that does not make the \namendment advisable or good government.\n  While the amendment is very attractive from a political perspective, \nit is not good policy. The amendment would create a new position, the \nSenior Representative of the National Guard. The incumbent of this \nposition would be a four-star general and would be a member of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  The amendment does not eliminate the current three-star Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau nor does it shift any of the duties and \nresponsibilities of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the newly \ncreated Senior Representative of the National Guard. This is pure and \nsimple an additional layer of bureaucracy. A new four-star position is \ncreated but the incumbent is not a commander. He has no directive \nauthority over any forces. The National Guard is under the control of \nthe Governors during peacetime and under the control of the war \nfighting CINC's during wartime. This new Senior Representative has no \nreal function.\n  This position was not created as the result of studies and analysis. \nThere have not been any hearings to determine whether such a position \nwill actually meet any need or to identify any military requirement for \nan additional general. This Senior Representative does not enhance the \nrepresentation of the Reserve forces. He is a National Guardsman and \nwould only concentrate on National Guard issues. I suspect creating \nsuch a position will do more to disrupt jointness than to enhance it.\n  Currently in the statute, the Chief of the National Guard reports \ndirectly to the Secretary of Defense and serves as the principal \nadviser to the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force. The Chief of \nthe National Guard Bureau is authorized to coordinate directly with the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n  Giving the Senior Representative of the National Guard membership in \nthe Joint Chiefs is contrary to the tenets of Goldwater-Nichols which \nwe worked so hard to develop and enact in 1986. In Goldwater-Nichols we \nestablished the membership of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the Chairman \nand the four Service Chiefs. The Vice-Chairman was not made a member of \nthe Joint Chiefs until 1992. This reflects the extensive study and \nanalysis conducted by the JCS, the Department of Defense and the \nCongress before increasing the size of the Joint Chiefs. This Senior \nRepresentative position has not been vetted by anyone. I hope the \nSenator from Alaska would agree to let the Armed Services Committee \nhold hearings on this idea and determine whether and how to best meet \nthe need the amendment is trying to address.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I know this amendment will be adopted by \nthe Senate. I want my colleagues to know that they are making national \nsecurity policy by passing a politically appealing proposal. I prefer \nprinciple over politics.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter addressed to me \nby the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Senate continues consideration of \n     the FY 1998 National Defense Authorization Bill, I want to \n     express my strong opposition, which is shared by the Chairman \n     and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to legislation that would make \n     the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (NGB) a four star \n     general and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       The Army National Guard, the Air National Guard, and the \n     Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps Reserves are full \n     partners in the first line of defense of the United States of \n     America. Under the Total Force Policy, they are fully \n     represented in the deliberations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     by their respective Service Chiefs. Moreover, the Total Force \n     Policy--which prescribes fully integrated active and reserve \n     forces--is also central to the National Military Strategy.\n       Placing the Chief of the National Guard Bureau on the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff would not accomplish the proposed \n     legislation's objective of fuller representation of the six \n     reserve components of the four Services. In addition, such a \n     step would run counter to the direction set for the Joint \n     Chiefs by the Goldwater-Nichols Act.\n       The National Guard is a critical and highly valued part of \n     our national defense. I am committed to achieving even \n     greater unity among the various components of the Armed \n     Forces. I am concerned that creating this additional four \n     star position on the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be divisive \n     and counterproductive to the goal of greater unity.\n       I will continue to examine the representation of the \n     various service components and the allocation of resources to \n     ensure equality and fairness in accordance with the needs of \n     our national defense. I strongly request your support to \n     maintain the existing JCS structure and the current \n     representation of the Reserve Components in the JCS by their \n     respective Service Chiefs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we agree to accept the amendment on this \nside.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to note my concerns with this \namendment, which has close to 50 cosponsors. It would establish the \nposition of Senior Representative of the National Guard Bureau and \nwould add that position as the seventh member of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff.\n  Mr. President, the composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a very \nserious matter. The Joint Chiefs function as an advisory body to the \nSecretary of Defense, the National Security Council, and the President. \nChanges in the composition or functions of the Joint Chiefs should only \nbe effected after long and careful consideration.\n  Mr. President, of all the issues we considered during the committee \nprocess that led up to reporting the landmark Goldwater-Nichols bill to \nthe Senate, one issue was more contentious than any other and took more \ncommittee time than all others. That issue was the establishment of the \nposition of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The \ncommittee eventually decided to create that position by a one-vote \nmargin. Moreover, although the committee decided to create the \nposition, it decided not to make the Vice Chairman a member of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. As a matter of fact, the Vice Chairman was not \nmade a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff until 1992, some 6 years \nafter the position was created. In contrast, the Stevens amendment \nwould add a new member to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Armed \nServices Committee has not held one hearing on the matter. I would also \nnote that Secretary Cohen and General Shalikashvili oppose this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. Without objection, \nthe amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 764) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. On behalf of Senator Dodd, I ask unanimous consent to \nadd Senator Helms as a cosponsor to amendment No. 763.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that David Todd, \nof the staff of the current Presiding Officer, be granted access to the \nfloor during consideration of this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 802\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on amendment No 802 \noffered by the Senator from Michigan and others.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to speak in a generic sense to \nthis issue and then briefly to the amendment, if the managers do not \nmind my doing that at this moment.\n  Mr. President, we are going to have several amendments that call for \ncutting off of funds, that call for withdrawal of American forces from \nBosnia by a date certain, and so on, amendments like the amendment No. \n759 of the Senator from Wisconsin and the substitute amendment No. 802 \nof the Senator from Michigan. I understand this may be a work in \nprogress here, since I know there are very bright people of all our \nstaffs sitting down right now trying to figure out whether or not we \ncan cobble together a reasonable compromise in this area. That is why I \nam not going to speak to the detail of any amendment, but I would like \nto speak to the issue because the issue does not change regardless of \nhow the amendment is crafted.\n  In reviewing the history of our policy in Bosnia, I feel like an odd \nvariant of a worker on a decision tree who, instead of taking the best \nchoice available to him, was forced to take the second best one in \nalmost every instance where he had a choice to make. It's like that old \njoke, you know, from Yogi Berra, ``When you come to a fork in the road, \ntake it.''\n\n  Forks in the road that we have been presented with have usually \ninvolved two bad choices. For most of the duration of the conflict in \nthe former Yugoslavia, over the last 4 years I have found myself taking \na minority position and sometimes being a minority of one or two or \nthree here in the Senate. As early as September 1992, on the floor of \nthe Senate, I called for lifting of the immoral and illegal arms \nembargo against Bosnia. I also called for conducting airstrikes against \nthe genocidal Serbian aggressors.\n  I went to Bosnia during that period, came back, wrote a lengthy \nreport, which was characterized as ``lift and strike,'' and engaged the \nPresident on that policy. We had significant debates here on the floor \nof the Senate about whether or not that policy was a sound one. I was \ntold by very knowledgeable people on the floor of the Senate that, \n``Obviously, airstrikes didn't work,'' and, ``What was I talking \nabout?'' and, ``The Serbs would just be more emboldened,'' all of which \nturned out to be dead wrong--dead, flat wrong. Three years and a \nquarter of a million dead later, we finally conducted airstrikes, which \nled to the Dayton accords and lifting of the arms embargo.\n  What is done is done, Mr. President. After Dayton, we committed our \ntroops to a multinational peace implementation force. But I remind my \ncolleagues that had we followed the lift-and-strike policy when first \nadvocated, we would not have needed to send American troops to Bosnia, \neither in IFOR or in SFOR. But now our forces are there.\n  So, to review the bidding, my original preference was lift and \nstrike. There were European forces on the ground. We would lift the \nembargo, use our air power to supplement those ground forces that were \nthere, and therefore, there would be no need to have American forces \nthere. But we ended up with a situation that was the next best, but \nstill not good. We waited. We dillied around for 3 years and then \nfinally conducted airstrikes. We finally got the Dayton accords. Since \nwe were now part of the deal, we had to provide ground forces as well. \nSo that was the second-best alternative. Going back to that decision \ntree I spoke of, we took a route over here that was better than not \nbeing on the tree, but it was not what it should have been in the first \nplace.\n  So I find myself in the strange position of having argued, initially, \n4 years ago, 5 years ago, that there was no need for American ground \ntroops in Bosnia, to now being on the floor defending the presence of \nour ground troops there. But again I want to emphasize that we made the \nwrong decision at the outset. We finally made the right decision 3 \nyears later, but by that time we had fewer options once we made the \nright decision.\n  Now our forces are there, and they have been the principal reason for \nthe successes that have been achieved by SFOR. Although many of the \nprovisions of the Dayton peace accords remain to be carried out, \nabsolutely nothing would have been accomplished had it not been for the \njob that SFOR has done, and its predecessor, IFOR. These men and women \nfrom NATO member states and many non-NATO states, led by an American \ncontingent, have successfully separated the warring factions, the \nMuslims, the Serbs, and the Croats, and have ended at least temporarily \nthe blatant, planned genocide of the Muslims by the Serbs and the \ndirect, immediate involvement of the country of Serbia, led by a war \ncriminal named Milosevic. They have succeeded in putting a substantial \namount of heavy weaponry in storage sites. And the carnage--though not \nthe damage--in Bosnia has stopped.\n  Yet much remains to be accomplished. There are still incidents of \nbeatings and house burnings, which are inexcusable and must be halted. \nMost refugees are still not able to return to their homes. And if their \nhomes lie in territory controlled by another of the three main \nreligious groups, in almost every instance they have not been able to \nreturn. Most of the indicted war criminals remain at large.\n  I have been very critical of the British conduct in Bosnia, but let \nme say publicly that I compliment them for doing yesterday what all of \nSFOR should be doing with indicted war criminals.\n  These are people who engaged in genocide, and they should be taken to \ncourt, an international tribunal, which exists. If they resist, all \nforce necessary should be used to apprehend them.\n  Yesterday the British SFOR troops acted. One indicted Bosnian Serb \nwar criminal was taken into custody. Another who resisted was shot and \nkilled. So, hurrah for the British. I hope we are emboldened enough to \nact in the same way. So, again, most of the war criminals still remain \nat large, institutions of government, both at the national level and in \nthe Muslim-Croat federation, need to be fleshed out and developed, \nnotwithstanding the progress we have made.\n\n  So now, once again I find myself in the minority. I think it was a \nmistake for the Clinton administration to have set a deadline of the \nend of June 1998 for the withdrawal of American ground forces from \nBosnia, before we were sure that all the tasks enumerated in the Dayton \naccords will have been accomplished.\n  Moreover, as I have repeatedly said over the last half year, I think \nour West European allies, particularly Great Britain and France, are \nmaking a serious mistake by not accepting our offer of United States \nair, sea, communications, and intelligence assets, plus an American \nready reserve force, as they say, over the horizon, in Hungary\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\nor Italy, if they would keep their ground forces in Bosnia when ours \nwithdraw.\n  I recently attended the NATO summit meeting in Madrid with President \nClinton and my colleague, Bill Roth and several others. At that meeting \nI suggested exactly that course of action. I hope the administration \nwill push our European allies very hard on that point.\n  But, once again I find myself in the minority, suggesting that it was \na bad idea to set a date of withdrawal once we had put troops on the \nground. It would be even worse idea if we mandated that they leave or \ncut off funds. And it would be a still worse idea, if we do withdraw, \nif the Europeans withdraw. As I have stated repeatedly over the last \nhalf year, I think our European allies, particularly France and Great \nBritain, would be making a major mistake.\n  Our allies talk ceaselessly in Brussels about a European security and \ndefense identity and a European pillar within NATO, but when they get a \nchance to put their troops where their mouths are, they somehow change \ntheir tune.\n  Now, once more, we face a Hobson's choice. I wish we had not set a \ndate certain for withdrawal from Bosnia. I want the Europeans to play \nthe military role to which they declare they aspire. But I do not want \nto give hope to the sordid opponents of Dayton, like Milosevic and \nTudjman, who would like to carve up Bosnia after international troops \nleave. So, I am reluctantly forced, in Mr. Hobson's terms, to take the \nhorse nearest the door; that is to give the Clinton administration the \nfreedom of action to come up with a better plan within the next 12 \nmonths.\n  Could all the Bosnian horrors of ethnic cleansing, rape camps, and \nshelling of innocent civilians and children reemerge? You bet they \ncould. In fact, if the international force withdraws before the tasks \nenumerated in Dayton have been accomplished, you can be sure they all \nwill return--ethnic cleansing, rape camps, shelling of innocent women \nand children. By locking us into a specific withdrawal date without \nproviding a viable alternative, we will guarantee that all we have \naccomplished in Bosnia will quickly fall apart and that what remains to \nbe accomplished will never get off the drawing board. It will guarantee \nthat a tinhorn dictator like Milosevic in Serbia, and an authoritarian \nthug like Tudjman in Croatia, will be able to proceed with their ill-\nconceived plans to torpedo Dayton and do what they have intended all \nalong--since 1992, I have been saying this--to carve up Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, with part going to Serbia and the rest to Croatia.\n  We have accomplished a great deal in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have \nmade a commitment to the people of that tragic land and to our allies, \nand to other cooperating partners in SFOR. Largely, though, because of \ncongressional pressure, it is not an open-ended commitment. Some of my \ncolleagues suspect that the President will come back to us with a \nrequest for another extension of funding for our troop commitment to \nSFOR. Fine. If he does, we will have a thorough debate and then decide \nwhether or not to support his request. But to say now, as is being \ncontemplated by some, that we should cut off any funds in the future, \nto say that now we will dictate what the outcome will be a year from \nnow, is the ultimate in stupidity, in my view. We are micromanaging. We \nare sending every wrong message we possibly can throughout Bosnia and \nthe rest of Europe.\n  What do we accomplish by doing that? Well, we accomplish, I guess, \nsatisfying ourselves and telling people we are withdrawing troops. We \nhave the authority to do that if the President does not withdraw troops \nby the end of June of next year. That is the operative date.\n  So let's give the President an opportunity to jawbone with our \nEuropean colleagues, to come up with a follow-on plan for what will \noccur after we withdraw our ground forces from Bosnia a year from now. \nBut let's not do it now. Again, my friend from Michigan is trying very \nhard to come up with a proposal that basically says the same thing: \nlook, Europeans, stay. We get out but we provide support.\n  That is a reasonable approach. But, again, let's not, further on this \ndecision tree, make another bad choice that leads us down the road \nfurther to less opportunity and fewer options for peace and security in \nEurope.\n  As I said, I just had the great honor of being in Madrid, Spain, with \nthe leaders of more than 16 European nations. I was playing what was \nvery much a bit role, along for the ride, but there. I find it somewhat \nironic that at the very moment some of us are supporting the \nenlargement of NATO to spread the zone of stability eastward within \nEurope so we do not end up in a circumstance like we did between World \nWar I and World War II, when several smaller states unable to be part \nof the West were forced to seek their own bilateral military \narrangements and their own attempts to provide their collective \nsecurity--we, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, are contemplating voting \nto increase the instability in the most insecure part of Europe.\n  To conclude, my hope is that we will not lock the President into a \npolicy straitjacket while the situation remains so unstable. To those \nwho have a philosophic disagreement with me that we should not be \ninvolved, that Bosnia is not so important, I say to them: you are not \ngiving up any option, by opposing an attempt to determine the outcome a \nyear before it is required, because there will be American forces there \nfor the next year unless there is a foolhardy amendment that suggests \nwe withdraw all American forces right now from SFOR.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to support what the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin is trying to do, because I think \nit is most important that the U.S. Senate speak at this very crucial \ntime to say, let's set a mission, let's set a timetable, let's be very \nclear with our allies about what that is going to be and, Mr. \nPresident, let's keep our word. Let's keep our word when we say this is \nour mission, this is our role, this is our responsibility, we are going \nto be there for you and we are going to leave June 30, 1998.\n  The chronology is very clear. We have been trying to help the people \nof the former Yugoslavia for years. Many of us believed that they had \nthe right to have a fair fight, but they didn't have a fair fight \nbecause part of that country was held to an arms embargo that did not \nallow them to fight for their lives, their families, their land and \ntheir sovereignty. We put amendment upon amendment on the floor to give \nthose people a chance to have a fair fight: Lift the arms embargo on \nthe Muslims, let them have a fair fight. But we could never adopt \nthat--actually, we did adopt it, but we could never get the attention \nof the President.\n  In 1995, we saw the horror of horrors, the massacre at Srebrenica 2 \nyears ago where we believe, and are not even sure yet how many, but we \nbelieve as many as 10,000 Bosnians were systematically murdered.\n  At the end of 1995, we sent in troops to keep the warring parties \napart and try to have a peace which was put together at Dayton. We said \nthat we would be there for a year at the end of 1995. At the end of \n1996, the President said that it would be June 1998, and the Secretary \nof Defense was very clear that we would set the mission and we would \nset the timetable.\n  What the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is now trying to do is \nsay, once again, we expect that timetable to be fair warning to \neveryone of what our intentions are. I think it is very necessary for \nthe Senate to speak on this, Mr. President, because we are seeing an \nalarming mission creep happening in that country as we speak.\n  I think our allies in NATO have every right to go forward with the \nmissions which they have laid out. The mission of the United States has \nbeen made very clear, that if a war criminal is there in front of us, \nof course, we would capture that person. But we committed, and it has \nbeen said as late as this week by both General Joulwan and Wes Clark, \nwho is the incoming head of NATO, that our mission would not be to go \nout and capture the war criminals, not because we don't think they \nshould be captured--of course they should--and the responsibility\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\nunder Dayton for that is with the parties, it is with the Bosnian \nGovernment. I think we should do everything we can to help provide a \nframework for the capturing of these people, but American troops should \nnot be part of that kind of effort, because we are the targets. We are \nthe superpower. I want us to be helpful, to bring peace to Bosnia, and \nI want those people who committed those atrocities to be brought to \njustice. It is unthinkable that within the last 2 years we would have \nseen the kind of atrocities that were perpetrated by those indicted at \nThe Hague who were representing the Bosnian Serbs. So I want those \npeople to be captured. I think it is important that they be brought to \njustice.\n  But, Mr. President, if we are going to be part of any such operation, \nit is incumbent on this administration to come back to Congress and \nchange the mission rather than having a mission creep, such as we saw \nin Somalia where we were not aware that we had changed the mission from \nfeeding starving children to capturing a warlord, and it cost us 18 \nRangers, because we are different. Our people who came back from \nSomalia said that when our troops would go with others down the streets \nof Somalia, the people would not be hostile to the Turkish troops, they \nwould not be hostile to other troops, but when the Americans came \nforward, the hostilities would erupt.\n  We are a major superpower in the world. We are the only superpower \nprobably that has a history of not being aggressive toward trying to \ntake over other governments. We want to be a beacon for what is good in \nthe world. So I think it is important that we are helpful to our allies \nwithout being in every firefight. I hope that we can set a standard and \na mission that will uphold those principles, that we are the beacon of \nthe world for what is good. I hope we can come to a bipartisan \nagreement that will assure that our mission is clear. That is why I \nhope that we can work with the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator \nFeingold, in his mission to be very clear in speaking as a United \nStates Senate that we are going to keep our word in Bosnia, that we \nwant to help the people there, we want to help them build their \ninfrastructure, we want them to have new factories, we want them to \nhave a peace that is based on economic security. I think the money that \nwe are spending there is very important and perhaps if we are clear in \nour mission and our timetable, we will be able to show that economic \nstability will produce a lasting peace, perhaps better than just \nkeeping warring parties apart.\n\n  I think we have to be very careful as we move forward. I think we \nhave to be clear in our mission, and we have to keep our word. We have \nto do what we say we are going to do, and our mission has been \nreiterated by our Department of Defense and our military leaders. I \ndon't want the Senate to go forward without speaking on this issue. I \nhope that we can work with Senator Feingold, Senator Warner, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Levin, Senator Thurmond, Senator Inhofe, and myself to \nmake sure that our mission is clear and our timetable is set.\n  Senator Lott, our majority leader, has been very clear with all of \nour allies and with us and to the press that the June 30, 1998, \ntimetable is real, and if we don't speak forcefully, then by inches, we \ncould change a mission that would be dangerous to our troops and, most \nimportant, dangerous to the steps we have taken in the Dayton peace \naccords, because if we have a flareup because of a change in mission, \nit could result in tearing down everything we have done so far in that \ncountry. It could decimate the Dayton peace accords if we allow a \nmission creep to go forward, a timetable to get fuzzy that we have not \napproved and have been clear that is what the United States commitment \nis.\n  I hope that we will come to terms on Senator Feingold's amendment. I \nhope that we will come to terms on the mission that are very clear with \nregard to war criminals and what our role will be, such as the \namendment that Senator Warner and I and others are working on with the \nhelp from Senator Lott and Senator McCain, Senator Inhofe.\n  It is very clear that when a superpower speaks, our allies, as well \nas our adversaries, should be able to count on our word being good. Our \nword on when we will leave Bosnia should be good. It is June 30, 1998. \nThe President has said so; the Secretary of Defense has said so.\n  So let's make sure we support that and we do everything to prepare \nthat country for peace. Ratcheting up the hostilities is a perilous \ncourse. I hope this Senate will speak for America so that we can remain \nthe beacon of the superpower that does not have a personal interest but \nwants the world to do what is right. That is our mission, and I hope \nthe Senate will speak.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree wholeheartedly with the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Texas. I would like, for a moment, to \nput this in historic perspective, because it was Senator Hutchison and \nI who had a resolution of disapproval in November 1995. We lost that by \nfour votes. I remember so well why we lost that by four votes. We lost \nit because there were several Members who said, ``Well, the President \nand the Secretary of Defense have promised that we are going to be out \nof Bosnia in 12 months, that will be Christmas of 1996.'' So a few of \nthem said, ``I guess that it's all right to go over if we can \naccomplish whatever mission we thought we were going to accomplish by \nthat time.''\n  In preparation for that, I went over to Bosnia in the northeast \nsector. I can remember so well going into the Tuzla area when no \nAmericans were up there, no Americans had been up there, and those who \nwould go ahead to see what we were getting into had not been there yet. \nI talked with General Haukland from Norway who was in charge of the \nnortheast sector for the United Nations in Bosnia. That was the area we \nwere assuming responsibility for.\n  When I told them we were going to be out in 12 months, they all \nstarted laughing. They said we were not going to be out in 12 months. \nHe said, ``You must mean 12 years.'' That is the situation we are in \nnow. It is like putting your hand in water and leaving it in there for \n12 months, taking it out and nothing has changed, it is the same as it \nwas.\n  We have made that commitment. We went in there and didn't come out as \nwe promised. This was not just a projection by saying by December 1996, \nthings should be done and we should be out. It wasn't that at all. The \nPresident said we will be out. In fact, I have statements from our \nSenate Armed Services Committee where the Secretary of Defense said it \nis an absolute. General Shalikashvili said it was an absolute, we will \nbe out of Bosnia by Christmas 1996. Now we are debating about whether \nto be out, not in 12 months, but 2\\1/2\\ years after this thing started.\n\n  The one thing that the distinguished Senator from Delaware did not \nmention is, what are our national security interests that we are there \nfor? It would be nice, it would be wonderful, and it would be \ncompassionate of us if we had the money and the resources to go around \nthe world and go to Ethiopia and go to all these places where they \nwould like to have our help, but we do not have those resources.\n  Now, the problem we have is this. We have a political problem--I \nrecognize that--that anyone who is opposed to getting out on June 30, \n1998, is going to say, ``If we pull out, they're going to start \nfighting again.'' You know what? They are right. But the same argument \ncould be used, Mr. President, if it is 10 years from now. So how long \nis this commitment going to go on?\n  You know what they said in November 1995? They said the cost is going \nto be between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. Now it is passing through \n$6.5 billion. Where is the money going to come from? The money is going \nto come from the defense budget, a defense budget that right now, while \nour distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee has \nput together a very good authorization bill that we have to pass, it is \nstill inadequate, still does not adequately arm America for the threats \nthat face us out there.\n  People who say the cold war is over and there is no threat anymore, I \ncan assure you the threat is much greater\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\nthan it was then during the cold war when we could identify who the \nenemy was and our intelligence knew something about that enemy.\n  So here we are now making a commitment. And how long is it going to \ntake? I can tell you right now, if we do not adhere to the June 30, \n1998 deadline, we are not going to get out until something very bad \nhappens. I suspect that we would still be in Somalia today if it were \nnot for the fact that 18 of our Rangers were brutally murdered and \ntheir nude corpses dragged through the streets in Mogadishu. I do not \nwant that to happen anywhere in the streets of Bosnia.\n\n  So it was not long ago I was in Brussels. I found there were many \nMembers of Congress that were going around whispering to our NATO \nallies, ``Don't worry about it. We won't leave at that time.'' That is \nthe most dangerous thing we could do at this time. We need to draw that \nline and say we are going to be out by that time.\n  We made a mistake. We should have been out by December 1996, as we \npromised, as the President promised, as the Secretary of Defense \npromised, as we promised the American people. We have to keep the \npromise this time and make it June 30. What we do in terms of a \ncommitment for June 30, 1998, right now I am not real sure. But I can \ntell you right now, with every fiber of my being I will fight to make \nsure that our troops are home after June 30 of 1998.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                     Investigating Military Crashes\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes on an \namendment that I offer today with my colleague, Senator Gordon Smith, \ndealing with the tragic crash last November of a C-130 Oregon Air Force \nReserve plane.\n  It is our understanding that the amendment has been cleared with the \nmanagers on both sides of the aisle and will be included in a package \nthat will be offered later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, and colleagues, last November our Nation \nwas shocked by the terrible news that an Air Force Reserve C-130 had \ncrashed off the California coast, killing 10 Oregon reservists. All of \nthe people of our State grieved and rallied to the support of the \nsurviving family members, providing what comfort could be offered at a \ntime of tragedy.\n  Mr. President, when these tragedies occur, the first question must \nbe: What can be done for the families of the victims, and how can it be \npossible to make sure that these tragedies do not happen in the future \nto the sons and daughters of other Americans?\n  What we found in our situation is that the Air Force, when they \nstepped in, was able to offer only limited assistance to the families. \nThe families had extreme difficulty in learning even the most basic \nfacts about the crash and about the subsequent investigation.\n  How would you feel if anxiously awaiting the news you were to first \nlearn important details from television news stories? This is what \nhappened in our home State of Oregon. And it is completely \nunacceptable.\n  What our amendment does, Mr. President, is really two things.\n  It directs the Federal Government to look into the question of using \na different notification process for informing the families in these \ntragedies.\n  As a member of the aviation committee here in the Senate, I have seen \nthat there have been improvements in terms of dealing with these \ntragedies on the civilian side. And I believe it is time to bring more \naccountability, more compassion, and more openness in terms of how the \nfamilies are notified in the instance of tragedies such as the C-130 \nthat took the lives of our constituents.\n  So the first part of our amendment directs the Federal Government to \nlooking into using the process used on the civilian side with respect \nto these crashes such as we had in Oregon.\n  The second part of our amendment directs the Federal Government to \nlook into the way investigations of these accidents are followed up on.\n  Right now, there is a dual-track system. There is one top secret \ninvestigation of a crash that cannot be seen. There is another separate \ninvestigation for public dissemination. And I am of the view that given \nwhat has come to light about the C-130 in the last few weeks, that this \ndual-track investigation, this dual-track process is eroding public \nconfidence in our system of handling these inquiries.\n  I believe that it is time to look at this in a comprehensive way, to \nlift the cloak of secrecy with respect to these investigations, unless \nit involves national security.\n  Under the second part of the amendment that Senator Smith and I offer \ntogether here today, there would be an effort to look into ending the \ndual-track system. Right now, the dual-track system, given all that has \ncome to light about similar problems in the last few weeks, in my view \nerodes public confidence, and it is time for the Federal Government to \nlook at a different kind of system and, in my view, lift the cloak of \nsecrecy unless an investigation does involve national security.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the legislation, \nparticularly the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, and the \nranking Democrat, Senator Levin. They have been extremely helpful to \nSenator Smith and I in going forward on this matter. The people of our \nState are grieving about this, and they want answers. We thank them.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Smith, who has been \nworking with me on this. We have pursued this every step of the way on \na bipartisan basis. I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for his remarks and diligence on this issue.\n  Mr. President, on November 27, 1996, as Senator Wyden has related, a \nPortland-based HC-130 airplane of the 304th Rescue Squadron, with the \ncall sign of ``King 56,'' crashed off the coast of California, killing \n10 of 11 people on board.\n  I read the account of this tragedy, as related by the sole survivor \nof this accident, T. Sgt. Robert Vogel, and I was both moved and proud \nknowing that under extreme stress and knowing of their peril, this \nOregon-based crew performed exactly as trained, and followed procedures \nand worked together until the very end.\n  Almost 8 months has passed since this accident, and still the \nDepartment of Defense officials are unsure of the cause of the \naccident. Never learning the cause of this accident and the risk of \nhaving a similar accident occurring to another C-130 crew is simply \nunacceptable to Senator Wyden and myself. That is why we have asked \nexperts from the National Transportation Safety Board to perform an \nadditional review of the accident investigation and the accident \nprocedures conducted by the Air Force. This review is still in \nprogress.\n  Although the cause of the accident is unknown, what we have learned \nis that there were very unfortunate shortcomings in the way the \nDepartment of Defense dealt with the families of the ``King 56'' crash \nvictims.\n  The shortcomings relate both to the way the Department manages \naccident investigations and the way the Department performs casualty \nnotifications. That is what this amendment by Senator Wyden and myself \nhas intended to address. We are simply asking the Department to \nevaluate its procedures against models used by the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and to report to Congress whether these procedures would \nbe beneficial and should be adopted also for military use.\n  I thank Senator Wyden again for our work together in trying to \ncorrect the shortcomings in the Department of Defense accident process \nand to do a better job assisting the families generally, but \nspecifically those families associated with ``King 56.''\n  I urge the Air Force to continue to question this accident so that \nnone of us in any State has to experience a similar tragedy as Oregon \nhas. Our volunteer men and women in the Armed Services deserve no less.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While the two Senators from Oregon are on the floor, let \nme\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\ncommend them for their amendment and for their sensitivity to families \nthat have to face tragedy which is reflected in this amendment. \nSenators Wyden and Smith are to be strongly commended and, I hope, \nsupported in this amendment. I think we are doing everything we can to \ntry to clear that amendment and see that it is, in fact, adopted, as it \ndeservedly should be.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the present \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 804\n\n   (Purpose: To cap the cost of the F-22 fighter production program)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 804.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of line 21 on page 32, insert the following new \n     subsection:\n       (  ) Limitation on Total Cost of Production.--The total \n     amount obligated or expended for the F-22 production program \n     may not exceed $43,000,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that Senator Coats \nand I have been talking to other Senators about. I think it is agreed \nto by both sides now.\n  It simply says, regarding the F-22 fighter plane, the day before \nyesterday the Air Force said they would build the F-22 fighter, 339 \nplanes, for $43 billion. We have spent so far a little over $18 billion \nin research and development of that plane.\n  Senator Coats, in the Armed Services Committee, got a provision put \nin that $18 billion--they have not spent that much yet but that is what \nis anticipated to be spent on research and development. Senator Coats \nput an amendment in the bill to make that a cap, $18 billion. This \namendment would put a $43 billion cap on the production of 339 \nairplanes.\n  As I say, that simply says exactly what the Air Force says it would \ntake to do it. I think it is a very healthy amendment. I think it is \none that serves the taxpayers well, will serve us well and the \ncontractors well. It is a commitment they are making and we are simply \ncodifying that in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Arkansas has mentioned, \nwe have been discussing this not only with each other but with other \nMembers who have an interest in this particular subject. We think it \nmakes a lot of sense on our side.\n  The Air Force has specified in testimony before us and in a public \nstatement that they believe, with the adjustments that Senator Cohen \nhas made and the QDR has made in terms of the total number of planes to \nbe built, they can meet the cost projection. It makes a great deal of \nsense, I think, for the Congress to say we encourage you very, very \nstrongly--in fact, we will put language in to give that encouragement--\nto meet that cost.\n  If we are going to have a viable tactical modernization program in \nthe future, given the realities of the budget that we have to deal with \nour entire defense structure, we have to set realistic cost caps on how \nmuch we will spend. If we don't do that, we will run into problems that \nwe have run into before, as in B-2 and other modernization programs, \nand we jeopardize the entire tactical air modernization program as well \nas funding for other aspects of our national security.\n  I think this makes perfect sense because we have something here that \nsimply ratifies what the Air Force has said they can already do. They \nhave assessed this. They said they can do it. They are working with a \ncontractor to work out an agreement to do this. We are saying, ``Amen. \nThis is what you need to do and we will urge you and support you in \nthis effort.''\n  I commend the Senator from Arkansas for his amendment. We have worked \ntogether, and I believe there is agreement across the aisle that we \nought to go forward with this. I think we should do just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 804) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COATS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman, Mr. Thurmond, \nand I, and the distinguished ranking member, together with others, have \nbeen working to resolve a draft that I hope will be an amendment in the \nsecond degree to the underlying amendment by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, which, as I understand it, from the distinguished \nranking member, is now acceptable in form and, therefore, I will \nentertain the remarks of the distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 802, As Modified Further\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send a modification of my second-degree \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify the \namendment, and the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 802), as modified further, is as follows:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A FOLLOW-ON FORCE FOR \n                   BOSNIA\n\n       The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) U.S. military forces were deployed to Bosnia as members \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     Implementation Forces (IFOR) to implement the military \n     aspects of the Dayton Agreement.\n       (2) The military aspects of the Dayton Agreement were being \n     successfully implemented.\n       (3) Following the recommendation of the Secretary General \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on December 11, \n     1996, to extend the presence of NATO forces in Bosnia until \n     June 1998 so that progress could be achieved in implementing \n     the civil aspects of the Dayton Agreement, the President \n     announced his decision to extend the presence of United Stats \n     forces in Bosnia to participate in the NATO Stabilization \n     Force (SFOR) until June 1998.\n       (4) The cost of U.S. participation in operations in Bosnia \n     from 1992 through June 1998 is estimated to exceed $7 \n     billion.\n       (5) The President and the Secretary of Defense have stated \n     that United States forces are to be withdrawn from Bosnia by \n     June 1998.\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States ground combat forces should not \n     participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     after June 1998;\n       (2) the European Security and Defense Identity, which, as \n     facilitated by the Combined Joint Task Forces concept, \n     enables the Western European Union, with the consent of the \n     North Atlantic Alliance, to assume political control and \n     strategic direction of NATO assets made available by the \n     Alliance, is an ideal instrument for a follow-on force for \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (3) if the European Security and Defense Identity is not \n     sufficiently developed or is otherwise deemed inappropriate \n     for such a mission, a NATO-led force without the \n     participation of United States ground combat forces in \n     Bosnia, may be suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina;\n       (4) the United States may decide to appropriately provide \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force, including command and control, intelligence, \n     logistics, and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in the \n     region\n       (5) the President should inform our European NATO allies of \n     this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly \n     urge them to undertake preparations for a Western European \n     Union-led or NATO-led force as a follow-on force to the NATO-\n     led Stabilization Force if needed to maintain peace and \n     stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and\n       (6) The President should consult with the Congress with \n     respect to any support to be\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\n     provided to a Western European Union-led, or NATO-led follow-\n     on force in Bosnia after June 1998.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Reed, McCain, Thurmond, Byrd, and Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might interject, perhaps it could be \nvoted on and then the Senator can make his remarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to have the amendment adopted first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The amendment (No. 802), as modified further, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment has the same language as the \noriginal second-degree amendment in almost all respects but a few \nrelatively minor ones. It is a sense-of-the-Congress resolution. It is \nnot a funding cutoff. It is a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that our \nground forces should be out of Bosnia in June 1998. It has the same \nlanguage as last night relative to the possible support for a European \nfollow-on force, either through the European Security and Defense \nIdentity, which is part of NATO, or in some other kind of a NATO-led \nforce, but without the participation of the U.S. ground combat forces.\n  It adds a provision at the end that the President should consult with \nthe Congress with respect to any support to be provided to such a \nWestern European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on force in Bosnia after \nJune 1998. And then there are some findings in front that are factual \nfindings before the sense-of-the-Congress language that is the heart of \nlast night's and this second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, very briefly, we should send a message that our troops \non the ground in Bosnia will be out by next June. That is the policy of \nthe administration. We should support that mission description. We \nshould do so in a way that will not undermine the goals of Dayton, or \nundermine the flexibility of our commanders in the field. The funding \ncutoff was too rigid, too inflexible, and too far in advance. So this \napproach was adopted.\n  General Shalikashvili and Secretary Cohen sent us a letter on July 9 \nthat, in two sentences, reflects the spirit and heart of my second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Part of that letter reads as follows: ``We remain committed to a June \n1998 withdrawal date.'' That is Secretary Cohen and General \nShalikashvili speaking. The next line also is reflected in this sense-\nof-the-Congress resolution: ``However, we strongly oppose a statutorily \nmandated withdrawal of the United States forces from the NATO-led \nStabilization Force by that date or, indeed, any specific date.'' It \npoints out that, our forces must be able to proceed with a minimum risk \nto U.S. personnel: legislating their redeployment schedule would \ncompletely change the dynamic on the ground and could undercut troop \nsafety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter from General \nShalikashvili and Secretary Cohen be printed into the Record at this \ntime.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: Eighteen months ago the bloodiest \n     conflict Europe had seen since World War II raged in Bosnia. \n     With United States leadership, the Parties to that conflict \n     agreed in December 1995 to cease hostilities. Today, NATO is \n     helping to maintain this U.S.-brokered peace, a peace that \n     provides a secure environment for political reconciliation \n     and economic reconstruction. The four-year long cycle of \n     violence has been broken, the warring factions have been \n     separated and an enforceable boundary between them has been \n     established. These successes have reinvigorated the NATO \n     Alliance and have reestablished America's leadership.\n       Notwithstanding these successes, legislation setting a \n     fixed date for withdrawal of U.S. forces is expected to be \n     considered by the Senate. We urge the Senate to reject this \n     legislation and we request your support. We remain committed \n     to a June 1998 withdrawal date. However, we strongly oppose a \n     statutorily mandated withdrawal of the United States forces \n     from the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) by that date or, \n     indeed, any specific date. A fixed withdrawal date will \n     constrict U.S. commander's flexibility, encourage our \n     opponents and undermine the important psychological advantage \n     U.S. troops enjoy. Our forces must be able to proceed with a \n     minimum of risk to U.S. personnel; legislating their \n     redeployment schedule would completely change the dynamic on \n     the ground and could undercut troop safety. Finally, \n     legislative action of this nature on a matter of European \n     security could very well undermine the cohesion of the NATO \n     Alliance.\n       We are committed to full consultation with the Congress on \n     our deployment in Bosnia. We urge the Senate to reject \n     attempts to legislate any mandatory date for withdrawal from \n     Bosnia.\n           Sincerely,\n     John M. Shalikashvili,\n       Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     William S. Cohen,\n       Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Feingold, \nwhose initiative it was that put us on the path to making a statement \nto sending a message about congressional intent, which this amendment \nreflects. Even though there is no funding cutoff, as I believe there \nshould not be, there should be a strong statement as to what \ncongressional intent is at this time and under these circumstances. And \nthis second-degree amendment that I offered last night, and have \nslightly modified again, which has now been adopted, is a bipartisan \namendment; it always has been.\n  Senator McCain has been active in this. Senator Reed from Rhode \nIsland, my first cosponsor, has been a very, very strong active person \nin the debate of this issue. I want to also express my particular \ngratitude to Senator Reed of Rhode Island for his constant involvement \nand participation and help in drafting this language.\n  With that, I thank Senator Warner, as always, for his work in trying \nto bring people together. My good chairman, Senator Thurmond, as \nalways, is helpful in trying to resolve these issues. And the two \nleaders have been very active as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for his \nremarks.\n  I was simply acting on behalf of the distinguished chairman in \nputting this matter together and reconciling the differences. But I \nwish the Record to reflect that the Senator from Virginia, on the voice \nvote, voted in the negative.\n  Mr. President, I have consistently opposed the deployment of United \nStates ground troops to Bosnia. In December 1995, prior to the initial \ndeployment of U.S. ground troops, I voted against the deployment on \nthree separate occasions. I have stated repeatedly that, in my view, \nthere is no vital United States national security interest at stake in \nBosnia that justifies putting United States ground troops in harm's \nway.\n  Having said that, I do not believe that the Bosnia amendments that we \nare voting on this afternoon are the right way to send the message to \nthe administration that we do not support its Bosnia policy.\n  As a general matter, I do not believe it is a good idea to set \ndeadlines for a military operation. I have criticized the \nadministration for setting Bosnia deadlines, and I do not believe the \nCongress should now validate that approach.\n  I also feel very strongly that it is the President's constitutional \nright and duty to decide when U.S. troops should be deployed on a \nmilitary operation, and when those troops should be withdrawn.\n  Although I do not support the President's Bosnia policy, and I remain \nof the opinion that that part of the world is not in the United States \nvital national interest, we have made a $7 billion dollar investment in \nBosnia. A precipitous withdrawal could jeopardize that investment.\n  Mr. President, last evening I had the opportunity to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Michigan on this issue. I wanted to take \nthis opportunity this afternoon to further explain the reasons for my \nvotes on these Bosnia amendments.\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\n  I urge other Senators who are anxious to speak, if we could be brief. \nI believe I am authorized to say on behalf of the distinguished \nchairman of the committee and the majority leader, indeed, the ranking \nmember, that we are very close to final passage. It is our hope and \nexpectation with the resolution of one matter, which the leadership of \nthe Senate is now addressing, that we might be able to proceed to final \npassage within maybe 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, very briefly, I commend the Senator from \nMichigan and the Senator from Virginia and my colleagues who have \nproposed the second-degree amendment. I also commend the Senator from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, for focusing our attention on this very \ncritical issue.\n  The danger for an immediate cutoff of funds, I think, is threefold.\n  First, essentially demoralizing our troops. It would be very \ndifficult for them to understand that we have cut off funds now for an \noperation that is extending into June 1998. In effect, it would be like \nthe difference between knowing that your lease expires in June 1998 and \ngetting the eviction notice. Cutting off of funds is very close to \nbeing evicted. I don't think our troops will understand that.\n  Second, it would paralyze our efforts to construct a follow-on force \nby our European allies, a force that would not contain American troops \nbut a force that would be necessary to maintain the peace in Bosnia. If \nwe were to announce today a cutoff of funds, I believe we would have no \nchance to construct this follow-on force by our European allies.\n  Finally, I think we embolden those force elements who are resisting \nwithin Bosnia. This would be the message, that we are leaving, \ncategorically, that there will be nothing to replace it, and that idea \ncan only lead to further violence.\n  So I believe the best approach is the one that has been adopted in \nthe second-degree amendment. And that is to, once again, reiterate our \nstrong commitment to a withdrawal date by June 1998, but to give the \ntime--and also to give the impetus--to develop a follow-on force, a \nnon-American follow-on force, and support that force, and to continue \nto build on the structure of peace that is emerging today and that we \nhope will continue in the former Yugoslavia.\n  I commend again all of my colleagues who are working on this effort.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that the proponents of the modified \nBosnia amendment have managed to work out a compromise, and I think, in \nfact, the changes that were made on the modification strengthened the \nsecond-degree amendment, made it stronger and tough, which, I think, is \nvery appropriate here.\n  While my original amendment would have prohibited the use of funds \nfor the deployment of ground troops in Bosnia, I was willing to accept \nthe sense-of-the-Congress language because I think it is vitally \nimportant that the Congress send a signal about our views on this \nmission during consideration of this bill, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I introduced this amendment in the first place because I felt it was \ncritical that we debate this issue at this time. Frankly, I think it \nwould have been somewhat irresponsible not to have any debate about the \nBosnian involvement in the context of the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  As I indicate by my underlying amendment, I would greatly prefer a \nhard statutory requirement that the administration stick to its stated \nend date of June 30, 1998. That is, in fact, what the other body did. \nThat is what the House has already done. The House voted 278 to 148 to \nlimit the use of funds after that date. The House version and the \nmodification to my amendment speak to the same goal. The Congress wants \nto see this mission end. Our main differences lay in the mechanism to \nachieve that goal. But when these two versions get to conference later \nthis year, the conferees will have to resolve these differences.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the conference will include the \nstrongest possible language with regard to this issue. We have taken an \nimportant step today toward terminating the Bosnian mission and \nbringing home our men and women.\n  I am delighted to have the support from so many Members on both sides \nof the aisle for my efforts in this area. I want to especially thank \nthe Senators from Michigan and Rhode Island for their work, and the \nstrong and consistent support of the Senator from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, who has been working with me on this important matter all \nalong.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nWisconsin for his courage in pursuing this matter. I want to thank the \nSenators from Michigan, from Arizona, from South Carolina, from Rhode \nIsland, and from Oklahoma who are working on this to make sure that we \nhave something that everyone can support. I think it is a very strong \nmessage to the administration that sets out the concerns of the Senate. \nI think with what the House did on this issue, it is going to be very \nclear that Congress expects a June 30 exit date for the United States. \nI think, certainly, if something occurs, that we should be able to \ndiscuss after that time, but I think if we plan from today, we are \ngiving plenty of notice to everyone what our intentions are.\n  I think the most important issue that we must address in the next \nyear is the issue that was promised to Senator Dole and Senator McCain \nby the President. That is that there would be arming and training of \nthe police force, of the Bosnians, so that they would be able to have a \nsense of order in their country when the NATO forces would withdraw. I \nam concerned that that training and arming is not taking place, and \nthat we may come upon the June 30 deadline for our exit and they won't \nbe fully supplied with policemen and with the armed services that will \nbe able to keep the peace. We have a year to correct that. I hope that \nthe administration will make sure that our word is kept, that we would \nhave a good solid police force that would be able to keep the peace in \nBosnia after June 30, 1998.\n  But I think the sense of the Senate provides for other options, other \nalternatives, as we have stated in the sense of the Senate, that if, in \nfact, it is not finally a peaceful situation, that the United States \ncould leave and perhaps a NATO force without the United States could \nstay. And we are going to be there in a support role. We have always \nbeen there in a support role for peacekeeping.\n  But I think we must keep our word. The Senate has spoken. The House \nhas spoken, and now is the time for the administration to hear the \nmessage and get along with the business of getting an exit strategy, \nputting these people in control of their government, giving them the \ntraining that they need to be able to sustain that peace themselves.\n  I appreciate very much the very bipartisan support for this sense of \nthe Senate. I hope that the administration will hear our words and \nbegin the strategy for the June 1998 exit of U.S. troops.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, one of the most difficult and intractable \nproblems facing the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization [NATO] is the civil war in the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. In recent years, we have witnessed mass murder and \ngenocide on a scale not seen in Europe since the Holocaust. We have \nalso been concerned that this conflict could spill over into \nneighboring countries, which would force NATO to intervene under much \nworse circumstances.\n  The U.S. provided the crucial leadership to negotiate the Dayton \npeace accords, which called for NATO forces to separate the warring \nfactions, and for democratic elections to be held, as a basis for a \npermanent peace in Bosnia. As a result of our efforts, fighting has \nended, and the first tentative steps towards peace have been taken.\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\n  We have just started down this path to peace, however, after more \nthan five years of war. Our early efforts have not erased the memories \nof concentration camps and mass murder. Building democratic \ninstitutions in such an environment is fraught with road blocks. It is \neasy for the foes of peace to beat the drum beat of war, and plunge \nBosnia back into a renewed cycle of fighting and genocide.\n  The United States has clearly stated our intention to withdraw in \nJune of 1998. The Administration is fully aware that a long-term and \nopen-minded commitment will not be supported by Congress.\n  Nonetheless, if the amendment offered by Senator Feingold were \nadopted by the Senate, it would send a loud and unmistakable signal to \nthe worst elements of the Bosnian factions to begin to prepare for war. \nSenator Feingold's amendment would terminate funding for U.S. \nparticipation in Bosnia on June 30, 1998, with no discussion of what \nwould follow in the vacuum left after our withdrawal. Indeed, a Senate \nvote in favor of Senator Feingold's amendment would make it more \ndifficult for the best elements in Bosnia--those who legitimately \ndesire to work for peace--to continue to advance their efforts. The \npressures to prepare for war will likely overtake and silence any \nfactions which wish to work for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. \nAt the present time, the various factions have eleven more months to \nhold elections and prepare for the gradual end of the direct \ninvolvement of NATO troops. These efforts will, for all intents and \npurposes, rapidly come to an end if the Senate openly votes to \ncompletely get out of Bosnia on June 30, 1998.\n  The second degree amendment offered by Senator Levin, of which I am a \ncosponsor, recognizes that it is likely that a NATO follow-on force \nwill have to remain in Bosnia after June 1998, while stating that U.S. \nground combat forces should not participate in such a force. This \ninvolves the replacement of U.S. ground combat forces with those of our \nEuropean partners in NATO. The Administration should exercise very \nstrenuous efforts to convince our allies to take up the ground combat \nrole by next June. It calls upon the President to urge our European \nallies to step up to the plate, and undertake preparations for a \nWestern European Union-led or NATO-led force, to assume responsibility \nfor the ground situation in Bosnia after June 1998. The second degree \namendments supports a U.S. provision of needed American command and \ncontrol, intelligence, and logistics support for such a follow-on NATO \noperation. This will allow NATO to continue to build democratic \ninstitutions within Bosnia to continue, and hopefully prevent an \narbitrary return to bloodshed and war. It is a wiser course and one \nwhich provides a logical conclusion to U.S. efforts in the region.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns of my \ncolleagues on this issue. I think we all agree that there are few more \nimportant foreign policy issues facing the United States then ensuring \nthat the Bosnian peace process succeeds.\n  I am pleased with the effort has been made by Senators on both sides \nof this issue to see that we did not need to vote on a cut-off of funds \nfor our ground forces in Bosnia.\n  However, it is precisely because I want to see the peace process \nsucceed that I feel that I must nevertheless voice my concerns about \nthis amendment.\n  It is my belief that our presence in Bosnia must be one without any \npreconditions as to time. We must stay long enough to make sure that \nthe job we started gets done, and gets done right.\n  Any effort to set a date to cut off funds, as Senator Feingold \nproposed in his amendment, or which suggests a firm date for the \nwithdrawal of all U.S. ground combat troops, as Senator Levin's second \ndegree amendment to Senator Feingold's amendment does, telegraphs U.S. \npolicy to those who would oppose us, and to those who oppose the \nimplementation of the Dayton Accords.\n  I do not think that there is a single Member of this Chamber that \ndoes not wish that 1 year had been sufficient time for the Dayton \nAccords to be implemented, and that U.S. troops were not still needed \nin the Balkans.\n  But the simple fact of the matter is that there are aspects of the \nDayton Accords which have not yet been fully implemented--aspects which \nrequire a little more time if they are going to have a chance to take \nroot.\n  Earlier this year voter registration began for the municipal \nelections scheduled for Bosnia this September. True, I wish that \nconditions existed to hold these elections last year when they were \noriginally planned. But those conditions did not exist then; they do \nnow.\n  What sort of signal will we send to those who support peace and \ndemocracy in Bosnia if, even as they are preparing for municipal \nelections, we are telling them that the troops who safeguard the peace \nprocess and democracy are on the way out?\n  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and his Party of Democratic \nAction have formed a coalition with a number of opposition parties to \nseek broad-minded support in the municipal elections. This amendment \nwill cut his legs out from under him, and give strength to those who \nwould like to see Bosnia destroyed.\n  This fall Serbia will hold a presidential election. It will be a \ndifficult campaign for Milosevic's opponents, but not an impossible \none. That Milosevic's grip on power might be lessened would have been \ninconceivable a year ago. It is not inconceivable now.\n  But setting a date for cutting off funds for U.S. forces or for the \nwithdrawal of all U.S. ground combat troops without giving the \nPresident flexibility will all but guarantee Milosevic's re-election.\n  I do not believe that supporters of this amendment intend it as a \nboost to Milosevic's campaign, but that is exactly what it will do.\n  Right now in the Republika Srpska there is a power struggle going on \nbetween President Plavsic and pro-Karadzic hardliners based in Pale.\n  How this struggle will play out, and whether the more moderate \nsupporters of President Plavsic can retain control, or whether the pro-\nKaradzic forces will seize control of the Republic Srpska has profound \nimplications for the future of peace and stability in the Balkans.\n  The pro-Karadzic forces, the Pale hardliners, the war criminals, have \nadopted a wait it out strategy. They think that the United States will \nbe withdrawing next year without any follow-on force to SFOR. If they \njust bide their time, they believe, come next summer they will be able \nto overturn Dayton and destroy any hope for Bosnia.\n  This amendment will tell them that they have won.\n  I do not think that giving support to the Pale hardliners is the \nintent of the supporters of this amendment, but that is exactly what \nthis amendment does.\n  It will tell them that they are right; all they have to do is wait, \nand that the United States will leave without fully implementing \nDayton, without following through on our commitment to create a secure \nand stable Bosnia.\n  After we have done so much we cannot abandon Bosnia now.\n  It is true there are still unsettled issues with refugees, with \nreconstruction, and with indicted war criminals in the \nformer Yugoslavia. And again, I would not argue that we did not want or \nhope that these matters would have been taken care of by now.\n\n  But having said that, setting a date for a troop pullout will not \nhelp us to resettle refugees, to speed economic reconstruction, or to \napprehend indicted war criminals.\n  Instead, it will send a message to refugees that they cannot hope to \nbe safely resettled; to those trying to rebuild their businesses that \nthey should not bother; and to war criminals that they only have to \nremain in hiding a little bit longer, and then they will be free to \ncommit their ghastly crimes once again.\n  The continued presence of U.S. forces is critical in keeping the \npeace process on track. And the fact of the matter is that the United \nStates-led peacekeeping force is the glue that holds peace process in \nthe former Yugoslavia together.\n  Those who suggest we set a date certain for a troop pullout argue \nthat we have already spent a lot of money pursuing peace in the \nBalkans, and that to continue to stay will cost us even more.\n  But to set a date to pull out now will all but guarantee that the \npeace process will break down, and that all that\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\nwe have invested in Bosnia in the past year and a half will be wasted.\n  Establishing a date certain for a United States pullout will set in \nmotion a clock whereby the forces of nationalism and ethnic hatred in \nthe former Yugoslavia will begin to plan for renewed war.\n  And, if war breaks out again in the Balkans and spreads elsewhere in \nthe region, it will be far more costly for the U.S. to have to \nintervene once again than if we retain the flexibility to maintain our \npresence.\n  Those who suggest we need to set a date for a United States pullout \nfrom Bosnia also argue that without this clear end-date there is danger \nof mission creep, and of Bosnia becoming a quagmire.\n  Just the opposite. Anyone who has paid attention to what has happened \nwith the NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia for the past year and a half \ncan only come to one conclusion: SFOR has a clear mandate. There has \nbeen no mission creep and there is not going to be any mission creep.\n  In fact, concern for the safety of our troops would dictate that we \nallow the military to continue with planning based on their current \nmission and deployment, and to pull out on a schedule dictated by the \nmilitary facts on the ground without having the Senate dangerously \ncompromise their position by telegraphing our plans and intentions.\n  In addition, this abrupt U.S. departure will almost certainly doom \nany effort to create some follow-on force or mechanism to insure the \npeace process continues. Again, I wish it were not the case. I wish \nthat our European allies would act in a more decisive way without \nUnited States having to take the lead--but we are dealing with reality \nhere.\n  I fully support the spirit of Senator Levin's amendment: I too \nbelieve that Europe should take greater responsibility for Europe, and \nthat a SFOR follow-on force led by Europe in the context of the \nEuropean Security and Defense Identity should be the next phase of \npeacekeeping in Bosnia.\n  But if the United States precipitously pulls out of Bosnia our \nEuropean NATO allies may be unable to lead a follow-on force. What if \nUnited States ground combat troops are required in Bosnia until August \n1, 1998, or even December 1, 1998, to effect a smooth, safe, \ntransition?\n  Indeed, under the dynamic set in motion by this amendment, if Europe \nwanted to lead such a follow-on mission in Bosnia with United States \nsupport it would be reasonable of them to question whether or not we \nwould be there to support them.\n  Do we really want to set a precedent here of giving our friends and \nallies reason to question whether the United States will be there to \nsupport them when they need our assistance? To send that sort of \nmessage would have tremendous implications--and none of them good--for \nU.S. interests throughout the globe.\n  It is my hope, and I think that of many of my colleagues, that a \nEuropean-led follow-on force to SFOR will take the lead in maintaining \nthe peace in Bosnia come next June. But that follow-on force may \nrequire some United States military support and assistance, on the \nground, in Bosnia.\n  This amendment, by preventing the United States from supporting our \nEuropean allies, will destroy any chance that such a European-led force \ncould come into being.\n  Both the President and the Secretary of Defense have suggested that \nUnited States forces will be able to pull out of Bosnia by June 30, \n1998. There is no reason to doubt their word or intention.\n  But, as my colleagues surely know, the unexpected may occur. There \nmay be good reason to keep some or even a substantial United States \nforce in Bosnia past next June. Or, there may be reason to pull our \nforces out sooner. The bottom line here is that we cannot and should \nnot put our military in a disadvantageous position by setting a date \ncertain for a pull out.\n  It is my belief that if we continue to work the peace process, and \ngive the President the discretion that, as Commander in Chief, he \ndeserves, by the time United States forces prepare to leave Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, the peace process will have been given sufficient time to \ndevelop deep, sustainable, roots.\n  To adopt this amendment will risk killing the peace process and all \nbut condemns Bosnia to further bloodshed.\n  Again, I would like to extend my appreciation to my colleagues on all \nsides of this issue who have worked hard to find a compromise. \nNevertheless, I feel that I must I oppose this amendment and would urge \nmy colleagues to oppose it as well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to state for the record that \nalthough I voted for the Levin substitute amendment, I did so as one of \nthe second choices that I described in my statement earlier today.\n  The Levin substitute amendment, in my opinion, was an improvement \nover the Feingold amendment in that rather than cutting off funds for \nUnited States ground forces in Bosnia after June 30, 1998, it puts our \nNATO European Allies on notice that we expect them to provide the post-\nSFOR ground forces, while we provide command and control, intelligence, \nlogistics, and if necessary a ready reserve force in the region.\n  My first choice, as I said earlier, would have been to give President \nClinton freedom of movement for the next 12 months to carry out the \nunfulfilled portions of the Dayton accords and to negotiate appropriate \ninternational security arrangements for Bosnia and Herzegovina after \nJune 30, 1998.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 759, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that amendment 759, as \namended, has not been agreed to.\n  Is there objection to the amendment? Hearing none, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 759), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment, if I could \nask?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Reed amendment \nNo. 772.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 805\n\n(Purpose: To achieve savings in the cost of the CVN-77 nuclear aircraft \n                            carrier program)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 805.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 122, add the following:\n       (c) Limitation of Costs.--(1) The Secretary of the Navy \n     shall structure the procurement of CVN-77 nuclear aircraft \n     carrier and manage the program so that the CVN-77 may be \n     acquired for an amount not to exceed $4,600,000,000.\n       (2) The Secretary of the Navy may adjust the amount set \n     forth in paragraph (1) for the program by the following \n     amounts:\n       (A) The mounts of outfitting costs and post-delivery costs \n     incurred for the program.\n       (B) The amounts of increases or decrease in costs \n     attributtal to economic inflation after September 30, 1997.\n       (C) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs \n     attributable to compliance with changes in Federal, State, or \n     local laws enacted after September 30, 1997.\n       (D) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs of the \n     program that are attributable to new technology built into \n     the CVN-77 aircraft carrier, as compared to the technology \n     built into the baseline design of the CVN-76 aircraft \n     carrier.\n       (E) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs \n     resulting from changes the Secretary proposes in the funding \n     plan of the Smart Buy proposal on which the projected savings \n     are based.\n       (3) The Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees annually, at the same time \n     as the submission of the budget under section 105(a) of title \n     31,\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\n     United States Code, any changes in the amount set forth in \n     paragraph (1) that he has determined to be associated with \n     costs referred to in paragraph (2).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my amendment would establish a cost cap on \nthe cost of the next nuclear aircraft carrier, and ensure that we \nachieve the savings that we expect from beginning to fund the ship next \nyear, which is a number of years earlier than planned.\n  Mr. President, the committee bill authorizes $345 million in fiscal \nyear 1998 to begin incrementally funding construction of the next \nNimitz class nuclear aircraft carrier, CVN-77, based on claims of cost \nsavings by the shipbuilder. The Committee did not adopt safeguards to \nensure that the taxpayers actually receive the savings on which this \nunusual action is based. Those are the safeguards which are contained \nin this amendment.\n  Let me just review the bidding. The Navy budget projects a total cost \nof $5.2 billion for CVN-77, funded normally--that is, with advance \nprocurement of $695 million in fiscal year 2000 and the remaining $4.5 \nbillion of full funding in fiscal year 2002.\n  The shipbuilder--Newport News Shipbuilding--has come forward with a \nproposal to save $600 million by having the Government provide funding \nfor CVN-77 earlier than the Navy budget proposes it. This claim has \nbeen repeated over the last 2 months in a highly visible media \ncampaign.\n  The shipbuilder claims that we could buy the CVN-77 under their \nalternative for $4.6 billion--a savings of $600 million --if we provide \nincremental funding over the next 5 years, starting with $345 million \nin fiscal year 1998.\n  I have been very skeptical in the past of providing phased or \nincremental funding for defense programs. The normal method of funding \nmajor defense procurement programs is to provide full funding in one \nlump sum in the year in which the program is started, with the \nexception of certain limited long-lead items which are funded through \nadvance procurement. As a general rule, incrementally funding major \nweapons programs reduces visibility over total program costs, and can \nlead to a ``buy in'' situation in which it becomes more difficult to \ncontrol total program costs and future cost growth.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we should try to achieve savings in \nDefense modernization wherever we can, particularly savings of the \nmagnitude of $600 million. Meeting our modernization goals for the \nmilitary services over the next 10 years within a stable defense budget \nis going to be a significant challenge. We need to look for innovative \nways to save money, and this approach to funding the CVN-77 looks like \nsomething we should do if--and this is the critical if--we really save \nmoney. At the same time, I feel strongly that we must protect the \ninterests of the taxpayer, if we are to take full advantage of the \nopportunity for savings.\n  It will disadvantage the tax payer if we incrementally fund CVN-77 \nwithout the assurances that the reason for doing it--saving dollars--is \nin fact achieved.\n  That's why we should adopt this amendment putting a ceiling on the \ntotal cost of this ship that is in line with what the shipbuilder \npromised.\n  If we don't, we will be in a terrible bargaining position.\n  The amendment puts a limit on the total cost of the next carrier, \nusing the cost cap language that was developed for the Seawolf \nsubmarine as a model. The amendment: establishes a cost cap of $4.6 \nbillion for CVN-77, $600 million below the Navy's budget estimate fully \nfunding this ship in the usual manner; it excludes outfitting and post \ndelivery costs; and it adjusts the cost cap automatically to reflect \nchanges in inflation or costs attributable to compliance with changes \nin Federal, State, or local laws.\n  This amendment adds three important additional provisions:\n  It includes a proviso that allows the Navy to change the cost cap for \nthe ship based on changes in costs that are incurred by inserting new \ntechnology--compared to the previous carrier, CVN-76.\n  It includes a proviso that allows the Navy to change the cost cap for \nthe ship if the funding is changed in later fiscal years from the plan \non which the shipbuilder based his proposed savings.\n  And it includes an annual reporting requirement on changes in the end \ncost of the CVN-77, so there will be visibility into the technology \nimprovement program that will allow the Navy to demonstrate how \ntechnology insertion is causing any substantive changes in the end cost \nof the ship.\n  My bottom line is that, despite my overall concerns about incremental \nor phased funding, I am willing to support this funding approach for \nthe next aircraft carrier, because I believe we can achieve the savings \nunder the phased funding approach. We must, however, have a vehicle to \nguarantee that the Government will achieve the promised savings, which \nis the driving argument for phased funding.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will help guarantee those savings, \nwhile providing room to adjust the price of CVN-77 for the legitimate \nfactors indicated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Chief of Naval Operations has \ndescribed the smart buy proposal as a proposal which has great merit. \nBoth the Navy and the Rand Corp. have verified that the savings claimed \nby the contractor under this plan can indeed be achieved.\n  However, these savings will not be achieved unless the funding \nprofile outlined in the smart buy proposal is carried out, as follows: \nfiscal year 1998, $345 million; fiscal year 1999, $170 million; fiscal \nyear 2000, $875 million; fiscal year 2001, $135 million; and fiscal \nyear 192002, $3,075 million. Therefore, the Levin amendment before us \nis based on the strong expectation that the administration will provide \nfunding in its annual budget submissions to fully fund CVN-77 in \naccordance with the smart buy proposal, and that the Congress will \nsupport those budget submissions with annual appropriations.\n  Without a firm commitment to this program by the Navy--as evidenced \nby including funding for this program in the SCN account for each year \nfrom fiscal year 1999 to 2002--the $600 million in savings to the \nAmerican taxpayer could well be lost. We expect the Navy to follow \nthrough on its commitment and to achieve the savings it has represented \nto be possible.\n  Likewise, I know my colleague agrees with me that the savings cannot \nbe achieved if the Congress does not authorize and appropriate the \namounts set forth in the smart buy proposal. Although the amendment \nbefore us contains a mechanism to deal with the failure of the Navy to \nprovide the appropriate funding, there is nothing to address problems \ncaused if a future Congress fails to provide adequate funding for this \nprogram. If at some point the Congress does not provide the necessary \nfunding, we will have to revisit the limitation contained in this \namendment and adjust it accordingly. Does the Senator agree that this \nis the course we will follow?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with the Senator from Virginia. The $600 million \nsavings that we all expect to achieve are based upon the funding \nprofile set forth in the smart buy proposal. I will work with the \nSenator from Virginia to ensure that we maintain that funding profile \nand achieve these savings, and I expect the Navy to do the same.\n  If for any reason the Navy fails to include the funding profile in \nits budget request, the amendment that we are offering provides a \nspecific remedy: the funding limitation would remain in place, but \nwould be adjusted to address the impact of the changed funding profile. \nParagraph (2)(E) of the amendment specifies that the limitation will be \nrevised to reflect any adjustments needed to accommodate a change in \nfunding. Would the Senator from Virginia agree that this is the effect \nof this amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am in complete agreement with the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. President, this is a matter on which my distinguished colleague \nand I have worked for some time. I do not feel that it is necessary to \nplace these financial constraints, because this contract, unlike \nothers, has built-in checks and balances. Nevertheless, we have \nreconciled our differences, and to that extent I will go ahead and \naccept his amendment.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 805) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are working--the chairman, the ranking \nmember, and others. I anticipate momentarily a statement from two other \nSenators that could well be the last items other than the adoption of a \nseries of agreed-upon amendments. Pending that, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, together with Senator Smith of New Hampshire, will \naddress the Senate on another matter.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the order at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator needs consent to call up his \namendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 680, as modified\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \ncall up amendment No. 680.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto modify the amendment at this time, and I send such a modification to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment will \nbe so modified.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 680, as modified.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 680), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 336, line 20, strike all after ``SEC. \n     1067.'' through ``(50 U.S.C. 401a).'' on line 3 of page 338 \n     and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     POW/MIA INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n\n       (a) The Director of Central Intelligence in consultation \n     with the Secretary of Defense, shall provide analytical \n     support on POW/MIA matters to all Departments and agencies of \n     the Federal Government involved in such matters. The \n     Secretary of Defense shall ensure that all intelligence \n     regarding POW/MIA matters is taken into full account in the \n     analysis of POW/MIA cases by DPMO.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is a modification mutually arrived at \ntogether with Senator Smith of New Hampshire and Senator McCain in an \neffort to try to improve the intelligence-gathering process with \nrespect to POW/MIA matters, and I thank Senator Smith of New Hampshire \nfor his cooperation and Senator McCain. I think we have strengthened \nthe ability of the process to guarantee that intelligence is going to \nbe properly and fully vetted in the process but at the same time be \nable to continue the cooperative effort that we have achieved over \nthese last years in that process.\n  I think the compromise we have arrived at is a thoughtful one and an \nappropriate one with respect to the best intelligence gathering and \ncontrol. So I think we have served the process well. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I appreciate the help of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts on this matter. We have reached \nagreement. The intent here is to see to it that those who are \ncollecting intelligence on POW/MIA matters both now and in the future \nwould have the opportunity to vet that through the intelligence \ncommunity, and we have accomplished that with the compromise language, \nand we accept that language on this side.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we had here a problem between the \nIntelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee. It was \nresolved through intense negotiations in the last few minutes. I thank \nSenator Smith of New Hampshire, who we all know is the leader on this \nissue. His commitment to getting a full resolution not only in the past \nbut in the case of conflicts in the future is well known. I thank \nSenator Kerry for his willingness, obviously, to move forward and \ncomprise.\n  Again, I thank Senator Smith of New Hampshire because I believe that \nthis achieves the goal that he sought and at the same time allows us to \ncome to an agreement here without further acrimony or dissent on this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, and Senator Kerry \nand urge we proceed to finish this off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I do not think there is any further debate. We are ready \nto proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 680), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7227-5", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7250-S7253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION FUNDS FOR CHEMICAL WEAPONS DESTRUCTION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support an amendment \nI have offered to the national Defense authorization for fiscal year \n1998 that sets conditions for continued United States assistance to \nRussia for the purpose of chemical weapons [CW] dismantlement and \ndestruction. I offer this amendment because I am disturbed that--\ndespite the fact that the United States has already provided $150 \nmillion in CW destruction aid to Russia through the Cooperative Threat \nReduction [CTR] Program--we appear no closer today than when we started \nthis endeavor to meeting our core objective of eliminating Russia's \noffensive chemical weapons capability.\n  Instead, Russia has to date failed to demonstrate a commitment--\neither political or financial--to destroying its chemical weapons \ncapability. Russia has not lived up to CW agreements it has signed. It \nhas failed to implement obligations undertaken in the 1990 Bilateral \nDestruction Agreement [BDA], which calls for United States verification \nof the destruction of Russian chemical stocks. And Russia is not \nworking with us to resolve outstanding compliance issues associated \nwith the 1989 bilateral Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding, which \nrequires both sides to fully and accurately account for their \nrespective chemical weapons stockpile. Moreover, Russian ratification \nof the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] remains a distant prospect, \ndespite the fact that one of the principal arguments made in favor of \nUnited States ratification was that it would induce the Russians to do \nthe same.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, as we continue to pour into Russia \nmore and more chemical weapons destruction aid, the Russians continue \nto pour more and more rubles into developing ever more deadly chemical \nweapons. According to press reports, Russia has developed three new \nnerve agents made from chemicals--used for industrial and agricultural \npurposes--which are not covered by the CWC. This development program \nhas been confirmed by a prominent Russian scientist who was jailed for \nrevealing Moscow's continuation of covert chemical weapons production. \nIn addition, Russia continues to modernize its strategic offensive \nforces. According to a recent Hoover Institution study, Russian \nspending on research and development for strategic\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\nweapons has increased sixfold in the last 3 years. They are developing \nan upgraded mobile ICBM; working on miniaturized nuclear warheads; \nbuilding a new class of SLBM-carrying submarines; and constructing \nenormous underground command and control bunkers to protect against a \nnuclear attack by the United States.\n  In light of these ongoing strategic and chemical modernization \nefforts, it is more than reasonable, Mr. President, to question \nseriously Russian claims that they do not have the financial \nwherewithal to destroy their chemical weapons stockpile. It seems to me \nthat United States assistance to Russia for CW destruction has, in \nfact, had the perverse effect of underwriting Russia's offensive \nchemical program. Moreover, the practice of providing unconditioned \nfunding reduces, if not eliminates, any incentive for Russia to set \naside its own resources for matching United States funds. I would note \nthat, while the United States has authorized $150 million for the \npurpose of destroying Russian chemical weapons and nearly half of that \nhas been obligated, Russia has committed only $24 million for \ndestruction of its own CW stocks, but has failed to obligate or spend \nany of this money.\n  My proposed amendment conditions fiscal year 1998 United States \nassistance to Russia for CW destruction--totaling $55 million--to \nRussia's living up to existing agreements concerning destruction and \ndismantlement of its chemical weapons capability. The amendment closely \nparallels the approach taken in the fiscal year 1996 National Defense \nAuthorization, when both Houses of Congress agreed to fence--but not \ncut--Nunn-Lugar funds for CW-related activities until the President \ncertified certain conditions were met. It is also very similar to a \nprovision contained in the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat \nReduction Act of 1997, S. 495, which the Senate approved in April of \nthis year. The intent is to reassure the Russians that--if they are \nserious about getting rid of their chemical weapons--we are fully \nprepared to offer them financial assistance to do so. However, the \namendment is intended to make equally clear that the United States \nCongress does not intend for the American taxpayer to subsidize a \ncontinuing Russian offensive chemical weapons capability.\n  Specifically, the amendment requires the President to certify that \nthree conditions are met before Cooperative Threat Reduction funds for \nCW destruction may be released:\n  First, that the Russians are making reasonable progress toward \nimplementation of the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement [BDA];\n  Second, that the United States has made substantial progress toward \nresolution, to its satisfaction, of outstanding compliance issues \nrelated to the Wyoming MOU and BDA; and\n  Third, that Russia has fully and accurately declared all information \nregarding its chemical weapons programs.\n  If the President cannot certify that these conditions are met, the \nproposed amendment does provide an alternative for releasing funds. In \nsuch a case, the President must however certify that ``the national \nsecurity interests of the United States could be undermined'' by not \ncarrying out the CW destruction activities provided for in the CTR \nProgram.\n  Mr. President, it was my original hope to go beyond what we agreed in \nS. 495, and to send an even stronger message to the Russians that a \nmutually beneficial bilateral relationship requires both parties to \ndemonstrate a firm commitment to live up to agreements already \nundertaken and to work together toward common goals. I am disturbed \nthat, since enactment of S. 495, the CWC has entered into force without \nRussian participation, Russia has failed to renounce its offensive \nchemical warfare program, the Russian Duma has refused to allocate any \nnew funds for CW destruction, and we have not reached any agreement \nunder the CTR Program to cap our own contribution to this endeavor. \nNevertheless, I am satisfied that this amendment sends a signal to the \nRussians and, if enacted into law, I encourage the President and senior \nadministration officials to use this amendment for maximum leverage to \ninduce the Russians to once and for all forswear a offensive chemical \nweapons capability.\n\n\n                      land conveyance at fort dix\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, countless thousands of American \nsoldiers received their basic training at Fort Dix Army Base in my home \nState of New Jersey. However, the 1988 BRAC reassigned the basic-\ntraining mission of Fort Dix into a much more limited training role for \nour reserve forces.\n  The economic impact in the surrounding communities was devastating. \nLocal merchants whose business depended upon business generated by the \nArmy personnel at Fort Dix suddenly saw their consumer base gone along \nwith 3,500 jobs and countless others in the subsequent years.\n  With funding assistance from the Federal Government and the \nBurlington County Department of Economic Development, a new master plan \nwas drafted to reduce the area's reliance on the military and begin \ndevelopment of a downtown shopping area as well as new housing \nfacilities.\n  While the community struggles to re-build, the majority of the land \nformerly occupied by Fort Dix has been moth-balled and sits idle. For \nyears, the community has been negotiating with the Army to acquire a \n35-acre plot of land owned at Fort Dix owned by the Federal Government \nfor use in the downtown development.\n  I am pleased that this transfer now enjoys the support of the Army \nand that an amendment to transfer this 35 acres to the Borough of \nWrightstown along with an additional 5 acres to the New Hanover Board \nof Education for an expected expansion of the school was included in \nH.R. 1119 that recently passed the House of Representatives.\n  I had planned to offer a similar amendment to this legislation but \nafter consultations with subcommittee chairman Inhofe and ranking \nmember Robb I have decided to withdraw the amendment and would instead \nlike to engage in a colloquy with my distinguished colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I know you are familiar with this issue and are \nsympathetic to the plight faced by communities like Wrightsborough who \nhave experienced significant economic difficulties in the wake of base \nclosures. I am confident that based on my conversations with you that \nwhen this legislation goes to conference you and Senator Robb will give \nevery consideration to the merits of this issue and the amendment \nadopted by the House.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Senator Torricelli, for bringing this issue to \nthe attention of the subcommittee. I am sympathetic to the plight of so \nmany of our communities which have had to essentially re-build in the \nwake of base closings and you have my assurance and that of this \nsubcommittee that we will give every consideration of this proposed \nconveyance when it is discussed in the conference.\n  Mr. ROBB. I, too, would like to thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nbringing this issue to our attention and assure you that the \nsubcommittee will review this issue in conference in the context of our \npolicy of not interfering with the BRAC disposal process and that it \nwill receive the consideration it deserves when it is discussed in \nconference.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I would again like to thank Chairman Inhofe and \nRanking Member Robb for their attention to this important issue.\n\n\n                              section 824\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to clarify the intent underlying section \n824 of the Defense Authorization Act. Section 824 does not in any way \naffect or address the issue of the Executive authority that the \nPresident may have to carry out empowerment contracting programs or \nother similar programs that make use of benchmarks and other incentives \nto support various categories of business.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I agree with your understanding. You accurately \ndescribe my view of the intent of section 824.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I concur. That is my understanding as well.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senators for their cooperation.\n\n\n                                  esop\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I recently learned of a dispute between the \nDepartment of Defense and a number of contractors regarding the \nallowability of cost of employee stock ownership plans, known as \nESOP's.\n  According to the contractors. DOD has retroactively changed its \ninterpretation of the relevant accounting in a\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\nmanner that will cost contractors millions of dollars and could drive \nsome of them out of business completely. The contractors also say that \nDOD has improperly applied the standards of a proposed rule even after \nthat proposed rule has been withdrawn.\n  I am concerned about the effect this could have on these companies \nand the employee's retirement plans which could be jeopardized by this \naction.\n  I had intended to attach an amendment to prohibit DOD from applying \nthe terms of the withdrawn rule but because that matter is currently in \nlitigation I will instead withhold that amendment and work this out in \nconference. In discussions with the Senator from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, he expressed concerns about the equity of any retroactive \napplication as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. I share my colleague's concern about this issue and the \npossible impact it could have on employee stock owned companies. I \nunderstand the need to protect the viability of our ESOP companies and \ntheir employees, and will continue to work with them and the Department \nof Defense to resolve this issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. I certainly share his concern \nabout any action by DOD to retroactively apply a new standard, or to \napply the terms of a rule that has been withdrawn.\n  However, the Department of Defense disputes the contractor's \nposition, and says that the issue is currently in litigation. I \nunderstand that the House has included a provision addressing this \nissue in their version of the bill, and I don't think we should lock \nthis in until we have an opportunity to hear out both the contractor \nand the Department.\n  I would be happy to work with Senator Robb on this issue, and if it \nturns out that the Department has retroactively applied a new standard, \nI will fully support the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I share the concerns expressed by Senator Robb and have \nasked the Defense Contract Audit Agency to give me a detailed \nexplanation of their current position on this dispute.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank my colleague from Virginia, the Senator from \nMichigan, and the Senator from Pennsylvania. I will not offer the \namendment at this time, and I look forward to working with them in \nconference.\n\n\n                      proposed expansion of usuhs\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was disappointed to read language in \nthe committee report accompanying the fiscal year 1998 Defense \nauthorization bill which called upon the Uniformed Services University \nof the Health Sciences [USUHS] to propose the construction of an \nadditional building on the USUHS campus. While I fully appreciate such \nlanguage is not binding, the provision is a clear invitation to the \ncontroversial school to expand the physical plant of a program which \nmany already consider to be costly.\n  More particularly, the provision is inconsistent with the view of a \nnumber of Members of Senate and the other body that USUHS not only \nshould not be expanded, but instead should be terminated. That view is \nshared by others as well. The Department of Defense has proposed \nphasing out this school, and proposals to close the school have also \nbeen offered by the Congressional Budget Office [CBO], the Grace \nCommission, and the National Performance Review.\n  Mr. President, USUHS is the most expensive source of physicians for \nour military, according to CBO costing 4 to 10 times as much as other \nsources and supplying only a tiny fraction of the needs of the Pentagon \nfor new physicians--less than 12 percent in 1994.\n  Expanding the physical plant of a program that is already 4 to 10 \ntimes as expensive as alternative sources of physicians for our \nmilitary makes no sense, and is inconsistent with both the increasing \npressure on the Defense Department's budget and our efforts to balance \nthe budget.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Department of Defense to carefully review \nthe non-binding language included in the report accompanying the fiscal \nyear 1998 Department of Defense authorization legislation before it \nmoves to expand a school that cannot justify its current cost to \ntaxpayers.\n\n\n                       Land Conveyance Provisions\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to ask the senior Senator from South \nCarolina, and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nThurmond, and the senior Senator from Michigan, and ranking minority \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, to clarify the \ncommittee's position on land conveyance provisions in the Defense \nauthorization Bill.\n  It is my understanding that the chairman and ranking member oppose \nspecial legislation for the conveyance, at other than fair market \nvalue, of any properties, facilities, or installations which have been \nclosed or realigned under the jurisdiction of the Base Closure and \nRealignment Commission [BRAC] if such legislation would interfere with \nthe statutory disposal process for BRAC properties. Thus, the committee \nhas not included any such conveyances in the fiscal year 1998 Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Further, it is my understanding that the Senate conferees to the \nfiscal year 1998 Department of Defense authorization bill will oppose \nany conveyances of properties, facilities, or installations closed or \nrealigned in the BRAC process if those conveyances would interfere with \nthe BRAC disposal process contained in current law.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The senior Senator from New Jersey's understandings are \ncorrect.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I concur with the chairman.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As the chairman and ranking member are aware, I have \nrequested that the committee include provisions to facilitate \nconveyances to two New Jersey communities in the fiscal year 1998 \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. However, I have been told \nthat since my requests concern properties closed under the BRAC which \nare already in the midst of the statutory closure process, the \ncommittee could not support these requests.\n  Accordingly, if any provisions for conveyances of properties, \nfacilities, or installations closed or realigned by BRAC that would \nintervene in the statutory BRAC disposal process are included in the \nconference agreement to the Defense authorization bill, I request that \nprovisions also be included to convey the Naval Reserve Center in Perth \nAmboy, NJ, to the city of Perth Amboy, for economic development \npurposes, and the Nike Battery 80 family housing site, East Hanover \nTownship, NJ, to the township council of East Hanover, for low and \nmoderate income housing.\n  Mr. THURMOND. As the Senator knows, the outcome of conference cannot \nbe forecast. As chairman it is my goal to support the Senate position \nand provide the Nation the best possible defense bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the Senator from New Jersey's concern and it \nis the committee's understanding that the outcome of the current \ndisposal process which is already underway for the two properties the \nSenator mentioned is likely to be consistent with the outcomes that the \nSenator's amendments would have provided.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate the Senators' recognition of the \nimportance of these conveyances to the economic well-being of these New \nJersey communities, and thank the Senators for their agreement to my \nrequest.\n\n\n                       twrs privatization funding\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], the chairman of the \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the title 31 \nprovisions on the Department of Energy programs.\n  Mr. SMITH. If the Senator will yield, I would be pleased to engage in \na colloquy.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator. I was prepared to offer a floor \namendment to this bill, S. 936, to address a very critical program at \nthe Department of Energy site at Hanford. As the chairman is aware, a \nmajor and costly cleanup effort is underway at that site as a result of \nits contributions to the cold war achievements. Part of the cleanup \neffort will address the highest threat to human health, at the site, \nthe 177 underground storage tanks that not only hold hazardous waste, \nbut high and low levels of radioactive wastes. The Hanford tank waste \nremediation system project, known as TWRS, is the most critical and \ncostly element in the cleanup of the Hanford site. Those underground \ntanks contain at-risk nuclear wastes, which have already\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\nleaked into the environment. Adequately addressing this situation is \nabsolutely essential, and is in fact codified in the Tri-Party \nAgreement entered into by the DOE, EPA, and Washington State. \nRegardless of the method of contracting selected, the time line \nrequired in that agreement must be met.\n  Currently, DOE is employing an innovative contracting approach to \ndealing with the remediation of those tank wastes called privatization. \nDOE embarked on privatization to attract outside financial resources to \nfinance the final design, construction and operation of cleanup \nprojects, which would in turn allow their scarce budget resources to be \nused to accelerate other cleanup actions. The Department also wanted to \ntake advantage of a commercial approach that has shown in the private \nsector not only to save dollars, but to reduce the time required to \naccomplish the task.\n  Section 3104 of the bill authorizes $275 million for DOE \nenvironmental management privatized projects, including $147 million \nfor TWRS at Hanford. This funding is critical to demonstrate to the \nprivatization contractors the Department's financial commitment to \nproceed with privatization. Without sufficient funds being reserved, \nthe privatization contractors--which plan to put up their capital to \ndevelop the cleanup project--and the contractors' investors have little \nassurance that TWRS or other privatization contracts will be fully \nfunded.\n  While I am concerned that the committee's authorization is not high \nenough to preclude some out-year BA spikes for the privatization \nprogram, I will forgo offering an amendment to increase this year's \nfunding with the understanding that the committee recognizes the need \nto provide at a minimum $147 million in budget authorization for TWRS \nto send the correct signal to the contractors and financial community.\n  Do I have the assurance of the Senator that he will stand fast on the \nSenate position of $147 million for TWRS in the upcoming conference \nwith the House?\n\n  Mr. SMITH. If the Senator will yield, yes I will vigorously defend in \nthe conference the Senate position of providing at least $147 million \nfor TWRS.\n  Mr. GORTON. Even if we secure the full $147 million in conference, as \nI hope we do, the fiscal year 1998 authorization is significantly less \nthan the administration request. Does the failure to authorize TWRS \nfunding at the administration's request level in any way suggest that \nCongress is backing away from the TWRS privatization project?\n  Mr. SMITH. If the Senator will yield further, the fact that we did \nnot authorize TWRS at the level initially recommended by the \nadministration in no way should be viewed as prejudicial. We believe \nthe authorization of $147 million, coupled with the $170 million \nalready appropriated in fiscal year 1997 is sufficient for the TWRS \nproject to proceed with absolutely no delay in the schedule or change \nin the intended work scope. The TWRS project will have $371 million in \nauthorized funds available if the committee mark becomes law. Given \nanticipated spending rates for both contractor teams, the TWRS project \nwill end fiscal year 1998 with a surplus of $207 million. We believe \nthis authorization level sends the proper signal to the contractor and \nthe investor communities that Congress is committed to cleaning up \nHanford's tank farm.\n  Mr. GORTON. Does the committee and the chairman further understand \nthat the $147 million provided in fiscal year 1998 represents a very \nminimum amount given the overall work intended, and the need to bank \nsome budget authority to avoid significantly larger budget authority \nrequirements in later years?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes, and I can assure the Senator that this committee will \ntake a close look at the TWRS project next year, and if the issues and \nreporting requirements identified in section 3131 are addressed by DOE, \nand hopefully they will be, we will provide the budget authority \nnecessary for the continuation of the project.\n  Mr. GORTON. Finally, section 3131, particularly subsection (b), \nsuggests that the authorization amount for privatization projects as \ndefined in section 3104 cannot be used for new contractual obligations \nuntil DOE provides a report setting forth a number of basic cost, \nconstruction, and savings related provisions. Yet, in the context of \nthe TWRS project, contracts are already in place with two contractors. \nEach contract contains two parts: a part A in which the contractors \nwill provide deliverables to support the construction and operation of \na TWRS facility, and a part B in which DOE, assuming part A \ndeliverables are acceptable, authorizes the contractor, or contractors, \nto proceed with the permitting and construction of a waste processing \nfacility. Since two Hanford tank waste remediation systems' contracts \nhave already been awarded, and any followon work for part B would be \nconsidered an exercised option, I want to be clear that these \nprovisions in section 3131 do not constitute an abrogation or \ntermination of the current contracts in existence.\n  Mr. SMITH. If the Senator will yield further, that is correct. It is \nnot the intent to abrogate or terminate the existing contracts. \nHowever, it is the intent of the provision that any future \nprivatization contracts or contract renewals or options exercised \npursuant to an existing contract funded under section 3104 must be \npreceded by a detailed DOE report to Congress as called for in section \n3131(b) of the bill. With respect to the TWRS contract, the section \n3131 limitations and notice and wait requirement are applicable to the \nauthorization to proceed with phase 1B. We are in no way attempting to \nslow down work on the Hanford tank farm cleanup. We are, in fact, \ntrying to ensure a stable funding environment for such projects in \norder that they can move forward expeditiously.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator for his clarification on these \npoints. I also appreciate his assurance to support $147 million in TWRS \nin conference and his demonstrated commitment to the environmental \nmanagement privatization concept. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7250-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7253-S7284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GULF WAR VETERANS' HEALTH\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and I am asking that I be \nincluded as a cosponsor. This amendment addresses some of the lessons \nto be learned from the Persian Gulf War in relation to the health of \nU.S. military personnel who served in that operation, many of whom are \nsuffering from what has come to be called Persian Gulf War Illness, or \nGulf War Syndrome.\n  This amendment requires the Department of Defense (DoD) and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) to assess the needs of, and prepare \nplans to provide effective health care to, veterans of the Persian Gulf \nWar and their dependents. It also directs the DoD and VA to consider \nthe health care needs of reservists and former members of the military \nwho suffer from Persian Gulf War Illness and who have fallen through \nthe cracks of the military and veterans health care systems. If \nultimately implemented, this plan, which is due by March 1, 1998, would \nbe a significant improvement over the existing tragic situation faced \nby many Gulf War veterans and their families. This is the responsible \nway to deal with this issue, rather than leaving these families to \nstruggle individually to deal with the effects of the invisible wounds \nsuffered in the service of our Nation. I have spoken previously about a \nsoldier struggling to provide health care for his child, fighting to \ncope with the child's severe deformities and health conditions that may \nhave resulted from his exposure to toxins during the Gulf War, and \nabout service members who have left the military because of their \ndeclining health and who cannot get medical insurance because of health \nconditions they believe are the direct result of their service.\n  A special concern that has arisen from our Gulf War experience \nconcerns the use of new and investigational drugs and vaccines to \nprotect our military personnel from the deadly effects of chemical and \nbiological weapons. My colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, has taken a particular interest in this matter, and I \ncommend him for his vigilance in looking after the interests of our \nmilitary personnel in this regard. This amendment contains a provision \nto modify the U.S. Code to require notice to all service personnel \nwhenever new or experimental drugs are being administered.\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\nIt also requires the Secretary of Defense to ensure that all service \nmembers' medical records accurately document the administration of \nthese drugs, so that possible involvement in future post-war illnesses \ncan be better studied.\n  In addition to looking at ways to deal with the health after-effects \nof the Gulf War, this amendment also implements other lessons learned \nfrom health problems arising from that conflict. It requires the \nSecretary of Defense to establish a system to better monitor the health \nof military personnel before deploying them to future operations \noverseas, and to maintain those records more efficiently. This will \ncorrect deficiencies noted from the Gulf War experience. The amendment \nalso requires a plan to better track the daily movements and locations \nof units and individuals during future military operations. We have \nseen how important this is, given the difficulty that DoD has had over \nthe past year in identifying those units that were in the vicinity of \nthe Khamisiyah ammunition depot when U.S. forces destroyed it after the \nGulf War, possibly releasing toxic chemical nerve and blister agents \ninto the atmosphere. In admitting this incident, DoD officials first \nsaid only a small number of troops were in the immediate area, but, \nover time, the number of units has continued to grow, and the number of \nindividuals affected has climbed to over 27,000. The number is expected \nto continue to grow as more information becomes available. Mr. \nPresident, these delays only add to the concerns of our veterans, and \nonly continue to delay the effective medical treatment of affected \nsoldiers.\n\n  Also in preparation for future wars in which chemical and biological \nweapons might be employed, this amendment requires a plan to deploy a \nspecialized chemical and biological detection unit with military forces \nsent into those dangerous situations. In the Persian Gulf War, some \n14,000 chemical alarms were set out and DoD witnesses have testified \nthat the alarms sounded an average of three times a day, for a total of \nsome 1.7 million alarms. Yet, most were dismissed as false alarms or \nbattery tests. That is not information designed to instill confidence \nin these alarms, to say the least. A specialized unit could provide \nmore reliable detection and confirmation of the threats faced by our \nforces.\n  On the medical front, this amendment calls for a review of the \neffectiveness of medical research initiatives regarding Gulf War \nillness, as well as a recommendation on the adequacy of federal funding \nfor this issue. Last year, I offered an amendment, which was adopted, \nthat provided $10 million for independent scientific research into the \npossible role of low levels of chemical warfare agents in Gulf War \nillnesses and their impact on the children of Gulf War veterans. This \nwas a field of inquiry that had not been previously addressed by the \nDepartment of Defense or by the VA, and I am pleased that the DoD has \nmoved quickly to award those funds to peer-reviewed research programs. \nI hope that these studies will provide answers in an expeditious \nmanner, so that any findings might be rapidly put to use in providing \neffective treatment for our Persian Gulf veterans. It will be helpful \nto have an assessment of whether our efforts to date to help these \nsoldiers and their families have been sufficient.\n  Finally, this amendment initiates a program of cooperative DoD-VA \nclinical trials to assess the effectiveness of medical treatment \nprotocols for Persian Gulf veterans suffering from ill-defined or \nundiagnosed conditions.\n  Mr. President, these are useful provisions that will continue to \nplace a much needed focus on the lingering and serious health concerns \nremaining from the Persian Gulf War. The slow and half-hearted efforts \nof the Department of Defense to address the health concerns of Persian \nGulf veterans over the last six years has fed the cynicism that is \nspreading throughout our military, causing soldiers to lose confidence \nand faith in the system that is supposed to support them, and which \nthey are expected to obey without question. That cynicism is a dark and \nspreading cancer that must be caught and corrected early, before the \nsystem is weakened beyond repair. This amendment is a step in that \ndirection, and I am pleased to cosponsor it. I thank my colleague, \nSenator Dodd, for his efforts.\n\n\n             Chiropractic health care demonstration program\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I wanted to express my support for the \namendment offered by the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee which would extend a chiropractic health care demonstration \nprogram currently underway by the Department of Defense.\n  Congress authorized for fiscal year 1995 a demonstration program to \nevaluate the feasibility and desirability of furnishing chiropractic \ncare for the military health service system. The demonstration was \nintended to be carried out over a 3-year period. Under the program, \nmajor military treatment facilities were permitted to contract for \nchiropractic health care. I would add that this follows in the wake of \nCongressional support for allowing chiropractors to be commissioned in \nthe armed services. This amendment extends the demonstration program \nfor 2 more years and would expand it to at least three additional \nmilitary treatment facilities.\n  I believe we should expand the range of health care options available \nto soldiers, not restrict them. A few years ago, the distinguished \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, noted on the Senate floor that the \nUnited States has traditionally kept alternative forms of medicine on \nthe fringes of society. He went on to note that, while we must protect \npatients from harmful treatment, we should allow them to choose the \nmethod and practitioner they prefer, especially when evidence indicates \nthat a group of practitioners provides high quality, cost-effective \ncare.\n  While I am not a doctor, I do believe that chiropractic health care \npresents an important health care option for our soldiers, especially \ngiven the types of health problems associated with the rigorous \nphysical activity that our soldiers routinely engage in. Lower back \npain is a frequent ailment that many soldiers understandably suffer \nfrom time to time. Many beneficiaries of the military health care \nsystem support the option to seek chiropractic treatment. I believe we \nshould support that option.\n  The demonstration program will allow the Department of Defense to \ngather the necessary information to determine the impact and \ndesirability of chiropractic care. I believe this is an important step \ntoward assuring that we fully meet the health care needs of our men and \nwomen in uniform. They support the option of using chiropractic care. \nLet's gather the necessary information in order to make an informed \ndecision on the matter. I am pleased that the Senate has adopted this \namendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes \nabout the importance of this bill and the profound responsibility which \nwe have in determining our Nation's defense budget.\n  I am a cosponsor of a tactical fighter amendment which will be \nproposed later today by my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin. \nSenator Feingold's amendment, which calls upon the Department of \nDefense to focus on strategic needs rather than special interests, \nrepresents an intelligent and responsible approach to protecting the \nsecurity of our Nation. It is only the first step in what should be a \nrevolution in our thinking about defense planning and spending.\n  Mr. President, some people believe that the revolution in military \naffairs is only a technological revolution: developing cutting-edge \ntechnology to preserve our military dominance into the future. In order \nto be successful, however, a revolution must impact strategy as well as \ntechnology.\n  While we, as a country, lead the world in defense technology, we are \nnot making similar progress in our thinking about defense. While our \ntechnologies may be sleek, our defense complex is not. As a result, we \nspend far more than we need to in order to remain the world's \nsuperpower.\n  Many people say that we can't cut corners when it comes to national \nsecurity. I agree. But that doesn't mean that we can't cut costs. In \nrecent weeks we have stood on this floor and cut costs in Medicare and \ndebated all too limited funding for education. Are we saying that we \ncan we afford to cut corners with our children? Our parents? Of course \nnot. We are saying that we have to cut costs--not corners.\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\n  I think we all want the same thing: to do the best for our country. \nAnd that means protecting our children, our parents, and the security \nof our Nation. It also means making wise financial decisions regarding \nall of our priorities. Without a sound economy, our children, our \nparents, and the security of our country are at risk.\n  Mr. President, I think we can be proud of what Congress has done this \nyear in support of a balanced budget. Still, within that balanced \nbudget we are not doing enough to challenge old-style thinking. In \nparticular, I want to draw our attention to the fact that, when every \nother spending area is up for debate and in most cases adjusting to \nbudget cuts, the defense budget seems to be untouchable.\n  In fact, both the Senate and the House plan to give the \nAdministration $2.6 billion more than it requested for defense \nspending. Why?\n  Mr. President, it is impossible to have rational debate about defense \nspending issues because there is a majority in this body that hears the \nwords ``cut defense'' and then does not listen to anything else.\n  Now, I realize that we have a bipartisan budget agreement this year--\nan agreement that takes us toward a balanced budget. Out of respect for \nthat hard won compromise, I will not introduce any amendments to cut \ndefense spending at this time. However, I urge us, as a Congress and as \na Nation, to set aside our special interests and old-style thinking, \nand to look at defense spending just as we approach every other issue \nof importance to our Nation's future.\n  Let's not give the military things they don't need and, in some \ncases, haven't asked for. And let's be realistic and smart about what \nit takes to defend our national interests.\n  Do we really need 18 Trident submarines? If we retired just two of \nthe older Tridents, we would still have the most powerful submarine \nfleet in the world--by far.\n  Similarly, there is an honest debate among experts about the ideal \nnumber of aircraft carriers. Many believe that we could hold the fleet \ndown to 10 carriers and have more than enough to defend our global \ninterests. Either of these plans would save billions of dollars over \nthe next few years. Why isn't this debate going on in the Senate?\n  I could tell you that, if we gave up those Tridents or carriers, we \ncould fund education or prevent crime or reduce the deficit. That's \ntrue. And all of those initiatives could use more funding. But that is \nnot the only argument I want to make today. Yes, I believe we should \nspend more on kids. But even if we already had every dollar we needed \nfor education, we still should spend our defense dollars wisely. I do \nnot believe that we are doing that today.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in an honest debate about our \ndefense needs. If we don't start examining the defense budget more \nclosely, it will remain a sacred cow to which we are beholden rather \nthan a tool which we use to further the best interests of our country.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments concerning S. \n936, the fiscal year 1998 national defense authorization bill.\n  I worked this year with my colleague from Indiana, Senator Coats, on \nthe Subcommittee on Airland Forces. This was our first year as chairman \nand ranking member on the subcommittee and I am pleased that we were \nable to work together very cooperatively.\n  It was in the spirit of bipartisanship that we reviewed the \nadministration's budget request, the services' so-called wish lists, \nthe testimony of our witnesses and our colleagues' requests for funding \nof various programs. In our first meeting, we agreed that we would \nadopt criteria for assessing funding requests, not unlike the criteria \nSenator McCain and I established in the area of military construction \nseveral years ago.\n  Section 1059 of the bill expresses the sense of the Senate that, in \nconsidering providing additional funding for the Reserve Component \nequipment, the Senate look to whether there is a Joint Requirements \nOversight Council validated requirement for the equipment, that the \nequipment is in the Reserve Component's modernization plan and is in \nthe Defense Department's Future Years Defense Program, that the \nequipment is consistent with the employment and use of the Reserve \nComponent, that the equipment is necessary for the national security of \nthe country, and that additional funds could be obligated in the \nupcoming fiscal year. Section 1059 expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat these criteria be met to the maximum extent practicable. I \nappreciate my colleagues' willingness to apply these standards to our \nfunding decisions, so that we can work to make sure we are buying \nthings that we truly need.\n  In accordance with the recent report of the Quadrennial Defense \nReview, the bill also adds about $150 million in funding for the Army's \nForce XXI [``21''], a ``digitization'' program that I agree has a great \ndeal of potential. I am a strong supporter of the Army's efforts and I \ncertainly agree that digitization of the battlefield offers \ntremendously enhanced situational awareness.\n  My concern as we embark on this multibillion dollar effort is that, \nin our enthusiasm to exploit these technologies to our advantage, we \nshould not ignore the vulnerabilities to which these systems could \nalready succumb.\n  We need to red team this technology--by this, I mean, we need to put \nourselves in our adversaries' shoes and think about what our enemies \nwould do to capitalize on our reliance on digitization. Would they jam \nus, would they spoof us, could they bring the whole system down? I \nbelieve that we need to be just as enthusiastic about testing potential \nvulnerabilities of digitization, because we can bet that our potential \nadversaries will be trying to undo us.\n  So, we are requiring a report on digitization and I am pleased that, \nat my request, the report will also outline the Army's plans to address \njamming vulnerabilities and to use electronic countermeasures. I will \nbe looking forward to that report, Mr. President.\n  I'd also like to take a moment to discuss one of the most difficult \nareas in the budget request: funding for tactical aviation programs. \nThe Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps will all be modernizing their \nfighter forces over the course of the next two decades. The good news \nis the services will field the most modern and the most lethal aircraft \nin the world, the bad news is that these programs will be \nextraordinarily expensive.\n  Over the life of the F-22, the F/A-18 E/F and the Joint Strike \nFighter programs, we can expect to spend several hundreds of billions \nof dollars in procurement alone, never mind operations and support \ncosts. Some thought that maybe the QDR would make dramatic changes to \nthese programs, but the QDR essentially revalidated the requirements \nfor these programs with relatively small changes in the number of \naircraft to be purchased in the out years--and it is still unclear to \nme when, or even whether, those cuts in the number of aircraft we will \nbuy are going to generate any meaningful savings.\n  Making decisions on the enormous funding requests associated with \nthese programs would be challenging enough alone, Mr. President, but \nwhen they are put in the context of the overall DOD budget and what \njust about everyone acknowledges is a sizable funding shortfall in \nfuture procurement accounts makes this task all the more daunting.\n  The Subcommittee on Airland Forces had several very good hearings on \nthese programs. We had service witnesses, OSD witnesses, CBO, and \ncontractors present testimony on our requirements and our progress in \nthese programs both from a technical risk and a cost standpoint.\n  I have been very concerned that we not repeat mistakes made in the \npast, where Congress was left in the dark and we ended up with an \nunacceptably expensive program like the B-2 program. I'll be very \ncandid, Mr. President, I have some strong reservations about what is \ncurrently happening in the F-22 program. The program is experiencing a \n$2 billion overrun in the research and development program, with a risk \nthat there may be sizeable cost growth in the procurement program as \nwell.\n  The Air Force and the contractor assure us that they can absorb these \noverruns by re-structuring the program and by taking out some \npreproduction verification aircraft. Some argue that this approach \nincreases concurrency in\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\nthe program, while the Air Force argues that by slowing down the \nengineering and manufacturing development phase of the program that \nthey will be able to reduce overall concurrency. I think the jury is \nstill out on that Mr. President, and that we are going to have to watch \nthis program very carefully.\n  Reasonable minds are going to disagree on what the best approach is \nto addressing this problem. I am afraid that I must disagree with the \ncommittee's approach on F-22. The bill before us cuts $500 million out \nof the program--20 percent of this year's request. I just don't see how \ntaking such a big cut out of the program can address the cost overrun. \nThere's no connection between the two as far as I can tell, and worse \nthan that, I'm concerned that cutting the program will only serve to \nincrease the technical risk.\n  I don't want my colleagues to misunderstand me. I agree that we need \nto be vigilant in our oversight of the F-22 program and we need to make \nsure that adequate controls are in place so that we don't end up with \nrunaway costs. But, I think a better way to deal with the situation is \nto fence the money--put up hurdles that the Air Force must clear before \nit can have all of the money that's been requested. Once those hurdles \nhave been cleared, the Air Force can move forward with the program as \nplanned. Under the committee bill, even if the Air Force meets every \nprogram requirement, they will still be $500 million short at the end \nof the year--it seems more punitive than remedial, Mr. President.\n  There are some other parts of the bill to which I am adamantly \nopposed. First, I take strong exception to the section included in the \ngeneral provisions which would prevent the General Accounting Office \n[GAO] from conducting any self-initiated audits, under its basic \nlegislative authority, until all other outstanding congressional \nrequests have been completed.\n  This language amends title 31 of the United States Code and is an \nunwarranted and unjustified intrusion into the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs. It represents a major policy shift \nin the operation and authority of GAO. One which this committee adopted \nwithout any consultation or input from the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee held an oversight hearing on GAO \nlast Congress. There were several Members on each side of the aisle at \nthat time who served on both committees. I don't recall any Member \nraising this as an issue or discussing problems regarding GAO's self-\ninitiated audits to light.\n  Moreover, the committee, under my chairmanship, contracted with the \nNational Academy of Public Administration [NAPA] to comprehensively \nreview GAO's management and operations. The NAPA study did not identify \nany problems related to GAO's conduct under their basic legislative \nauthority, nor did it make any recommendations for our consideration on \nthis issue. In fact, quite the contrary. Some analysts thought GAO \nshould perform more, not less, self-initiated audits. In their view, \nGAO was often subject to rather parochial and narrow Member requests \nwhich only drained GAO's time and resources. I would note that GAO \ncurrently conducts 80 percent of its work in response to Member \nrequests. A few years ago, it was far more evenly split.\n  Since 1921, the Comptroller General has had broad authority to \nevaluate programs and investigate on his own initiative all matters \nrelating to the receipt, disbursement, and use of public money. Self-\ninitiated authority has provided GAO the flexibility to pursue critical \nissues that auditors and investigators uncover in the course of their \nwork. It is essential to the maintenance of generally accepted \nstandards of independence and impartiality. Any restriction of this \nauthority would be akin to us muzzling the auditor. The effect of this \nprovision would be that, for example, work could not proceed on the \nnext set of high risk list reports until all Member requests--just \nthink if a Member requested GAO to examine alien abductions--not only \nhad been staffed, but had been completed. On large jobs, it may take \nwell over a year to do the work.\n  I know from my long service on the Governmental Affairs Committee \nthat Members often disagree with GAO's conclusions on a particular \nreport. That has happened to me more than once. But if we demand \nobjectivity, and I think all of us do, then we must give GAO the \nindependence and authority they need to do the job. We want them to be \nable to investigate mismanagement or fraud wherever it exists.\n  I regret that this committee did not see fit to consult with GAO's \nauthorizing committee before slipping this provision in a massive bill \nat the last moment. I know that I, during my chairmanship of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, would at least have consulted with the \nArmed Services Committee if we were going to act on legislation \naffecting title 10.\n  For these reasons, I will do all I can to strike this provision from \nthis bill and I would hope my colleagues on both committees would join \nwith me.\n  The committee's bill contains five land conveyance provisions--\nincluding one that was added at literally the last minute of the \nmarkup--and in their current form I am opposed to each of them. These \nconveyances are as follows:\n  Section 2813, Land Conveyance Hawthorne Army Ammunition Depot, \nMineral County NV. This provision would authorize the Secretary of the \nArmy to convey, at no cost, 33 acres of real property currently used as \nArmy housing to Mineral County Nevada.\n  Section 2815, Land Conveyance, Topsham Annex Naval Air Station, \nBrunswick ME. This provision would authorize the Secretary of the Navy \nto convey, at no cost to the Maine School Administrative District No. \n75, 40 acres or real property including improvements to the property.\n  Section 2816, Land Conveyance Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant \nNo. 464 Oyster Bay, NY. This provision would authorize the Secretary of \nthe Navy to convey at no cost 110 acres of real property, including \nequipment, fixtures, special tools, and test equipment all of which \ncomprise the Naval Industrial Reserve Plant No. 464 to the County of \nNassau, NY.\n  Section 2817, Land Conveyance Charleston Family Housing Complex, \nBangor ME. This provision would authorize the Secretary of the Air \nForce to convey at no cost 20 acres of real property currently used as \nAir Force housing to the city of Bangor ME.\n  Section 2818, Land Conveyance Ellsworth Air Force Base, SD. This \nprovision would authorize the Secretary of the Air Force to convey at \nno cost 5 parcels of land totalling more than 290 acres to the Greater \nBox Elder Area Economic Development Corporation in Box Elder, SD. Each \nof the five parcels of land contains military housing units.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the committee has discontinued a \nprocess to evaluate land conveyances which started when I was chairman \nof the Readiness Subcommittee, and which was continued by Senator \nMcCain when he was chairman. This informal process sought to ensure \nthat taxpayer's interests were partially protected, by conducting an \nexpedited 30-day screen conducted by the General Services \nAdministration for other Federal interest of each proposed conveyance. \nBecause these land conveyance provisions waive the Federal Property and \nAdministrative Services Act, the committee cannot assure taxpayers that \nthe Federal Government is not seeking to acquire property that is \nsimilar to what the legislative provisions are giving away.\n  Now, Mr. President, some have suggested that screening this property \nfor Federal interest is just a bureaucratic procedure that delays the \nproductive use of property which the Member in his or her judgement \nbelieves to be the best interest of his or her constituents. Others \nhave suggested that this process is a waste of time because the \nexpedited screening policy implemented by Senator McCain and myself \nnever resulted in property being flagged for other Federal use.\n  I would like to address each of these points.\n  First, Federal screening is the law of the land. If Congress, and the \nArmed Services Committee in particular, believe that it is no longer \nnecessary, the appropriate action is to amend the Federal Property and \nAdministrative Services Act. It also appears that the intent of several \nof these conveyances is to get around the McKinney Act which Congress \npassed to address the needs of the homeless. I think it should be made \nclear that the McKinney Act has by and large been successful in \nproviding housing to the homeless. If the proponents of these \nconveyances disagree, they should seek to amend McKinney rather than \ncontinually waive it.\n  Now let me explain why Federal screening of excess property makes\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\nsense. I refer to a chart provided by the General Services \nAdministration entitled, ``Recent Examples of Excess Real Property \nScreened by GSA with Federal Agencies and Subsequently Transferred to \nother Federal Agencies for Continued Federal Use.''\n  Mr. President this chart shows why Federal screening of excess \nproperty saves taxpayer dollars. The chart lists five examples, \nincluding two from the Department of Defense, where excess property \nfrom one agency was transferred to another Federal agency as a result \nof the screening process. The total value of property in these five \nexamples is almost $36 million. What this means Mr. President, is that \nthe screening process saved Federal taxpayers $36 million dollars \nbecause the receiving agencies were able to utilize property which the \nholding agency no longer needed.\n  Now I would ask the chairman or ranking member of the Readiness \nSubcommittee whether he can tell me if there is any Federal interest in \nthe property which the committee proposes to give away?\n  I would further ask my friends what harm they see in ensuring that \ntaxpayer's interests are minimally protected by requiring a Federal \nscreen before allowing these conveyances to go forward? Would my \ncolleague consider accepting an amendment for each of the conveyances I \nhave identified that would require a satisfactory Federal screen as a \ncondition of the conveyance?\n  It seems to me that there is the potential with these land \nconveyances for the taxpayer to lose twice. Once because another \nFederal agency may have a need for this property. And a second time \nbecause we are authorizing the military to give away the property \ninstead of trying to seek a fair market value for it.\n  In the past, when I was chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee we \nasked the General Services Administration to provide a preliminary \nestimate of the value of the property which the committee was proposing \nto give away. I would note that each of the five conveyances included \nin the committee's bill would convey the property for no consideration. \nI think, at a minimum, we should at least have a ball park estimate of \nhow much money the Government is losing with these provisions.\n  I would expect that my colleagues who speak of the importance of \nbalancing the budget and are so-called deficit hawks would be \ninterested in the result of GSA's valuation of these properties.\n  To conclude I have asked the GSA to conduct a 30-day screen for each \nproperty, and make an estimate, to the extent possible, of the value of \neach proposed conveyance. I will make this information available to my \ncolleagues as soon as I have it.\n  In addition, I am strongly opposed to the committee's action in \nraising the budget for the space-based laser by $118 million. \nDeployment of this dubious star wars holdover would violate the ABM \nTreaty, cost an exorbitant amount, and not address any real current or \nanticipated near-term threat to our security. I have similar concerns \nabout the $80 million that the committee is recommending for the \nantisatellite [ASAT] program.\n  The committee can find $118 for the space based laser and $80 million \nfor ASAT, but is slashing $135 million from one of our most valuable \nnational security programs, the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. \nThe proposal to cut $25 million from the Energy Department's Materials \nProtection, Control and Accounting [MPC] Program, another $50 million \nfrom the Department's international nuclear safety program, and $60 \nmillion from the CTR program itself--are to me extremely ill-advised. I \nstrongly support the efforts by Senator Bingaman to restore and to \nincrease funds for the MPC Program and the Initiatives for \nProliferation Prevention program.\n  Perhaps most extraordinary of all was the committee's agreement to \nincrease the National Missile Defense Program by a whopping $474 \nmillion without even first requiring a detailed explanation of how \nthese funds would be spent. The committee's action offers strong \nevidence of a double standard at work in the current Congress, in which \nsocial and environmental programs are being slashed and subjected to \ncongressional micromanagement, while a massive and provocative defense \nprogram escapes close congressional scrutiny. The committee is giving \nall the appearance here of handing the NMD Program a blank check, at \nthe same time another bill, S. 7, would force the President to deploy a \nNMD system by the year 2003. I regard these actions both as poor \ndefense policy and poor management of the public's funds.\n  Finally, I regret that the committee has acceded to the Department's \nrequest to cut end strength further. I understand the rationale that is \nused to support continued end strength reductions, i.e., to cut end \nstrength in order to generate cash savings that can help pay for \nmodernization programs, and I agree completely that our service-members \ndeserve to have the best and most modern equipment available. However, \nI do not agree with the approach that we reduce the size of the force \nto pay for it.\n  We are using the military for peacetime operations as much today as \nat any time during the cold war. I believe that if we want to continue \nto deploy a superb and ready force, we cannot cut the size of the force \nyear after year and operate at the same optempo. Even if modernization \nprograms can reduce the manpower needed to conduct wartime or peacetime \noperations in the long term, in the near term, we still need people to \ncarry out our important worldwide commitments.\n  I am concerned that we are rapidly falling below the manning levels \nnecessary to either conduct our peacetime operations or credibly \nmaintain a combat force capable of carrying out two nearly simultaneous \nmajor regional contingencies. Unfortunately, I do not believe it is \npossible to build a consensus in the Congress to maintain the \nappropriate size force, which I believe to be about 1.6 million active \nduty, when the Defense Department, itself, argues that it does not need \nthese personnel and views the savings from end strength reductions as a \nrelatively easy way to fund its weapons programs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the DOD \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1998. This is a responsible bill \nthat recognizes the national security threats we face, and properly \nfunds the operations and modernization accounts needed to support the \nfinest military in the world.\n  Over the past year, we have been constantly reminded that our \nmilitary must be able to respond to a variety of threats all over the \nglobe. The United States is unlike any other country in that we can \nidentify important national interests in every region on the Earth, and \nour military must have the right equipment, training and resources to \nprotect those interests. Our Armed Forces must be prepared for a \nvariety of missions, from peacekeeping, humanitarian, and peace \nenforcement operations to rapid, full scale deployment.\n  This authorization bill recognizes the missions and roles our Armed \nForces will face and provides an appropriate level of funding. While \nthe fiscal year 1998 DOD authorization bill is nearly $3 billion higher \nthan the President's budget request, it keeps total defense spending \n$3.3 billion below last year's inflation adjusted level. Although some \nof my colleagues may think this a negligible reduction, this is the \n13th year in a row where the U.S. defense budget is less than it was \nthe year before.\n  I believe this bill takes a significant step forward regarding DOD's \ndepot maintenance policy. It maintains the public/private competition \nfor depot maintenance workloads at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases \nwhich can save future taxpayer dollars. If the competitions for these \nworkloads are won by the private sector, hundreds of millions of \ndollars in savings could be realized by avoiding the costs of new \nmilitary construction, movement of the workload, and retraining workers \nat the remaining Air Logistics Centers. Privatization of non-core depot \nmaintenance workloads is supported by Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dr. John White, Deputy Secretary of \nDefense, the Aerospace Industries Association, Business Executives for \nNational Security, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Public/private \ncompetition is a good idea, and I am pleased this bill recognizes its \nvalue.\n  This bill also moves to address the critical readiness issues by \nauthor- \n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\nizing more than $77 billion in near-term readiness funding. This \nincludes an increase of more than $1 billion for high priority programs \nsuch as ammunition procurement, flying hours, cold weather gear, and \nbarracks renovation.\n  This year's defense bill also recognizes the needs of our men and \nwomen in uniform. I believe the committee wisely includes additional \nmilitary construction projects, adopts a single, price-based housing \nallowance based on a national index for housing costs, and a 2.8 \npercent pay raise to better our uniformed military's standard of \nliving.\n  I applaud the adoption of Senator Stevens' amendment, to which I was \nan original cosponsor, to create a position on the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff for a four-star general to represent the National Guard Bureau. \nThe National Guard is a vital part of our armed services, serving in \ntimes of crisis both at home and abroad. A four-star general will give \nthe National Guard, which now comprise 55 percent of our ground forces, \nequal consideration and input at the real decision making levels in the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I do not, however, support all the extra funds that were added to \nthis bill. I felt it important to support of Senator Bingaman's \namendment to cut $118 million from the Space Based Laser Program. I \nbelieve that a national missile defense is a laudable goal. There is, \nhowever, no immediate or even mid-term threat to U.S. security that \nsuggests the need for the immediate development of this space based \nnational missile defense system. Only Russia and China have nuclear-\narmed ICBM's that can reach the United States and China has no more \nthan a dozen or so of these weapons. There is consensus within the \nnational security and intelligence communities that it is very unlikely \nthat additional countries can or will build ICBM's within the next two \ndecades.\n  I will continue to strongly support the funding of critical theater \nmissile defense systems and a national missile defense system that meet \nprojected threats and achieve an affordable ballistic missile defense. \nUnder this scenario, should threats to the United States begin to \nmaterialize, we will have sufficient lead-time to respond to those \nthreats, and dedicate higher funding levels to develop and deploy a \nnational missile defense system.\n  I also supported the Wellstone amendment to offset cuts in the \nveterans' health care budget by allowing the Secretary of Defense to \ntransfer up to $400 million from DOD funds. I believe it is imperative \nthat we support our veterans who have fought to guarantee us our \nfreedom. The planned cuts in the VA will certainly have an effect on \nthe availability and quality of health care and other essential \nservices that are available to our veterans. I believe it would be only \nfair to give the Secretary of Defense the ability to transfer the funds \nwhich would offset the VA cuts, especially when this bill authorizes \n$2.6 billion more than the President's request.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I believe the Senate has acted wisely in \nrequiring a comprehensive study of the base closure process before any \nfurther base realignment and closure rounds can occur. As the senior \nsenator from California, I have seen firsthand how cumbersome and \nnightmarish the BRAC process has been. Communities continue to struggle \nwith the base reuse process. In addition, environmental cleanup of \nclosed bases is proceeding much slower and at much greater cost than \nexpected. Finally, there are no reliable figures to show how much the \nDepartment of Defense has saved in the prior BRAC rounds, much less \nreliable estimates for savings in future rounds. I will not vote for \nfurther base closure rounds until these problems are resolved.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I seek to withdraw an amendment I have \nfiled to the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill because I see \nthat pressing ahead with this amendment at this time would only delay \npassage of this important legislation. Before I formally withdraw my \namendment, however, I wish to inform my colleagues about the \ncircumstances which prompted me to introduce this measure--\ncircumstances which continue today.\n  A basic unfairness exists within the current regulations for \nmembership in the National Guard. This inconsistency arbitrarily \npenalizes some patriotic Americans who serve their country well. It \nalso hinders the ability of some National Guard units to attract and \nretain the most qualified individuals, thereby undermining the \neffectiveness of those units.\n  This situation was brought to my attention because of a constituent \nof mine, Robert Echols, of Nashville. Mr. Echols, a Federal district \ncourt judge in the Sixth Judicial Circuit in Tennessee, is also a \ncolonel in the Tennessee National Guard where he has served with \ndistinction for 27 years. In September 1995, Colonel Echols was \nrecommended for promotion to the rank of brigadier general.\n  Although Colonel Echols' promotion was supported by the chief judge \nof the sixth judicial district, the Tennessee National Guard, and the \nNational Guard Bureau here in Washington, to date his promotion has \nbeen delayed. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and \nReserve Affairs has cited a regulation limiting Guard service by \ncertain Federal officials to explain this delay. Further exacerbating \nthe unfairness to Colonel Echols is the fact that this regulation is \ninconsistently applied. Other Federal officials who should fall within \nthe scope of the regulation serve in the Guard unhindered.\n  I have been working with the Pentagon since early this year to \nrectify this unfair situation. Thus far, no solution has been found. \nIndeed, the Pentagon has been unwilling to reconsider Colonel Echols' \ncircumstance. They have also opposed my amendment to this legislation.\n  I offered my amendment in an attempt to address the specific \nsituation of district court judges serving in the National Guard. \nConsidering that the chief of the sixth circuit has written that Mr. \nEchols' Guard service does not hinder his ability to serve as a judge, \nit is clear to me that civil servants in this category should be \nconsidered for National Guard service on a case-by-case basis. That is \nwhat my amendment would have done.\n  Nevertheless, it has become clear to me that pressing forward in this \nfashion at this time will only delay passage of the critical Defense \nauthorization bill, probably without rectifying the underlying problem. \nI will, therefore, withdraw the amendment at this time. I do intend, \nhowever, to continue working to find a solution to this unfair \nsituation which penalizes Americans seeking to serve their country and \nundermines the effectiveness of National Guard units.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as the fiscal year 1998 Defense \nauthorization bill moves to conference to resolve differences between \nthe Senate and House versions of the bill, I am hopeful the conferees \nwill give careful consideration to the Senate provision addressing the \nissue of the disposal of the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile. This \nprovision requires an additional report to Congress by the Secretary of \nDefense on options available to the Department of Defense for the \ndisposal of chemical weapons and agents.\n  Since 1985, Congress has directed the Army to conduct a number of \nstudies and evaluations of our Nation's chemical weapons stockpile in \norder to determine the safest and most effective method of disposal. \nRegardless of the destruction timetables set forth in the recently \nratified Chemical Weapons Convention, U.S. chemical agents and \nmunitions must be disposed of by 2004 as a matter of national policy.\n  Determining a safe and cost effective method for disposal of our \nNation's chemical weapons stockpile is an issue of concern to many \ncommunities and citizens located near the Army's eight CW storage \nsites. In my home State more than 1,000 1-ton containers of bulk VX \nnerve agent are stored at the Newport Army Chemical Activity, Newport, \nIN.\n  At the direction of Congress, the Army examined a range of disposal \noptions and methods and involved significant public participation in \nthe review process. The Army also considered the recommendations \ncontained in an independent report on certain alternative technologies \nprepared by the National Academy of Sciences at the request of \nCongress.\n  On December 6, 1996, the Army recommended that the Department of \nDefense utilize a neutralization process\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\nfor disposal of bulk chemical agents stored at Aberdeen Proving Ground, \nMD, and Newport, IN. On January 17, 1997, the Department of Defense \nauthorized the Army to proceed with the necessary activities to pilot \ntest two neutralization-based processes for the destruction of chemical \nagents stored at Aberdeen and Newport.\n  As the conference meets to resolve differences between the House and \nSenate-passed versions of the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization \nbill, I am hopeful conferees will be mindful of the important progress \nmade by Congress and the Army since 1986 to address this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the distinguished chairman, \nwe are prepared to exchange a package of routine amendments which have \nbeen agreed to by the chairman, Mr. Thurmond, and the distinguished \nranking member, Mr. Levin, and as far as this Senator knows that is the \nlast item prior to final passage.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it sounds to me as if good progress has been \nmade here, and we are about ready to come to final passage on this very \nimportant legislation. I think it is a monumental achievement to be \nable to move a Department of Defense authorization bill in the way this \nhas been moved and in the time it has been moved.\n  Therefore, after this vote, then, it will be the last vote of today. \nFollowing the disposition of the DOD authorization bill, the Senate \nwill proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Joel \nKlein to be an Assistant Attorney General. I expect some debate at the \nvery minimum on that nomination today. The Senate will begin the DOD \nappropriations bill at 12 noon on Monday and at 3 p.m. on Monday \nconduct a cloture vote on the Klein nomination. Therefore, the next \nrollcall vote will occur at 5 p.m. on Monday. I encourage all Members \nwho intend to amend the DOD appropriations bill to be prepared to offer \ntheir amendments on Monday. We hope to complete that bill by the close \nof business or afternoon Tuesday. This will be the final vote this week \nuntil Monday.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as soon as this is worked out, I will \nnot hold up the vote, but I just want to commend everyone for getting \nthis very important bill through the Senate. The distinguished \ncommittee chairman, Senator Thurmond, our wonderful President pro \ntempore, has worked hardest to make sure that we have the armed \nservices authorization with the policies in place that we need to \nprovide for the strong national defense of this country. I commend him \nand his ranking member, Senator Levin, and all of those on the \ncommittee who have tried to make sure that we are using our tax dollars \nin an efficient way but with the foremost goal of providing the \nsecurity of our country and for the support of the troops both in \ntraining, quality of life, and the technology that we need to make sure \nthat our troops are the safest they can be when they are in the field \nand that they have the best equipment of any troops in the world, so \nthat when they are called on to fight for the security of our Nation, \nthey will be able to do the job.\n  I commend the committee and I commend its leaders.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I do not intend to talk any longer than \nnecessary, until we get a signal that we are ready to go to final \npassage. I don't want to hold anything up. I know a lot of people have \nplanes to catch and commitments to make, and are very anxious to \nfinalize this bill as quickly as possible. But, in that we were in a \nquorum call and not quite there yet, let me just take this opportunity \nto say how profoundly disappointed I am that we were not able to do \nanything to move toward additional base closings.\n  I doubt there is a Member in this body that doesn't understand that \nwe have too much capacity. We had a force structure designed to address \nthe cold war. The threats have changed, the force structure has been \nreduced, but the base infrastructure has not been reduced accordingly. \nAs a consequence, with a fixed top budget line, that means we have to \nspread our resources around in areas that are not essential and \nsacrifice areas that are essential.\n  We do not begin to have the amount of money needed to modernize our \nforces. We have been talking about this for years and we keep \npostponing that. The quality of life for our soldiers, particularly in \nhousing, has suffered. The state of our military housing is deplorable. \nNearly two-thirds of current military housing is substandard and \nsubstandard by military standards, which is even below civilian \nstandards. I am ashamed at what we ask people who commit to serve this \ncountry to live in; how we ask them to live. I have toured and visited \nthose barracks, those homes. As former chairman of the personnel \nsubcommittee, I made it a point to visit many bases both here and \nabroad. The state of our military housing is deplorable.\n  We cannot begin to shift enough funds there if we can't find the \nfunds to shift. One of the ways proposed to address that is additional \nrounds of base closings. I know they are painful. None of us want to \nclose bases in our States. I have had to participate in two base \nclosings in our State and we only had two bases. But the people of \nIndiana supported that because they felt it was necessary, we did have \nexcess capacity. And it was done in a fair manner. It was not easy. It \nwas not painless. But it was necessary.\n  The argument that we have heard here on the floor that we don't know \nwhat the cost is going to be is a ludicrous argument. If you take that \nto its logical conclusion, we ought to be doubling the number of bases \nbecause it is going to save us money, because if cutting bases costs \nmoney it just makes sense that adding bases, new bases, would save \nmoney.\n  Every industry in America has had to adjust to the global changes \nthat are taking place in business and become more productive. They have \nhad to do more with less. So whether it's auto companies or electronics \nmanufacturers or whatever, they have had to close excess capacity. Does \nthat mean people get laid off? Yes. Transferred? Yes. Does it mean that \ncommunities are impacted? Yes. But for the institution to be viable for \nthe future, it is a necessary step. Otherwise everybody gets hurt. Yet \nwe refuse to do that here. I am just disappointed that we could not at \nleast put some process--not even defining the process--but some process \nthat would move us toward reducing this infrastructure and addressing \nthe long-term problem that we have.\n  We might not get the savings in 3 years. It might not directly offset \nin the 5-year budget plan. But we know it is going to accrue positively \nfor the Department of Defense at some point in the future; that \nmaintaining these bases is simply going to continue to drain money from \nessential functions, to put pressure on pay, to put pressure on health \ncare for the military members and their dependents, to put pressure on \nhousing, quality of life, modernization and everything else.\n  Mr. President, we are moving toward finalizing this bill. It looks \nlike an agreement is reached and I will yield the floor. We can talk \nabout this more at another time.\n  Several Senators addressed Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1998 Defense budget \nrequest sent over by the administration continues to reflect the low \npriority given to our men and women serving in the armed services. For \nthe third straight year, the administration has inadequately funded the \nnational security interest of this Nation, particularly in the \nmodernization accounts. Congress\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\nadded $2.6 billion in funding to the administration's request in order \nto provide the resources necessary to execute required national \ntasking. Additionally, the committee refocused the administration's \nbudget request, adding over $5.2 billion to the procurement and \nresearch and development modernization accounts.\n  Service Chiefs requested that any potential additional funding be \ndevoted toward key modernization accounts, as reflected in the \nrespective services unfunded priority lists. Unfortunately, the bills \nproposed by the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House National \nSecurity Committee include a plethora of programs not requested by the \nDefense Department, virtually ignoring the request of the Pentagon and \nimpeding the military's ability to channel resources where they are \nmost needed. In my opinion, this bill contains in excess of $4.9 \nbillion in questionable add-ons and expenditures that do little to \ncontribute to our national security. Similarly, the House defense bill \ncontains over $5.5 billion in objectionable defense adds.\n  Mr. President, the following highlight some of the more egregious \nprojects:\n  The military construction and family housing accounts received \nunrequested plus-ups for low-priority U.S. based projects totaling over \n$772.0 million, including over $262.5 million for the National Guard \nand Reserves. This MILCON plus-up represents over $100 million more \nthan was added to the 1997 Defense budget request. However, unlike last \nyear, the committee has not had the luxury of adding nearly $13 billion \nto the overall budget request. The MILCON plus-up includes over $85 \nmillion for the construction of nine readiness and reserve centers for \nthe Guard and Reserve at the same time that National Guard and Reserve \nend-strength is being cut by over 54,000 personnel.\n  The procurement account includes the unrequested funding of $343.3 \nmillion for six C-130 aircraft. General Fogleman testified before the \ncommittee that the Air Force had too many C-130 aircraft, in fact, he \ncalled it ``An embarrassment of riches.'' The House bill includes $331 \nmillion to keep the B-2 line open. The Chief of Naval Operations, No. 1 \npriority on his unfunded priority list was the addition of four F/A-\n18E/F aircraft. This request, his No. 1 priority, was overlooked by \nboth committees.\n  The Senate bill includes $2.6 billion for procurement of four new \nattack submarines and proposes a teaming arrangement which effectively \neliminates competition among shipyards. The American taxpayer will soon \nfind itself funding submarines less capable by design than the Seawolf, \nand without the benefit of economic common sense which competition and \nfree market principles would provide the cost will approach that of the \nSeawolf.\n  The bill includes unrequested plus-ups in excess of $42 million for \nautomotive and combat vehicle technology research, including research \non vehicle composites, electric drives, and battery recharging.\n  Included are plus-ups to medical research and development projects \ntotaling over $26.5 million for retinal display research, freeze dried \nblood, and human factors engineering, among others.\n  Funding of approximately $17 million for unrequested research into \nthe next generation Internet. I believe Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are \ncapable of continuing the computer revolution without additional \nfunding from DOD.\n  Mr. President, in summary, I am sure there are many programs on my \nlist which may be good programs. I am sure that they benefit certain \nStates, however, with military training exercises continuing to be cut, \nbacklogs in aircraft and ship maintenance, flying hour shortfalls, \nmilitary health care underfunded by $600 million, and 11,787 \nservicemembers reportedly on food stamps, I believe we need to forgo, \nin General Fogleman's terms, the ``Embarrassment of riches''.\n  Overall, I believe the committee has produced a fine defense bill, \nand I voted in favor of reporting it out of committee. It is imperative \nthat we maintain the additional $2.6 billion added to the \nadministration's request and I support the redirection of funds to the \nmodernization accounts. However, the allocation of some of those funds \nto unnecessary spending still warrants concern, and I urge my \ncolleagues to look carefully at these add-ons.\n  I ask unanimous consent two tables of objectionable programs be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\n  Objectionable programs in the fiscal year 1998 Senate Armed Services  \n                              defense bill                              \n                        [In millions of dollars]                        \n                         PROCUREMENT                                    \n                                                                        \nArmy: C-XX Medium-Range Aircraft (5).........................      23.0 \nNavy:                                                                   \n  SSN-21 (SEAWOLF)...........................................     153.4 \n  New Attack Submarine.......................................   2,600.0 \n  Advance Procurement for TAGS-65............................      75.2 \n  Other Propellers and Shafts................................      38.3 \n  Amphibious Raid Equipment..................................       1.6 \nAir Force:                                                              \n  C-130J Logistics...........................................      48.0 \n  WC-130J (3)................................................     177.0 \n  Logistic Support for WC-130J...............................      29.7 \n  EC-130J....................................................      70.5 \n  C-130J (2).................................................      95.8 \n  National Guard and Reserve Equipment.......................     653.0 \n                                                                        \n                   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT                             \n                                                                        \nArmy:                                                                   \n  University and Industry Research Centers...................       2.3 \n  Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology...................       4.0 \n  Medical Advanced Technology................................       4.6 \n  Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology..........       9.0 \n  DoD High Energy Laser Test Facility........................      10.0 \n  Army Research Institute....................................       3.6 \n  National Automotive Center.................................       4.0 \n  Plasma Energy Pyrolysis System.............................       8.7 \n  Radford Environmental Development and Mgmt.

Mr. President, I want to just for 10 seconds thank my \nfriend from Indiana, the most knowledgeable member of the Armed \nServices Committee on personnel issues, and his advocacy for what is \nright about this base closing issue. It is important and critical. I \nthink most of my colleagues will understand the argument he just made \nbecause we are going to pay for this in a big way if we don't reverse \nthe vote that was taken most recently. I yield.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 423, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment No. 423.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 423) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am pleased to say on behalf of Senator Thurmond, the \nranking member and I, are now ready to take up a series of amendments \nwhich have been agreed to by both sides. Following the adoption of \nthese amendments, I know of no reason why we cannot go to final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 666, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were considered and agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 594, as Modified\n\n  (Purpose: To consolidate and strengthen restrictions on the use of \n    human test subjects in biological and chemical weapons research)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF HUMANS AS EXPERIMENTAL \n                   SUBJECTS IN BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Prohibited Activities.--No officer or employee of the \n     United States may, directly or by contract--\n       (1) conduct any test or experiment involving the use of any \n     chemical or biological agent on a civilian population; or\n       (2) otherwise conduct any testing of biological or chemical \n     agents on human subjects.\n       (b) Inapplicability to Certain Actions.--The prohibition in \n     subsection (a) does not apply to any action carried out for \n     any of the following purposes:\n       (1) Any peaceful purpose that is related to a medical, \n     therapeutic, pharmaceutical, agricultural, industrial, \n     research, or other activity.\n       (2) Any purpose that is directly related to protection \n     against toxic chemicals and to protection against chemical or \n     biological weapons.\n       (3) Any military purpose of the United States that is not \n     connected with the use of a chemical weapon and is not \n     dependent on the use of the toxic or poisonous properties of \n     the chemical weapon to cause death or other harm.\n       (4) Any law enforcement purpose, including any domestic \n     riot control purpose and any imposition of capital \n     punishment.\n       (c) Biological Agent Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``biological agent'' means any micro-organism (including \n     bacteria, viruses, fungi, rickettsiac, or protozoa), \n     pathogen, or infectious substance, and any naturally \n     occurring, bioengineered, or synthesized component of any \n     such micro-organism, pathogen, or infectious substance, \n     whatever its origin or method of production, that is capable \n     of causing--\n       (1) death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a \n     human, an animal, a plant, or another living organism;\n       (2) deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or \n     materials of any kind; or\n       (3) deleterious alteration of the environment.\n       (d) Report and Certification.--Section 1703(b) of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (50 \n     U.S.C. 1523(b)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(9) A description of any program involving the testing of \n     biological or chemical agents on human subjects that was \n     carried out by the Department of Defense during the period \n     covered by the report, together with a detailed justification \n     for the testing, a detailed explanation of the purposes of \n     the testing, the chemical or biological agents tested, and \n     the Secretary's certification that informed consent to the \n     testing was obtained from each human subject in advance of \n     the testing on that subject.''.\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\n       (e) Repeal of Duplicative, Superseded, and Executed Laws.--\n     Section 808 of the Department of Defense Appropriation \n     Authorization Act, 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1520) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the managers of the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill and the committees for their \nassistance and support of my amendment.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. This historic treaty puts into U.S. law a clear prohibition \non the testing, production, and stockpiling of an entire class of \nterrible weapons of mass destruction, and we are now part of the \ninternational institutions which will enforce the treaty worldwide.\n  Even with this clear ban, constituents have written me concerned \nthat, without their consent, human test subjects are used to research \nchemical and biological weapons agents, or that the Government, with \nthe consent of local elected officials and Congress, may conduct \nexperiments on civilian populations. Very often, these concerns are \nbased on reading existing provisions in the United States Code that \nappear to permit it. The provision in question, contained in title 50, \nUnited States Code, Chapter 32, Section 1520, is a relic of the cold \nwar, and my amendment strikes it.\n  Further, to make it clear that such testing is no longer permitted, \nthis amendment spells out a clear, easily understood prohibition of the \nuse of human test subjects in chemical and biological weapons research. \nTo prevent confusion, this amendment spells out the distinction between \nweapons testing and such peaceful medical research such as the search \nfor a cure for AIDS or developing vaccines for deadly diseases. But to \nmake sure that even this peaceful research is not misused, my \namendments adds a new reporting requirement for the Pentagon to \ndescribe in detail every year exactly what sort of medical and peaceful \nresearch is conducted and requires the Department of Defense to certify \nthat full informed consent was obtained in advance from anybody \nparticipating in this research. Congress, and most importantly, the \npublic must have the best possible information about these programs.\n  A provision that, on the surface, appears to permit testing of \nchemical weapons on civilian populations has no place in U.S. law, and \nI thank my colleagues for joining me in striking it.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 595 as modified\n\n     (Purpose: Reports on procedures for providing information and \n  assistance to families of victims of Department of Defense aviation \n                               accidents)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1041. REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FAMILY \n                   NOTIFICATION AND ASSISTANCE PROCEDURES IN CASES \n                   OF MILITARY AVIATION ACCIDENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a need for the Department of Defense to \n     improve significantly the family notification procedures of \n     the department that are applicable in cases of Armed Forces \n     personnel casualties and Department of Defense civilian \n     personnel casualties resulting from military aviation \n     accidents.\n       (2) This need was demonstrated in the aftermath of the \n     tragic crash of a C-130 aircraft off the coast of Northern \n     California that killed 10 Reserves from Oregon on November \n     22, 1996.\n       (3) The experience of the members of the families of those \n     Reserves has left the family members with a general \n     perception that the existing Department of Defense procedures \n     for notifications regarding casualties and related matters \n     did not meet the concerns and needs of the families.\n       (4) It is imperative that Department of Defense \n     representatives involved in family notifications regarding \n     casualties have the qualifications and experience to provide \n     meaningful information on accident investigations and \n     effective grief counseling.\n       (5) Military families deserve the best possible care, \n     attention, and information, especially at a time of tragic \n     personal loss.\n       (6) Although the Department of Defense provides much needed \n     logistical support, including transportation and care of \n     remains, survivor counseling, and other benefits in cases of \n     tragedies like the crash of the C-130 aircraft on November \n     22, 1996, the support may be insufficient to meet the \n     immediate emotional and personal needs of family members \n     affected by such tragedies.\n       (7) It is important that the flow of information to \n     surviving family members be accurate and timely, and be \n     provided to family members in advance of media reports, and, \n     therefore, that the Department of Defense give a high \n     priority, to the extent practicable, to providing the family \n     members with all relevant information on an accident as soon \n     as it becomes available, consistent with the national \n     security interests of the United States, and to allowing the \n     family members full access to any public hearings or public \n     meetings about the accident.\n       (8) Improved procedures for civilian family notification \n     that have been adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration \n     and National Transportation Safety Board might serve as a \n     useful model for reforms to Department of Defense procedures.\n       (b) Reports by Secretary of Defense.--(1) Not later than \n     December 1, 1997, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the advisability of establishing a \n     process for conducting a single, public investigation of each \n     Department of Defense aviation accident that is similar to \n     the accident investigation process of the National \n     Transportation Safety Board. The report shall include--\n       (A) a discussion of whether adoption of the accident \n     investigation process of the National Transportation Safety \n     Board by the Department of Defense would result in benefits \n     that include the satisfaction of needs of members of families \n     of victims of the accident, increased aviation safety, and \n     improved maintenance of aircraft;\n       (B) a determination of whether the Department of Defense \n     should adopt that accident investigation process; and\n       (C) any justification for the current practice of the \n     Department of Defense of conducting separate accident and \n     safety investigations.\n       (2) Not later than April 2, 1998, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on assistance provided by \n     the Department of Defense to families of casualties among \n     Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the department. The \n     report shall include--\n       (A) a discussion of the adequacy and effectiveness of the \n     family notification procedures of the Department of Defense, \n     including the procedures of the military departments; and\n       (B) a description of the assistance provided to members of \n     the families of such personnel.\n       (c) Report by Department of Defense Inspector General.--(1) \n     Not later than December 1, 1997, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Defense shall review the procedures of the \n     Federal Aviation Administration and the National \n     Transportation Safety Board for providing information and \n     assistance to members of families of casualties of \n     nonmilitary aviation accidents, and submit a report on the \n     review to Congress. The report shall include a discussion of \n     the following matters:\n       (A) Designation of an experienced non-profit organization \n     to provide assistance for satisfying needs of families of \n     accident victims.\n       (B) An assessment of the system and procedures for \n     providing families with information on accidents and accident \n     investigations.\n       (C) Protection of members of families from unwanted \n     solicitations relating to the accident.\n       (D) A recommendation regarding whether the procedures or \n     similar procedures should be adopted by the Department of \n     Defense, and if the recommendation is not to adopt the \n     procedures, a detailed justification for the recommendation.\n       (d) Unclassified Form of Reports.--The reports under \n     subsections (b) and (c) shall be submitted in unclassified \n     form.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 598, as modified\n\n  (Purpose: To add a subtitle relating to Persian Gulf war illnesses)\n\n       On page 226, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n                   Subtitle B--Persian Gulf Illnesses\n\n     SEC. 721.

Mr. President, this amendment will help address the \ncritical educational needs of the children of the fine soldiers and \nairmen serving at Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina.\n  Across America, many communities surrounding major military \ninstallations are at a great disadvantage by having large numbers of \nmilitary-connected schoolchildren, yet they receive nowhere near \nadequate impact aid. Harnett County in North Carolina is one of them. \nHarnett County is a relatively rural, agricultural county; that has \nexperienced tremendous growth in its military-connected student \npopulation during the last decade.\n  Many soldiers stationed at Fort Bragg, and airmen assigned to Pope \nAir Force Base, have found a home in Harnett County because of its \npeaceful quality of life, its proximity to the bases and many other \ndesirable aspects. According to one housing developer, 98 percent of \nthe families buying in his community are military families. Harnett \nCounty has welcomed these newcomers but, in so doing, has struggled for \nthe past several years to provide the basic services required to \naccommodate this burgeoning population.\n  Mr. President, Harnett County's schools have been especially impacted \nby this influx of military dependents. Recent years have seen thousands \nof students added to the rolls of Harnett County's school system. This \ngrowth has resulted in severe overcrowding in Harnett County schools. \nMany children have been forced to attend classes in temporary \nfacilities, such as cafeterias, gymnasiums, auditorium stages, \nlibraries, and trailers. In some schools, students must wait in line up \nto an hour even to use the bathroom.\n  Mr. President, projections indicate that Harnett County taxpayers \nwill have to spend $87,000,000 for new schools within the next decade \nmerely to keep up with this growth. As a rural county, Harnett has \nlittle industry or commercial development that can be used to generate \nsignificant tax dollars for school construction. The county simply does \nnot have nearly enough resources to build more schools to serve these \nmilitary dependents without substantial assistance.\n  The Federal Government has an obvious obligation to provide for the \neducation of military dependents. Because of the nature of military \nservice which requires frequent moves and reassignments, military \nfamilies seldom have an opportunity to establish strong roots in a \ncommunity or to become active in local schools. The Federal Government \nhas a duty to ensure that these parents, who are prepared to risk their \nlives and go to war in 18 hours to serve our country, need not worry \nabout the quality of education afforded their children.\n  For almost 50 years, Federal law has addressed the costs incurred by \nlocal communities in the education of military dependents through the \npayment of impact aid. These payments are designed to alleviate local \ngovernment's inability to raise revenue for schools in the customary \nmanner of raising property taxes since they are constitutionally \nprohibited from taxing installation property. These payments are not \nintended to benefit the local governments, but are intended to insure \nthat service-members' children are not treated as second-class citizens \nand thereby disadvantaged by their parents' devotion to their country.\n  Nevertheless, the responsibility for making these payments has been \nremoved from the Department of Defense and placed upon the Department \nof Education over the years. In so doing, the Federal Government has \nsteadily reduced its payments to local educational agencies that serve \nthese children. Despite rhetoric in support of education to the \ncontrary, the President's own budget punishes these children by \nproposing a reduction of $72 million or 10 percent below the fiscal \nyear 1997 level. I have always believed that the Federal Government has \na limited role in education, but clearly, it has a role when its \nactions place a direct negative economic impact upon a community, such \nas Harnett County.\n  Some may argue that we owe no obligation to communities surrounding \nmilitary bases. They may say that because communities now compete to \nretain military bases that our duties are mitigated. Our duty is owed \nto the service member, not the community. Besides, every community \nsurrounding a military installation does not share equally in the \neconomic benefit of having the installation closeby. For example, \nHarnett is the only county in the Fort Bragg impact area that suffers \nan economic loss due to its being adjacent to Fort Bragg. According to \nthe latest statistics, Harnett County loses at least $122,000 per year \nbecause of Fort Bragg.\n  Adding to the education funding crisis, Fort Bragg purchased an \nadditional 7,000 acres in the county last year. That purchase nearly \ndoubled the amount of land the Federal Government owns in Harnett. This \npurchase caused Harnett County to permanently lose an additional \n$24,000 in annual tax revenues. The projected fiscal year 1997 impact \naid payment to Harnett County is only $37,712. Compare that to the \n$278,177 that the county would receive if impact aid basic support \npayments were fully funded.\n  During the past few years, I have worked closely with concerned \nHarnett County leaders, including the school board and county \ncommissioners, Army officials at Fort Bragg and here at the Pentagon, \nliterally spending hundreds of hours working to try to address these \ncritical Army needs. If I may quote from a March 9, 1995, letter by \nthen Fort Bragg commanding general, Lt. Gen. Henry Shelton to Secretary \nof the Army Togo West:\n\n       I sympathize with counties that have to educate our \n     children, especially those, like Harnett County, that have \n     recently experienced a substantial increase in the number of \n     students from military families. I am concerned that the U.S. \n     Department of Education is providing less impact aid for some \n     military family members than for others, and that this \n     disparity in impact aid might adversely affect the quality of \n     education that some of our military family members are \n     receiving. We should be providing the same high level of \n     assistance for every child. Education is a key component of \n     quality of life. For this reason, we should make every effort \n     to ensure that all of our military family members receive a \n     quality education regardless of where they live.\n\n  General Shelton, of whom I am extremely proud, is now a four-star \ngeneral in charge of the military's special operations command, went on \nto say to Secretary West ``[my staff] offered to assist Harnett County \n* * * [and] discussed the possibility of conveying to Harnett County \nparcels of land for the construction of schools.''\n  General Shelton's commitment to the well-being of his troops has been \ncontinued by his successor as commanding general, Lt. Gen. John Keane, \nwho is and has been working closely with civilian leaders such as Mike \nWalker, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Logistics \nand Environment. They have determined that two outparcels that the Army \nowns are not required for future Army use. Mr. President, as a result \nof this decision, both General Keane and Secretary Walker sent letters \nto me a day or so ago, supporting the conveyance of two small parcels \nof land to Harnett county for educational and economic development \npurposes. I ask unanimous consent that these two letters dated July 9, \n1997, be printed in the\n\n[[Page S7265]]\n\nRecord at this point, following which I shall continue my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Army,\n\n                                     Fort Bragg, NC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Jesse A. Helms,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: This letter details my recollection of \n     the discussions I and other Army representatives had with you \n     leading up to the Army's recent acquisition of the former \n     Rockefeller property commonly known as ``Overhills.''\n       It was discussed that, along with the main property of \n     approximately 11,000 acres vitally needed by Fort Bragg for \n     military training, there were also two noncontiguous \n     outparcels totaling about 300 acres. These outparcels were of \n     limited training value due to their small size and location, \n     each surrounded by private property. I do not believe their \n     inclusion in the purchase materially affected the overall \n     cost of Overhills. Rockefeller representatives simply wanted \n     to sell all the property together to one buyer.\n       In the discussions, there was also agreement to support any \n     subsequent legislation intended to declare the outparcels \n     excess property and transfer them to the county in which they \n     are located. I continue to support such a transfer.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                John M. Keane,\n\n                                               Lieutenant General,\n     U.S. Army, Commanding Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Department of the Army,\n\n\n                            Office of the Assistant Secretary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: As you know, the Army recently acquired \n     approximately 11,000 acres in order to help alleviate the \n     overall shortfall in training lands at Fort Bragg. The \n     property included two outparcels of land (Tract No. 404-1, \n     containing approximately 137 acres, and Tract No. 402-2, \n     containing approximately 157 acres), noncontiguous to the \n     installation and noncontiguous to each other. The Army has \n     determined that these properties will not be used for \n     training or other purposes due to their size, configuration, \n     and location. These parcels did not contribute significantly \n     to acquisition costs and are not required for future Army \n     use.\n       I hope this information is helpful for your purposes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert M. Walker,\n         Assistant Secretary of the Army, (Installations, \n           Logistics & Environment).\n\n  Mr. HELMS. The map shows that neither of these small parcels of land \nis contiguous to the primary training areas at Fort Bragg--known as the \nNorthern Training Area and Overhills property; they are also \nnoncontiguous to each other. These properties are open farmland, \nsurrounded by private property, without the foliage and terrain that \nArmy units stationed at Fort Bragg require for operational training.\n  Mr. President, local leaders and Army officials had planned for the \nArmy to provide a long-term lease for the construction of three \nschools--an elementary school, a junior high school, and a high school \non land lying along N.C. 87 which crosses the recently acquired \nOverhills property. Over the last several months, they mutually agreed \nto forego that arrangement because of concerns that placement of \nschools in that area would impose restrictions on training and \nnegatively impact the habitat of the red-cockaded woodpecker. Together, \nthey agreed that the ideal location for these new schools was on the \nopen tracts the Army had previously identified as being available for \nconveyance to the county.\n  Last year, North Carolina voters approved a bond referendum for the \nconstruction of new schools. I am told that to use those funds, the \ncounty must own the land. Therefore, a long-term lease by the Army on \nthese parcels would not be useful to the county or the Army. It is \ncritical that parcel No. 404-2 be transferred now since Harnett County \nplans to break ground on construction later this year in an attempt to \nfinally catch-up with the increasing demand for education imposed by \nthe children of military personnel. This amendment further authorizes \nthe Secretary of the Army to sell parcel No. 404-1 at fair market \nvalue.\n  Mr. President, North Carolinians are proud of the several great \nmilitary installations within our borders. For more than 50 years, \nNorth Carolinians have been especially proud of Fort Bragg, home of the \nU.S. Army's elite XVIII Airborne Corps, the 82d Airborne Division, and \nour Special Operations Forces. These units and other units stationed at \nFort Bragg are on the front line of our Nation's defense; standing \nready to deploy anywhere, any time, to preserve freedom in the world.\n  Just 2 days ago, we were reminded once again about the price of \nliberty. Eight soldiers at Fort Bragg were tragically lost when their \nBlackhawk helicopter crashed. The victims have been identified and \ntheir families notified but the cause of the crash is still being \ninvestigated.\n  Those who have served in the military understand the sense of family \nand community that exists among those, particularly those who have \nvolunteered to put themselves in harm's way, for the benefit of their \nfellow-citizens. These courageous and selfless Americans use the \ninstruments of war to secure our peace and prosperity. Each of these \nbrave Americans experiences a feeling of loss when one of their own is \nlost. The North Carolinians who live around Fort Bragg share that sense \nof loss. Those citizens and the Fort Bragg family have embraced the \nfamilies of the lost soldiers and are doing all they can to comfort \nthem at this tragic time.\n  I spent four nonheroic years in the Navy during World War II. I have \nalways had great affection and respect for the soldiers and defense \nsupport personnel who devote their lives to the defense of our country. \nI will do anything in my power to ensure that they are provided \neverything they need to do their jobs.\n  This includes not merely providing an adequate training area, \nequipment and hardware; but also the quality of life and peace of mind \nto enable each soldier to focus on his mission, accomplish it, and \nreturn home safely. Unmistakably essential to that quality of life is \nthe proper education of their children.\n  Listen again to the words of General Shelton, ``[e]ducation is a key \ncomponent of quality of life. For this reason, we should make every \neffort to ensure that all of our military family members receive a \nquality education regardless of where they live.''\n  Mr. President, a vote against this amendment is a vote against the \nArmy's senior civilian and military leaders charged with responsibility \nfor the readiness and well-being of these fine men and women at Fort \nBragg.\n  A vote against this amendment is a vote against their children who \ndepend upon us to help educate them so that they too can serve their \ncountry when they grow to adulthood.\n  Mr. President, I do hope Senators will support this amendment which \ntakes a small step toward addressing the educational needs of the \nchildren of our Nation's finest soldiers. It's the right thing to do \nand I am confident that Senators will agree.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 628\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on options for the disposal of chemical \n                          weapons and agents)\n\n       At an appropriate place in title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

DESIGNATING THE Y-12 PLANT IN OAK RIDGE, TENNESSEE \n                   AS THE NATIONAL PROTOTYPE CENTER.\n\n       The Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee is designated as the \n     National Prototype Center. Other executive agencies are \n     encouraged to utilize this center, where appropriate, to \n     maximize their efficiency and cost effectiveness.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Strom Thurmond, and the other members \nof the committee for supporting my amendment, which will designate the \nY-12 plant in Oak Ridge, TN as a ``National Prototype Center.''\n  Mr. President, for the first time in nearly half a century, the \nUnited States is neither designing nor producing any new nuclear \nweapons. The size of the U.S. nuclear stockpile is shrinking, and the \nsize of the nuclear weapons complex is shrinking along with it. That is \nappropriate.\n  However, as we reduce the physical size of our nuclear weapons \ncomplex, we must not allow the unique experience and expertise that \nhave developed at the nuclear weapons production plants to simply \ndisappear. Instead, we should use these unique resources to further \nenhance our national security and economic competitiveness.\n  The Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge has played a critical role in our nuclear \nweapons complex since 1943. Every weapon in the current U.S. nuclear \nstockpile contains some part that was manufactured at Y-12. In the \ncourse of fulfilling this critical mission, Y-12 and its workforce have \ndeveloped applied manufacturing expertise that is unsurpassed anywhere \nin this country. This makes Y-12 perfectly suited to become a National \nPrototype Center.\n\n[[Page S7267]]\n\n  Prototypes provide the first concrete test of a product after the \ninitial research and development have been performed. Businesses and \nthe military use prototyping to test their designs and to anticipate \nand prevent problems later in the production cycle.\n  However, circumstances in the 1990's have made prototyping more \ndifficult for both the military and industry. The threats facing our \nmilitary today are fundamentally different from those we faced during \nthe Cold War, and the defense budget has shrunk as well. This means \nthat the military must now produce defense systems in relatively small \nvolumes--sometimes as small as one. Commercial industries are facing \nsome of the same challenges, as they strive to produce smaller numbers \nof more customized products. These trends have made prototyping even \nmore important, but they have also made it prohibitively expensive in \nmany cases.\n  I believe that we will benefit as a nation if we find a way to \npreserve these important prototyping capabilities, and I believe the \nsolution lies with Y-12. Y-12 has already helped to develop numerous \nprototypes for the Department of Defense, NASA, and others, from \ncomponents for the Seawolf submarine's propulsion system to a new and \nmore advanced type of pencil lead. Designating Y-12 as a National \nPrototype Center will highlight Y-12's ability to rapidly transform \ncomplex hardware designs into precision prototypes through the use of \nadvanced manufacturing techniques. It will also allow customers to take \nadvantage of the resources of a world-class national laboratory--the \nOak Ridge National Laboratory--which is located in close proximity to \nthe Y-12 plant.\n  Mr. President, this National Prototype Center will not only enhance \nour national security by preserving vital weapons manufacturing \nexpertise, it will also enhance our economic security by helping to \nsolve tough problems for U.S. industries so that they can get their \nproducts to the global marketplace more quickly. And it will be cost-\neffective.\n  The American taxpayers have already invested billions of dollars in \nthe equipment and expertise that reside at Y-12. It makes little sense \nfor that investment to be duplicated by other Federal agencies or U.S. \nindustries. At a time when cost control is a major consideration in \ndeveloping new weapons systems and commercial products, it makes sense \ninstead for others to take advantage of existing state-of-the-art \nfacilities at Y-12. My amendment would allow them to do just that, and \nI thank my colleagues for supporting it.\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 714, AS MODIFIED\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to conduct an explosive \n           munitions demilitarization demonstration program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 235 DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM ON EXPLOSIVES DEMILITARIZATION \n                   TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       (a) Program Required.--During fiscal year 1998, the \n     Secretary of Defense may conduct an alternative technology \n     explosive munitions demilitarization demonstration program in \n     accordance with this section.\n       (b) Commercial Blast Chamber Technology.--Under the \n     demonstration program, the Secretary shall demonstrate the \n     use of existing, commercially available blast chamber \n     technology for incineration of explosive munitions as an \n     alternative to the open burning, open pit detonation of such \n     munitions.\n       (c) The Secretary shall use competitive procedures in \n     selecting participants for the demonstration program \n     described in subsection (b). In addition the Secretary shall \n     include a cost benefit analysis of this technology generally \n     for explosives munitions destruction.\n       (d) Assessment.--The Secretary shall assess the relative \n     benefits of the blast chamber technology and the open \n     burning, open pit detonation process with respect to the \n     levels of emissions and noise resulting from use of the \n     respective processes.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than the date on which the President \n     submits the budget for fiscal year 2000 to Congress pursuant \n     to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit a report on the results of \n     the demonstration program to the Committee on Armed Services \n     of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the \n     House of Representatives. The report shall include the \n     Secretary's assessment under subsection (c).\n       (e) Funding.--(1) Of the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated under section 201(4), $6,000,000 is available \n     for the demonstration program under this section.\n       (2) The amount provided under section 201(4) is hereby \n     increased by $6,000,000 for the explosives demilitization \n     technology program (PE 63104D).\n       (3) The amount provided under section 101(5) for special \n     equipment for user testing is hereby decreased by $6,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President this amendment would authorize an \nincrease of $6 million to the budget request for the Explosive \nDemilitarization Technology program (PE 63104D) to conduct a \ndemonstration program at Anniston Army Depot. This is a much needed \ndemonstration of current commercial off-the shelf blast chamber \ntechnology as an acceptable alternative to open burning/open pit \ndetonation (OB/OD) by reducing significantly emissions and noise caused \nby OB/OD. The demonstration has nation-wide application if successful \nand is in keeping with the military's program of continuing technology \nevaluation of demilitarization methods for existing conventional \nammunition as described in the Joint Demilitarization Study, September \n1995, page II-4-14, a study prepared for the Director, Environmental \nand Life Sciences, Defense Research and Engineering, Office of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Mr. President annually we spend millions of dollars on the production \nof new munitions of all types. At the other end of the pipeline however \nis the vexing problem of disposing of outdated munitions of all types. \nThe enormity of the problem for this Nation is this: The stocks managed \nby the Army, DOD's Manager for Conventional Ammunition (MCA), currently \nstored in 26 States totals approximately 449,308 tons of material and \ncosts over $12 million annually to store according to a DOD 1995 Joint \nDemilitarization Study. More serious however is the fact that the study \npredicts an additional 730,420 tons will be generated into that \nstockpile by the end of fiscal year 2001.\n  Let me state again the magnitude of the problem for the Nation: \nthrough the end of fiscal year 2001, over 1.2 million tons of material \nwill pass through or reside in the military conventional ammunition \naccount. This is enough ammunition to exceed 2800 earth covered \nmagazines and will cost over $1.2 billion to destroy if we assume that \nit costs approximately $120 million to destroy 107,000 tons of material \nusing fiscal year 1995 projections. The technology in the COTS blast \nchamber has the potential of mitigating local environmental concerns; \nthe potential of increasing destruction throughput; and is capable of \ndestroying in a safe and environmentally sound manner greater than 98 \npercent of the explosives the DOD stores utilizing particular bag house \ntechnology at locations in America, Europe, and the Pacific.\n  Alabama stores in excess of 22,437 tons of material ranking us fifth \nin size of stockpile. Environmental considerations are of paramount \nimportance to me and to a balanced national level demilitarized \nprogram. I think DOD, the Army, and the Joint Ordnance Commanders \nGroup, Demilitarization and Disposal Subgroup, are playing a major role \nin ensuring that our various storage sites, to include Anniston Army \nDepot, are in compliance with Federal, State, and local regulations. \nLikewise, I think the DOD is also quite sensitive to public opinion. \nWhile better cost-efficient ways must be found to destroy this \nincreasing amount of material, we must take advantage now of new \ntechnologies in the R stage to compliment the current OB/OD method of \ndestruction, with the view that not in the too distant future those \ntechnologies will not only replace aging organic demilitarization \nfacilities, but close the chapter on the risky OB/OD method before the \nenvironmental challenges close the book for us.\n  The JOCG cited three environmental challenges in a study to be \nconsidered in life cycle management of the demilitarization program. \nThey are: permitting facilities; disposal of residuals; and, cleanup. \nWith new technologies the effects of each can be mitigated and give \nlocal communities new hope that their environment will no longer be \nfouled by OB/OD.\n  Mr. President, on June 19 Anniston Army Depot received permission \nfrom the State of Alabama to proceed with the construction of its \nchemical weapons disposal facility. This is an emotionally charged \nissue, but one we are assured will be managed every step of the way \nwith safety of the operation and concern for the community as its\n\n[[Page S7268]]\n\nhighest priorities. Previous plants in our country are proving that \nthis can be done. However, conventional ammunition destruction lags \nbehind, in my opinion, on both counts. For this reason I strongly \nbelieve that a demonstration program at Anniston involving COTS blast \nchamber technology begins the long awaited opportunity to rid North \nAlabama of another type of munition material, that only grows more \nunstable with time and will furnish the date upon which the JOCG can \nmake full-scale development decision for other locations in the \ncountry.\n  Today, TOW missiles rounds, currently in storage, are experiencing \nstorage problems and must be dealt with as a higher destruction \npriority over older missiles. Storage quantities for TOW missiles \nreaches nearly 400,000 rounds. I cannot conceive that OB/O, in Alabama \nor anywhere else in the Nation, is the most efficient and most \nresponsible method of destruction for these missiles. Other \nmethodologies must be utilized and they must be demonstrated now.\n  Mr. President, the COTS blast chamber I am recommending for this \ndemonstration program is totally enclosed, constructed of steel and \nconsists of a hydraulic chamber door, exhaust fan and over-pressure \ncontrols. The chamber is large enough to accommodate the TOW missiles I \ndescribed. Noise measurements of 0.5 percent of what is allowable by \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration are cited by the \nmanufacturer. Emission controls for exhaust rates and temperatures are \nalso controlled. The chamber will work with Anniston's current Subpart \nX permits, and according to the manufacturer the blast chamber is 80 \npercent cleaner than OB/OD. These are pluses for any community in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, our environment will not wait; the munitions will not \nwait, and the people should not have to wait for the slow wheels of \ngovernment.

Mr. President, this amendment is critical to recognize \nthe mandate of the last Congress to stop assistance payments to the \nSchool District of Los Alamos, NM. under the auspices of the Atomic \nEnergy Community Act of 1955. It enables the high quality of education \nin northern New Mexico required to attract the staff of the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory--the staff that enables the laboratory to fulfill \nits Federal missions. And it recognizes that many school districts in \nthe vicinity of the laboratory are now contributing to the educational \nprograms required by the laboratory's staff and that these districts \nmust offer suitably challenging educational programs.\n\n[[Page S7269]]\n\n  The Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 enabled assistance payments \nfor communities and school districts impacted by the presence of major \natomic energy facilities. These facilities were primarily located in \nremote areas, to address the security concerns accompanying their \nmissions. Assistance payments were required in recognition of the \nnearly complete dependence of these cities on AEC facilities that did \nnot pay local taxes. It was also in recognition that the quality of the \nschools available in these communities played a critical role in the \nrecruitment and retention of personnel at these remote sites. And in \nthose early days, most of the laboratory staff lived in Los Alamos.\n  Over the years, most of these atomic energy communities moved to \neither attain economic self-sufficiency or were close enough to self-\nsufficiency that they could accept buyout provisions to enable their \nself-sufficiency.\n  Of school districts, only Los Alamos still needed these payments. In \nlast year's Energy and Water Appropriations Act, we noted that fiscal \nyear 1997 would be the last payment to the Los Alamos schools under the \nAtomic Energy Community Act of 1955. The Department was directed to \ndevelop other approaches for continued funding needs.\n\n  The amendment we consider here today represents a critical step in \nproviding required resources for the Los Alamos schools. It implements \nthe plan developed by the Department to fulfill the congressional \nmandate. It recognizes that the personnel required at Los Alamos are \nnow resident in many communities, not only Los Alamos, in the remote \nareas of northern New Mexico. The requirement to provide educational \nprograms that will aid in recruitment and retention for the staff of \nLos Alamos National Laboratory is still present, but many school \ndistricts now house the workers for the laboratory--not only Los \nAlamos. Those districts also need enriched programs to accomplish their \ncontribution to the laboratory's Federal mission. In response to the \ncongressional mandate, the Department developed the concept of an \neducational foundation in northern New Mexico, that can supply \neducational enrichment funding to these school districts.\n  This amendment authorizes funding to start this foundation and \nspecifies that only interest from the initial Federal investment will \nbe used for educational enrichment programs. The Department intends to \nfund this foundation, pending appropriations, over a period of about 5 \nyears, during which time it will build the foundation's funding to a \nlevel to supply appropriate levels of enrichment funding to those \ndistricts impacting laboratory workers.\n  The amendment is an important step in stopping further funding under \nthe Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 and fulfills the mandate of the \nprevious Congress.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, section 3161(c) of the fiscal year 1996 \nNational Defense Authorization Act called for the Department of Energy \nto examine the need for continued funding of the Los Alamos School \nDistrict and to make recommendations to the Congress. If the \nDepartment's recommendation indicates a need for further assistance for \nthe school board or the county, as the case may be, after June 30, \n1997, the recommendation shall include a report and plan describing the \nactions needed to eliminate the need for further assistance for the \nschool board or the county, including a proposal for legislative action \nto carry out the plan.\n  The amendment that I am offering today, with my colleague the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, is the result of this planning process, \ninvolving the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Department of Energy, \nand the Los Alamos school board, and takes a major step toward \ndownsizing the Department's contribution to the Los Alamos School \nDistrict.\n  The amendment provides for a Federal payment in fiscal year 1998 of \n$5 million to a foundation that will support educational excellence in \nthe schools serving the children of Los Alamos employees. This Federal \npayment will be matched by a contribution by the University of \nCalifornia--out of its contract fee for managing and operating Los \nAlamos National Laboratory--and by private fundraising in the State. \nThe amendment further provides that the interest earned on any Federal \npayment will remain with the foundation, instead of reverting to the \nU.S. Treasury, as would be the case absent a special provision to the \ncontrary. In our discussions with the majority members of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee on this amendment, we have agreed that future \npayments to the foundation from the Department will be in order, so \nthat the corpus of the endowment is sufficient to sustain excellence in \nthe school system, but that more analysis is required to arrive at an \noverall figure for such additional support. This is the first step \ntoward bringing to a close the annual payment to the school district.\n  It is important to recognize that the Los Alamos School District is \nsubject to a number of special conditions that makes the development of \nalternative funding sources difficult.\n  The State of New Mexico funds its public schools under an \nequalization formula. Thus, the Los Alamos School District is not \nfunded from local property taxes directly, but from a State-wide fund \ninto which all such property taxes go. This factor represents an \nimportant constraint on the ability of the community to tax itself to \nenhance its school system. As part of the agreement that resulted in \nthis legislative proposal, the school board has agreed to seek special \nlegislation in New Mexico that would allow it to raise revenues to \nsupplement the State-mediated funding.\n  Because of its geographic isolation and lack of developable land, Los \nAlamos is one of the highest-cost-of-living communities in New Mexico, \nwith a cost of living 40 percent higher than the State average and 23 \npercent higher than the average for all of the United States. Thus, \neven though Los Alamos receives the same State funding as other \ncomparably sized school districts, in Los Alamos the dollars do not go \nas far.\n  Setting up an educational foundation to help shoulder the burden that \nthe Department has been carrying makes good sense. Further, the Los \nAlamos School District has committed to a number of actions that will \nfurther decrease the need for Department of Energy support in the \nfuture. It will increase fees to students for various activities, \nimplement energy efficiency measures, and reduce administrative costs. \nAlready, this year the Los Alamos School District has reduced its \nspending by roughly $900,00 through such measures, and it will continue \nto examine contracts and functions in the future in order to reduce \ncosts.\n  The Department of Energy and the Congress have always recognized that \nthe quality of the local school system is a significant factor is many \nrelocation decisions involving personnel whom Los Alamos National \nLaboratory would like to attract and retain. The national interest in \nmaintaining the strength of the laboratory translates into a need to \nhave a mechanism that will produce a superior school system in the \ncommunities which are home to the technical employees of the \nlaboratory. This proposal is a major step toward doing that at reduced \ncost to the Government, and I urge its adoption.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 763, as modified\n\n  (Purpose: To congratulate Governor Christopher Patten of Hong Kong)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill at the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to comment on the \nproposed technical amendment I have offered to section 1070 of S. 936, \nthe fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense authorization bill. \nSpecifically, section 1070 would grant the Secretary of the Air Force \nthe authority to convey to the Planes of Fame Museum in Chino, CA, a B-\n17 aircraft known as the ``Picadilly Lilly.'' It is my understanding \nthat the aircraft is in need of repairs, and the museum would be \nwilling to do the necessary work on the B-17 provided the museum had \nclear title to the aircraft.\n  Technically, it is my understanding that the aircraft is historical \nproperty under the administration of the U.S. Air Force Museum, which \nis located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH. It is also \nmy understanding that the Air Force Museum has been attempting to work \nout an agreement with the Planes of Fame Museum that would allow for \nthe latter facility to take the B-17 in exchange for other historical \nproperty. I am told the Air Force Museum is prepared to continue to \nwork in good faith with the Planes of Fame Museum to arrive at an \nexchange that is mutually beneficial.\n  The technical change I am offering simply is designed to ensure that \nif the Secretary of the Air Force exercises the discretion provided in \nsection 1070, the Secretary determine appropriate compensation in \nexchange for the B-17. The provision, as amended, now would provide the \nSecretary with the authority to convey the aircraft, after determining \nan appropriate level of compensation, and securing other conditions of \nconveyance. I certainly hope that the Secretary of the Air Force and \nthe Air Force Museum will work together with the Planes of Fame Museum \nto reach an agreement that is in the best interests of all parties.\n  Mr. President, let me close by thanking my distinguished friend from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner; the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. \nThurmond; and their staffs for their assistance with this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 808\n\n  (Purpose: To establish at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center a pilot \n   program of higher education with respect to the administration of \n business relationships between the Federal Government and the private \n                                sector)\n\n       On page 353, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1107.

The mathematics \nare clear. This program serves a vital training need: modern \nsophisticated, and high quality electronic countermeasures training. It \nis far cheaper to provide this training using cheaper-to-operate \ncommercial jet aircraft than our military fighters.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has a history of supporting this \nprogram and believes that it has resulted in significant savings to the \nAir Force and Air National Guard. I am pleased that Senator Coverdell \njoin me in offering this amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n\n[[Page S7271]]\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 811\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure the President and Congress receive unencumbered \nadvice from the directors of the national laboratories, the members of \n  the Nuclear Weapons Council, and the commander of the United States \n Strategic Command regarding the safety, security, and reliability of \n              the United States nuclear weapons stockpile)\n\n       On page 347, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS REGARDING THE \n                   SAFETY, SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY OF UNITED \n                   STATES NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on \n     earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on \n     nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using \n     weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of \n     the nuclear stockpile are essential to ensure its credibility \n     as a deterrent.\n       (2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       (3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States \n     is prohibited by section 507 of the Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102-377; 42 \n     U.S.C. 2121 note) from conducting underground nuclear tests \n     ``unless a foreign state conducts a nuclear test after this \n     date, at which time the prohibition on United States nuclear \n     testing is lifted''.\n       (4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the Secretary of Energy to ``establish and \n     support a program to assure that the United States is in a \n     position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued \n     deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons \n     designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive \n     test ban on nuclear explosive testing is negotiated and \n     ratified.''.\n       (5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the President to submit an annual report to \n     Congress which sets forth ``any concerns with respect to the \n     safety, security, effectiveness, or reliability of existing \n     United States nuclear weapons raised by the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program of the Department of Energy''.\n       (6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that ``to \n     assure that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under \n     a test ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our \n     confidence in the safety, reliability, and the performance of \n     our weapons''. This decision was codified in a Presidential \n     Directive.\n       (7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1994 also requires that the Secretary of \n     Energy establish a ``stewardship program to ensure the \n     preservation of the core intellectual and technical \n     competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons''.\n       (8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the \n     safety and reliability of the United States nuclear stockpile \n     is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. \n     The ability of the United States to maintain warheads without \n     testing will require development of new and sophisticated \n     diagnostic technologies, methods, and procedures. Current \n     diagnostic technologies and laboratory testing techniques are \n     insufficient to certify the future safety and reliability of \n     the United States nuclear stockpile. In the past these \n     laboratory and diagnostic tools were used in conjunction with \n     nuclear testing.\n       (9) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed ``the \n     establishment of a new annual reporting and certification \n     requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe \n     and reliable under a comprehensive test ban''.\n       (10) On the same day, the President noted that the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the \n     responsibility, after being ``advised by the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, \n     and the Commander of United States Strategic Command'', to \n     provide the President with the information to make the \n     certification referred to in paragraph (9).\n       (11) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code, is responsible \n     for providing advice to the Secretary of Energy and Secretary \n     of Defense regarding nuclear weapons issues, including \n     ``considering safety, security, and control issues for \n     existing weapons''. The Council plays a critical role in \n     advising Congress in matters relating to nuclear weapons.\n       (12) It is essential that the President receive well-\n     informed, objective, and honest opinions from his advisors \n     and technical experts regarding the safety, security, and \n     reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.\n       (b) Policy.--\n       (1) In general.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (A) to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear \n     weapons stockpile; and\n       (B) as long as other nations covet or control nuclear \n     weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, to retain a \n     credible nuclear deterrent.\n       (2) Nuclear weapons stockpile.--It is in the security \n     interest of the United States to sustain the United States \n     nuclear weapons stockpile through programs relating to \n     stockpile stewardship, subcritical experiments, maintenance \n     of the weapons laboratories, and protection of the \n     infrastructure of the weapons complex.\n       (3) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) the United States should retain a triad of strategic \n     nuclear forces sufficient to deter any future hostile foreign \n     leadership with access to strategic nuclear forces from \n     acting against our vital interests;\n       (B) the United States should continue to maintain nuclear \n     forces of sufficient size and capability to hold at risk a \n     broad range of assets valued by such political and military \n     leaders; and\n       (C) the advice of the persons required to provide the \n     President and Congress with assurances of the safety, \n     security and reliability of the nuclear weapons force should \n     be scientifically based, without regard for politics, and of \n     the highest quality and integrity.\n       (c) Advice and Opinions Regarding Nuclear Weapons \n     Stockpile.--Any director of a nuclear weapons laboratory or \n     member of the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council, or the Commander \n     of United States Strategic Command, may submit to the \n     President or Congress advice or opinion in disagreement with, \n     or in addition to, the advice presented by the Secretary of \n     Energy or Secretary of Defense to the President, the National \n     Security Council, or Congress, as the case may be, regarding \n     the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile.\n       (d) Expression of Individual Views.--A representative of \n     the President may not take any action against, or otherwise \n     constrain, a director of a nuclear weapons laboratory, a \n     member of the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council, or the Commander \n     of United States Strategic Command for presenting individual \n     views to the President, the National Security Council, or \n     Congress regarding the safety, security, and reliability of \n     the nuclear weapons stockpile.\n       (e) Definitions.--\n       (1) Representative of the president.--The term \n     ``representative of the President'' means the following:\n       (A) Any official of the Department of Defense or the \n     Department of Energy who is appointed by the President and \n     confirmed by the Senate.\n       (B) Any member of the National Security Council.\n       (C) Any member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       (D) Any official of the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (2) Nuclear weapons laboratory.--The term ``nuclear weapons \n     laboratory'' means any of the following:\n       (A) Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (B) Livermore National Laboratory.\n       (C) Sandia National Laboratories.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 812\n\n(Purpose: To authorize a land conveyance, Hancock Field, Syracuse, New \n                                 York)\n\n       On page 409, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2819.

The cost of the survey shall be borne by the \n     County.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under subsection (a) as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to cointroduce legislation \nwith Senator Moynihan that would greatly assist economic development in \nSyracuse, NY. This legislation concerns Hancock Field in Syracuse. \nThere are two parcels of land there that the Air Force Base Conversion \nAgency intends to dispose of, and would be of great value to the \nHancock Field Development Corp. In this amendment, we ask\n\n[[Page S7272]]\n\nthat these parcels of land be conveyed to the corporation so that they \nmay use the land to further economic development in the region and \nincrease jobs.\n  The first parcel of land was formerly the base housing management \narea. It is at a strategic spot on Performance Drive because it is \nneeded to complete a major access way to the industrial airpark. The \nsecond parcel is 15 acres at the center of the airpark which is \ncurrently the site of the 152d Air Control Group, which is moving to a \nnew location very soon. This parcel is owned by the Federal Government \nand will be declared surplus and disposed of through the traditional \nGSA property disposal process, rather than the BRAC disposal process.\n  These small actions will have a big effect on the redevelopment at \nHancock. I am very pleased that this amendment has been agreed to. I \nwould also like to thank Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin, the \nranking member on the Armed Services Committee. Their leadership in \ngetting this important legislation passed was very instrumental.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 813\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize a land conveyance, Havre Air Force Station, \n               Montana, and Havre Training Site, Montana)\n\n       On page 409, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2819. LAND CONVEYANCE, HAVRE AIR FORCE STATION, MONTANA, \n                   AND HAVRE TRAINING SITE, MONTANA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Authorized.--(1) The Secretary of the Air \n     Force may convey, without consideration, to the Bear Paw \n     Development Corporation, Havre, Montana (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Corporation''), all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to the real property \n     described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The authority in paragraph (I) applies to the following \n     real property:\n       (A) A parcel of real property, including any improvements \n     thereon, consisting of approximately 85 acres and comprising \n     the Havre Air Force Station, Montana.\n       (B) A parcel of real property, including any improvements \n     thereon, consisting of approximately 9 acres and comprising \n     the Havre Training Site, Montana.\n       (b) Conditions of Conveyance.--The conveyance authorized by \n     subsection (a) shall be subject to the following conditions:\n       (1) That the Corporation--\n       (A) convey to the Box Elder School District 13G, Montana, \n     10 single-family homes located on the property to be conveyed \n     under that subsection as jointly agreed upon by the \n     Corporation and the school district; and\n       (B) grant the school district, access to the property for \n     purposes of removing the homes from the property.\n       (2) That the Corporation--\n       (A) convey to the Hays/Lodgepole School District 50, \n     Montana--\n       (i) 27 single-family homes located on the property to be \n     conveyed under that subsection as jointly agreed upon by the \n     Corporation and the school district;\n       (ii) one barracks housing unit located on the property;\n       (iii) two steel buildings (nos. 7 and 8) located on the \n     property;\n       (iv) two tin buildings (nos. 37 and 44) located on the \n     property; and\n       (v) miscellaneous personal property located on the property \n     that is associated with the buildings conveyed under this \n     subparagraph; and\n       (B) grant the school district access to the property for \n     purposes of removing such homes and buildings, the housing \n     unit, and such personal property from the property.\n       (3) That the Corporation--\n       (A) convey to the District 4 Human Resources Development \n     Council, Montana, eight single-family homes located on the \n     property to be conveyed under that subsection as jointly \n     agreed upon by the Corporation and the council; and\n       (B) grant the council access to the property for purposes \n     of removing such homes from the property.\n       (4) That any property conveyed under subsection (a) that is \n     not conveyed under this subsection be used for economic \n     development purposes or housing purposes.\n       (c) Reversion.--If the Secretary determines at any time \n     that the property conveyed pursuant to this section which is \n     covered by the condition specified in subsection (b)(4) is \n     not being used for the purposes specified in that subsection, \n     all right, title, and interest in and to such property, \n     including any improvements thereon, shall revert to the \n     United States, and the United States shall have the right of \n     immediate entry thereon.\n       (d) Description of Property.--The exact acreages and legal \n     description of the parcels of property conveyed under \n     subsection (a) shall be determined by surveys satisfactory to \n     the Secretary.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer an amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization measure providing for the \nconveyance of the Havre Air Force Station and Training Site in \nnorthcentral Montana to the Bear Paw Development Corp.\n  These two facilities comprise over 90 acres of real property. \nSeventy-seven buildings are located on the property, including 45 \nsingle family homes. The U.S. Air Force deactivated these facilities in \n1993 although it has maintained the facilities since that time.\n  Members of the Bear Paw Development Corp. include Hill, Blaine, \nLiberty, and Chouteau Counties, the cities of Havre, Chinook, Harlem, \nand Fort Benton, the town of Chester and the Fort Belknap and Rocky \nBoy's Tribal Governments. It was officially recognized by the U.S. \nEconomic Development Administration in 1968 and has received similar \nrecognition from the State of Montana as well.\n  Bear Paw Development provides a variety of community and economic \ndevelopment services to its members including helping local governments \nplan for infrastructure improvements and secure needed financing. It \nalso provides training and technical assistance to businesses through \nthe Small Business Development Center and the Montana Microbusiness \nProgram.\n  My amendment provides that Bear Paw will convey the single family \nhomes as well as several other buildings to the Box Elder School \nDistrict adjacent to the Rocky Boy's Reservation and the Hays/Lodgepole \nSchool District on the Fort Belknap Reservation. Both school districts \nwill use the buildings for classrooms and school facilities.\n  In addition the Human Resource Development Council in Havre will \nreceive eight homes which it will use to house the homeless.\n  The real property and remaining structures will be utilized by Bear \nPaw for local economic development projects.\n  Mr. President, this conveyance results in several important benefits: \nRelieving the Air Force and taxpayers of the responsibility of \npreserving deactivated facilities, helping local school districts \nprovide adequate and safe school facilities for their students, and \npromoting economic stability and growth in northcentral Montana. Truly \nall parties will benefit from this transfer.\n  Thank you for your consideration.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 814\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize the production of tritium in commercial \n                              facilities)\n\n       On page 444, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3139.

Mr. President, I am pleased the committee has adopted an \namendment Senator McCain and I have offered which requires the General \nServices Administration to conduct a Federal screening of property \nconveyed by the Department of Defense. This amendment also requires \nthat GSA provide Congress with a statement of value for any real \nproperty which is conveyed by the Department of Defense.\n  This provision will codify a process which started when I was \nchairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, and which was continued by \nSenator McCain when he was chairman. I congratulate and thank Senator \nInhofe and Senator Robb for accepting this amendment. In previous \nyears, this informal process sought to ensure that taxpayer's interests \nwere partially protected, by conducting an expedited 30-day screen \nconducted by the General Services Administration for other Federal \ninterest of each proposed land conveyance in the defense authorization \nbill. Because these land conveyance provisions implicitly waive the \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act, the committee cannot \nassure taxpayers that the Federal Government is not seeking to acquire \nproperty that is similar to what the legislative provisions are giving \naway.\n  Now, Mr. President, some have suggested that screening this property \nfor Federal interest is just a bureaucratic procedure that delays the \nproductive use of property which the member in his or her judgment \nbelieves to be the best interest of his or her constituents. Others \nhave suggested that this process is a waste of time because the \nexpedited screening policy implemented by Senator McCain and myself \nnever resulted in property being flagged for other Federal use.\n  I would like to address each of these points.\n  First, Federal screening is the law of the land. If Congress, and the \nArmed Services Committee in particular, believe that it is no longer \nnecessary, the appropriate action is to amend the Federal Property and \nAdministrative Services Act.\n  Now let me explain why Federal screening of excess property makes \nsense. I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record, at the \nconclusion of my remarks, a chart provided by the General Services \nAdministration entitled, ``Recent Examples of Excess Real Property \nScreened by GSA with Federal Agencies and Subsequently Transferred to \nother Federal Agencies for Continued Federal Use.''\n   Mr. President, this chart shows why Federal screening of excess \nproperty saves taxpayer dollars. The chart lists five examples, \nincluding two from the Department of Defense, where excess property \nfrom one agency was transferred to another Federal agency as a result \nof the screening process. The total value of property in these five \nexamples is almost $36 million. What this means, Mr. President, is that \nthe screening process saved Federal taxpayers $36 million because the \nreceiving agencies were able to utilize property which the holding \nagency no longer needed.\n  I would expect that my colleagues who speak of the importance of \nbalancing the budget and are so-called deficit hawks would be \ninterested in the result of GSA's valuation of these properties.\n  So to conclude, I am pleased that the committee has accepted this \namendment. As a result I do not intend to offer the amendment I have \nfiled on the individual land conveyance provisions. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure that this provision is retained in \nconference.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  RECENT EXAMPLES OF EXCESS REAL PROPERTY SCREENED BY GSA WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES AND SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFERRED TO \n                              OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR CONTINUED FEDERAL USE \\1\\                              \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Holding agency                     Property name             Acres    Receiving agency        Value    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAir Force.......................

DOD/VA COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n       Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by section \n     201(4), $15,000,000 shall be available for the DOD/VA \n     Cooperative Research Program. The Secretary of Defense shall \n     be the executive agent for the funds authorized under this \n     section.\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to \nfurther a valuable, mutually beneficial affiliation between the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans' Affairs by \nauthorizing a $15 million increase for the DOD/VA Cooperative Research \nProgram. This program encourages health-related research which benefits \nboth veterans and active duty military personnel. In fact, fostering \nthis collaborative relationship was the original intent of the DOD \nappropriation, back when this program began in 1987. It has been funded \nevery year since then. Funding for this amendment is made available \nfrom the Army procurement, specifically, special equipment for user \ntesting.\n  Each year, the DOD/VA Cooperative Research Program begins with \njointly selected, specific research topics, and the Departments, \nworking together, come up with priorities for research areas and the \nappropriate funding levels. The VA and DOD jointly designate \nrepresentatives to oversee the entire process. The result is research \nwhich provides a strong, direct link between DOD and VA investigators \nto pursue research of mutual interest, and facilitates research that \nfollows the natural course of disease or injury in individuals, first \nas active duty military personnel, and then as veterans.\n  I am cosponsoring this amendment with Senator Durbin and Senator \nSpecter who also believe that the joint research program reaps \ntremendous\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\nbenefits. I thank the distinguished junior Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor his willingness to reach agreement on this amendment.\n  In fiscal year 1997, DOD and VA agreed to spend the funds provided \nfor this program on such areas as a new Environmental Epidemiology \nResearch Center and studies on combat casualty care including bone \nhealing, blood replacement, skin repair, vascular repair, and spinal \ncord injury. Last year's program also yielded expanded research on \nprostate cancer and emerging pathogens.\n  In addition, I am particularly encouraged by a new research program \non psychiatric disease and post-traumatic stress disorder targeted at \nidentifying risk profiles for soldiers who might have a higher \nprobability of developing PTSD. This PTSD-prevention program will be \ndeveloping methods to screen potential combat-ready soldiers for PTSD. \nAs the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have \nwitnessed the devastating effects of PTSD on the lives of former \nmilitary personnel, and I am enormously encouraged by research which \nmay prevent the onset of PTSD.\n  Because of the collaborative nature of the joint program, this \namendment does not specify research areas for focus. Rather, it leaves \nthat decision with the Departments. Given the number of unanswered \nquestions surrounding the illnesses and health problems of gulf war \nveterans, however, I am optimistic the DOD and VA will want to pursue \nmore research in this area to help identify effective treatments and \nrecognize the battlefield risks that our troops face in today's \nwarfare. This research would not only address the current health \nproblems of gulf war veterans, it will also help identify prevention \nmeasures for future deployments. As the nature of war changes, the \nmodern military must cope with threats that include environmental \nhazards and possible biological or chemical warfare, as well as the \nmore traditional hazards of combat. Research is needed to ensure that \nwe are ready to meet these new risks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nfrom West Virginia and Illinois in offering an amendment which would \nauthorize continued funding for the successful program of medical \nresearch conducted jointly by the Departments of Defense and Veterans \nAffairs.\n  This important and cost-effective program began in 1987 and has been \nfunded at approximately $20 million per year every year since then.\n  This research partnership is built on the concept of joint DOD-VA \npolicy making, scientific review, and research performance. Research \nefforts are targeted at areas of mutual DOD-VA concern such as \nmutations in microorganisms that become known pathogens and are \nencountered by soldiers in foreign environments, trauma and wound \nhealing, and stress-related chronic illnesses including PTSD and the \npossible effect of stress on undiagnosed symptoms experienced by \nPersian Gulf War veterans.\n  The Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs are joined by their \ncommon responsibilities to the men and women who are first service \nmembers, but subsequently become veterans. In the DOD-VA Cooperative \nResearch program each Department brings unique strengths to the table \nto advance their joint missions and commitments. Perhaps that is why \nDOD's Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar, Director, Environmental and Life \nSciences, has been quoted as saying ``Our investigators are very \nenthusiastic about participating in these joint initiatives.''\n  Mr. President, both the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs \nwill benefit from the approval of this amendment. Even more \nimportantly, the men and women who now wear the uniforms of our Armed \nForces and who will one day become veterans will reap the benefits of \nthe medical research authorized by this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I applaud the authorization of $15 million \nfor the DOD-VA Cooperative Research Program. Authorization of these \nfunds will guarantee the continuation of this laudable research effort.\n  The DOD-VA Cooperative Research Program supports important research \nthat contributes significantly to the health missions of both DOD and \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs [VA]. Since 1987, the VA medical and \nprosthetics research appropriation has been supplemented by funds \ntransferred to VA under a cooperative agreement with DOD. The DOD-VA \nresearch program has become a truly collaborative effort and one that \nis mutually beneficial to both DOD and VA. The work performed under \nthis program addresses conditions affecting both active duty personnel \nand veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, the consequences \nof exposure to environmental hazards, wound repair, brain and spinal \ncord injury, and skin and vascular repair. No other program supports \nthis type of mission-relevant cooperative research.\n  I expect that with this funding, areas of mutual interest to DOD and \nVA in the fields of medical and psychological research will continue. \nSpecifically, this funding encourages innovative endeavors in \naccordance with the five jointly established programs: the DOD-VA \nenvironmental epidemiology research center; research on psychological \ndiseases and post-traumatic stress disorder; cardiovascular fitness; \nresearch in prostate cancer and emerging pathogens; and casualty care \nenhancement.\n  It is imperative for the health and well-being of our veterans and \nactive-duty military personnel that Congress continue to fund this \nimportant initiative by authorizing $15 million for the DOD-VA \nCooperative Research Program. This is the least that we can do in \nrecognition of the invaluable service rendered by our veterans and \nmilitary personnel.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 817\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the process of \nenlarging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be a continuous \n                                process)\n\n       On page 347, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING EXPANSION OF THE \n                   NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) met on \n     July 8 and 9, 1997, in Madrid, Spain, and issued invitations \n     to the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland to begin accession \n     talks to join NATO.\n       (2) Congress has expressed its support for the process of \n     NATO enlargement by approving the NATO Enlargement \n     Facilitation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 \n     note) by a vote of 81-16 in the Senate, and 353-65 in the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) The United States has assured that the process of \n     enlarging NATO will continue after the first round of \n     invitations in July.\n       (4) Romania and Slovenia are to be commended for their \n     progress toward political and economic reform and meeting the \n     guidelines for prospective membership in NATO.\n       (5) In furthering the purpose and objective of NATO in \n     promoting stability and well-being in the North Atlantic \n     area, NATO should invite Romania, Slovenia, and any other \n     democratic states of Central and Eastern Europe to accession \n     negotiations to become NATO members as expeditiously as \n     possible upon the satisfaction of all relevant membership \n     criteria.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that NATO should be commended--\n       (1) for having committed to review the process of enlarging \n     NATO at the next NATO summit in 1999; and\n       (2) for singling out the positive developments toward \n     democracy and rule of law in Romania and Slovenia.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this week, Heads of State and Government of \nthe member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance met in Madrid and \nagreed to expand of NATO by inviting the Czech Republic, Hungary, and \nPoland to begin accession talks with NATO. These central European \ncountries were always considered the likely first nations to be invited \nto join since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergency of \ndemocracy in these countries.\n  Since the end of Soviet hegemony in Central and Eastern Europe, these \ncountries have strived to break free from the oppressive burden of \nState controlled economies and one party governments with great \nsuccess. I applaud the advances which these nations have made.\n  There are other nations which deserve recognition for their enormous \naccomplishments. While their successes have been more recent, they \nnonetheless have demonstrated a commitment in a positive direction \nwhich should be acknowledged and encouraged. Both Romania and Slovenia \npresent a tremendous case for NATO enlargement. While the \nadministration\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\nhas determined not to pursue their accession at this time, I believe \nthat these nations have made significant strides which certainly \nrecommend them for NATO membership in the near term.\n  The Senate has supported the concept of expanding NATO for those \nemerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, which have \nstruggled and successfully shaken the yoke of their former communist \nsystems. In October 1996, Congress voted overwhelmingly by 81 to 16 to \napprove the NATO Facilitation Act. This bill provides valuable \nresources to assist these nations in making essential changes to their \ndefense structure in order to help prepare them for NATO membership.\n  Last month in the State Department bill, the Senate included Romania, \nthe Baltics, and Bulgaria as eligible for this assistance. This \npositive step reflects the progress in democracy-building and economic \ndevelopment being undertaken in these nations. I believe that more \nneeds to be done to encourage these new democracies along the positive \npath they are following. They need firm commitments and a clear \nunderstanding that NATO is not off limits to them.\n  The amendment I am proposing, along with Senator Breaux, Senator \nBrownback, and Senator Gordon Smith, is a sense of Senate that NATO \nstrongly signal other Central and Eastern European nations that \nenlargement process will not end with these first three nations. The \ncommunique from the NATO Madrid Summit states that:\n\n       The Alliance expects to extend further invitations in \n     coming years to nations willing and able to assume the \n     responsibilities and obligations of membership, and as NATO \n     determines that inclusion of these nations would serve the \n     overall political and strategic interests of the Alliance and \n     that the inclusion would enhance overall European security \n     and stability.\n\n  There should be invitations extended to other nations that meet the \ncriteria for membership at the NATO summit associated with the 50th \nanniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty in April 1999. It is important \nfor the United States and NATO to continue to clearly demonstrate the \nintention to continue to enlarge NATO based on the progress of these \nemerging democracies. By so doing, NATO sends an unmistakable message \nto other central European countries that they will have an opportunity \nto become a part of NATO as they continue to strengthen democratic \ninstitutions, pursue free market economies, and modernize their \nmilitary in support of NATO objectives.\n  I believe that Romania presents a particularly strong case for future \nmembership. Last November, the people of Romania voted overwhelmingly \nto elect Emil Constantinescu as their new President. His election \ndemonstrated that Romanians wanted to firmly put the communist era--\nwhich had dominated Romania's Government and economy--behind them. In \nvoting to oust Ion Iliescu in favor of Constantinescu, they rejected \nstate socialism, stagnant economies, corrupt government practices in \nsearch of a revitalized economy, a new political openness and \nreconciliation, and a pro-western posture. With Constantinescu they got \na reform-committed President and a parliament to match. The process of \nchange in Romania is now firmly in place.\n  Romania's new Government has initiated price liberalization and \nprivatization. They are enacting laws to encourage greater foreign \ninvestment, a step which was desperately needed. The President has been \nclear from the start that economic reform would be difficult but the \nRomanian people have continued to support his policies. The \ninternational financial institution's recognize Romania's positive \necomomic steps and have reward them accordingly. In April the \nInternational Monetary Fund announced a loan of $430 million to Romania \nand the World Bank loans of up to $530 million.\n  In addition, Romania has put aside historic differences with its \nneighbors. They have produced political agreements with Hungary and \nUkraine to reconcile border disputes and resolve ethnic tensions. \nIndeed, President, Constantinescu has showed a tremendous effort to \nreach out to the Hungarian ethnic minorities in Romania by bringing \nHungarians into the government.\n  As a military alliance, NATO needs to take seriously the commitment \nof prospective members to contribute to NATO's collective security. \nRomania has also shown the commitment needed to bring its military to \nmodern standards. They have expressed a willingness to take on the \nresponsibilities and costs associated with NATO membership. Romania was \nthe first nation to join the Partnership for Peace program and have \nparticipated in missions in Bosnia and Albania as well as other \npeacekeeping missions. They understand that NATO is not a one-way \nsecurity arrangement. Romania fully intends to contribute effectively \nto the security and stability of the alliance. They are already \nincreasing their defense budget and their military is firmly under \ncivilian control. They are incorporating new training procedures to \nconform with NATO standards. In addition, Romania is well on its way to \nmeeting the considerable interoperability objectives established by \nNATO.\n  I believe also that Romania's geographical location would serve \nNATO's strategic considerations as well. Romania's membership would be \nan important asset in strengthening NATO's southern flank and provide a \nkey geostrategic position at the Black Sea.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment as a commitment to \ncontinue the process of a NATO enlargement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 818\n\n(Purpose: To provide for research, development, test, and evaluation of \n         Multitechnology Integration in Mixed-Mode Electronics)\n\n       On page 46, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 220. MULTITECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION IN MIXED-MODE \n                   ELECTRONICS.\n\n       (a) Amount for Program.--Of the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated under section 201(4), $7,000,000 is available \n     for Multitechnology Integration in Mixed-Mode Electronics.\n       (b) Adjustments to Authorization of Appropriations.--(1) \n     The amount authorized to be appropriated under section 201(4) \n     is hereby increased by $7,000,000.\n       (2) The amount authorized to be appropriated under section \n     101(5) and available for special equipment for user testing \n     is reduced by $7,000,000.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes \nappropriations of $7,000,000 for a project called multitechnology \nintegration in mixed-mode electronics. It is a project that will help \ngive the United States a military advantage over our potential \nadversaries because it will support the development of technologies far \nsuperior to the off-the-shelf technologies that are becoming available \nto all nations on the global markets.\n  As technologies are developed and commercialized, they become more \nstandardized, mass produced, and widely available. We need to move \nbeyond this cycle and find unique ways to integrate technologies into \nproducts that offer superior performance and are not available off-the-\nshelf.\n  This appropriation increase is offset by a reduction in the Army's \nprocurement appropriation for purchasing special equipment for user \ntesting.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 819\n\n (Purpose: To authorize a multiyear contract for the Family of Medium \n                       Tactical Vehicles (FMTV))\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 113. MULTIYEAR PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY FOR FAMILY OF \n                   MEDIUM TACTICAL VEHICLES.\n\n       Beginning with the fiscal year 1998 program year, the \n     Secretary of the Army may, in accoredance with section 2306b \n     of title 10, United States Code, enter into a multiyear \n     procurement contract for the procurement of vehicles of the \n     Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles. The contract may be for a \n     term of our years and include an option to extend the \n     contract for one additional year.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment would authorize the \nSecretary of the Army to enter into a multiyear procurement contract \nfor the family of medium tactical vehicles [FMTV]. This authority is \nsignificant for the following reasons:\n  First, the Army fleet of aging trucks, the backbone for our premier \nland force, has reached the end of its useful life and new trucks are \nrequired to support the heavy demand we place on these vehicles.\n  Second, the Army will complete acquisition of the first round of new\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\nFMTV trucks through an existing multiyear in 1998. The soldiers in the \nfield love these new trucks. They are reliable, capable, and are easily \nmaintained. We must continue to field these trucks to our soldiers as \nquickly as possible.\n  Third, the multiyear authority will be exercised within the current \nbudget and will result in 9.5 percent savings over the life of the \nmultiyear or $122.3 million. This means that the Army will be able to \nfield more trucks than would otherwise be possible with current budget \nconstraints.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the fielding of these trucks and \nbelieve that this multiyear will make the best use of available \nresources and will help our soldiers. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent a description of the background on the FMTV \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles [FMTV] Multi-Year\n\n       Sponsor: Senator Thurmond.\n       Amendment: Add a provision authorizing a multiyear program \n     for FMTV.\n       Background: The FMTV program has, after a somewhat rocky \n     start, provided extremely high quality medium trucks to \n     replace the aging truck fleet throughout the Army. The old \n     2.5 ton and 5 ton trucks that one sees in pictures from the \n     Vietnam era through some present day operations are in many \n     cases older than the soldiers driving them. The Army will \n     conclude its first multiyear program for the FMTV in mid-1998 \n     (fiscal year). To date, the Army has procured approximately \n     10,000 of these new trucks out of a requirement for 85,400. \n     The committee did not recommend a multiyear provision for \n     1998 as the Army failed to adequately fund the program (with \n     resources necessary to maintain production) and the follow-on \n     assumption that this failure does not demonstrate steady \n     fiscal support for this important piece of equipment.\n       Arguments to support a multiyear provision: Much needed \n     truck that needs to be fielded expeditiously to replace a \n     very old and costly fleet. Soldiers love the new trucks and \n     they are performing well.\n       Any action that would reduce the cost of this program must \n     be considered favorably.\n       The Army did request additional funding on its ``wish \n     list'' for the FMTV (thereby demonstrating support and \n     commitment to the program).\n       Authorizing a multiyear will result in a 9.5 percent cost \n     savings (over the four year life of the multiyear) or $122.3 \n     million dollars.\n       Arguments Against the Multiyear Provision: The Army failed \n     to adequately fund this program in 1998 and result would have \n     been a break in production (2-4 months). [Note--The committee \n     added $44 million to resolve this problem] This does not \n     demonstrate support for funding required for a program for \n     which they request a multiyear authority.\n       Recommendation: Support the multiyear provision.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 820\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of the Air Force to conduct a cost \n   and operation effectiveness analysis regarding ALR radar warning \n                               receivers)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 132.

FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Availability of Funds.--(1) Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 201(4) is hereby increased by \n     $5,000,000.\n       (2) Funds available under the section referred to in \n     paragraph (1) as a result of the increase in the \n     authorization of appropriations made by that paragraph may be \n     available for a facial recognition technology program. The \n     Secretary shall use competition procedures in selecting \n     participants for the program.\n       (b) Offset.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the amount authorized to be appropriated by section \n     201(1) is hereby decreased by $5,000,000.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my amendment would authorize an \nadditional $5 million for the DOD's Counter-Terrorism Technical Support \nProgram, to fund the development of facial recognition access control \ntechnology. FRAC technology is an innovative means of positively \nidentifying individuals, either singularly or in a crowd, for a range \nof security purposes. The Eigenface method of facial recognition is the \ncore technology of a new system that quickly recognizes and identifies \na person by capturing his or her face on a quickly scanning camera. \nThis new biometric identification method computes in each face a \ncharacteristic set of component images, or Eigenfaces, which can be \nused to positively identify an individual.\n  This rapid-scanning capability is superior to traditional ID cards, \nauthorization keypads, palm readers, and most retinal scanners. Unlike \nconventional systems, it can scan a crowd and pick out individual \nfaces, rather than require individuals to position themselves before a \nscanner. It is perfect for use at airports, border crossings, or \nwherever large numbers of people pass through for entry and time-\nconsuming identification procedures are not practical. This technology \nwill support the counter-terrorism effort the Congress established last \nyear, addressing one of the most pressing national security threats we \nface.\n  Mr. SMITH. I want to commend the Senator from Massachusetts for this \nvery useful amendment. Facial recognition is a critical tool in \nsecuring sensitive areas and safeguarding military and civilian \npersonnel. It will improve our ability to control access to critical \nfacilities and at our borders. I am glad to cosponsor this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to thank the Senator from New Hampshire for \nhis support of this important funding. The technology is inexpensive, \nwell-understood, and uses off-the-shelf-equipment. The Defense \nDepartment, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Department of \nJustice have all acknowledged the potential benefit of Eigenface \nidentification systems for their security needs. I am grateful for your \nsupport of the important provision.\n  I also want to mention that the source of the offset for this funding \nincrease is $5 million provided for travel and transportation of \npersonnel in the Army's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation \naccount. This reduction brings the account down to the same level \nprovided in fiscal year 1997. All of the other services have requested \nand been provided the same level of funding for this function in fiscal \nyear 1998 as they were provided in fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I believe that this amendment will help \nfill an important gap in our defense capability. I support this \nadditional $5 million for facial recognition technology.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I join Senators Kennedy, Smith, and Thurmond in their \nsupport of this innovative technology. It will have a dual role as an \naccess control device and for protecting the United States from the \never-increasing threat of terrorism.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 822\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on the Joint Statement on Parameters on \n Future Reductions in Nuclear Forces issued at Helsinki in March 1997)\n\n       On page 306, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1041. REPORT ON HELSINKI JOINT STATEMENT.\n\n       (A) Requirement.--Not later than March 31, 1998, the \n     President shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on the Helsinki joint statement on future \n     reductions in nuclear forces. The report shall address the \n     U.S. approach (including verification implications) to \n     implementing the Helsinki joint statement, in particular, as \n     it relates to: lower aggregate levels of strategic nuclear \n     warheads; measures relating to the transparency of strategic \n     nuclear warhead inventories and the destruction of strategic \n     nuclear warheads; deactivation of strategic nuclear delivery \n     vehicles; measures relating to nuclear long-range sea--\n     launched cruise missiles and tactical nuclear systems; and \n     issues related to transparency in nuclear materials.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Helsinki Joint Statement'' means the \n     agreements between the President of the United States and the \n     President of the Russian Federation as contained in the Joint \n     Statement on Parameters of Future Reductions in Nuclear \n     Forces issued at Helsinki in March 1997.\n       (2) The term ``START II Treaty'' means the Treaty Between \n     the United States of America and the Russian Federation on \n     Further Reduction and Limitation on Strategic Offensive Arms, \n     signed at Moscow on January 3, 1993, including any protocols \n     and\n\n[[Page S7277]]\n\n     memoranda of understanding associated with the treaty.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to express my support for a very \nimportant amendment offered by Senator Bingaman, a key member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  The bill before us is a critical one. It authorizes $269 billion for \nthe military activities of this country--everything from the pay for \nthe men and women who so capably serve this country to the aircraft, \ntanks and ships they operate to the housing in which they reside. This \nsingle bill provides for all of this. The members of the committee are \nto be commended for their excellent work.\n  Despite the numerous critical issues this bill does address, there is \none crucial area that the Senator from New Mexico and I think requires \nfurther attention--the status of our efforts with the Russians to \nimplement the START II agreement and, as importantly, design meaningful \nand verifiable measures to take us beyond the constraints of START II.\n  Mr. President, many in this body on both sides of the aisle believe \nthat reducing the number of existing nuclear weapons and controlling \ntheir spread to other countries represents the gravest challenge to our \nnational security. START II called for a limit of 3,500 deployed \nwarheads by 2003. At the Helsinki summit earlier this year, Presidents \nClinton and Yeltsin agreed to reduce this ceiling to 2,000 to 2,500 by \nthe end of 2007. In addition, they concurred on the need for exchanges \nof information about total United States and Russian stockpiles of \nstrategic warheads and about the elimination of excess warheads. \nFinally, they agreed to negotiate confidence-building ``transparency'' \narrangements such as on-site inspections.\n  These are all worthwhile measures and, in this Senator's opinion, \nvery timely. The Pentagon has already indicated it can protect this \nnation's interests and deter would-be aggressors with significantly \nfewer weapons than would be permitted under START II. I agree with this \nassessment. Therefore, like Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin, Senator \nBingaman and I think it's appropriate to explore doing much more than \ncalled for in START II.\n  That is the purpose of our amendment. We ask the President to submit \na report to Congress describing how the United States plans to \nimplement the Helsinki accords. The decisions reached at Helsinki will \nhave far-reaching implications for both the United States and Russia. \nWe hope that with this report, the administration will analyze the \nconsequences of their announced path as well as describe any other \nadditional approaches that merit further inquiry.\n  Despite the fact that the cold war ended nearly a decade ago, the \nUnited States and the Russians still maintain thousands of nuclear \nweapons poised to be launched within seconds of receiving notice to do \nso. None of these weapons are on bombers. The United States decided \nyears ago that it no longer needed to keep bombers on such a high alert \nstatus. However, we and the Russians each maintain roughly 3,000 \nweapons on ballistic missiles ready to go at the push of a button. With \nthis amendment, we hope the administration will consider whether \nkeeping such large numbers of weapons in such a high alert status \nremains in our national interest. As stated in a recent editorial by \nSenator Nunn and Bruce Blair, ``It is time to rethink the unthinkable. \nThe United States and Russia should cast off the mental shackles of \ndeterrence and make our nuclear relationship more compatible with our \npolitical relationship.'' The authors go on to state we can accomplish \nthis by first reducing the number of weapons we have poised to launch \nat a moment's notice. This report would address this important question \nas well as the other central elements contained in the Helsinki \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, with this amendment, we are asking the administration \nto examine the case made by Senator Nunn, Gen. Lee Butler, and many \nothers. Although we are requesting just a study of this issue, it is a \nstudy that could eventually lead us to a safer, more secure world. I \nbelieve this is the time, and this is the bill, for the Senate to \nexpress its desire to explore this course.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 823\n\n(Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate relating to the utilization \n           of savings derived from the base closure process)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2832. SENSE OF SENATE ON UTILIZATION OF SAVINGS DERIVED \n                   FROM BASE CLOSURE PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1988, the Department of Defense has conducted 4 \n     rounds of closures and realignments of military installations \n     in the United States, resulting in the closure of 97 \n     installations.\n       (2) The cost of carrying out the closure or realignment of \n     installations covered by such rounds is estimated by the \n     Secretary of Defense to be $23,000,000,000.\n       (3) The savings expected as a result of the closure or \n     realignment of such installations are estimated by the \n     Secretary to be $10,300,000,000 through fiscal year 1996 and \n     $36,600,000,000 through 2001.\n       (4) In addition to such savings, the Secretary has \n     estimated recurring savings as a result of the closure or \n     realignment of such installations of approximately \n     $5,600,000,000 annually.\n       (5) The fiscal year 1997 budget request for the Department \n     assumes a savings of between $2,000,000,000 and \n     $3,000,000,000 as a result of the closure or realignment of \n     such installations, which savings were to be dedicated to \n     modernization of the Armed Forces. The savings assumed in the \n     budget request were not realized.\n       (6) The fiscal year 1998 budget request for the Department \n     assumes a savings of $5,000,000,000 as a result of the \n     closure or realignment of such installations, which savings \n     are to be dedicated to modernization of the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Sense of Senate on Use of Savings Resulting From Base \n     Closure Process.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     savings identified in the report under section ______ should \n     be made available to the Department of Defense solely for \n     purposes of modernization of new weapon systems (including \n     research, development, test, and evaluation relating to such \n     modernization) and should be used by the Department solely \n     for such purposes.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this amendment will address concerns that \nwe have discussed here on the floor regarding the Base Realignment and \nClosure [BRAC] process.\n  Before the Congress ever considers to authorize future BRAC \ncommissions--a process which I strongly oppose, we should take a more \ndetailed look at whether those elusive savings from infrastructure \nreductions will ever be achieved. That is what I accomplish by the \namendment which I offer today.\n  Mr. President, I have consistently asked what has happened to savings \nfrom the past four BRAC actions. The Pentagon estimated savings from \nthe four previous base closing rounds to reach $57 billion over a 20-\nyear period with annualized savings of $5.6 billion per year starting \nin 2001. In its April 1995 report, the GAO estimate for such savings \nprojects the savings at less than half these numbers. GAO estimates \nthat the 20-year savings may be $17.3 billion, with annual recurring \nsavings possibly reaching $1.8 billion.\n  Mr. President, GAO conducted further analysis and issued a following \nreport in a April 1996. In this report, GAO found that the total amount \nof actual savings that may be estimated from BRAC actions is uncertain \nfor several reasons. One of which is that DOD accounting systems do not \nprovide adequate information or isolate their impact from that of other \nDOD initiatives.\n  Despite the fact that DOD has complied with legislative requirements \nfor submitting annual cost and savings estimates, the GAO further \nstates that the estimates' usefulness is limited because the estimates \nare not budget quality, and that the inclusion of the estimates of \nreduced personnel costs by all the services are not uniform and \nfurther, the GAO determined that certain community assistance costs \nwere excluded.\n  In one example, GAO identified the fact that DOD BRAC cost estimates \nexcluded more than $781 million in economic assistance to local \ncommunities as well as other costs.\n  Mr. President, in its December 1996 report, CBO stated that it was \nunable to confirm or assess DOD's estimates of cost savings because the \nDOD is unable to report actual spending and savings from BRAC actions.\n  So now Mr. President, we have the Pentagon, the GAO, and CBO with \ndiffering estimates on what has actually happened and what is supposed \nto happen as a result of the four previous BRAC rounds. There is no \nconsensus on the numbers--and that is a significant\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\nproblem. It seems everybody has a different number on the issue, and \nthere are numerous inconsistencies on the estimates of what the savings \nare supposed to be. And the Congress has been assured that starting in \nthe year 2001, the savings may in fact be realized. I question that \nassurance Mr. President, because I do not think we know what they will \nbe. But what we do know now, is that any savings from the past four \nbase closure rounds have yet to be realized.\n  Mr. President, the intent of DOD to streamline its infrastructure \ncost is not lost on us. We must recognize that the need to fill the \nprojected $17 billion gap between projected procurement funding and the \nprocurement funding objective of $60 billion. Mr. President, throughout \nthis year's DOD authorization process, the Congress has heard testimony \nfrom the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the \nrespective service chiefs and service secretaries, and to a person, \neach has testified on the importance of modernizing our military forces \nfor the 21st century. But Mr. President, that just is not happening.\n\n  Mr. President, the projections for national defense outlays decrease \n34.4 percent over the period from 1990 to 2002. We have all seen the \ndownward pressure on defense spending. Yet the future years defense \nplan [FYDP] calls for a 40-percent increase in the military's \nmodernization budget within the confines of an overall defense budget \nthat will more likely be flat at best. We have seen procurement funding \nplummet from $54 billion in 1990 to today's level of just over $42 \nbillion.\n  The U.S. military has undergone a significant transformation in the \npost-cold-war period. Specifically, from 1989 to 1997, DOD reduced \ntotal active duty end strength by 32 percent, with further reductions \nto 36 percent by 2003 as a result of the QDR. After the completion of \nfour previous base closure rounds, the world-wide base structure will \nhave been reduced by 26 percent, and domestic facilities will have been \nreduced by 21 percent. In more tangible numbers 97 of 495 major bases, \nas well as hundreds of smaller facilities and housing areas, and the \nrealignment of many other bases and facilities has already been \naccomplished by this process.\n  However, we are chasing elusive infrastructure savings, and there is \nno straight line corollary between the size of our forces and the \ninfrastructure required to meet two nearly simultaneous major regional \nconflicts. DOD has even admitted to GAO investigators that they do not \nhave accounting systems in place to isolate the impact of specific \ninitiatives, such as BRAC.\n  The amendment which I offer states that it is the sense of the Senate \nthat the savings through previous BRAC actions which are estimated by \nthe Department of Defense be made available to the Department solely \nfor the purpose of modernization of new weapons systems.\n  Mr. President, I am offering this amendment so that the Congress will \nsend a very clear message to this administration. The Congress \nrecognizes the limited resources that are available to the Department \nof Defense, and that we have to insure that these dollars are invested \nwisely. Not only so our military forces can meet the commitments of \ntoday, but also so our military forces will be prepared to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century, and continued to be the most capable \nmilitary force in the world.\n  Mr. President, we must send a very clear message that the past base \nclosure process which has been so devastating to many local communities \nwill actually result in savings that can be invested in our force \nmodernization.\n  Mr. President, that is what my amendment accomplishes, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 824\n\n  (Purpose: To conform limits for Department of Energy General Plant \n    Projects to recommendations from the Department contained in a \n            Congressionally mandated report on the subject)\n\n       On page 425, line 12, strike ``$2,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,000,000''.\n       On page 425, line 17, strike ``$2,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,000,000''.\n       On page 429, line 6, strike ``$2,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,000,000''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 825\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a pilot program relating to use of proceeds \nfrom the disposal or utilization of certain Department of Energy assets \n  for activities funded by the defense Environmental Restoration and \n                       Waste Management account)\n\n       On page 444, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3139.

ASSESSMENT OF THE CUBAN THREAT TO UNITED STATES \n                   NATIONAL SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has been an avowed enemy of Cuba for \n     over 35 years, and Fidel Castro has made hostility towards \n     the United States a principal tenet of his domestic and \n     foreign policy.\n       (2) The ability of the United States as a sovereign nation \n     to respond to any Cuban provocation is directly related to \n     the ability of the United States to defend the people and \n     territory of the United States against any Cuban attack.\n       (3) In 1994, the Government of Cuba callously encouraged a \n     massive exodus of Cubans, by boat and raft, toward the United \n     States.\n       (4) Countless numbers of those Cubans lost their lives on \n     the high seas as a result of those action of the Government \n     of Cuba.\n       (5) The humanitarian response of the United States to \n     rescue, shelter, and provide emergency care to those Cubans, \n     together with the actions taken to absorb some 30,000 of \n     those Cubans into the United States, required immeasurable \n     efforts and expenditures of hundreds of millions of dollars \n     for the costs incurred by the United States and State and \n     local governments in connection with those efforts.\n       (6) On February 24, 1996, Cuban MiG aircraft attacked and \n     destroyed, in international airspace, two unarmed civilian \n     aircraft flying from the United States, and the\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\n     four persons in those unarmed civilian aircraft were \n     killed.\n       (7) Since the attack, the Cuban government has issued no \n     apology for the attack, nor has it indicated any intention to \n     conform its conduct to international law that is applicable \n     to civilian aircraft operating in international airspace.\n       (b) Review and Report.--Not later than March 30, 1998, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall carry out a comprehensive review \n     and assessment of Cuban military capabilities and the threats \n     to the national security of the United States that are posed \n     by Fidel Castro and the Government of Cuba and submit a \n     report on the review to the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the \n     House of Representatives. The report shall contain--\n       (1) a discussion of the result of the review, including an \n     assessment of the contingency plans; and\n       (2) the Secretary's assessment of the threats, including--\n       (A) such unconventional threats as--\n       (i) encouragement of migration crises; and\n       (ii) attacks on citizens and residents of the United States \n     while they are engaged in peaceful protest in international \n     waters or airspace;\n       (B) the potential for development and delivery of chemical \n     or biological weapons; and\n       (C) the potential for internal strife in Cuba that could \n     involve citizens or residents of the United States or the \n     Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (c) Consultation on Review and Assessment.--In performing \n     the review and preparing the assessment, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall consult with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States \n     Southern Command, and the heads of other appropriate agencies \n     of the Federal Government.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 827\n\n    (Purpose: To require a report on fire protection and hazardous \n             materials protection at Fort Meade, Maryland)\n\n       On page 306, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1041.

Mr. President, I am offering an amendment to delete \nsection 1040 from the bill and replace it with an annual reporting \nrequirement.\n  Let me take just a moment to express my concerns with some activities \nof the General Accounting Office over the years. Starting with the \nPersian Gulf war, when the GAO sent auditors to the battlefield to \ninspect Apache helicopters, I have been concerned about the GAO's self-\ninitiated activities, particularly in the areas under the jurisdiction \nof the Armed Services Committee. In the past several years, the GAO has \nundertaken increasing numbers of self-initiated audits while relegating \ncongressionally mandated activities to a lower priority.\n  Because of this inappropriate prioritization, the committee included \na provision in the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill that \nwould require the Comptroller General of the United States to certify \nto Congress that all audits, evaluations, other reviews, and reports \nrequested by Congress or required by law are complete prior to the \ninitiation of any audits, evaluations, other reviews, and reports that \nare not required by Congress. I sponsored this provision because I \nbelieve it would make the GAO, a legislative branch agency, far more \nresponsive to the needs of the Congress.\n  I understand there are a number of concerns regarding this provision. \nOne concern is that this provision would effectively prevent the GAO \nfrom performing any valuable, self-initiated jobs that could save \nbillions of dollars. I find this extremely hard to believe. With 535 \nMembers of Congress, from different backgrounds and with varied \ninterests, it is hard to imagine a situation where the GAO could not \nfind a congressional sponsor for an audit which would save billions of \ndollars.\n  Another concern is that this provision is not in the jurisdiction of \nthe Armed Services Committee. Mr. President, it is because the GAO \ncontinues to perform a number of self-initiated jobs relating to issues \nunder the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, while the \nrequests of committee members are either canceled or remain unfinished, \nthat the committee decided to take action.\n  A third concern questions the necessity of such a provision. We have \nbeen told that only 20 percent of the GAO's work is self-initiated. \nFirst of all, I have concerns regarding the GAO's definition of what is \nself-initiated and what is requested by Congress. I understand that if \na staff member expresses some interest in an issue, an audit may be \ninitiated as a request of the Senator for whom that staff member works. \nI personally believe a signed request letter from a Member of Congress \nshould be required before an audit can be considered a congressional \nrequest. Furthermore, I have concerns that these numbers do not provide \na complete picture. Although only 20 percent of GAO's total workload \nmay be self-initiated, a far larger percentage of the work within a \nparticular division may be self-initiated. For example, I understand \nthat as of June 16, 1997, 50 percent of the work being performed by the \nNational Security and International Affairs Division was self-\ninitiated.\n  I am also troubled by what appears to be the pursuit of personal \nagendas by GAO personnel that permeates much of their work. Many of \nGAO's reports provide only one side of a story rather than the whole \npicture. Just as we require witnesses in a court of law to tell the \ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, we should require no \nless from the GAO. If we in Congress take the work of the GAO \nseriously, and use it in our efforts to make well-informed decisions \nthat serve the best interests of the American taxpayer, than GAO should \nbe expected to provide the entire picture rather than one side that \nserves the interests of a specific group.\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\n  Mr. President, despite my concerns and the GAO's demonstrated lack of \nresponsiveness, I have decided to amend my original language at the \npersonal request of Senators Thompson and Glenn. As the chair and \nranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I am sure that \nthey will do all they can to ensure that the work of the GAO is more \nresponsive and complete. However, if for some reason the GAO continues \nto demonstrate a disregard for the needs of the Congress, I intend to \nreintroduce the original language and rein in the rogue activities of \nthe GAO.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 830\n\n           (Purpose: To propose a substitute to section 363)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be stricken, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 363.

Administrative actions adversely affecting military training or \n              other readiness activities.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by Senator Chafee, I would like to explain why I \nbelieve that this amendment not only protects public health and the \nenvironment, but will also ensure that we will maintain a strong \nnational defense.\n  As my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee are aware, the \noriginal motivation of section 363 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, as reported, grew out of a series of executive \nagency actions in the various regions of the country that needlessly \nlimited or stopped ongoing training activities. In those instances, \nlong-scheduled training and readiness efforts of active duty, reserve \nand national guard forces were stopped in their tracks, because of the \nrash and unjustified actions of overzealous Federal bureaucrats.\n  Although the action taken by these low-level functionaries was within \ntheir powers, and met applicable public safety, welfare, and \nenvironmental statues, the timing and nature of the actions taken were \nneither justified nor appropriate given the lack of actual and \nimmediate implications to human health and the environment. As a result \nof these highly unjustified actions, troops who had to travel hundreds \nand sometimes thousands of miles, at considerable cost to the \ntaxpayers, were unable to conduct these critical training and readiness \nmissions.\n  The purpose of the original language offered in committee, would have \nallowed the Secretary of Defense to impose a 30-day moratorium on the \napplication of administrative or enforcement actions that could have a \nsignificant adverse effect on military readiness or training \nactivities. Although appreciating the justification for the language, \nthere were some, including Senator Chafee, who were concerned about the \nimpact that this language would have on existing public welfare, \nsafety, and environmental statutes. In order to address this concern, \nSenator Chafee and I, along with members of the Armed Services \nCommittee were able to fashion the compromise language that we are \noffering today, that will strike the proper balance in these \nsituations.\n  Under this language, if the Secretary of Defense discovers that an \nofficial of an Executive agency is proposing to take, or has taken an \nadministration action that will result in a significant adverse effect \non the training or readiness activities of the armed forces, the \nSecretary shall submit a written notification to the head of that \nagency, which will trigger a mandatory consultation between those two \nofficials. In addition, the Secretary's notification will trigger an \nimmediate moratorium on the application of the administrative action \nuntil 5 days after the notification, or until the head of the Executive \nagency and the Secretary are able to agree on an appropriate course of \naction, whichever is sooner. If the two officials are unable to agree \non a course of action, then the ultimate decision will be elevated to \nthe President.\n  One significant concern over the committee reported language was that \na 30-day moratorium was too stringent and could frustrate efforts to \navoid immediate, actual, and irreparable damage to human health and the \nenvironment. Subsection (D)(2) of this amendment provides that the head \nof the Executive agency can waive the moratorium if a determination is \nmade that the delay in the administrative action or proposed \nadministrative action will pose an actual threat of imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment to public health and the environment. This \nlanguage will not only strike an important balance between national \ndefense and public welfare concerns, but it will also avoid a \nreplication of past events undertaken by low-level bureaucrats. If the \nmilitary training activity will pose an actual threat of imminent and \nsubstantial endangerment to public health and the environment, that \ndecision will have to be taken by the head of the Executive agency. We \nbelieve that actions such as this, which will have a significant impact \non our national security, should be taken by the top decision\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\nmaker at the agency, who is in a better position to understand the full \ncomplexities of this decision, rather than some low-level government \nemployee.\n  I want to make one thing clear about this waiver however. The head of \nthe Executive agency must meet a higher threshold of use of this \nprovision than the tired and over-litigated test for the words imminent \nand substantial. The use of the words ``actual threat'' doesn't mean \njust a ``possible threat'' or a ``potential threat.'' Instead, it means \nthat if the training or readiness activity is undertaken that it is \n``highly likely'' or ``near certain'' that there will be an actual \nthreat to public health and the environment.\n  We must protect public health and the environment and we must ensure \nour national defense. When these issues come into conflict, we must \ntake special efforts to balance these issues. Decisions of this nature \nshould be made at the highest levels of our government, and because of \nthis language, they will.\n  I believe this is a very important amendment, and I appreciate the \nsupport of my colleagues for its adoption.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 831\n\n(Purpose: To recognize the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies as an \n            institution of the National Defense University)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 905.

Mr. President, last Monday I introduced an amendment \nthat could have helped ensure this bill is not vetoed by President \nClinton because it violates the bipartisan budget agreement. Today, we \nhave reached agreement on that amendment--but it does not go nearly far \nenough.\n  Let me lay out what this defense authorization bill does in very \nlarge terms. This bill adds $5.1 billion to the Pentagon's request. It \ndoes this by moving $2.4 billion from defense-related activities of the \nEnergy Department to the Defense Department--primarily in procurement \nand R The two Energy programs hardest hit are privatization of \ncleanup efforts and forward funding of asset acquisition.\n  My amendment sought to restore some of the privatization money \nbecause we have a huge problem at the Hanford Reservation that could be \nsolved with this new funding. We have 177-million-gallon tanks filled \nwith chemical and high-level radioactive waste located near the \nColumbia River. The environmental devastation at Hanford and other \nformer defense nuclear sites is truly mind-numbing. We must clean up \nthe mess we have made. Privatization offers us an opportunity to do \nthat and reduce costs and increase efficiency.\n  My amendment sought to restore $300 million of the $1 billion the \nPresident sought in this one-time shot in the arm of the environmental \nmanagement program. Instead, I was successful in securing only $59.7 \nmillion, making the amount this bill funds only $274.7 million. This is \na tremendous shortfall and could result in the Federal Government \nmissing legally enforceable cleanup milestones.\n  Mr. President, the House defense authorization bill is even worse--\nfunding the entire privatization program at only $70 million. Our \nSenate conferees must insist we keep the entire amount we have in this \nbill. Senator Gorton and I have the commitment of Sen. Thurmond that \nthe conferees will do that.\n  On the appropriations front, I was able to secure an extra $43 \nmillion yesterday in the Senate energy and water development \nappropriations bill. The privatization account increased from $300 \nmillion to $343 million. Again, the House is rumored to be far, far \nlower--and the appropriation's conferees will have a difficult job \nahead to keep even these greatly diminished funds.\n  We made a huge mess at Hanford while we were fighting and winning the \ncold war. Now we must pay the debt the federal government owes to these \ncold warrior communities. And this bill takes a small step--but just \ndoesn't do the job. However, I do want to thank the committee for \naccepting my amendment and I look forward to working with the chairman \nand ranking member to ensure these numbers remain in the bill this \nCongress sends to the President.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthis amendment offered by my colleague from Washington State, Senator \nMurray, and me which would increase budget authority for the Department \nof Energy's Environmental Management Program by $50 million.\n  It is absolutely essential that the Senate provide as high a level of \nfunding for the Department's privatization program as possible. Like \nSenator Murray, I am particularly interested in this program because of \nthe tank waste remediation system [TWRS] privatization program at \nHanford. The Hanford Nuclear Reservation houses over 55 million gallons \nof hazardous nuclear and chemical wastes in 177 underground storage \ntanks located near the Columbia River. The TWRS program was established \nto manage, retrieve, treat, and immobilize and dispose of these wastes \nin a safe and cost effective manner.\n  Under the TWRS program, the contractors are responsible for \ndemonstrating the technical and business viability of using privatized \nfacilities to treat and immobilize Hanford tank wastes; define and \nmaintain required levels of nuclear, radiological, and occupational \nsafety; maintain environmental protection and compliance; and reduce \ncosts and remediation time.\n  Under the privatization program, a contractor can recover the \nresources it has invested only through the delivery of acceptable \nservices paid for by the DOE on a fixed-unit-price basis. The \nunderlying intent is to transfer the primary share of the financial, \nperformance and operational responsibility for the treatment effort \nfrom the government to the private contractor.\n  TWRS and similar privatization efforts if done correctly and with \nproper oversight will allow for significant cost savings and represent \nan opportunity to use private-sector means and innovative technologies \nto accelerate cleanup. Without TWRS privatization, it is unlikely we \ncan meet the long-term cleanup compliance milestones at Hanford. If \nTWRS privatization is not pursued, the project will need to be funded \nfrom the base environmental management account which will necessitate \ncuts elsewhere in the DOE cleanup program--not only at Hanford but at \nsites throughout the country.\n  In order for the privatization concept to work, enough funds must be \nprovided in budget authority to send the appropriate signal to Wall \nStreet and the investment community that Congress is committed to this \nproject. Funding TWRS at a level as close to the President's budget \nrequest is vitally important to the success of this program. Increasing \nfunding for this program by $50 million would bring total funding for \nprivatization to $265\n\n[[Page S7282]]\n\nmillion--the same figure that we appropriated on the Appropriations \nCommittee yesterday. I urge support for this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 833\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of Defense to grant a blanket \nwaiver of the applicability of certain domestic source requirements to \nforeign country so as not to impede cooperative projects or reciprocal \n            procurements of defense items with such country)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 809. BLANKET WAIVER OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC SOURCE \n                   REQUIREMENTS FOR FOREIGN COUNTRIES WITH CERTAIN \n                   COOPERATIVE OR RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH \n                   THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Authority.--(1) Section 2534 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Wavier Generally Applicable to a Country.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall waive the limitation in subsection \n     (a) with respect to a foreign country generally if the \n     Secretary determines that the application of the limitation \n     with respect to that country would impede cooperative \n     programs entered into between the Department of Defense and \n     the foreign country, or would impede the reciprocal \n     procurement of defense items entered into under section 2531 \n     of this title, and the country does not discriminate against \n     defense items produced in the United States to a greater \n     degree than the United States discriminates against defense \n     items produced in that country.''.\n       (2) The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall apply with \n     respect to--\n       (A) contracts entered into on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) options for the procurement of items that are exercised \n     after such date under contracts that are entered into before \n     such date if those option prices are adjusted for any reason \n     other than the application of a waiver granted under \n     subsection (i) of section 2534 of title 10, United States \n     Code (as added by paragraph (1)).\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The heading of subsection (d) of \n     such section is amended by inserting ``for Particular \n     Procurements'' after ``Waiver Authority''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment because of the \nDepartment of the Navy's narrow interpretation of the Department of \nDefense's April 1997 ``Determination and Waiver'' which was a first \nstep for the Department in breaking down unproductive and egregious \nbarriers for free trade.\n  This is a simple and straight-forward amendment which waives certain \ndefense items with respect to a foreign country if the Secretary of \nDefense determines that country would impede cooperative programs \nentered into the foreign country and the Department of Defense. \nAdditionally, it would waive protectionist practices if it is \ndetermined it would impede the reciprocal procurement of defense items \nin that foreign country and that foreign country does not discriminate \nagainst defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree \nthan the United States discriminates against defense items in that \ncountry. This amendment would apply to all contracts entered into on or \nafter the date of enactment, including any option for the procurement \nof items under a contract that are entered into before the date of \nenactment if those option prices are adjusted for any other reason.\n  I have spoken of this issue before in this Chamber and the potential \nimpact on our bilateral trade relations with our allies because of our \npolicy toward ``Buy America''. From a philosophical point of view, I \noppose these type of protectionist trade policies because I believe \nfree trade is an important component of improved relations among all \nnations and a key to major U.S. economic growth.\n  From a practical standpoint, adherence to ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions seriously impairs our ability to compete freely in \ninternational markets for the best price on needed military equipment \nand could also result in a loss of existing business from long-standing \ninternational trading partners. While I fully understand the arguments \nby some to maintain certain critical industrial base capabilities, I \nfind no reason to support domestic source restrictions for products \nwhich are widely available from many U.S. companies, that is, pumps \nproduced by no less than 25 U.S. companies. I believe that competition \nand open markets among our allies on a reciprocal basis provide the \nbest equipment at the best price for U.S. and allied militaries alike.\n  There are many examples of trade imbalances resulting from \nunnecessary ``Buy America'' restrictions. Let me cite one case in \npoint. Between 1991 and 1994, the Netherlands purchased $508 million in \ndefense equipment from U.S. companies, including air-refueling planes, \nChinook helicopters, Apache helicopters, F-16 fighter equipment, \nmissiles, combat radios, and training equipment. During the same \nperiod, the United States purchased only $40 million of Dutch-made \nmilitary equipment. In recent meetings, the Defense Ministers of the \nUnited Kingdom and Sweden have apprised me of similar situations. In \nevery meeting, they tell me how difficult it is becoming to persuade \ntheir Governments to buy American defense products, because of our \nprotectionist policies and the growing ``Buy European'' sentiment.\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that this amendment will end \nonce and for all the anticompetitive, antifree trade practices that \nencumber our Government.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 834\n\n (Purpose: To convert the one-time report on aircraft inventory to an \n                             annual report)\n\n       Strike out section 1037, and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1037.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer an amendment on \nbehalf of Senators Bingaman, Hollings, Hagel, and Kerrey, and myself \nthat would help clarify the implications of a recent trade agreement \nfor an industry of vital importance to our defense industrial base. The \namendment would direct the Pentagon to perform a study assessing \nwhether dependence on foreign sources for certain resistors and \ncapacitors is likely to increase to the point of raising national \nsecurity concerns as a result of the tariff reductions scheduled to \ntake effect pursuant to the Information Technology Agreement (ITA).\n  The ITA was signed last December in Singapore and will phase in zero-\ntariff treatment for semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, \ncomputers, software, and other electronics products in North America, \nthe European Union, Australia, Japan, and many other countries in the \nAsia-Pacific region. Domestic producers of resistors and capacitors \nhave expressed concern to many Senators that the elimination of the 6 \npercent duty on resistors and 9.4 percent duty on capacitors would \nseriously undermine the vitality, and perhaps viability, of their \noperations. The Pentagon is a major purchaser of these products. For \nthis reason, the industry's concerns warrant a more thorough \ninvestigation of the implications of the tariff reductions for national \nsecurity than has occurred to date.\n  One of the manufacturing facilities affected by the Information \nTechnology Agreement is Dale Electronics, which is located in Yankton, \nSD. The Dale plant employs about 400 people and manufactures resistors, \ninductors, and magnetics. Like my colleagues who have cosponsored this \namendment, who also represent major facilities constituting an \nimportant part of our defense industrial base, I would like to know \nmore about how the tariff changes underway will affect defense \npreparedness. No doubt, the estimated 20,000 people working in the \npassive electronics industry would also appreciate having the benefit \nof this information.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to the distinguished manager \nof the bill, Senator Thurmond, for working with me and my colleagues on \nthis issue. I know that he shares our interest in bringing to light \nfacts necessary for the Federal Government to make informed decisions \nabout important aspects of our defense industrial base.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, just before final action here, I want to \ntake this opportunity to thank all the Republicans and all the \nDemocrats for the fine cooperation they have given through the \nconsideration of this bill. The Congress can pass no more important \nbill than this defense authorization legislation. It means our very \nprotection. It is important to the Nation and I am so pleased that we \nare able, now, to go forward and pass this bill promptly.\n  Mr. President, I ask for third reading of the bill.\n\n\n   En Bloc Amendments Nos. 753 as modified, 607 as modified, 605 as \n                        modified, 762, 763, 772\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If there be no further amendment to be \nproposed, the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the \nbill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Thurmond and all the \nRepublican subcommittee chairs, the Democrats on our side, ranking \nmembers, our staffs, and thank the rest of our colleagues for their \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able ranking member, \nSenator Levin, for the fine job he has done on this bill. I wish to \nthank also the subcommittee chairmen who have done such a good job \nhere, and all others who have participated here and helped us bring \nthis bill to conclusion.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have had third reading of the bill, as I \nunderstand it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with respect to H.R. 1119, the House-\npassed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 1998, I\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\nask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the \ntext of S. 936, as passed, be substituted in lieu thereof; that the \nbill be advanced to third reading and passed; and the title of S. 936 \nbe substituted for the title of H.R. 1119; that the Senate insist on \nits amendments to the bill and the title and request a conference with \nthe House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees; that the motion to reconsider the \nabove-mentioned votes be laid upon the table; and that the foregoing \noccur without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1119), as amended, was deemed read the third time and \npassed.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1998 for \n     military activities of the Department of Defense, for \n     military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for \n     such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Presiding Officer (Mr. Hagel) appointed \nMr. Thurmond, Mr. Warner, Mr. McCain, Mr. Coats, Mr. Smith of New \nHampshire, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nRobb, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Cleland conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, in closing, I want to take this \nopportunity to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, for their fine cooperation throughout \nthe consideration of this bill. And, Mr. President, I want to take this \nopportunity to thank Mr. Brownlee of the majority staff and Mr. Lyles \non the minority staff, and finally the superb work of the fine floor \nstaff that has been so helpful. They have all rendered yeoman service \nin the consideration and passage of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me again congratulate Senator \nThurmond for the tremendous work that he put into this bill and the \nsuccess of this bill. The strong vote that it got --I believe 94 \nvotes--in the U.S. Senate is a real tribute, I think, to the work that \nSenator Thurmond, as our chairman, has put in on this bill. I \ncongratulate him for it.\n  I also want to thank all the members of the committee for their work. \nAgain, our staffs, David Lyles of our staff on this side and Les \nBrownlee on the Republican side, our Republican and Democratic leaders, \nthe majority leader, and the Democratic leader were extremely helpful, \nand they again made it possible for us to complete this bill, I think, \nin very good order and with very great speed. To the members of our \nfloor staff, thanks to all of them for making it possible for us to \nmove with such great dispatch on a very complicated bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to again thank Senator Levin for his fine \ncooperation and all that he did to promote this bill. He did a \nmagnificent job.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I, too, would like to compliment the \nSenator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, for his leadership, as \nwell as Senator Levin, for moving this bill through, and in addition to \nthat, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle.\n  This bill had great potential for not only taking all this week, but \nall of next week. I compliment the leaders for making this happen, to \nget this bill completed, as the majority leader announced at the \nbeginning of the week that we were going to finish this on Friday \nbefore we adjourned. And we did. I think that is very important.\n\n  I also think that the vote is very positive. To have 94 votes for \nfinal passage on a defense bill I think is very positive indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7253-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Mr. Joel Klein, \nwho has been nominated for the position of Assistant Attorney General \nof the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Mr. Klein was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously on May 5. As his \nrecord and testimony reflect, Joel Klein is a fine nominee for this \nposition, and I am pleased that his nomination has finally been brought \nbefore the full Senate today. He has my strong support and, I believe, \nthe strong support of every member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Now, I believe Mr. Klein is as fine a lawyer as any nominee who has \ncome before this committee. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard \nLaw School before clerking for Chief Judge David Brazelon of the D.C. \nCircuit and then Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell. Mr. Klein went on \nto practice public interest law and later formed his own law firm, in \nwhich he developed an outstanding reputation as an appellate lawyer \narguing--and winning--many important cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. For the past 2 years, Mr. Klein has ably served as Principal \nDeputy in the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, and for the past \nseveral months he has been the Acting Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Antitrust Division.\n  It is clear, both from his speeches and his enforcement decisions, \nthat Mr.\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\nKlein is well within the mainstream of antitrust law and doctrine and \nwill be a stabilizing influence at the Antitrust Division of the \nJustice Department. While no one doubts his willingness to take \nvigorous enforcement actions when appropriate, it is a credit to Mr. \nKlein that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of \nManufacturers and other business associations have written in strong \nsupport of his nomination to lead the Antitrust Division. They believe \nhe will be good for American business. And I think they are right.\n  At the same time, Mr. Klein has demonstrated a sense of direction and \na vision for the Antitrust Division, which is important in a leader. He \nis committed to enforcing our Nation's antitrust laws in order to \nuphold our cherished free enterprise system and protect consumers from \ncartels and other anticompetitive conduct. So, I am certain that Mr. \nKlein will also be very good for consumers.\n  Antitrust doctrine has had its ups and downs over the years--although \nwe may not all agree on which times were which. At this point, however, \nI am hopeful that antitrust is entering a more mature and more stable \nperiod. Although antitrust analysis is fact-intensive and will always \ncontain gray areas, I hope Mr. Klein will work to help make antitrust \ndoctrine as clear and predictable as possible so that companies know \nwhat is permitted and what the Antitrust Division will challenge. This \nwill help businesses compete vigorously without the worry and chilling \neffects that result from uncertainty. I suggest that the Division's \ngoal should be to avoid burdens on lawful business activities while \nappropriately enforcing the law against those who clearly violate it.\n  Finally, I would like to add that personally I have been very \nimpressed with Mr. Klein. He strikes me as a person of strong \nintegrity, as a highly competent and talented lawyer who is well-suited \nto lead the Antitrust Division. While I expect we may not always agree \non every issue, I believe that Mr. Klein's skills and expertise and his \npersonal integrity will be a service to the Department of Justice, to \nantitrust policymakers, and to the health of competition in our \neconomy. I look forward to working with him in the coming years.\n\n  In what appears to be a last-ditch effort to scuttle Mr. Klein's \nnomination, there are some who have now floated an allegation that the \nnominee's participation in a particular merger decision was somehow \nimproper. Upon examination, let me say that it appears to me that these \nreports are wholly unfounded and provide no basis whatsoever for \nquestioning Mr. Klein's conduct. I understand that, with respect to the \nmatter at issue, Mr. Klein consulted with the proper ethics officials \nand was assured that his participation raised no conflict of interest \nor even the appearance thereof. Based on what we know, this judgment \nappears sound, and I am confident that the nominee has conducted \nhimself appropriately. I hope that nobody in this body will use this \nextraneous, ill-founded notion as an eleventh hour basis for opposing \nMr. Klein's nomination. I am confident, having worked with him over the \nyears, knowing him personally as well as I do, having watched him in \naction, having seen him make decisions, and having seen him apply the \nlaw, that Mr. Klein is a man of high integrity, and I urge my \ncolleagues to cast their votes in his favor.\n  I might add that some will suggest that Mr. Klein is misapplying the \nTelecommunications Act and has taken questionable positions on \nparticular mergers. I will refrain here from passing judgment on any \nparticular decision and from engaging in a detailed debate on \ntelecommunications antitrust policy. I fully recognize that there are \nsome very, very important issues at stake here, especially in light of \na number of ambiguities left in the wake of the telecommunications law. \nI also recognize that there have been some controversial mergers in \nthis area, and yet other potentially landmark mergers which have not \nyet come to pass.\n  In short, telecommunications competition and antitrust policy is one \nof the most important, yet somewhat unsettled, policy areas affecting \nour emerging, transforming economy. The looming policy decisions to be \nmade in this area cannot be ignored. Indeed, I plan to have the \nJudiciary Committee and/or our Antitrust Subcommittee fully explore \nthese issues.\n  But I believe it is neither fair nor wise to hold a nominee hostage \nbecause of such concerns, especially one as competent and decent as \nJoel Klein. In my view, sound public policy is best served by bringing \nthis nominee up for a vote, permitting the Justice Department to \nproceed with a confirmed chief of the Antitrust Division, and for us in \nCongress to move forward and work with the Department and other \ninvolved agencies in the formulation and implementation of \ntelecommunications policies.\n  I hope that all Senators, and especially those of the President's own \nparty, will permit the administration's nominee to be voted on.\n  Finally, let me just say this: I believe that the President deserves \na great deal of credit for picking Joel Klein as one of his chief \nnominations for this year. There are times when I disagree with the \nPresident, but I have to say when he does a good job and when he does \nnominate good people, as he has in these areas in the past in some of \nthe areas of law, in particular, and I cite with particularity some \npeople at Justice, the Director of the FBI and so many other law \nenforcement aspects of our Government, then I will support the \nPresident.\n  I will do what I can to show support for him and to encourage him to \ncontinue to pick the highest quality people for these positions. I am \nconfident that Joel Klein is of the highest quality. I am confident \nthat he is one of the finest lawyers in this country in this field and \nI feel absolutely confident that he will do one of the best jobs in \nhistory at the Antitrust Division. Anything less than that, I would be \ndisappointed in. I believe he will. He is a fine man. I hope this body \nwill support him.\n  I hope when we have the cloture vote on Monday we will invoke cloture \nand have the debate, allow anybody to say what they want to, but then \nhopefully vote Mr. Klein up for this position so he can fully embrace \nthis position and fulfill it and do what needs to be done. That is all \nI will say today.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side may have some comments. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was \nan historic achievement of bipartisan consensus. The act was intended \nto promote competition in every sector of the communications industry, \nincluding the broadcast, cable, wireless, long distance, local \ntelephone, manufacturing, pay telephone, electronic publishing, cable \nequipment, and direct broadcast satellite industries. At the time of \nits passage, the law had the support of the Clinton administration and \nalmost every sector of the communications industry.\n  Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act was the result of many \nyears of debate in the Congress. In 1991, I authored legislation to \nallow the Regional Bell Operating Companies [RBOC's] into \nmanufacturing. That bill passed the Senate by almost two-thirds of the \nSenate, but the House could not pass it. In 1993 I introduced S. 1822 \nwhich was a comprehensive effort to update the Communications Act of \n1934. Again, we tried to pass the legislation, but at each stage, one \nindustry blocked the other. As a result, communications policy was set \nby the courts, not by Congress and not by the Federal Communications \nCommission [FCC], the expert agency.\n  It is now almost 18 months after the historic law was passed and \ncritics are already hailing it as a failure because of recent mergers \nand the apparent lack of competition. In actuality we will not know the \nimpact of the law for years to come. Yet a critical factor that will \ndetermine its success has more to do with how the law is being enforced \nthan what the statutory language says.\n  First, it is important to note that many of the decisions we made \nwere based on the commitment that the respective industries were going \nto compete against each other. Telephone companies were going to enter \nthe cable television market. The cable industry was going to enter the \nlocal telephone service market. And long distance companies would enter \nthe local telephone service market.\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\n  Now, 18 months later, we're seeing more of the opposite. But I am not \nready to simply blame the industry for deciding not to compete. \nEveryone knows that it's more natural for monopolies to defend their \nmarket share than to willingly give it up. Furthermore, competition can \nonly occur if the new competitors are provided the legal and economic \nopportunity to compete for market share. Thus, the success of the law \ndepends upon its implementation and oversight.\n  One major element of the implementation is the rules adopted by the \nFCC. The FCC has been working nonstop for the past 18 months to adopt \nrules to implement the law. I have some concerns about how the FCC has \ninterpreted certain provisions, and I have been working with the FCC on \nthose issues. One problem, though, has been that the rules themselves \nare not in effect because these same companies that pledged competition \nhave instead sought consolidation and litigation.\n\n  An example of why vigorous enforcement of the act is necessary is \nreflected in the difficulty new entrants are experiencing in trying to \nenter the local telephone market. Financial reports today detail MCI's \nproblems that it faces in trying to break into the local telephone \nmarket. MCI will record approximately $800 million in losses this \nyear--almost double its expected loss. AT also wrote to the FCC \noutlining the need for greater enforcement of the act if new entrants \nare to be successful in trying to enter the local market.\n  Three of the FCC's major rulemakings are now tied up in the courts. \nThe interconnection rules have been stayed by the Eighth Circuit Court \nof Appeals since last fall. The universal service rules and access \ncharge rules also were recently challenged in the courts. The list goes \non with a number of other proceedings being tied up in the courts. The \nmost outrageous example thus far is last week's announcement that SBC, \nthe Bell Telephone Co. for the Southwestern United States, is \nchallenging the constitutionality of the statute itself--18 months \nlater!\n  It is important to note that SBC already has merged with Pacific Bell \nand almost merged with AT At the same time SBC was trying to merge \nwith AT, it was seeking to enter the long distance market to \nsupposedly compete with AT SBC was denied in its initial request to \nenter the long distance market, so instead of challenging the FCC \ndecision, SBC simply decided to seek continued protection from the \ncourts. The irony, of course, is that for 10 years, the \ntelecommunications industry argued that the courts should not \nadminister communications policy.\n  With all this litigation going on, it's no wonder the media believes \nthe law was a failure. I think it's time we focused more on why there \nappears to be more consolidation than competition. Also, I think the \nCongress needs to be more attentive to whether the administration's \nnominees support the policies advocated by the administration during \nconsideration of the legislation.\n  Let there be no doubt that much of the competition provisions were \ncombined with a transition to greater deregulation. In exchange for \nless regulation, there had to be competition to protect consumers. That \nis not happening. Competition and deregulation were all we heard on the \nfloor of the Senate, but all we're now seeing is consolidation and \nderegulation without the competition. It doesn't appear that some in \nthe administration today share the same views about competition as the \nadministration did in 1995 when the law was being debated.\n  Because the litigation strategy of some incumbents appears to have \nprevented competitors from entering the various markets, the Antitrust \nDivision at the Department of Justice is now tasked with a far greater \nrole than anyone envisioned. But the nominee before us today has made \ncertain statements and taken certain actions in his acting capacity \nthat concern me greatly. His actions raise further concern with the \ndirection of the administration's policies with respect to its \ninterpretation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I believe that \nthese issues need clarification before Mr. Klein's nomination should be \nbrought to a vote in the Senate.\n  Whether or not robust competition develops in the local telephone \nservice market depends upon the administration's commitment to vigorous \nenforcement of the act. Unfortunately, while serving as Acting Chief of \nthe Antitrust Division, Mr. Klein has explicitly contradicted specific \nstatutory mandates and conference report directions that the Congress, \nworking with the White House, fought against all odds to have added to \nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996. Several Members have asked Mr. \nKlein, Attorney General Reno, and the White House about these concerns \nand have asked them to demonstrate that the Antitrust Division will \nfollow the explicit meaning of the Telecommunications Act. So far, \nthere has not been a satisfactory response to our concerns.\n  Mr. President, with respect to my colleague in discussing the \ncharacter of Mr. Klein, there is no question about Mr. Klein being of \nthe highest character and integrity.\n  But what really occurs, Mr. President, and I have had to respond to a \nlot of calls from good friends, it was not his character but his \nability, even though he is a smart lawyer, to administer the law as \nwritten.\n  There is no question in my mind that, of course, you have those who \nbelieve in weak antitrust. We went through that in the Reagan years. I \nhave been the chairman of the State, Justice, Commerce Subcommittee of \nappropriations for the Antitrust Division, and during those particular \nyears the Reagan administration cared less whether we had antitrust. To \nthe credit of the distinguished wife of our distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, Anne Bingaman, came in there and we really beefed up the \ndepartment, and we even brought to task none other than Bill Gates of \nthe computer world. So when you can do that you know you have a good \nantitrust head in power.\n  When I saw this particular gentleman take over it gave me misgivings. \nRight to the point, as the newspaper said, from the very beginning when \nI put my hold on this particular nomination, I said I would be glad to \ndiscuss it that afternoon, I was not going to politic it around, I have \nother work to do. But as a matter of conscience, I thought I ought to \nbring these things to the attention of my colleagues.\n  There is no better place to look at the nominee than this particular \nNew York Times editorial entitled ``A Weak Antitrust Nominee.'' I ask \nunanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 11, 1997]\n\n                        A Weak Antitrust Nominee\n\n       The next head of the Justice Department's antitrust \n     division will have a lot to say about whether the 1996 \n     Telecommunications Act breaks the monopoly chokehold that \n     Bell companies exert over local phone customers. He will rule \n     on mergers among telecommunications companies and advise the \n     Federal Communications Commission on applications by Bell \n     companies to enter long-distance markets. Thus it is \n     disheartening and disqualifying that President Clinton's \n     nominee, Joel Klein, is scheduled to come up for confirmation \n     today in the Senate with a record that suggests he might \n     knuckle under to the powerful Bell companies and the \n     politicians who do their bidding.\n       Senators Bob Kerrey, Ernest Hollings and Byron Dorgan have \n     threatened to block the vote today and put off until next \n     week a final determination of Mr. Klein's fate. But the \n     Administration would do its own telecommunications policy a \n     favor by withdrawing the nomination and finding a stronger, \n     more aggressive successor.\n       Mr. Klein, who has been serving as the Government's acting \n     Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, demonstrated his \n     inclinations when he overrode objections of some of his staff \n     and approved unconditionally the merger of Bell Atlantic and \n     Nynex. That merger will remove Bell Atlantic as a potential \n     competitor for Nynex's many dissatisfied customers. Mr. Klein \n     refused even to impose conditions that would have made it \n     easier for state and Federal regulators to pry open Nynex's \n     markets to rivals such as AT\n       Worse, Mr. Klein sent a letter to Chairman Conrad Burns of \n     the Senate communications subcommittee, who runs political \n     interference for the Bell companies, that committed the \n     antitrust division to pro-Bell positions in defiance of the \n     1996 act.\n       That act invites the Bell companies to provide long-\n     distance service, but only if the Bells first open their \n     systems to rivals that want to compete for local customers. \n     Yet in the letter to Mr. Burns, Mr. Klein explicitly rejected \n     Congress's interpretation of requirements to be imposed on \n     the Bells in favor of his own, weaker standard.\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\n       In a subsequent submission to the Federal Communications \n     Commission, Mr. Klein further weakened a requirement that \n     before the Bells enter long-distance service they face a \n     competitor that is serious enough to build its own switches \n     and wires. Mr. Klein has also upset some senators by seeming \n     to minimize the importance, provided in the 1996 \n     Telecommunications Act, of Justice's advice to the F.C.C. on \n     applications by Bell companies to enter long distance.\n       True, Mr. Klein has blocked applications by two Bell \n     companies, SBC and Ameritech, to offer long-distance service \n     before they had opened their local markets to competition. \n     But by pandering to Mr. Burns, he has created strong doubts \n     that he can provide aggressive antitrust leadership.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. And there is no better way to bring this right to the \nfocus of concern.\n  Let me refer, without having to put the entire article of the Wall \nStreet Journal from this morning into the Record, a headline, Mr. \nPresident, that ``MCI Widens Local Market Loss Estimate.'' The very \nfirst sentence,\n\n       MCI communications corporation is calling for tougher \n     regulatory action to break the competitive advantages enjoyed \n     by the regional Bell telephone companies and the local phone \n     markets,\n\nand they said its losses from entering that business could total $800 \nmillion this year, more than double its original estimate. And then the \narticle continues.\n  The point is, it is very difficult to break into a monopoly and it is \nvery difficult to get a monopoly to give up marketshare. That has been \nquite obvious, working in telecommunications since I have been here, 30 \nyears, that this is the keenest, most competitive, most take-advantage \ncrowd you have ever seen. We are bogged down right now into the courts. \nAll the promises about going into each other's businesses to compete \nhave been forestalled, and mergers on course and everything else of \nthat kind, so in writing this legislation we had a back and forth with \nthe best of Washington lawyers on all sides, on every word, coaching \nus, more or less, for the last 4 years, until February of this last \nyear, when we passed the bill.\n  For that 4-year period, we got into the requirements--we call it a \nchecklist--that the regional Bell operating companies had to comply \nwith to open up their markets before they could get into long distance, \nipso facto, allow them into long distance, with the monopoly control of \nwhoever is going to receive the call locally, and you have a \nmonopolistic situation and they will run a touchdown and the long \ndistance companies and all competition will be extinguished. So we had \na debate over every particular facet.\n  One particular requirement is labeled here in section 271 of the \nparticular act and it is referred to in the actual conference report on \npage 33 in the report language, section 271. Let me read it so it is \nintelligently understood here:\n\n       . . . the Bell operating company is providing access and \n     interconnection to its network facilities for the network \n     facilities of one or more unaffiliated competing providers of \n     telephone exchange services . . . [as defined in section \n     347(A)] to residential and business subscribers.\n\n  For the unattuned, the emphasis should be to ``residential and \nbusiness subscribers.''\n  We wanted to have a facilities-based competitor operating there \nbefore that particular Bell company could take off into the long \ndistance competition. There is no question in my mind that the \ndistinguished gentleman under consideration, Mr. Joel Klein, understood \nthis.\n  He made a talk on March 11 at the Willard Inter-Continental Hotel \nhere in Washington to the Glasser Legalworks Seminar, and the seminar \nwas entitled ``Competitive Policy In Communications Industries: New \nAntitrust Approaches.''\n  On page 9 of that particular talk, I quote Mr. Klein himself.\n\n       Now, let me add a few words about how we will apply this \n     standard to RBOC applications under Section 271 of the Act. \n     Our preference, though we recognize that it may not always \n     occur, is to see actual, broad-based--i.e., business and \n     residential--entry into a local market.\n\n  And it goes on and on explaining.\n  When my friend from Montana, the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nCommunications on the Committee of Commerce here in the U.S. Senate, \nSenator Conrad Burns saw that, he wrote a letter to Mr. Klein. I am \nsorry I do not have my hand immediately on that letter itself, but he \nlisted a series of questions in his letter to the Acting Assistant \nAttorney General, and the Acting Assistant Attorney General, Joel Klein \non May 20, answered the letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent, so it will be understood, in fairness to \neverybody, the entire letter and the enclosure be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                           Antitrust Division,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: Thank you for your letter of May 15, \n     1997. I welcome the opportunity to respond to your questions \n     and look forward to working with you and the Subcommittee on \n     Communications in implementing the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996.\n       Before responding to each of your specific questions. I \n     thought it might be helpful if I made a few general \n     observations. To begin with, I wholeheartedly agree with your \n     statement that ``the basic point of the Telecommunications \n     Act is that regulators should stand aside and let market \n     forces work once fair competition is possible.'' I want to \n     assure you that the Department of Justice shares that view. \n     The sooner market forces can fully displace regulatory \n     efforts, the better the Nation's consumers will be.\n       Second, we welcome the prospect of letting the Bell \n     Operating Companies (BOCs) into long distance service. \n     Additional entry into that business, under appropriate \n     circumstances, will enhance competition and will thereby \n     further longstanding goals of the Department of Justice.\n       Third, the standard that we are applying under the Act is, \n     I believe, a competition standard, designed to ensure that \n     the local market is open to competitive entry; it is not a \n     metric test, and it does not require that a BOC lose any \n     particular portion of market share before the Justice \n     Department will support its entry into in-region long-\n     distance. On the contrary, I agree with your point that \n     ``local telephone competition may be slow in coming to rural \n     states for reasons having nothing to do with BOCs' steps \n     to satisfy the checklist.'' If competition is slow in \n     coming to a rural state because of the independent \n     business decisions by potential competitors, and not \n     because of any BOC actions or non-actions that \n     unreasonably impair competition, the Department would \n     support in-region long-distance entry. If my speech \n     conveyed any other impression--i.e., that we were seeking \n     to use the metric or market-share test that Congress \n     rejected during the legislative process culminating in the \n     1996 Act--I regret the confusion.\n       Let me amplify this point by setting forth my understanding \n     of the statutory requirements under section 271. The three \n     basic requirements are that a petitioning BOC must: (1) \n     satisfy either Track A or Track B's entry requirements; (2) \n     satisfy the 14-point checklist; and (3) satisfy the \n     ``separate subsidiary'' requirements of section 272. Beyond \n     that, and in addition to these requirements, the FCC must \n     find that ``the requested authorization is consistent with \n     the public interest, convenience, and necessity.'' 47 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 271(d)(3)(C). In making its decision, the FCC must give \n     ``substantial weight to the Attorney General's evaluation.'' \n     Sec. 271(d)(2)(A). The Attorney General, in turn, is required \n     to evaluate the application ``using any standard the Attorney \n     General considers appropriate.'' Sec. 271(d)(2)(A) (emphasis \n     supplied). It was in the context of this specific statutory \n     language--i.e., ``any standard''--that I said in my speech \n     that Congress had given the Department a ``broad swath'' in \n     terms of its ability to evaluate section 271 applications. At \n     the same time, I clearly share your view that any standard we \n     use should be a competition standard. I have also made clear \n     my view that we should explain our standard before any BOC \n     filed a 271 application so that we would not be seen as \n     playing a game of ``gotcha,'' whereby we would ``change the \n     rules of the game'' after an applicant had filed with the \n     FCC.\n       In order to accomplish these goals, almost immediately \n     after I became Acting Assistant Attorney General last \n     October, I asked all BOCs as well as any other interested \n     party, to give me their views of an appropriate competition \n     standard under Section 271 and to answer several questions \n     that would help the Department to formulate its position in \n     that regard. Based on the comments the Department received, \n     we developed the standard that I announced in my March 11 \n     speech.\n       In formulating this standard, I specifically rejected using \n     the suggestion in the Conference Report that the Department \n     analyze BOC applications employing the standard used in the \n     AT consent decree--objecting to BOC in-region long-distance \n     entry unless ``there is no substantial possibility that the \n     BOC or its affiliates could use its monopoly power to \n     impede competition in the market such company seeks to \n     enter.'' H.R. Conf. Rep. 104-458, at 148 (1996). That \n     standard, which had barred BOC entry into long distance \n     since their divestiture from AT, struck me as \n     insufficiently sensitive to the market conditions, and I \n     was concerned that it would bar BOC entry even where it \n     would be competitively warranted.\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\n       On the other hand, the Department's standard examines \n     whether a BOC's systems are sufficiently developed so that a \n     new entrant into its market can have confidence that, when it \n     signs up a new customer, that customer will be switched \n     effectively and will get service from the new carrier. Our \n     general preference is to see these systems operate in \n     practice. Once we are confident that this transitioning will \n     work effectively, we will be able to conclude that the local \n     market is open to competition. By the same token, we also \n     realize, as I indicated earlier, that in some areas--\n     particularly rural States--it is certainly possible that due \n     to the business decisions of particular companies, there may \n     be no new entrants for local service, A BOC should not be \n     excluded from in-region long-distance entry in such cases.\n       I believe that the standard we adopted is fair, balanced, \n     and reasonable. Most important, I believe it is consistent \n     with Congress's intent in the 1996 Act and that, if it is \n     implemented fairly, it will maximize the benefits to the \n     American public across the board--in local markets, long-\n     distance markets, and with respect to one-stop shopping. As \n     you so well put it in your letter, ``once fair competition is \n     possible''--and that's what our standard is designed to \n     test--then ``regulators should stand aside and let market \n     forces work.'' That is a pro-market, antitrust view, and I \n     can assure you that the Division will work to implement it.\n       I have responded to your specific questions in the \n     Attachment to this letter. I look forward to talking with you \n     regarding these and other telecommunications issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Joel I. Klein,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                         Questions and Answers\n\n       1. In your speech you used the following terms--``real'' \n     and ``broad-based competition,'' ``actual, broad-based \n     entry,'' ``true broad-based entry,'' ``tangible entry,'' \n     ``large-scale entry,'' and entry on a ``large-scale basis.'' \n     What do those terms mean to the Department?\n       By referring to ``real,'' ``actual, broad-based'' entry and \n     similar terms, I intended to express the Department of \n     Justice's general preference (though not mandatory \n     requirement) to see actual entry by competing carriers that \n     are selling both business and residential telephone service \n     on more than a non-trivial basis (though not in any specific \n     numbers). Such entry provides both (1) meaningful evidence \n     that the Bell Operating Company (BOC) has taken the necessary \n     steps to open its local market and (2) an opportunity to \n     measure the performance of the BOC in making available the \n     statutorily required services and facilities. The Department, \n     however, does not view such entry as a necessary precondition \n     to BOC long distance entry. Rather, we intend to look for \n     such entry where we would expect it to occur and, if it is \n     not occurring, to investigate why that is the case. Thus, in \n     my March 11 speech to which you refer, I stated that ``[o]ur \n     preference, though we recognize that it may not always occur, \n     is to see actual, broad-based i.e., business and \n     residential--entry into a local market.''\n       2. How many residential customers have to be served by a \n     competitor to meet the Department's entry test?\n       The Department's approach to whether the FCC should grant a \n     particular application by a BOC to enter into in-region long-\n     distance service does not turn on any numerical threshold for \n     the amount of residential customers that must be served by a \n     competitor before a BOCC meets the threshold for entry into \n     in-region long-distance service. If a significant number \n     (though not necessarily a large percentage) of residential \n     customers are being served in a particular state, it is \n     likely that the BOC has taken appropriate steps to open that \n     state to local competition. At the same time, it is not \n     necessarily the case that, if no residential customers are \n     being served by a competitor of the BOC, the BOC has not \n     taken the appropriate steps to open up a state to local \n     competition. As the Department stated in its FCC filing in \n     the SBC Oklahoma matter, ``if the absence or limited nature \n     of local entry appears to result from potential competitors' \n     choices not to enter--either for strategic reasons relating \n     to the Section 271 process, or simply because of decisions to \n     invest elsewhere that do not arise from the BOC's compliance \n     failures or barriers to entry in the state--this should not \n     defeat long distance entry by a BOC which has done its part \n     to open the market.''\n       3. How many business customers have to be served by a \n     competitor to meet the Department's entry test?\n       The Department's approach to whether the FCC should grant a \n     particular application by a BOC to enter into in-region long-\n     distance service does not turn on any numerical threshold for \n     the amount of business customers that must be served by a \n     competitor for a BOC to receive a recommendation from the \n     Department in favor of its entry into in-region long-distance \n     service. If a significant number (though not necessarily a \n     large percentage) of business customers are being served in a \n     particular state, it is likely that the BOC has taken \n     appropriate steps to open that state to local competition. At \n     the same time, it is not necessarily the case that, if no \n     business customers are being served by a competitor of the \n     BOC, the BOC has not taken the appropriate steps to open up a \n     state to local competition. As the Department stated in its \n     FCC filing in the SBC Oklahoma matter, ``if the absence or \n     limited nature of local entry appears to result from \n     potential competitors' choices not to enter--either for \n     strategic reasons relating to the Section 271 process, or \n     simply because of decisions to invest elsewhere that do not \n     arise from the BOC's compliance failures or barriers to entry \n     in the state--this should not defeat long distance entry by a \n     BOC which has done its part to open the market.''\n       4. Does there have to be more than one competitor in the \n     local exchange market to meet the Department's entry test?\n       No. Although it is likely that there will be more than one \n     competitor in many local exchange markets, in certain (most \n     likely rural) markets, it is possible that such entry will \n     not be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. If, in such \n     circumstances, the absence of entry does not reflect a BOC's \n     failure to help open the market to competition, the \n     Department would support long distance entry by the BOC.\n       5. Does a BOC have to face competition from AT, MCI or \n     Sprint to meet the department's entry test?\n       No. There is no single competitor, or combination of \n     competitors, that is required to compete with any particular \n     BOC in order for the Department to support its entry into in-\n     region long-distance. For example, our analysis of SBC's \n     application in Oklahoma focused on the efforts of Brooks \n     Fiber to enter the local market in Oklahoma. At no point did \n     we suggest that the application was deficient because none of \n     the three major interexchange carriers had entered Oklahoma.\n       6. How do you reconcile Congress' rejection of a metric \n     test for BOC entry into the long distance market with your \n     statement that ``successful full-scale entry'' is necessary \n     in order for the Department to ``believe the local market is \n     open to competition?''\n       In my judgment, the Department's entry standard is \n     consistent with Congress's decision to reject a metric test. \n     We do not require any shift in the level of market share as a \n     condition of entry. Rather, we think that the openness of a \n     local market can be best assessed by the discretionary \n     judgment of the FCC, relying in part on the Department of \n     Justice's competitive assessment, and based on the evaluation \n     of the particular circumstances in an individual state. While \n     this inquiry may involve an assessment of actual competition, \n     it does not focus on any metric or market share.\n       7. You have used the metaphor that the Department ``want(s) \n     to make sure that gas actually can flow through the \n     pipeline'' before allowing interLATA entry. How many orders \n     for resold services must be processed by a BOC in order to \n     satisfy this standard?\n       The Department does not require any particular number of \n     orders to be processed as a precondition to receiving our \n     support for a Section 271 application. Our inquiry seeks to \n     determine, whether the systems offered by the BOC to its \n     competitors will hold up, as a practical matter. This is very \n     important to new entrants trying to compete for customers, \n     but it is also not always easy to effectuate because of real-\n     world technical impediments which, in our experience, have \n     cropped up often. For example, in California, the orders for \n     resold services by competitors, when placed on a non-trivial \n     scale, led to a serious backlog in PacBell's wholesale \n     operations. This problem, in turn, created a real impediment \n     to entry by new competitors, whose customers and potential \n     customers became very concerned.\n       8. How many orders for unbundled network elements must be \n     processed by a BOC to satisfy this standard?\n       The Department does not require any particular use of \n     unbundled loops as a precondition to receiving our support \n     for a Section 271 application. Unbundled loops should be \n     available, as both a practical and legal matter, for use by \n     competitors without running into problems that will retard \n     competitive entry.\n       9. How much market share must a BOC lose to its competitors \n     to demonstrate that ``gas can flow through the pipeline?''\n       The ``gas in the pipeline'' metaphor does not reflect any \n     intention to measure the market share of competitors or any \n     shift in share to entrants, or to require any minimum shift \n     in share. In fact, our SBC evaluation notes that we are \n     willing to use alternate measures other than actual \n     commercial usage as proof that the ``pipeline can carry \n     gas.'' For example, if the same systems are in place in \n     different states, the use of those systems in other states \n     can be a useful indicator of whether or not competitors will \n     be able to receive what they need from the BOC. Similarly, in \n     some cases, we expect that comprehensive testing--carrier to \n     carrier, internal and/or independent auditing--may be able to \n     demonstrate that a BOC's support systems will enable entrants \n     to compete effectively.\n       10. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt testified on March 12, 1997, \n     before the Senate Commerce Committee that a BOC that \n     satisfied the checklist but did not have an actual competitor \n     in its market would meet the entry standard. Do you agree \n     with Chairman Hundt?\n       My answer would depend on the specific circumstances \n     presented by a given application. Under the Department's \n     approach, it is possible that a BOC satisfying the checklist, \n     but not facing an actual competitor, could merit entry into \n     in-region long-distance service under Section 271. The most \n     critical factor, as I have indicated, is whether the BOC has \n     taken the necessary steps to allow\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\n     competition in its market. If there are no competitors in a \n     particular state because of market conditions--rather than \n     because of artificial impediments to entry--we would support \n     BOC entry into long distance in that state.\n       11. If the Department opposes a BOC interLATA application, \n     do you believe the FCC should reject the application? If so, \n     wouldn't that give the Department's recommendation \n     ``preclusive effect'', something that the Act specifically \n     prohibited?\n       We believe the FCC should give our analysis substantial \n     weight, which is the specific statutory requirement adopted \n     by Congress in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The FCC, \n     however, is not required to follow our recommendation blindly \n     or reflexively and should certainly consider the statutory \n     framework and the comments of others in making its ultimate \n     decision.\n       12. You have also stated that the checklist, the \n     facilities-based requirement, the separate subsidiary \n     requirement and the option of ``Track B'' (the statement of \n     terms and conditions) are all ``necessary, through not \n     sufficient, to support entry''. What more must a BOC \n     demonstrate to obtain the Department's support?\n       The Department views the FCC's public interest \n     determination, which is expressly included in Section \n     271(d)(3)(C), as a fourth requirement. We view this \n     determination as reflecting Congress' decision to condition \n     BOC entry into long distance on a discretionary judgment by \n     the FCC, based in part on the Department of Justice's \n     competitive assessment, that a particular applicant will best \n     serve the interests of affected consumers in maximizing \n     telecommunication competition in all markets.\n       13. Do you believe that Track B can be used only if no one \n     has requested interconnection under Track A?\n       No. For Track A to apply, a potential facilities-based \n     carrier (be it predmoninantly or exclusively facilities \n     based) must request access to a checklist item. If no such \n     carrier requests such access, the BOC is free to proceed to \n     apply for long distance entry under Track B. Moreover, even \n     if a potential facilities-based carrier does request access \n     to a checklist item, the BOC still may utilize Track B if \n     ``the only provider or providers making such a request have \n     (i) failed to negotiate in good faith as required by Section \n     252, or (ii) violated the terms of an agreement approved \n     under Section 252 by a provider's failure to comply, within a \n     reasonable period of time, with the implementation schedule \n     contained in an agreement.'' 47 U.S.C. Sec. 271(c)(1)(B).\n       14. Can a BOC rely on Track B if it has received \n     interconnection requests from potential competitors, but \n     faces no ``competing provider'' which is actually providing \n     telephone exchange service to residential and business \n     customers predominantly over its own facilities?\n       As our evaluation of SBC's Section 271 application explains \n     in greater detail, a ``competing provider'' need not be \n     operational as of the date of its request to initially \n     qualify as a ``competing provider'' for purposes of \n     determining the application of Track A. See SBC Evaluation at \n     13-17. We believe this view comports with the language and \n     purpose of the statute and is expressly supported by the \n     Conference Report, which states that Track B serves only to \n     ensure that a BOC is not ``effectively prevented from seeking \n     entry into the interLATA services market simply because no \n     facilities-based competitor that meets the criteria set out \n     in [Track A] has sought to enter the market.'' H.R. \n     Conf. Rep. 104-458, at 148 (1996) (emphasis supplied). \n     Even so, a BOC's application may still be considered under \n     Track B if ``the only provider or providers making an \n     interconnection request have (i) failed to negotiate in \n     good faith as required by Section 252, or (ii) violated \n     the terms of an agreement approved under Section 252 by a \n     provider's failure to comply, within a reasonable period \n     of time, with the implementation schedule contained in an \n     agreement.'' 47 U.S.C. Sec. 271(c)(1)(B).\n       15. What if the requesting interconnectors under Track A do \n     not ask for, or wish to pay for, all of the items in the \n     checklist? Can the BOC satisfy the entry test by \n     supplementing their interconnection agreements with a filing \n     under Track B to cover at least all remaining items in the \n     checklist?\n       As explained in greater detail in our SBC filing, the basic \n     view of the Department is that ``[a] BOC is providing an \n     item, for purposes of checklist compliance, if the item is \n     available both as a legal and practical matter, whether or \n     not competitors have chosen to use it.'' SBC Evaluation at 23 \n     (emphasis supplied). Accordingly, under certain \n     circumstances--i.e., where there are checklist items that \n     have not been requested by any Track A qualifying provider--a \n     firm offer to provide an item through a sufficiently clear \n     provision in a statement of generally available terms, \n     coupled with the requisite showing of practical availability, \n     would suffice to constitute ``providing'' that item for \n     purposes of checklist compliance.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I refer by emphasis that he says on question one: ``In \nyour speech''--Senator Burns is referring to the speech made by Mr. \nKlein--``In your speech you used the following terms--`real' and \n`broad-based competition', `actual, broad-based entry', `true broad-\nbased entry', `tangible entry', `large-scale entry', and entry on a \n`large-scale basis'. What do those terms mean to the Department?''\n  The rest is right there, but by way of emphasis, let me quote Mr. \nKlein in response: ``Thus, in my March 11 speech to which you refer, I \nstated that `[o]ur preference, though we recognize it may not always \noccur, is to see actual, broad-based * * * business and residential--\nentry into a local market.' ''\n  Now, Mr. President, it is very interesting because these \ncommunications lawyers, and I ought to know, because if you work with \nthem over the years you begin to learn. What should interest anybody \nlooking at qualifications of this particular nominee, he puts in \nitalics ``[o]ur preference, though we recognize it may not always \noccur''--and thereupon, you could not believe it, Mr. President, you \ncould not believe it, our Mr. Klein had the unmitigated gall, in \nresponse to his italic to file an opinion here, an addendum to the \nevaluation of the Department, the U.S. Department of Justice in the \nmatter of the application of SBC Communications, Inc., docket 97-121. \nWhen? The day after that letter was sent, and here is what he says--\nbecause you get the hint in the letter but you get the fact in this \naddendum.\n  Let me quote:\n\n       The statute requires that both business and residential \n     subscribers be served by a competing provider, and that such \n     provider must be exclusively or predominantly facilities-\n     based. It does not, however, require that each class of \n     customers (i.e., business and residential) must be served \n     over a facilities-based competitor's own facilities. To the \n     contrary, Congress expressly provided that the competitor may \n     be providing services ``predominantly'' over its own \n     facilities ``in combination with the resale of'' BOC \n     services. . . . Thus, it does not matter whether the \n     competitor reaches one class of customers--e.g., \n     residential--only through resale, provided that the \n     competitor's local exchange services as a whole are provided \n     ``predominantly'' over its own facilities.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, you have section 271, that particular provision \nturned right on its head. I have no better authority, Mr. President, \nnot if this particular Senator's opinion is of any value, and I might \nsay that no one Senator wrote the Telecommunication Act of 1996, but \nimmodestly, if there is one that had more involvement than anybody \nelse, it was me. I had put out a bill S. 1822; Senator Pressler put out \nhis bill, S. 652. We changed it around back to S. 1822. Everyone knows \nthat. Look at the finished documents. I worked around the clock, and I \nworked with Chairman Bliley, the Republican chairman on the House side. \nHere in a letter of June 20, 1997, to the Honorable Reed Hundt by \nChairman Bliley, Chairman of the FCC.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    U.S. House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                        Committee on Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Reed Hundt,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hundt: I recently read with interest and \n     dismay the Department of Justice's additional comments \n     regarding SBC Communications Inc.'s (SBC's) application to \n     provide in-region, interLATA services in the State of \n     Oklahoma. The Department therein clarified its views on \n     section 271(c)(1)(A) of the Communications Act, as amended. \n     As the primary author of this provision, I feel compelled to \n     inform you that the Department misread the statute's plain \n     language. As you rule on SBC's application and future BOC \n     applications, you should not overlook the clear meaning of \n     section 271 or its legislative history.\n       The Department argued that a BOC should be allowed to enter \n     the in-region, interLATA market under ``Track A'' (i.e., \n     section 271(c)(1)(A)) if a competing service provider offers \n     facilities-based services to business customers and resale \n     services to residential customers, so long as the combined \n     provision of both services is predominantly over the \n     competing service provider's facilities. In other words, the \n     Department wrongly takes the view that section 271(c)(1)(A) \n     is satisfied if a competitor is serving either residential or \n     business customers over its own facilities.\n       Section 271(c)(1)(A), however, clearly requires a different \n     interpretation. To quote the statute, a competing service \n     provider must offer telephone exchange service to \n     ``residential and business subscribers . . . either \n     exclusively over their own telephone exchange service \n     facilities or predominantly over their own telephone exchange \n     service facilities.'' Track A is thus satisfied if--and only \n     if--a BOC faces facilities-based competition in both \n     residential and business markets. Neither the statute nor its \n     legislative history permits any other interpretation; I know \n     this because I drafted both texts.\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\n       In the end, the Department's recent misinterpretation of \n     section 271 reinforces a point I frequently made during \n     Congressional debate over the Telecommunications Act of 1996: \n     the Department of Justice does not have the expertise to make \n     important telecommunications policy decisions. The FCC, by \n     contrast, does have the necessary expertise, which explains \n     why Congress gave you and your colleagues--and no one else--\n     the ultimate authority to make important decisions, such as \n     the decision to interpret section 271. I remind you that the \n     Department's role in this matter is a consultative one, and \n     should be treated as such.\n       Let me conclude by noting that, while this letter focuses \n     exclusively on Department's interpretation of section \n     271(c)(1)(A), it should not be construed to mean that the \n     balance of the Department's comments were either consistent \n     or inconsistent with Congressional intent.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Bliley,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  (Mr. HUTCHINSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I see another Senator wishing to talk. \nBut, Mr. President, there it is. Here we have a Deputy Attorney General \nnominee that is not going to carry out President Clinton's policy, nor \nthe language of the statute.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nPresident Clinton to me on October 26, 1995.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Fritz: I enjoyed our telephone conversation today \n     regarding the upcoming conference on the telecommunications \n     reform bill and would like to follow-up on your request \n     regarding the specific issues of concern to me in the \n     proposed legislation.\n       As I said in our discussion, I am committed to promoting \n     competition in every aspect of the telecommunications and \n     information industries. I believe that the legislation should \n     protect and promote diversity of ownership and opinions in \n     the mass media, should protect consumers from unjustified \n     rate increases for cable and telephone services, and, in \n     particular, should include a test specifically designed to \n     ensure that the Bell companies entering into long distance \n     markets will not impede competition.\n       Earlier this year, my Administration provided comments on \n     S. 652 and H.R. 1555 as passed. I remain concerned that \n     neither bill provides a meaningful role for the Department of \n     Justice in safeguarding competition before local telephone \n     companies enter new markets. I continue to be concerned that \n     the bills allow too much concentration within the mass media \n     and in individual markets, which could reduce the diversity \n     of news and information available to the public. I also \n     believe that the provisions allowing mergers of cable and \n     telephone companies are overly broad. In addition, I oppose \n     deregulating cable programming services and equipment rates \n     before cable operators face real competition. I remain \n     committed, as well, to the other concerns contained in those \n     earlier statements on the two bills.\n       I applaud the Senate and the House for including provisions \n     requiring all new televisions to contain technology that will \n     allow parents to block out programs with violent or \n     objectionable content. I strongly support retention in the \n     final bill of the Snowe-Rockefeller provision that will \n     ensure that schools, libraries and hospitals have access to \n     advanced telecommunications services.\n       I look forward to working with you and your colleagues \n     during the conference to produce legislation that effectively \n     addresses these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. He writes:\n\n       Dear Fritz: I enjoyed our telephone conversation today \n     regarding the upcoming conference on the telecommunications \n     reform bill and would like to follow up on your request \n     regarding the specific issues of concern to me as proposed \n     legislation.\n\n  I am reading just part of it now.\n\n       As I said in our discussion, I am committed to promoting \n     competition in every aspect of the telecommunications and \n     information industries. I believe that the legislation should \n     protect and promote diversity of ownership and opinions in \n     the mass media, should protect consumers from unjustified \n     rate increases for cable and telephone services, and in \n     particular, should include a test specifically designed to \n     ensure that the Bell companies entering into long distance \n     markets will not impede competition.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, that is why we wrote 271 the way we wrote it. \nThat is why we wrote it that way. There isn't any question, as the \nchairman has said, this is bipartisan. This isn't because some Senator \nis enraged or upset or something else like that. I have been here long \nenough to get enraged or upset. I have seen a lot of good ones go \nthrough and several bad ones.\n  I thought having participated on the ground and worked for 4 years in \ngetting this formative act that was voted on by 95 U.S. Senators--they \nvoted on this particular language when it passed this particular body. \nThey understand not only that this isn't just a singular mistake, we \nhave the proposition of the gentleman, Mr. Klein, also coming forward \nand disregarding entirely, gratuitously, and summarily throwing out the \nVIII(c) test, which I will have time to refer to on here later on.\n  My point here is that we really worked hard to get participation. \nThere were those who didn't want the antitrust provision. They wanted \none-stop shopping at the Federal Communications Commission. We worked \nhard to make sure that this was done right. We realized many times that \nthey don't have antitrust lawyers like Reed Hundt, who is now the \nChairman and understands the law, and you necessarily don't have \nantitrust lawyers coming in as members and commissioners at the Federal \nCommunications Commission. So to give emphasis to opening up the market \nfor free and open competition, we put in the antitrust provisions in \nthere for its opinion to be provided to the Federal Communications \nCommission. We worked hard to provide it. We worked diligently on the \nVIII(c) test, which was Judge Greene's test for over 12 years now in \nthe breakup of AT, and every one of the Bell Operating Companies \nattested to that particular language. And here comes the particular \nnominee casting aside, in a gratuitous fashion, that requirement, on \nthe one hand, and changing over the statute just on a letter from a \nSenator, on the other hand.\n  When you have that kind of weak nominee, you have thwarted the intent \nof the Congress and the President of the United States and the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Antitrust, Business \nRights and Competition Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nI rise today to urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Joel \nKlein as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division.\n  Mr. President, the head of the Antitrust Division, obviously, plays a \ncritical role in assuring that our antitrust laws are enforced wisely \nand vigorously. The importance of that role really cannot be \noverstated. Strong enforcement of antitrust laws is necessary to foster \nand to protect competition. As we all know, competition is good \nbusiness, it gives businesses increased incentives to innovate, either \nby creating new products and services, finding ways to improve existing \nproducts, or by lowering costs. That type of innovation is good for \nboth business and for consumers.\n  Maintaining the competitive foundation of the American economy has \nalways been a difficult task. And as our economy grows and changes, \nit's only getting more difficult. We often discuss globalization of the \neconomy as allowing more and more American companies the opportunity to \ncompete in the international marketplace and, because of that, they \nhave flourished in this international environment. In order to build on \nthis success, it is essential that we apply the antitrust laws in order \nto protect our companies from unfair, anticompetitive actions on the \npart of foreign businesses and foreign governments.\n  In my view, Mr. President, Joel Klein is qualified to lead our \nefforts toward that stronger, more efficient antitrust enforcement. Mr. \nKlein is a superbly qualified attorney, with a great deal of \nsubstantive knowledge regarding both the jurisprudence and the \nenforcement of the antitrust laws. He has shown his abilities over the \nlast few months in his capacity as the Acting Assistant Attorney \nGeneral. He has shown this by leading the Antitrust Division through a \nseries of very complex, difficult analyses, particularly in the area of \ntelecommunications.\n\n  As we all know, telecommunications issues have become very important \nand, many times, quite controversial. Now, some have expressed concerns \nregarding Mr. Klein's interpretation of\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\nsection 271 of the Telecommunications Act in a way that some believe \nwill make it too easy for the Regional Bell Operating Companies, or the \nRBOC's, to enter the long distance market. However, Mr. President, in \nboth instances where the Antitrust Division has been called upon to \nevaluate an RBOC application to enter the long distance market, the \nAntitrust Division has recommended against the RBOC. In other words, \nMr. President, some people believe that Mr. Klein has been too hard on \nThe RBOC's. The ironic thing about this debate is that when you really \nanalyze it, you will see that Mr. Klein has received criticism from \nboth sides of these issues.\n  Now, Mr. President, these decisions involve complex factual, complex \nlegal, and complex economic analyses. Yes, each decision has angered \nsome of the parties involved, but I believe Mr. Klein has done his job \nin a responsible and principled way. I may not agree with every \ndecision made by the Antitrust Division, but what is important, I \nbelieve, is whether or not the nominee has interpreted the law \nresponsibly and fairly. Interpreting a complex matter, such as the \nTelecommunications Act, is certainly not easy. I expect Mr. Klein's \ndecisions will not please everyone. They certainly will not please \neveryone, given that it seems everyone has their own interpretation of \nthis law. In fact, I think he should be praised for his willingness to \ntake on these important and controversial issues. Rather than skirt \ncontroversy, Mr. Klein has done his job as best he can. I believe it is \ntime that the U.S. Senate does its job. I believe that we need to \ndiscuss Mr. Klein's qualifications and the merits of this particular \nmatter, and then I believe we need to vote on this confirmation.\n  Mr. President, we cannot continue to move forward in this area of \nantitrust enforcement without the sort of calm, principled leadership \nthat Joel Klein will provide. America will need an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral with a strong understanding of antitrust doctrine and the \nwillingness and ability to enforce the laws in an aggressive but \nevenhanded manner. I believe, Mr. President, that it is vitally \nimportant that the competitive foundation of our economy be maintained, \nand that the antitrust laws must be enforced and must be enforced \nfairly. Joel Klein, I believe, shares these goals, and I believe that \nhe has proven he has the expertise and the ability to put those goals \ninto practice. I believe, therefore, Mr. President, we should confirm \nhis nomination without further delay.\n  Mr. President, as we have already heard on this floor, there is going \nto be a vigorous debate about this nominee. Each Senator has to \nexercise his or her constitutional obligations. Each one of us has to \ndecide whether we will vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' I merely ask, \nhowever, that we do vote, that after a good, thorough, and vigorous \ndebate, we bring this matter to a close. Quite frankly, this \nadministration has had some problems, for whatever reason, in filling \nsome of the key positions at Justice. They are slowly beginning to take \ncare of that matter. I believe that in the Senate we have an \nobligation--now that we have the nomination in front of us--to proceed, \nand to proceed without unnecessary and undue delay.\n  Frankly, it is not helpful to have a vacancy in one of the key \npositions. Mr. Klein has, for some months, been the acting head of the \nAntitrust Division. I believe that he has carried out his duties well, \nas I have already said, in that particular job. But it is not helpful \nand it is not good for this nomination to continue to be pending, and \nit is not good for him to continue to be in the position of the acting \nhead of the Antitrust Division.\n\n  So, as we have this debate--and it will be a good debate; I am sure \nit will go on for some time--I merely urge my colleagues to bring this \nmatter at some point to a vote in the near future so that we can move \non with the business of antitrust in this country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, no one in this country at any time should \never have a problem sleeping as long as there is an opportunity to talk \nabout antitrust issues. It is for many some of the most boring, \nlifeless set of issues available to discuss anywhere in public \npolitics. Antitrust enforcement--what on Earth is it?\n  When I came to Washington, DC, I threatened to put the picture of the \n1,000 lawyers who are hired in our Government for antitrust enforcement \npurposes on the cartons of milk in grocery stores because I felt that \nthese 1,000 lawyers hired by our Government for antitrust enforcement \nhad surely vanished. I knew that we were paying 1,000 of them. But it \nwas clear to me there was no antitrust enforcement, so they must have \nvanished.\n  So it is a decade and half later and we are now talking about \nantitrust issues again. And the discussion today is with confirming a \nnomination to head the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice.\n  This is, while boring for many people, an important question because \nwe have what is called a free market system in our country. A free \nmarket system only works to the extent that you have referees who are \nwilling to intervene in circumstances where people try to rig the \nmarket and where there is not open competition and where there is \nmonopoly pricing in circumstances where the market is not free. In many \ncases, that is the same as stealing.\n  You go back to the beginning of the century and you will find \nexamples in a range of industries--petroleum, natural gas, a whole \nrange of industries, railroads--in which there were monopolies and \ntrusts. They were stealing from the American public. We put in place a \nnumber of things to deal with that.\n  One, we prosecuted some people and threw some people in jail.\n  Second, we put in place certain legislation which said that if the \nfree market is going to be free, then let's make sure there are some \nreferees to keep it free. That is the whole issue of antitrust \nenforcement.\n  Today the issue is, shall a Mr. Joel Klein from the Justice \nDepartment, who is now acting in this role as Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Antitrust Enforcement, be confirmed by the Senate? \nPresident Clinton sent his name down here and asked for confirmation. \nAnd I am standing here to say that Mr. Klein, by all accounts, has a \ndistinguished career.\n  I met with Mr. Klein yesterday. He is a very likable fellow who has \nmuch to commend him. But I believe it is not the time to proceed to \nthis nomination because a number of very important questions remain \nunanswered. The Senator from South Carolina mentioned some of them.\n  We had an enormous fight on the floor of the Senate about the \nTelecommunications Act. For the first time in 60 years, we reformed the \ntelecommunications laws in this country. One of the fights we had on \nthat legislation was about what the role of the Justice Department with \nrespect to whether or not there is competition with local phone service \nproviders so that the Bell system can be freed then to go to compete \nagainst long distance companies. When is there effective competition \nlocally that would free the Bells to compete in the long distance \nsystem? We said let's have an important role for the Justice Department \nin that area. We specifically talked about the test for that role, what \nis called the 8(c) test.\n\n  Now we have a person who is down at the Justice Department and writes \na letter to a colleague of ours when questioned about all of these \nissues, and he says, ``Well, I specifically reject the so-called 8(c) \ntest,'' in terms of how the Justice Department will evaluate the kinds \nof activities that are involved in whether or sufficient competitive \nmarket place conditions exist before a Bell company can enter the long \ndistance market.\n  There are a range of issues that we want to have answered. I have \nwritten to the President and Senator Kerrey has written to the Attorney \nGeneral. We have received no responses at this point. We would like \nresponses to a series of questions about positions taken by this \nnominee.\n  I am not standing here suggesting that Mr. Klein is unworthy. I am \nsaying at this point that the questions, which are very serious \nquestions, have not yet been answered. We have asked them, but they \nhave not yet been answered.\n  In light of that, I don't think any name should proceed until we \nreceive answers to very important questions.\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\n  The Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger was approved by Mr. Klein. Why was \nthat approved without conditions? We had some abbreviated discussion of \nthat yesterday. But I think we need more information about that. Why \nwas that not approved with some conditions? We had the opportunity to \nestablish conditions. How does this decision relate to the stated \nobjective that the Department of Justice is really concerned about \npromoting competition?\n  I would like more information about the Justice Department's \ninterpretation of facilities-based competition, which is a standard \nthat we discussed at some length in the Telecommunications Act. Why? I \nwould like to ask and like to get some additional answers.\n  Does the nominee before us specifically reject the so-called 8(c) \nstandard outright when Congress specifically recommended that standard \nfor evaluating the issues of competition? And where does the nominee \nstand on the issue of media concentration?\n  It is very hard to see that a telecommunications bill, which by its \nnature was to promote more competition, is moving in the direction of \nbeing successful when we have, instead of more competition, more \nconcentration. We have behemoth organizations marrying up and two \nbecoming one or four becoming two and two becoming one. So, by \ndefinition, you have less competition. We have more and more galloping \nconcentration in the telecommunications industry--television, radio, \nand all the rest of it. And, yet, I would like to know, where does the \nJustice Department and where does this nominee stand on the issue of \nconcentration?\n  Is that alarming, or do we have people who want to shake the pom-poms \nto become cheerleaders for it, as Mr. Baxter did when he was at the \nDepartment of Justice? There wasn't any merger that wasn't big enough \nfor him. It didn't matter. The bigger, the better. That is not the role \nof the Department of Justice and antitrust enforcement, in my judgment.\n  I am here to say that this is premature. This nomination should not \nbe considered until we have received sufficient answers to some of \nthese questions.\n  Again, let me reemphasize. I am not standing here today to say that \nMr. Klein is not someone without distinguished credentials. I have met \nhim. I kind of like him. But there are a number of questions \nunresolved, and those questions should be resolved. The Senate should \ninsist that they be resolved before we move this nomination forward.\n  So I will speak at some length on Monday. The Senator from Nebraska, \nSenator Kerrey, Senator Hollings, and I believe, will also speak and \nexplain the kinds of answers we are awaiting from the administration, \nfrom both the President and the Attorney General, before we proceed on \nthis nomination.\n  We have every right in this nomination process to say that before \nthis nomination proceeds, there are certain questions we think the \nAmerican people deserve an answer to. I intend to ask them not only \ntoday but on Monday, and we hope perhaps before this process is \ncomplete, that the Attorney General might respond or the White House \nmight respond to the questions that have been put to them about some of \nthe things that have been written, some of the things that have been \nspoken and said, and some of the decisions that have been made by the \nActing Assistant Attorney General in the Antitrust Division.\n  Mr. President, I will speak at greater length on this subject on \nMonday. I yield the floor.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about the \nnomination of Joel Klein to be the head of the Antitrust Division of \nthe Department of Justice.\n  I have had the opportunity on a couple of occasions to meet and to \ntalk with Mr. Klein, and I like him personally and I admire his career \nand what he has done as an individual.\n  However, I have serious reservations about his capacity to serve in \nthis position. He has been nominated. I appreciate and respect the \nPresident's confidence in him. But it is with deepest sincerity that I \nsay, although I would like to support his nomination for high office \nand hope that by the time the Senate votes on this nomination I can \nsupport him, at this time I believe that his nomination requires much \nmore deliberation. I am especially troubled by many of the \nadministration's telecommunications policies and especially in this \ncase Mr. Klein's interpretation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.\n  I have asked Attorney General Reno by letter to clarify the policy \nMr. Klein will be required to implement should Mr. Klein be confirmed. \nIn 1995, when this bill was being debated, I led, unfortunately, at \ntimes a filibuster in the Chamber when this bill was being discussed \nbecause I wanted the Department of Justice to have a role in \ndetermining whether or not there was competition before other entities \nwere going to be allowed to expand their services. The \nTelecommunications Act should work, but it will only work if we have an \nunrelenting dedication on the part of all Government agencies, the FCC \nand the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, their \nunrelenting attention and dedication to making certain we have \ncompetition.\n  Mr. President, just recently, I met with Joel Klein. I like him and \nadmire him. It is the second time I have had a chance to visit with him \nsince he was nominated by the President to serve as the Assistant \nAttorney General for Antitrust. It is with the deepest sincerity, that \nI say that I would like to support his nomination for this high office. \nI hope that by the time the Senate votes on this nomination that I can \nsupport him.\n  At this time, however, I believe that this nomination requires \nconsidered deliberation. I am deeply troubled by the administration's \ntelecommunications policies and Mr. Klein's interpretation of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996. I have asked the Attorney General to \nclarify the policy Mr. Klein will be required to implement should he be \nconfirmed.\n  My colleagues know that in 1995, I led a filibuster against the \nSenate Commerce Committee version of the Telecommunications Act to \nassure that the American people were fully aware of the monumental \ndecisions being made by the Senate. I believed then, as I do now, that \nonly an unrelenting dedication to competition and universal service by \nthe Congress and the executive branch could make that legislation \nbeneficial to consumers.\n  For days, with the support of the Clinton administration, my \ncolleagues and I fought to assure that the law would embrace real \ncompetition and universal service. If it did not, it would simply be \none more piece of legislation for the big, the powerful, and moneyed \ninterests.\n  On the Senate floor we were successful in making the commitment to \nvigorously pursue competition central to the decision to end the court \nsupervised Modified Final Judgement [MFJ] which controlled the \nactivities of the seven Baby Bells and AT following the breakup of \nthe Bell System.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, was that the American people did not \nask for the Telecommunications Act. I do not recall one Nebraskan \ncomplain to me that telephone service was too expensive or that their \nservice was poor. For most Americans, when asked about their phone \nservice, they might quote Andy Griffth from the old AT commercial, \nand say ``rings true, and not a lick of trouble * * *.''\n  While there was satisfaction for most residential consumers, there \nwere a host of new technologies and opportunities to bring the benefits \nof the information revolution to all Americans which the monopoly \norganization of the telecommunications marketplace was stifling. Every \nday of the status quo represented a lost opportunity for American \nhomes, schools, and economic development.\n\n  There were proposals to invest Government funds in building the \nutopian information superhighway, there were regulatory initiatives to \nprod monopolies to invest in the future.\n  The pathway chosen to bring advanced services, lower prices, and more\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\nchoices to consumers was to fundamentally change the economics of \ntelecommunications services from a regulated monopoly to a competitive \nmarket. The price for opening all markets to competition, however, was \nan obligation by all telecommunications carriers to contribute to the \nsupport of universal service.\n  The vision of telecommunications reform was that competition would \nspur investment, innovation, and choice and universal service support \nwould assure that no American would be left behind.\n  It was and is a grand vision. One which if properly implemented can \nenergize the economy, enhance productivity, build wealth, enhance \nfreedom, and revolutionize the way Americans work, learn, and relax.\n  A significant part of the battle on the Telecommunications Act \ncentered on the appropriate role for the Department of Justice in \ntelecommunications policy. The first draft of the Telecommunications \nAct, written by Senator Pressler on behalf of the Republicans on the \nSenate Commerce Committee had no role for the Department of Justice and \ndid not even explicitly reserve the Department's preexisting antitrust \npowers.\n  As passed by the Senate Commerce Committee and the full Senate, the \nDepartment's antitrust authority had been preserved and the Department \nwas given an advisory role in the FCC's decision to allow the Regional \nBell Operating Companies, RBOCs, to enter the long-distance market \nwithin their own regions.\n  To strengthen the bill Senators Dorgan, Leahy, Thurmond, and I \nproposed amendments to strengthen the role of the Department of \nJustice.\n  I believed and continue to believe that the Department of Justice \nusing its powers under the antitrust laws and the new law would and \nshould be the bulwark against the abuse of monopoly power. I was \nconfident that the Department of Justice would steadfastly be on the \nside of the consumer and fight for a vision of telecommunications \ncompetition which served the interests of all Americans.\n  I opposed the Senate passed bill, because it did not have a strong \nenough role for the Department of Justice.\n  I voted for the conference agreement in large part, because the role \nof the Department had been strengthened. Specifically, the bill as \nenacted, gave the Department's opinion on Bell entry into long distance \n``substantial weight,'' and eliminated the ability of the Federal \nCommunications Commission to approve a merger of telephone companies \nwhich bypassed antitrust review.\n  Mr. President, the effort to protect and enhance the role of the \nDepartment of Justice was a hard fought fight. President Clinton, even \nthreatened a veto of the bill if it had a weak role for the Department.\n  Having fought and won the legislative battle, I am particularly \nconcerned about recent comments made by Acting Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Klein regarding the Department of Justice's role in \nfacilitating competition under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  In response to questions by the chairman of the Senate Communications \nSubcommittee, Mr. Klein said that he ``specifically rejected using the \nsuggestion in the Conference Report that the Department analyze Bell \nOperating Company (BOC) applications employing the standard used in the \nAT consent decree''. This standard, known as the 8(c) test would \nreject BOC entry into in-region long distance unless ``there is no \nsubstantial possibility that the BOC or its affiliates could use its \nmonopoly power to impede competition in the market such company seeks \nto enter.''\n  While the Telecommunications Act gave the Attorney General the \nauthority to choose any standard she sees fit to evaluate Bell entry \ninto in-region service, I have asked the Attorney General to clarify \nthe Department's policy on this matter. I am hopeful that a \nclarification from the Attorney General can put Mr. Klein's comments \ninto a fuller and more appropriate context.\n  I certainly hope that Mr. Klein's statement does not mean that a Bell \nOperating Co. should be allowed to enter the in-region long distance \nmarket even if there is a ``substantial possibility that the BOC or its \naffiliates could use monopoly power to impede competition.''\n  In fairness to Mr. Klein, he put forward an alternate test known as \nthe ``irretrievably open to competition test.'' Unfortunately, it is \nplaced in a context, which at least implies that the 8(c) test is too \ntough on Bell Operating Companies.\n  During the consideration of the Telecommunications Act, President \nClinton wrote in a letter to Members of Congress that the \nTelecommunications Act should ``include a test specifically designed to \nensure that the Bell companies entering into long distance markets will \nnot impede competition * * *'' I hope that Mr. Klein and the Attorney \nGeneral can set this record straight as to the administration's policy.\n\n  Mr. Klein also wrote to Chairman Burns that ``we think that the \nopenness of a local market can be best assessed by the discretionary \nauthority of the FCC, relying in part on the department of Justice's \ncompetitive assessment, and based on the evaluation of the particular \ncircumstances in an individual state.''\n  Mr. President, I fought hard to include DOJ in the process of \ndetermining when Bell Operating Companies enter in region long distance \nmarkets because of the legal and economic expertise of the Antitrust \nDivision. It would be tragic if the Department abdicate its role in \nthis area.\n  The Federal Communications Commission [FCC] is not the only agency \nequipped to make decisions about the openness of markets. A market \ncannot be competitive if it is not open. The Department's \nresponsibility under the act and the Nation's antitrust laws is most \nserious and should be aggressively pursued by the Antitrust Division.\n  Although the ultimate decision lies with the FCC, the Department must \naccept its important role as the expert in competition and market power \nand adopt a meaningful entry standard based on procompetitive \nprinciples. I am not yet convinced that the Department has done that.\n  To me, what is most important is that the Attorney General put \nforward a test which Mr. Klein will implement which is unrelenting in \nits commitment to competition.\n  The Kerrey test of competition would be as simple as do customers \nhave a choice? If the answer is no, you do not have competition.\n  The ideal open telecommunications market would allow an entrepreneur, \nnew to the market to offer bundled services to the home. To do that \nthere must be full access to the local exchange carrier at fair prices. \nIf it takes a legion of lawyers, lobbyists, and investment bankers to \neven offer a new service to a customer of a monopolist, you do not have \nan open market.\n  On a separate but equally important competition issue, I remain very \nconcerned about recent mergers between large telecommunications \nproviders. The decision by the Department of Justice to approve the \nBell Atlantic/NYNEX merger without any conditions is troubling.\n  Reports of AT's efforts to bring two BOC's back into it's fold \nshould give everyone pause. A year ago, such action would have been \nlaughable. I feel strongly that the Bell Atlantic merger approval, \npersonally supervised by Mr. Klein sent exactly the wrong message to \nthe market. I fear that this merger will lead to a new round of large \ntelecommunications mergers which could greatly reduce any chance for \nthe swift adoption of a vibrant, competitive telecommunications market.\n\n  Competitive entry could be frozen while real and potential \ncompetitors court, woo, and marry each other. As to unions between the \nprogeny of the former Bell System, I believe that it is generally not a \ngood idea for family members to wed!\n  One thing is certain, Congress did not intend to replace the urge to \ncompete with the urge to merge.\n  While the FCC and the States struggle with implementation of the new \ntelecommunications law, it is important to remember that a key part of \nthat legislation did not rely on regulation, it relied on the \nmarketplace. The idea was to unleash pent up competitive forces among \nand between telecommunications companies. Mega mergers between \ntelecommunications\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\n titans quell these market forces for increased investment, lower \nrates, and improved service.\n  I can accept an honest disagreement on competitive impact of the Bell \nAtlantic/NYNEX merger. I want the head of the Antitrust Division to \nfollow the law, even if it provokes my ire. It is in honest \ndisagreement that we can examine the effectiveness of the law. If the \nlaw needs to be changed, let's change it.\n  Beyond that, there are elements of the Bell Atlantic/NYNEX decision \nwhich are deeply troubling to me. Those concerns could be relieved if I \nwere convinced that the competitive concerns received full, open, and \ndeliberate consideration and that efforts were made to mitigate the \nloss of actual and potential competition. Most importantly, this merger \nshould not be a precedent for a no holds barred approach to \ntelecommunications combinations.\n  The history of telecommunications service in America is at a critical \npoint. At risk is a lifeline service important to every citizen of this \nNation. The Department's commitment to using its full authority to \npromote competition is important to achieving an environment where \nconsumers come first and entrepreneurs are encouraged to challenge the \nstatus quo.\n  The bold vision of the Telecommunications Act is a promise yet \nunfilled. The man or woman who executes the responsibilities of this \noffice will have a profound effect on every American, and not only in \ntelephone service.\n  Our antitrust laws form the keystone of our market economy. They \nstand between every American and the tyranny of raw, unbridled economic \npower. The person entrusted with the enforcement of those laws must \nhave an unwavering commitment to a marketplace built on full, fair, and \nopen competition.\n  As the Senate fully considers this nomination, I am willing to be \nconvinced that Joel Klein is that person.\n  Mr. President, the need for competition is the overriding imperative \nof this Telecommunications Act. I am not in business as a monopoly. My \nbusiness is such that customers come in. If they do not like what I am \nserving them, do not like the price, they go elsewhere, and as a \nconsequence of that we pay very close attention to the customer. And \nthose customers right now who are buying local services, especially \nresidential service at the local level, they still have two choices: \nTake it or leave it.\n  That is not competition. I do not come to the floor here criticizing \nthe regional Bell operating companies or AT or any other long \ndistance providers. I am just very much aware, if I am a monopoly, I do \nvery much business if I have to compete, if I have to satisfy my \ncustomers' desires, demands for high quality and a reasonable and fair \nprice.\n  There is a businessman in Nebraska who owns many things, and one of \nthe things he owns is newspapers. I once asked him how he managed to \nmake money in the newspaper business, and he said to me, well, it's \nreal simple; he takes advantage of two of America's most endearing and \nenduring institutions, monopoly and nepotism.\n  Mr. President, with the Telecommunications Act need to ensure that \nthe monopolies face competition, they come to us, the RBOC's and AT \nand the other carriers are all coming to us saying they want to \ncompete. What they need to make sure happens is that there is \ncompetition, that you get rigorous and vigorous competition at the \nlocal level.\n  In addition to that, though it is not the role of Antitrust at \nJustice, it is the role of the FCC to make certain that on the table we \nhave before us those things that the market will not get done.\n  There are some things that competition will not get done for us. \nThere is a need to make certain we have real service. There is a need \nto make certain that areas that are remote are getting good service. \nThere is a need to make certain people with lower incomes are going to \nget universal service. There are all sorts of things the market will \nnot get done, and we have to put them on the table. I think we have an \neasier time surfacing those things and debating those things than we do \nin making certain that at the local level we have competition.\n  As I said, Mr. President, it is not an easy thing to accept that \ncompetition if you are in business right now and you are a monopoly. It \nis easy to talk about it, but it is not easy to do it. There is a lot \nof pressure on Justice and FCC to make decisions and determinations \nthat are anticompetitive under the veil and cloak of competitive \nlanguage.\n  I am very much concerned, not by his actions, but by some statements \nand a particular letter he wrote in response to a concern of a Member \nof this body about a speech that Mr. Klein had given. The letter, in my \njudgment, gives away the authority that this Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, when we finally passed the Telecommunications Act of \n1996, gave the Department of Justice.\n  Mr. Klein appeared to me, in this letter, to give away the authority \nthat this law gives the Department of Justice. I, for one, need to hear \nfrom the Attorney General saying that she believes that the Department \nof Justice has this authority and she intends to make certain that \nAntitrust exercises that authority before I am going to be willing to \nvote for Mr. Klein.\n  It is a difficult job being head of Antitrust. As far as I am \nconcerned, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice creates \na lot of jobs because they insist on competition. I believe you get \nmore jobs in a competitive environment, not less. I believe competition \ndetermines in a much better way who is being successful in giving the \ncustomer what they want and, as a consequence, much more likely in the \nlong term to create jobs than if we allow entities to perform \nvertically monopoly, or near monopoly, control over the marketplace, \nand, in that kind of environment, to be able to basically say, as I \nindicated earlier, to the customer, ``Take it or leave it; I don't care \nwhether you like the price, whether you like the service; I am saying \nto you, you have to take it or leave it.''\n  This is one of the most difficult things we have ever gone through, \ngoing from a monopoly to a competitive environment. It is going to be \nwrenching and difficult for rural areas and for private sector \ncompanies that have to adjust their hiring policies, have to adjust \ntheir personnel policies, have to adjust their marketing policies. I \nknow that this kind of change is going to force the private sector, the \nmonopoly private sector, to go through substantial change. But it is \nthe intent of this legislation that they go through that change. It is \nonly if we have a competitive environment, again, acknowledging there \nare some things the market will not do for rural areas, and we have to \nmake sure, in order to achieve universal service, that we identify \nthose things upfront or it will not happen.\n  But acknowledging and setting aside those things, it is terribly \nimportant for the consumers to take advantage of the benefits of what \nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows. It is vitally important that \nboth the FCC and Antitrust at Justice insist on a competitive \nenvironment in order for that to happen.\n  I regret at this stage in the game having to say I do not support Mr. \nKlein. As I indicated, my view can be changed, depending upon what the \nAttorney General says in response to a letter I have sent to her. My \nhope is she will indicate she intends to make certain that Antitrust, \nwhoever is confirmed, will carry out the intent of the law as debated \nfully on this floor and as enacted both by the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  It would be my hope to be able to vote for Mr. Klein. At this stage \nin the game, I will not. At this stage in the game, I hope this body \ndeliberates a good deal of time upon not just Mr. Klein, but what is \ngoing to happen if Antitrust and Justice doesn't enforce the law, what \nis going to happen to consumers of this country if we don't get a \ncompetitive environment.\n  The only reason we had benefit in the long distance environment with \nreduced price and increased quality was the presence of competition. In \nthe absence of that, the consumers of this country are going to come \nback to us and say that that law wasn't very darn good.\n  All of us who voted for that act have a lot at stake. All of us who \nvoted for the Telecommunications Act of 1996 have a lot at stake, and \nthe job that Mr. Klein does, or whoever it is at\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\nAntitrust and all the Commissioners who are going to be nominated over \nat FCC, as well, all need to take a lot of time in deliberating over \nwhat those individuals are going to do before we vote to confirm them \nas a consequence of the impact that they are going to have, not just \nupon us, but especially upon the consumers, upon whom all of us, at the \nend of the day, depend.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to having an opportunity later to come \ndown, and I most especially look forward to not only yielding the \nfloor, but listening to the majority leader. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens).

Mr. President, this past Tuesday night, the eyes of the \nNation and a good part of the world were focused on Cleveland and the \nplaying of the All Star Game. This was an All Star Game that had, I \nthink, particular significance. This, of course, is the 50th \nanniversary of Jackie Robinson's entrance into major league baseball, \nwhen the so-called color line was actually finally broken.\n  It was appropriate that the honorary captain of the American League \nwas Larry Doby. It was also appropriate that the other honorary captain \nwas Frank Robinson. Frank Robinson, of course, who played when I was a \nyoung boy for the Cincinnati Reds, played very well, and then went on \nlater to be the first African American manager in the American League \nfor Cleveland.\n  Mr. President, on July 5, 1947--50 years ago--Larry Doby became the \nfirst African-American to play in the American League. Earlier that \nyear, of course, Jackie Robinson was the first person to be signed and \nto play for the Brooklyn Dodgers--the first African American to play in \nthe major leagues--and Larry Doby was the first African American to \nplay in the American League.\n  Earlier this year, we as a nation paid tribute to Jackie Robinson for \nthe courage and for the integrity showed in breaking baseball's color \nbarrier.\n  I think it is only right, Mr. President, to hail today on the Senate \nfloor the quiet courage of a man who did the same thing just 3 months \nlater in the American League. Bill Veeck of the Cleveland Indians saw \nthat Larry Doby was leading the Negro National League with a .458 \nbatting average and 13 home runs. Veeck and Doby then made a historic \ndecision, a decision that amounted to an act of faith in America's \nfuture. They decided that the opposition to Jackie Robinson's entry \ninto the Major Leagues was a throwback, a vestige of the past, and that \nracial tolerance was the wave of the future. It was a brave choice and \na tough choice, but, of course, it was the right choice. Larry Doby \nsaid later that Bill Veeck ``didn't see color. To me, he was in every \nsense colorblind, and I always knew he was there for me.''\n  Mr. President, that was a very characteristically generous and \ngracious statement by Larry Doby because it was Larry Doby himself, \nafter all, who had to be brave out on the playing field. Larry Doby had \nto be brave in a time of segregation and other terrible indignities \ninflicted on African-Americans. He showed the courage that was needed \n50 years ago, and all Americans today ought to be grateful for his \nexample.\n  Again, here is another quote from Larry Doby. ``Kids are our future, \nand we hope baseball has given them some idea of what it is to live \ntogether and how we can get along, whether you be black or white.''\n  Mr. President, the accomplishments of Larry Doby on the baseball \ndiamond are well known. In 1948, his first full season in the Major \nLeagues, he led the Indians to victory in the World Series, batting \n.318 and hitting a game-winning home run. He was named to the All Star \nteam every single year from 1949 to 1955. In 1952, Larry Doby led the \nAmerican League in home runs and in runs scored. Two years later, in \n1954, he led the league in home runs and in RBI's. He left the Indians \nin 1956 to play for the Chicago White Sox and later for the Detroit \nTigers. Larry Doby retired in 1959 but returned to baseball in 1978 to \nmanage the White Sox, becoming only the second African-American manager \nin the history of the major leagues. The first, as I stated, of course, \nas we know, was the great Frank Robinson, who managed the Cleveland \nIndians from 1975 to 1977.\n\n  Mr. President, as I have said, Larry Doby's contribution to baseball \nis well known. That is why he was chosen to serve as honorary captain \nof this year's American League team at the All Star Game this past \nTuesday night. But when everyone at Jacobs Field rose Tuesday night at \nthe All Star Game to honor this great American, we thanked him even \nmore for his message of reconciliation and racial brotherhood.\n  I have a copy of the Cleveland Plain Dealer article from July 6, \n1947. This article described Larry Doby's first game as a Cleveland \nIndian. The headline reads, ``Doby Shows Strong Arm as He Works at \nSecond Base.''\n  I submit, Mr. President, that Larry Doby showed a lot more than that \non that now distant July day. Larry Doby showed what America could and \nwhat America should be. So on behalf of people of the State of Ohio and \non behalf of all Americans, I rise today in the Senate to say thank you \nto Larry Doby and to pay tribute to this very fine gentleman.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7295-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7295-S7296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TAX PLAN DIFFERENCES\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the House of Representatives and the \nSenate recently passed tax relief plans that will help every American \nat every stage of life. They are obviously not the solution to all of \nour problems, but they are a first step in the right direction.\n  These carefully crafted tax relief packages will not only make an \nimmediate difference in the monthly budgets of middle-class families \nbut will also encourage the risk taking that will raise the future \nstandard of living for us, for our children, and for our grandchildren. \nThey will accomplish both goals by giving tax credits to people who pay \ntaxes and who bear the cost of raising the next generation and by \nreducing taxes on saving and investing.\n  Why do we need tax relief now? Consider the following: total taxes, \nFederal, State, and local combined, take up almost one-third of the \nU.S. economy. That means that for every 8 hours of work the average \ntaxpayer spends almost 3 hours of work to pay the tax collector rather \nthan bringing it home to meet family needs.\n  Following our lead, President Clinton has offered a tax relief plan \nof his own. We congratulate him on continuing to move in our direction, \nagreeing to tax credits not just for young kids but for teenagers, too, \nand also for giving families some relief from the death tax. But our \nplan and the President's still have some big differences. Most \nimportantly, we strongly believe that his plan sells the middle class \nshort. We think he has a much too narrow definition of middle class, \none that includes as rich too many families that most people would see \nas solidly middle class.\n  In particular, we think the President's plan has a strange bias \nagainst families with working moms. He is much too quick to put \nfamilies with working mothers in the rich category just because they \nneed two incomes to make ends meet, to pay their taxes, and to stay on \ntop of their bills.\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\n  For example, let us say dad's a teacher and makes $40,000. Everyone \nknows he is not rich. Now let us say mom's also working and she makes \n$30,000, money that goes to help raise their three kids, pay their \ntaxes, and save for retirement. Almost everyone would still say this \nfamily is not rich. But the President is well out of the mainstream on \nthis issue. His plan says that because mom works, this family is no \nlonger middle class; that it somehow became rich and does not deserve \nfull tax credits for its kids.\n  We strongly disagree. Our plans, which got the support of two-thirds \nof Senate Democrats as well as Republicans, do not punish families with \nworking moms. These families work hard, play by the rules, and struggle \nto make ends meet. They are overtaxed and they deserve tax relief. If \nthe President will not let them get a full share of lower taxes, if he \nthinks they only deserve a portion of the tax cuts others will get, \nthen he ought to get out of the tax-cutting business. People who \npay full-time taxes should not get part-time tax relief. Our tax plans \nlive by this code. They would give this family up to $1,100 more than \nthe President's plan would.\n\n  Is this situation unusual? Definitely not. In 1995, the typical \nmarried couple with two or more kids in which both parents worked full \ntime earned almost $61,000. This typical family should be making about \n$70,000 next year, assuming economic growth keeps going. Remarkably, \nthis income level already disqualifies them for two-thirds of the \nPresident's tax credits for children, and that is just for being the \ntypical family with two or more kids and two hard-working parents.\n  This crucial point warrants repeating. Under the President's plan, \nthe typical married couple with two or more kids and both parents \nworking full time would not qualify for full tax credits. Why? Because \nthe President thinks they are rich.\n  The ultimate shape of this long-sought balanced budget agreement and \ntax relief package is targeted to be finalized before the August \nrecess. I hope that we can take our case to the American public and \nsway the White House with the merits of our argument. Families where \nboth parents work to make ends meet hardly fit anyone's definition of \nrich. More accurately, these families are representative of the effort \nit takes to keep a roof over their heads, food on the table and the \nbills paid, especially the hefty bill they are obligated to pay to \nUncle Sam. On this key issue, the President clearly is in the wrong. \nThese families are not rich. They are middle class and they deserve a \nfull share of tax relief.\n  Under the bipartisan congressional plans, that is exactly what they \nwill get.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I noted yesterday my concern that the \nSenate is failing to proceed to confirm the four judicial nominees and \nthe nominee to be Deputy Attorney General of the United States. The \nRepublican leader had indicated that today he intended to take up the \nnomination of Mr. Holder to be the Deputy Attorney General, the second \nhighest ranking official in the Department of Justice. Now it appears \nthat the Republican leadership has decided not to proceed to that \nnomination but to hold it hostage to the confirmation of the Acting \nAssistant Attorney General for Antitrust.\n  I urge the majority leader to abandon this brinkmanship. There is no \nneed to tie up a noncontroversial and consensus nominee for the \nimportant position of Deputy Attorney General. In my view we could have \nproceeded to that matter before the last recess. In any event, there \nclearly is no justification for tying confirmation of the Deputy to any \nother nominee.\n  Likewise, I again urge the Republican leadership to proceed to \nconsideration of the four judicial nominees favorably reported by the \nJudiciary Committee over the last 7 weeks. Yesterday, we succeeded in \nreporting three additional judicial nominees. I would hope that we \ncould proceed to their confirmations early next week. Confirming those \n7 nominations pending on the executive calendar would literally double \nour production for the first 6 months of this session.\n  We are still confirming judges at a rate of less than one judge per \nmonth. Twenty-three judicial nominees remain pending before the \nJudiciary Committee, some have been bottled up in committee for as long \nas 27 months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7296-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE RIGGS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Mr. and Mrs. \nVernon Riggs of Saint Ann, MO, who on July 13, 1997, will celebrate \ntheir 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to \nthe day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Riggs' commitment to \nthe principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7296-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7296-S7297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WISHES DO COME TRUE FOR KIDS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a newspaper article entitled ``Wishes do \ncome true for Kids'' appeared in the Saturday, June 21, 1997, edition \nof the Washington Times. The article relates the story of a charitable \nfoundation--Kids, Inc.--which was established in 1982. The foundation \nhas helped gravely ill youngsters in 17 states find some measure of \nhappiness in their last days by financing a special vacation with their \nfamily members, or meeting a celebrity, or attending a circus, or \nparticipating in a group outing such as a VIP tour of the U.S. Capitol.\n  The article also tells about the moving force behind this very \nworthwhile volunteer organization--retired Army Colonel John G. \nCampbell of Burke, Virginia.\n  I am not surprised to read of Colonel Campbell's efforts to help some \nof our most vulnerable citizens. I have known Colonel Campbell for many \nyears. He accompanied me on a congressional delegation to China and on \nseveral trips to dedicate military facilities in the state of West \nVirginia. He has served the country in uniform and as a staff member of \nthe U.S. Senate. I have always found Colonel Campbell to be a man of \ncompetence, compassion, and Christian conscience. I thank and commend \nhim for his efforts on behalf of the children who have benefited from \nKids, Inc., and wish him and his wife, Jan, well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article about Colonel \nCampbell and his work on behalf of seriously ill children be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 21, 1997]\n\n                      Wishes Do Come True for Kids\n\n                          (By Patrick Butters)\n\n       To be perfectly callous, most people wonder whether giving \n     cash and precious time to charity actually goes to the poor \n     folks who need it most--or whether it just sinks into the \n     black hole of ``administrative costs.''\n       With Kids Inc., a good answer would be to look around its \n     small office in Burke. Ensconced behind a heavy, nondescript \n     door in an office complex on Old Keene Mill Road, the \n     nonprofit group's results can be seen on its walls.\n       Photos show smiling and sometimes laughing children, most \n     of them gravely ill. Since 1982, Kids has helped such \n     unfortunate youngsters in 17 states find a few moments or a \n     few days of happiness through special requests, such as \n     visiting Disney World or meeting wrestler Hulk Hogan, actor \n     Michael J. Fox or a member of the Washington Redskins. \n     Children have gone on such group outings as VIP tours of the \n     U.S. Capitol.\n       ``There are no fancy ads, no fancy offices, no glossy \n     publications and no fund-raising firms. It is small and has \n     direct impact,''\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\n     says Frank Norton, who volunteers with his wife, Carol.\n       ``This is neighborhood. These are folks you may not know \n     but you could know. They may be your nextdoor neighbor or \n     your cousin.''\n       The head neighbor of all this is retired Army Col. John G. \n     Campbell, president of the nonprofit group. Not surprisingly, \n     his consulting firm has donated office space to Kids.\n       He's a tall, handsome Texan with an endearing drawl, a \n     killer grin and a disarming demeanor. At Kids events, he's \n     everywhere at once, announcing the next guest or simply \n     rounding up metal folding chairs for the artist he's enlisted \n     to draw pictures of the children. Col. Campbell's stunning \n     wife, Jan, who is Kids secretary/treasurer, and the rest of \n     the volunteer army work the huge crowd.\n       ``A brilliant, brave soldier with a touch of bravado,'' \n     says Sen. John Warner, Virginia Republican, of Col Campbell, \n     with whom he has worked for many years on Capitol Hill.\n       Yet Col. Campbell takes great pains to point out that this \n     is an all-volunteer organization. What little overhead there \n     is pays for a certified public accountant and for operating \n     licenses. Kids could not survive on just John Campbell, and \n     he knows it.\n       ``While most of the news you read is bad news, there are a \n     great deal of good things going on,'' he says. ``People are \n     willing--and eager--to help if they know it's going directly \n     to a worthy cause.''\n       The first child Kids helped was 8-year-old Andrew Bley, who \n     suffered from a brain tumor. The boy went to the same church \n     as Col. Campbell, a Burke resident, who at the time was a \n     well-connected Army liaison officer to the U.S. Senate. He \n     and several others met with then-Rep. Earl Hutto, Florida \n     Democrat, and Frank Borman, then-chairman of Eastern \n     Airlines, whom Col. Campbell knew while on the faculty of \n     West Point. They pooled their resources and sent Andrew and \n     his family to Walt Disney World ``for what was really their \n     first real, great family vacation.''\n       ``The family's resources were exhausted--which, by the way, \n     is frequently the case in all of these things,'' Col. \n     Campbell says. Andrew was ``a brave, cheerful kid who fought \n     until the end and died,'' says Col. Campbell, his voice \n     ebbing.\n       The boy, as they say, did not die in vain. The trip created \n     a lasting impression on the volunteers.\n       ``It was so rewarding for those of us who participated in \n     it, we thought, `Gee, we ought to try and to this on some \n     sort of organized basis.' '' Col. Campbell says.\n       A framed check dated Dec. 28, 1983, on the wall of Col. \n     Campbell's office is signed by Mr. Warner for $250. This \n     marked the first actual donation, opening the bank account \n     the day Kids officially went into business.\n       The orders came in immediately. Some children wanted--and \n     got--events such as being onstage with Bill Cosby or trips to \n     Ocean City or the circus. (One child even went fishing in \n     Alaska.)\n       Others received items such as a new wheelchair, an \n     automatic page turner, art lessons, home computer, a canopied \n     bed or a pneumo-wrap, which helped a 16-year-old boy with \n     Duchenne's muscular dystrophy breathe more easily. One \n     heartbreaker wanted an Easter dress and matching bonnet. \n     Another just wanted a Barbie doll.\n       Some of the other requests weren't so simple, but were \n     attainable. A little boy spent a few nights on the aircraft \n     carrier USS Saratoga and sat in the cockpit of a jet. (``They \n     made him an honorary member of the squadron and gave him a \n     leather jacket,'' says Col. Campbell.) Kids has also taken \n     children on elephant rides, trips to the FBI's target range \n     and up in the air in a hot air balloon.\n       The first year, 1982, Kids helped seven children. The \n     numbers doubled the next year, and last year the organization \n     helped 60 children.\n       The Kids brochure stresses that the families of the \n     patients are involved as much as possible. ``Generally in \n     these situations the family is wiped out,'' Col. Campbell, \n     ``but in the end we do what the child wants to do.''\n       This message pervades conversations with participants. In \n     the pauses, it's evident that childhood illness is very \n     democratic, within and without.\n       ``It affects the entire family,'' says retired Army Col. \n     Frank Norton, a member of Kids' 28-member advisory board. \n     ``It's not just the child suffering. The other children in \n     the family watch their parents have to put all their money, \n     time and energy into this one child, and they may not have \n     time to do other things with the other children. Kids is a \n     way to help the entire process, and I think they have been \n     successful in a wonderfully low-key way.''\n       While Kids' heart is in the right place, it does not--and \n     cannot--accept everybody. There are 10 specific requirements. \n     One is that children must be recommended by a social worker \n     or other health care professional. Another specifies that \n     children be 16 or younger, though Kids can be flexible on \n     this point.\n       As it is with any well-oiled charitable machine, once word \n     gets out about its success there seems to be more people in \n     need than there is money. Kids raises its funds through \n     events--such as the annual Kids Celebrity Tennis Party and \n     the Kids Hot Air Balloon Rally, golf tournaments, art \n     auctions, movie premieres and car shows.\n       Depite the complexity of such operations, the events \n     themselves come off pretty casually. The children, sometimes \n     wearing crisp, colorful Kids T-shirts and ball caps to shield \n     their shaved heads from the sun, show up with their parents \n     and brothers and sisters. The picnics are filled with games \n     and food, and the volunteers seem to have as much fun \n     laughing and playing as do the families.\n       ``In terms of the parents, they are profiles in courage,'' \n     says Mr. Warner. ``They want to do everything they can to \n     bring some happiness into that child's life. And then you see \n     in the child's face equal or even greater courage. They may \n     have some knowledge of their terminal nature and yet they \n     retain that youthful vigor.''\n       Connections are crucial for a nonprofit in this town, and \n     Col. Campbell makes no bones about using his to keep Kids \n     afloat. On the wall is a framed 1992 excerpt from the \n     Congressional Record, which contained Mr. Warner's remarks \n     about the value of Kids. He and his Senate pals Strom \n     Thurmond, Alfonse D'Amato, Pete Domenici and Trent Lott are \n     on the Kids board of advisers, as are Reps. W.G.

The Congress and the Administration are right to be proud \nof this historic agreement. This report provides solid evidence that \nNAFTA has already proved its worth to the United States during the 3 \nyears it has been in effect. We can look forward to realizing NAFTA's \nfull benefits in the years ahead.\n  NAFTA has also contributed to the prosperity and stability of our \nclosest neighbors and two of our most important trading partners. NAFTA \naided Mexico's rapid recovery from a severe economic recession, even as \nthat country carried forward a democratic transformation of historic \nproportions.\n  NAFTA is an integral part of a broader growth strategy that has \nproduced the strongest U.S. economy in a generation. This strategy \nrests on three mutually supportive pillars: deficit reduction, \ninvesting in our people through education and training, and opening \nforeign markets to allow America to compete in the global economy. The \nsuccess of that strategy can be seen in the strength of the American \neconomy, which continues to experience strong investment, low \nunemployment, healthy job creation, and subdued inflation.\n  Export growth has been central to America's economic expansion. \nNAFTA, together with the Uruguay Round Agreement, the Information \nTechnology Agreement, the WTO Telecommunications Agreement, 22 sectoral \ntrade agreements with Japan, and over 170 other trade agreements, has \ncontributed to overall U.S. real export growth of 37 percent since \n1993. Exports have contributed nearly one-third of our economic \ngrowth--and have grown three times faster than overall income.\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\n  Workers, business executives, small business owners, and farmers \nacross America have contributed to the resurgence in American \ncompetitiveness. The ability and determination of working people across \nAmerica to rise to the challenges of rapidly changing technologies and \nglobal economic competition is a great source of strength for this \nNation.\n  Cooperation between the Administration and the Congress on a \nbipartisan basis has been critical in our efforts to reduce the \ndeficit, to conclude trade agreements that level the global playing \nfield for America, to secure peace and prosperity along America's \nborders, and to help prepare all Americans to benefit from expanded \neconomic opportunities. I hope we can continue working together to \nadvance these vital goals in the years to come.\n                                                  William J.

By supporting our museums and theaters, our dance companies \nand symphony orchestras, our writers and our artists, the National \nEndowment for the Arts provides such a climate. Look through this \nreport and you will find many reasons to be proud of our Nation's \ncultural life at the end of the 20th century and what it portends for \nAmericans and the world in the years ahead.\n  Despite cutbacks in its budget, the Endowment was able to fund \nthousands of projects all across America--a museum in Sitka, Alaska; a \ndance company in Miami, Florida; a production of a Eugene O'Neill play \nin New York City; a Whistler exhibition in Chicago; and artists in \nschools in all 50 States. Millions of Americans were able to see plays, \nhear concerts, and participate in the arts in their hometowns, thanks \nto the work of this small agency.\n  As we set our priorities for the coming years, let's not forget the \nvital role the National Endowment for the Arts must continue to play in \nour national life. The Endowment shows the world that we take pride in \nAmerican culture here and abroad. It is a beacon, not only of \ncreativity, but of freedom. And let us keep that lamp brightly burning \nnow and for all time.\n                                                  William J.

Through a wide \n     variety of programs and the channels of communications it has \n     opened, NATO has helped to secure the peace, economic \n     development, and cooperation among its member nations and \n     other countries; and\n       Whereas, Poland, a free and democratic nation with a long \n     and proud history, enjoys numerous ties with NATO member \n     nations. The Republic of Poland is committed to the \n     preservation of freedom and the strengthening of democracy. \n     This nation's well-being as a sovereign country has long been \n     dependent upon the overall stability of central Europe; and\n       Whereas, the people of Poland wish to exercise their \n     responsibilities within NATO.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado; to the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 97-1027\n\n       Whereas, the federal ``Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996'', Public Law 104-193, \n     herein referred to as the ``Act'', was passed by the United \n     States House of Representatives on July 18, 1996, and the \n     United States Senate on July 23, 1996, and signed into law by \n     President Clinton on August 22, 1996; and\n       Whereas, Article III of such Act addresses the several \n     states' obligation to provide child support enforcement \n     services and mandates that the states adopt certain \n     procedures for the location of an obligor and the \n     establishment, modification, and enforcement of a child \n     support obligation against such obligor; and\n       Whereas, the members of the Sixty-first General Assembly \n     recognize the importance of assuring financial support for \n     minor and dependent children; however, the General Assembly \n     finds that those procedures specified in the Act include such \n     far-reaching measures as the following:\n       (1) The necessity to implement the ``Uniform Interstate \n     Family Support Act'', as approved by the American Bar \n     Association and as amended by the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which uniform act allows \n     for the direct registration of foreign support orders and the \n     activation of income-withholding procedures across state \n     lines without any prior verification, certification, or other \n     authentication that the child support order or the income-\n     withholding form is accurate or valid and without a \n     requirement that notice of such withholding be provided to \n     the alleged obligor by any specified means or method, such as \n     by first-class mail or personal service, to assure that the \n     individual receives proper notice prior to the income-\n     withholding;\n       (2) Liens to arise by operation of law against real and \n     personal property for amounts of overdue support that are \n     owed by a noncustodial parent who resides or owns property in \n     the state, without the ability to determine if a lien exists \n     on certain property;\n       (3) The obligation of the state to accord full faith and \n     credit to such liens arising by operation of law in any other \n     state, which results in inadequate notice and the inability \n     of purchasers to have knowledge or notice of such liens;\n       (4) A duty placed upon employers to report all newly hired \n     employees, whether or not the employee has a child support \n     obligation, to a state directory of new hires within a \n     restricted period of time after the employer hires the \n     employee;\n       (5) The requirement that social security numbers be \n     recorded when a person applies for a professional license, a \n     commercial driver's license, an occupational license, or a \n     marriage license, when a person is subject to a divorce \n     decree, a support order, or a paternity determination or \n     acknowledgment, or when an individual dies, whether or not \n     the person has an obligation to pay child support;\n       (6) A requirement that the child support enforcement agency \n     enter into agreements with financial institutions doing \n     business in the state in order to develop, operate, and \n     coordinate an unprecedented and invasive data match system \n     for the sharing of account holder information with the child \n     support enforcement agency in order to facilitate the \n     potential matching of delinquent obligors and bank account \n     holders;\n       (7) Procedures by which the state child support enforcement \n     agency may subpoena financial or other information needed to \n     establish, modify, or enforce a support order and to impose \n     penalties for failure to respond to such a subpoena and \n     procedures by which to access information contained in \n     certain records, including the records of public utilities \n     and cable television companies pursuant to an administrative \n     subpoena; and\n       (8) Procedures interfering with the states' right to \n     determine when a jury trial is to be authorized; and\n       Whereas, the Act mandates numerous, unnecessary \n     requirements upon the several states that epitomize the \n     continuing trend of intrusion by government into people's \n     personal lives; and\n       Whereas, the Act offends the notion of notice and \n     opportunity to be heard guaranteed to the people by the Due \n     Process Clauses of the 5th and 14th Amendments to the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Act offends the 10th Amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which provides that ``The \n     powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.''; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has ruled in New \n     York v. United States, 112 S.

C. \n     Choy in 1984; and\n       Whereas, a judgeship for the State of Hawaii has been \n     denied throughout the last three presidential \n     administrations; and\n       Whereas, the State of Hawaii is one of only two states in \n     the Union without full-time, active representation on its \n     respective federal circuits; and\n       Whereas, the federal circuit courts, according to U.S. \n     Senator Diane Feinstein of California, ``have been structured \n     to draw upon the legal traditions of several states'' in \n     order to ``preserve the federalizing function of the courts \n     of appeals''; and\n       Whereas, the ideals expressed by Senator Feinstein cannot \n     possibly be attained in the U.S. Ninth Circuit if the State \n     of Hawaii has no circuit judge to give voice to our ``legal \n     traditions''; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals receives \n     approximately six percent of its workload from the State of \n     Hawaii, including cases involving the Native Hawaiian \n     Sovereignty vote, mandatory lease to fee condominium \n     conversion, Native Hawaiian land claims, and the Waikiki \n     vending ordinances, among many others: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Nineteenth Legislature of the \n     State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1997, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the President of the United \n     States and the United States Senate are respectfully \n     requested to work diligently and appropriately to award the \n     State of Hawaii a full and equal measure of judicial \n     representation on the United States Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals by appointing and confirming a qualified resident of \n     the State of Hawaii to any presently existing vacant Ninth \n     Circuit judgeship; and be it further\n       Resolved That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     Governor of the State of Hawaii, the members of the Hawaii \n     Congressional Delegation, and the Honorable Orrin Hatch, \n     Chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Committee.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-172.

Nixon, U.S. \n     District Court Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee, \n     has overturned the capital convictions of four (4) of \n     Tennessee's most heinous convicted killers; and\n       Whereas, in overturning these four (4) convictions, Judge \n     Nixon has continued a pattern of judicial conduct that raises \n     an issue as to his bias against capital punishment; and\n       Whereas, during his tenure on the U.S. District Court for \n     the Middle District of Tennessee, Judge Nixon has continually \n     delayed ruling on capital cases before his court; and\n       Whereas, he has also repeatedly reversed the convictions \n     and/or sentences of many capital cases which were tried and \n     adjudicated years ago, making it difficult for such cases to \n     be retried; and\n       Whereas, the State of Tennessee Attorney General has even \n     filed a petition for writ of mandamus against Judge Nixon to \n     expedite a death penalty matter in a particular case that \n     languished in his court: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the one-hundredth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives Concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     memorializes the House of Representatives and Senate of the \n     U.S. Congress to consider amending the United States \n     Constitution to remove Federal Judges for ``dereliction of \n     duty'', and not just ``high crimes and misdemeanors'', in \n     order to ensure that judges act with due dispatch and care in \n     carrying out their duties on appeals of capital cases and \n     other habeas corpus matters, and writs of mandamus, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That this General Assembly hereby memorializes \n     the House of Representatives of the United States Congress to \n     thoroughly and timely investigate whether ground exist to \n     impeach John T.

No. 449), which, if \n     enacted, would direct the Secretary of the Interior to \n     dispose of certain Federal lands in the Las Vegas Valley and \n     authorize the State of Nevada to elect to obtain the lands \n     for public purposes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     jointly, That the Legislature of the State of Nevada hereby \n     expresses its support for the Southern Nevada Public Land \n     Management Act of 1997 and for the sale or other transfer of \n     public land managed by the Federal Government in the Las \n     Vegas Valley if the transfer does not adversely affect \n     sparsely populated and rural counties in Nevada; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-174.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the tax incentives for alcohol used as a fuel shall be extended as \npart of any extension of fuel tax rates; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         EXCISE TAX LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould extend the current excise tax incentive for ethanol use. I am \npleased to be joined by Senators Moseley-Braun, Johnson, and Wellstone \nin this important effort.\n  We are moving forward with this extension today for several reasons. \nLast month the Senate included extension language in the reconciliation \nbill. I believe this sends a strong signal that ethanol enjoys wide, \nbipartisan support on this side of the Capitol. Based on that action, \nnow is the appropriate time to pursue extension through any and all \navenues. Reconciliation is one avenue. Reauthorization of the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act [ISTEA], the \nvehicle used in this legislation, is another. We would prefer that it \nbe done sooner in the reconciliation bill, rather than later in the \nISTEA reauthorization. But we want to make it clear that, one way or \nanother, we will not rest until this extension becomes law.\n  I stand in strong support of the Senate's reconciliation language \nthat would extend the program through 2007. I commend my colleagues, \nSenators Grassley and Moseley-Braun for their tireless efforts to \ninclude an extension in the Senate language. And, I urge Senate \nconferees to hold fast to that position.\n  Despite strong support in the Senate, the House Ways and Means \nCommittee voted last month to cut, cap, and kill this important \nprogram. Even with a moderation of the Committee language in the House \nand the action by the Senate, the House Committee action has caused \nconsiderable uncertainty about the future of the ethanol program which \nwill no doubt affect the growth of this renewable fuel program.\n  The ethanol program has been an excellent example of a program that \nworks. At a time when we are laboring to enact a balanced budget, I \nbelieve that programs, like ethanol, that pay for themselves and \nprovide important benefits should be maintained rather than summarily \neliminated.\n  Ethanol's benefits are well documented--it strengthens the economy, \nimproves the environment, and decreases our dependence on foreign oil. \nA recent study conducted by the Midwest Governors' Conference concluded \nthat the ethanol program produces a net savings to the Federal budget \nof more than $3.6 billion, adds over $450 million to State tax receipts \neach year, increases total U.S. employment by 195,200 jobs, and boosts \nnet farm income by more than $4.5 billion annually. The Federal \nGovernment gains $1.30 for each gallon of ethanol sold in America--more \nthan double the 54-cent-per-gallon cost of the incentive.\n  The increased use of ethanol helps offset the greenhouse gas \nemissions that result from the burning of fossil fuels. Ethanol-blended \nfuels reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and air \ntoxics. Also, ethanol reduces the demand for imported gasoline and \nimported oxygenates by more than 90,000 barrels per day.\n  Clearly, ethanol is not a favorite of many of the big oil companies. \nBut just as clearly, ethanol use is good for America. Each gallon of \nethanol production capacity not built due to uncertainty about \nethanol's tax status represents a loss of revenue to the U.S. Treasury \nas well as to our Nation's farmers. If investors are scared away \nbecause of legislative attacks on ethanol, the taxpayer loses.\n  That is why we are introducing legislation to reaffirm and extend our \nnational commitment to this domestic, agriculture-based, renewable fuel \nprogram. We need to give this important sector of our economy the \nstability that will allow it to keep expanding. We need a solid, long-\nterm commitment to help ensure that the demand for home-grown ethanol \ncontinues.\n  It is a critical time for ethanol. Instead of debating how to cut, \ncap, and kill the ethanol program as a number of legislators on the \nother side of the Capitol have done, supporters, whether from rural or \nurban areas, should be discussing the most appropriate way to extend \nthe program. A program that works.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation to send a signal that Congress will keep its commitment to \nrenewable alcohol fuels.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 1009. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nincrease the Federal minimum wage; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                 legislation to raise the minimum wage\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, we renew the battle for a fair \nminimum wage. Last year, after an unacceptable lag of 5 years, Congress \nenacted legislation to raise the minimum wage, which had shamefully \nbeen allowed to fall below acceptable levels and was no longer a living \nwage for the 10 million Americans who rely on it for their income.\n  We all remember the battle in the last Congress. For over 18 months, \nRepublican Senators, newly in the majority, stalled action on any \nincrease. The irresponsibility and unfairness of that obstruction \nbecame increasingly obvious, and the opponents became increasingly \nnervous about their position. Public support for a fair increase in the \nminimum wage finally became overwhelming. As the 1996 elections came \ncloser, the obstructionists surrendered--and a fair two-step increase \nwas signed into law by President Clinton last August. Under that \nlegislation, the minimum wage rose from $4.25 an hour to $4.75 an hour \non October 1, 1996, and it will rise to $5.15 an hour on September 1 \nthis year.\n  Current law stops there. No further increases will take effect unless \nCongress acts again. It is time for us to do so now, in order to \nguarantee that further fair increases take place in the years ahead.\n  Today, therefore, I am introducing legislation to provide increases \nof 50 cents an hour in each of the next 3 years and increases of 30 \ncents an hour in each of the following 2 years--to $5.65 an hour on \nSeptember 1, 1998, to $6.15 an hour on September 1, 1999, to $6.65 an \nhour on September 1, 2000, to $6.95 an hour on September 1, 2001, and \nto $7.25 an hour on September 1, 2002.\n  At a time when Congress is making many other decisions on taxing and \nspending over the next 5 years, it is entirely appropriate that we act \non the minimum wage over the 5-year budget period, too.\n  The increases I am proposing are based on a simple principle. Intense \nRepublican opposition to raising the minimum wage during the 8 years of \nthe Reagan administration, and periodic opposition during the past 7 \nyears, have left the real value of the minimum wage far below the \nlevels it had in the previous 40 years. The bill introduced today will \nrestore the purchasing power of the minimum wage to the level it had \nwhen the Reagan administration came to power.\n  The experience with the 50-cent increase that went into effect for \nthe minimum wage last October refutes the doomsday predictions that \nopponents have always raised whenever Congress considers a fair \nincrease. A study released today by the Economic Policy Institute sums \nup the experience of the past 9 months. As the title of the study \nstates, ``The Sky Hasn't Fallen'' because of the increase.\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\n  The study documents several clear facts about last year's increase: \nIt raised wages for 4 million workers; 66 percent of these are adults, \nand 58 percent are women.\n  Some 40 percent of the increase went to families in the bottom 20 \npercent of the income scale, whose earnings average $14,000 a year; 55 \npercent of the increase went to families in the bottom 40 percent of \nthe income scale, who earn $30,000 a year or less.\n  Contrary to opponents' claims, the increase did not primarily go to \nteenagers in part-time jobs after school.\n  There was no significant effect on employment of adults, minorities, \nteenagers or anyone else. The crocodile tears shed for these groups by \nopponents of the minimum wage have no basis in fact.\n  The bottom line is clear. Employment does not go down because the \nminimum wage goes up. The overall conditions of the economy determine \nthe levels of employment for all sectors of the work force. Reasonable \nincreases in the minimum wage have no significant effect on these \nlevels.\n  Even the Wall Street Journal threw in the towel, and it did so soon \nafter the increase last October took effect. An article published on \nNovember 20, 1996 was headlined ``Fears Over Raising the Minimum Wage \nAppear Unfounded.'' And the facts since then have amply verified that \nstatement.\n  Raising the minimum wage was the right thing for Congress to do last \nyear, and it's the right thing for Congress to do this year. No one who \nworks for a living should have to live in poverty. Everyone who works \nfor a living deserves a living wage. I urge the Senate and the House to \nact expeditiously on the legislation I am introducing today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous Consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1009\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to suspend the rate of duty with respect to certain \nchemicals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           duty suspension with respect to certain chemicals\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nwill suspend the duties on two chemicals used in the manufacturing of \npharmaceuticals, ultraviolet protection products, and fragrances. \nCurrently, these chemicals are imported into the United States.\n  The first chemical, benzyl alcohol, is used to produce esters. In \n1996, this product was listed in the pharmaceutical category and \ncarried a duty free status which has been overturned.\n  The second chemical, benzophenone, is primarily used to produce \npharmaceuticals, ultraviolet protection products, and fragrances. \nCurrently, no domestic producer of this product exists. Therefore, \nsuspending the duties on this item would not adversely affect domestic \nindustries.\n  Mr. President, suspending the duty on these chemicals will benefit \nthe consumers by stabilizing the costs of the end products. I hope the \nSenate will consider this measure expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1010\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DUTY SUSPENSIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the \n     United States is amended--\n       (1) in subheading 2906.11.00 (relating to dl menthol), by \n     striking

ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS REGARDING THE \n                   SAFETY, SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY OF UNITED \n                   STATES NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on \n     earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on \n     nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using \n     weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of \n     the nuclear stockpile are essential to ensure its credibility \n     as a deterrent.\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\n       (2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       (3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States \n     is prohibited by section 507 of the Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102-377; 42 \n     U.S.C. 2121 note) from conducting underground nuclear tests \n     ``unless a foreign state conducts a nuclear test after this \n     date, at which time the prohibition on United States nuclear \n     testing is lifted''.\n       (4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the Secretary of Energy to ``establish and \n     support a program to assure that the United States is in a \n     position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued \n     deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons \n     designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive \n     test ban on nuclear explosive testing is negotiated and \n     ratified.''.\n       (5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the President to submit an annual report to \n     Congress which sets forth ``any concerns with respect to the \n     safety, security, effectiveness, or reliability of existing \n     United States nuclear weapons raised by the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program of the Department of Energy''.\n       (6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that ``to \n     assure that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under \n     a test ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our \n     confidence in the safety, reliability, and the performance of \n     our weapons''. This decision was codified in a Presidential \n     Directive.\n       (7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1994 also requires that the Secretary of \n     Energy establish a ``stewardship program to ensure the \n     preservation of the core intellectual and technical \n     competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons''.\n       (8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the \n     safety and reliability of the United States nuclear stockpile \n     is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. \n     The ability of the United States to maintain warheads without \n     testing will require development of new and sophisticated \n     diagnostic technologies, methods, and procedures. Current \n     diagnostic technologies and laboratory testing techniques are \n     insufficient to certify the future safety and reliability of \n     the United States nuclear stockpile. In the past these \n     laboratory and diagnostic tools were used in conjunction with \n     nuclear testing.\n       (9) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed ``the \n     establishment of a new annual reporting and certification \n     requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe \n     and reliable under a comprehensive test ban''.\n       (10) On the same day, the President noted that the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the \n     responsibility, after being ``advised by the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, \n     and the Commander of United States Strategic Command'', to \n     provide the President with the information to make the \n     certification referred to in paragraph (9).\n       (11) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code, is responsible \n     for providing advice to the Secretary of Energy and Secretary \n     of Defense regarding nuclear weapons issues, including \n     ``considering safety, security, and control issues for \n     existing weapons''.

Mr. President, today, July 11, marks the \nsecond anniversary of the fall of the so-called safe area of \nSrebrenica, one of the three eastern enclaves in Bosnia.\n  By most estimates, following the fall of Srebrenica over 8,000 Muslim \nrefugees fleeing the Serb forces simply disappeared. Many of these \nrefugees were old men, women, and children, killed in acts of inhuman \ncruelty.\n  Even today, 2 years later, the vast majority of these people are \nstill unaccounted for.\n  Others from Srebrenica were luckier--forced to flee their homes as \npart of a brutal policy of ethnic cleansing.\n  I am still haunted by an image from a picture that I saw in the \nnewspaper shortly after the fall of Srebrenica. It was a picture of a \nyoung woman, a refugee from Srebrenica, around 20 years old, who \nclimbed a tree, tied a rope around her neck, and hung herself. A \nphotographer captured her lifeless body as it hung from the tree.\n  Mr. President, I look at that picture and I think: What kind of \nnation are we if we can not see to it that the people who practiced \nrape, practiced genocide, practiced ethnic cleansing, are not brought \nto justice? We know who these people are. We know where they live.\n  The fact is, of the 74 war criminals indicted by the International \nWar Crimes Tribunal at The Hague, only 9 have been apprehended.\n  Where is the conscience of the world?\n  I first wrote to the President about this issue on September 11 of \nlast year, following a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, at which administration witnesses provided testimony to the \neffect that there were no capable international or national \ninstitutions in Bosnia with both the authority and the ability to \napprehend indicted war criminals.\n  The President responded to this letter that ``although the peace will \nnot be complete until indicted war criminals are brought to justice,'' \nIFOR would not hunt down war criminals, and that U.S. policy would be \nto ``continue our efforts to press all parties to turn over indicted \nwar criminals to the Tribunal.''\n  In the months since then we have seen how willing the parties to \nDayton have been to turn over indicted war criminals.\n  When the IFOR mandate ended and IFOR was replaced by SFOR, I took up \nthis issue with Secretary Perry, writing him on December 4 last year--\nagain, following a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--\nthat I believed that it was essential that the follow-on force have \nclear, unambiguous authority for apprehending war criminals or to \nprovide more effective support to other authorities in carrying out \nthis task.\n  I received a response from the Department of Defense on February 18 \nof this year that again stated that the administration shared my \nconcern on the importance of this issue, but that no additional efforts \nto apprehend war criminals would be forthcoming.\n  I also took this question up with the other Democratic and Republican \nwomen of the Senate. The nine of us sent a letter to the President on \nMarch 3 of this year in which we requested that the President:\n\n       . . . look at this problem as a top priority and indicate \n     to us precisely how the international community might ensure \n     the arrest and extradition to The Hague of those responsible \n     for crimes against humanity.\n\n  The President responded to us on April 11. His letter stressed the \nrole of\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\nthe International Tribunal in ``establishing accountability for war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity . . .'' The President also stated \nthat:\n\n       I share your sense of urgency and my Administration is \n     committed to assisting the Tribunals in the apprehension and \n     extradition of those indictees who remain at large. We are \n     currently examining a variety of options in this regard.\n\n  Frankly, I found the President's response to be inadequate. And in \nmid-April I wrote to both the President and the Secretary General of \nthe United Nations urging an aggressive stand to see that indicted war \ncriminals are brought to justice.\n  As I stated in my April 21 letter to the President, it is my belief \nthat:\n\n       Unless the United States takes a position of aggressive \n     leadership on this issue in the international community, we \n     run the risk that future historians will conclude that the \n     lessons of current U.S. foreign policy are that crimes \n     against humanity, genocide, and the use of rape as an \n     instrument of war are acceptable--and that those who \n     perpetrate these crimes can do so with impunity.\n\n  We would, moreover, put at risk all the gains of the Dayton process \nif we do not bring these war criminals to justice.\n  The President responded to me on June 19, stating that, ``My foreign \npolicy team is examining several options to assist and enhance the \nability of the Tribunal to bring indicted war criminals into custody.''\n  Mr. President, I will ask that copies of those portions of this \ncorrespondence that I feel my colleagues will find most useful be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  Finally, to provide additional tools to the administration in the \napprehension of war criminals, in May of this year Senator Lautenberg, \nLugar, Leahy, D'Amato, Mikulski, and myself introduced the War Crimes \nProsecution Facilitation Act of 1997. This legislation, which has since \nbeen included in the committee-passed Senate Foreign Operation \nAppropriations bill, conditions United States financial assistance to \nthe states and entities of the former Yugoslavia with their cooperation \nwith the war crimes Tribunal.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what humiliations and deprivations this \nwoman whose picture I saw in the paper suffered. Perhaps she saw a \nloved one killed. Perhaps she was raped. All I know is that she could \ntake no more.\n  In the memory of this nameless young woman, and in the memory of the \ncountless thousands of others who were killed, tortured, and raped, we \nmust make sure that peace and justice are restored in Bosnia.\n  And the bottom line is that there can be no peace and justice in \nBosnia without the prosecution of those who committed crimes against \nhumanity.\n  What happened in Srebrenica was not unique to the war that tore the \nformer Yugoslavia apart. In town after town, village after village, \natrocities were committed by all sides in a brutal civil war.\n  Unlike the countless other villages and towns wiped off the map in \nthe campaigns of ethnic cleansing, however, the fall of Srebrenica--and \nthe brutal atrocities carried on while the international community \nstood passively by--at long last galvanized the international community \nto end the war and bloodshed in Bosnia. What we saw in Srebrenica \nshamed the international community to action, and led to the \nnegotiation of the Dayton accords.\n  Today, 2 years after Srebrenica and a year-and-a-half since Dayton, \nshould be a day to look back at our accomplishments of the past 2 years \nand say that we have upheld our vow of ``never again.''\n  Instead, it is a day when we must admit that we have not done enough \nto honor the memory of the young women whose photograph I referred to \nearlier, or the other victims of ethnic cleansing in the former \nYugoslavia.\n  The horrors that tore Yugoslavia apart--the ethnic cleansing, the \ngenocide, the rapes--have been well documented. The perpetrators of \nthese horrors are well known. Yet only 9 of the 75 indicted war \ncriminals in the former Yugoslavia have been apprehended and are in \ncustody.\n  The rest remain at liberty, their whereabouts known, and many working \nin jobs with the police, government, and leading businesses in the \nformer Yugoslavia. Many live and work within minutes of NATO camps \nmanned by U.S. troops.\n  Despite its efforts to amass evidence, lead investigations, and issue \nindictments, at almost every turn the Tribunal has been stymied by the \nfailure of the international community to apprehend indicted war \ncriminals and bring them to justice.\n  Estimates are that up to 20,000 women in Yugoslavia were \nsystematically raped as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and \ngenocide. In Srebrenica, for example, one woman told of Serb soldiers, \ndressed as U.N. peacekeepers, who came in a factory where refugees were \ngathered and dragged away two girls aged 12 and 14 and a 23-year-old \nwoman. After several hours the three returned. They were crying, naked, \nand bleeding. One said, ``We are not girls anymore.''\n  According to the U.N. Commission of Experts, the victims of rape in \nBosnia included girls as young as 6 and women as old as 81. Many women \nand girls were subjected to gang rapes while being held in detention \ncamps. And, tragically, for many of the women of ex-Yugoslavia rape was \nmerely a prelude to further torture and then death.\n  I believe the use of rape as an instrument of genocide and ethnic \ncleansing is a war crime of the highest order. And the failure to \nassure that those who have been indicted for rape as a war crime are \napprehended, extradited, and made to stand trial, does a grave \ninjustice not just to the women of Srebrenica, but to women around the \nworld.\n  The administration has asserted that rape as a war crime must not be \nallowed to stand and that the peace in this troubled area ``will not be \ncomplete until indicted war criminals are brought to justice.''\n  Ultimately, it would be a hollow and cynical gesture to claim outrage \nover rape as a war crime but then to act as if the issue is not \nimportant enough to merit the commitment or resources to see that those \nwho committed these crimes are apprehend and prosecuted.\n  Our commitment to Bosnia, after all, is not just about Bosnia. It is \nalso about the principles that guide us and our conduct in the world. \nIt is about what we, as Americans, value.\n  Yesterday, with the arrest of one indicted war criminal by SFOR, and \nthe death of another who resisted arrest, the international community \ntook a long-delayed step in the right direction in seeing that the \nperpetrators of these crimes against humanity are brought to justice.\n  I hope that the actions of SFOR in Prejidor yesterday sends a clear \nsignal to those indicted war criminals who remain at large that today, \non the anniversary of the fall of Srebrenica, the international \ncommunity is serious about bringing them to justice.\n  Although I believe that the capture of indicted war criminals is \nprimarily the responsibility of the governments of the former \nYugoslavia, yesterday's action illustrate the important role that SFOR \nhas to play in this process as well.\n  The SFOR mandate clearly states that if SFOR patrols, including U.S. \ntroops, encounter indicted war criminals and the tactical situation \npermits they are to arrest them and extradite them to The Hague.\n  But we have also heard stories of SFOR commanders telling their \ntroops that if they encounter an indicted war criminal they should \nleave the area immediately and take no action.\n  I can think of no better way to honor the memory of Srebrenica then \nif today SFOR turns over a new leaf, and vows to pursue its mandate \nvigorously and to the maximum degree possible.\n  If indicted war criminals are not brought to justice, the \ninternational community will have betrayed the legacy of Nuremberg, the \nvictims of the war that tore Yugoslavia apart, and women worldwide. \nThis will also set a dangerous precedent that will give encouragement \nto others elsewhere in the world who may consider the use of rape and \ngenocide as tools of war.\n  In the aftermath of the Holocaust 50 years ago, the civilized world \nvowed that we would never again allow crimes against humanity to \nblacken our history.\n  In the aftermath of the tragedy of Srebrenica 2 years ago, we vowed \nthat we would bring peace and justice to Bosnia.\n  Today, on the second anniversary of the fall of Srebrenica the \ninternational community must vow to redouble its\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\ncommitment to take immediate strong action to see that the indicted war \ncriminals are brought to justice.\n  If not, as I stated in my letter to the President on April 21, 1997, \nwe run the risk that future historians will look back on current U.S. \npolicy and conclude that the ethnic cleansing and the use of rape as an \ninstrument of war is acceptable--and that those who perpetrate this \ncrime can do so with impunity. This would be a tragic betrayal of our \nhistory, our principles, and the people of Srebrenica.\n  I ask that the correspondence to which I earlier referred be printed \nin the Record.\n  The correspondence follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1997.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We, the women of the United States \n     Senate, welcome your recent statement that you believe that \n     the establishment of a permanent international institution \n     for the prosecution of those who have committed war crimes \n     should be a high priority for the international community, \n     and to express our concern that those indicted for genocide, \n     systematic rape and other war crimes by the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia are apprehended \n     and tried.\n       The Tribunal has clearly established that, for the first \n     time in history, the organized, systematic rape of thousands \n     of women was employed as an instrument of war, and that \n     genocide was used to ``ethnically cleanse'' areas of \n     conflict. These, we believe, are war crimes of the highest \n     order.\n       Investigators have documented rapes of over 50,000 women \n     and girls and the use of rape as a weapon in a brutal \n     campaign of ethnic cleansing. The war that tore Bosnia apart \n     is one more chapter in the reprehensible book of genocide.\n       Those who ordered and perpetuated these crimes must be \n     brought to justice. The War Crimes Tribunal has publicly \n     indicted 75 people, including 5 for genocide, but only 6 of \n     the indicted suspects are in custody and many war criminals \n     remain at large.\n       We understand your decision and concerns about the use of \n     U.S. troops to apprehend indicted war criminals in the former \n     Yugoslavia. Like you, we consider the safety of U.S. troops \n     to be of the highest priority and would not support their \n     security being compromised. We are sure that you will also \n     agree that, to ensure the peace they have worked so hard to \n     preserve does not dissolve as soon as they depart, it is \n     critical that the international community take action to \n     assure that war criminals not be allowed to continue to elude \n     justice.\n       We, the women of the Senate, ask that you look at this \n     problem as a top priority and indicate to us precisely how \n     the international community might ensure the arrest and \n     extradition to the Hague of those responsible for crimes \n     against humanity. We believe that it is critically important \n     that the United States aggressively exercise its leadership \n     in the international community to ensure that the indicted \n     are brought to justice.\n       We look forward to hearing your thinking and plans on this \n     very important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein, Mary L. Landrieu, Carol \n           Moseley-Braun, Olympia J. Snow, Susan M. Collins, Kay \n           Bailey Hutchison, Barbara A. Mikulski, Patty Murray.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1997.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, Thank you for your letter of April 11 \n     regarding the deep concern shared by the women of the Senate \n     that only 7 of the 75 indicted war criminals in the former \n     Yugoslavia have been arrested and extradited to The Hague to \n     stand trial. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed with \n     the substance of your response.\n       In our March 3 letter, the women of the Senate asked that \n     you view this issue as a priority and that the United States \n     provide leadership in ensuring that the international \n     community take steps to secure the necessary trials. The \n     essence of your response appears to be that the \n     administration continues to examine ``a variety of options.''\n       As you may recall, in an October 10, 1996, letter you \n     assured me that the administration ``will continue to assist \n     the War Crimes Tribunal and we will continue to look at all \n     other possible ways to help detain and deliver war criminals \n     to The Hague . . . the peace will not be complete until \n     indicted war criminals are brought to justice.''\n       In the seven months that have passed between your letter to \n     me of October 10 and your letter of April 11, not one \n     additional indicted war criminals has been arrested or \n     extradited to The Hague, and the United States has undertaken \n     no concrete steps to see that they are brought to justice.\n       The failure of U.S. leadership makes a mockery of the \n     Tribunal's efforts, and continued procrastination and \n     obstruction in bringing indicted war criminals to justice \n     threaten to undermine both the Tribunals effectiveness and \n     the Dayton peace process as well. Mr. President, justice \n     delayed is justice denied.\n       If, as you stated to me in your letter last October 10, \n     ``We cannot tolerate genocide, ethnic cleansing and the use \n     of rape as instruments of war,'' then it would appear that \n     current U.S. policy regarding the apprehension of indicted \n     war criminals in the former Yugoslavia is woefully \n     inadequate. In fact, current U.S. policy not only allows \n     those who perpetuated genocide, ethnic cleansing, and rape \n     to remain at liberty, but, as a recent Human Rights Watch/\n     Helsinki report notes, it allows them to occupy positions \n     of authority in running police forces, towns, and \n     businesses in former Yugoslavia.\n       The International War Crimes Tribunal for the former \n     Yugoslavia has clearly established that, for the first time \n     in history, the organized, systematic rape of thousands of \n     women was employed as an instrument of war, and that genocide \n     was used to ``ethnically cleanse'' areas of conflict during \n     the tragic conflict in ex-Yugoslavia.\n       Between 1991 and 1993, the United Nations Commission of \n     Experts documented 800 victims of rape by name, 1,673 who \n     were referred to but not named, and 500 cases of rape with an \n     unspecified number of victims. The youngest documented victim \n     was 5 years old, the oldest 81. The Commission also noted \n     that, due to the social stigma of rape, investigation and \n     documentation were difficult, and estimates are that up to \n     50,000 women in ex-Yugoslavia were systematically raped as \n     part of a policy of ethnic cleansing and genocide. The use of \n     rape as an instrument of genocide and ethnic cleansing, I \n     believe, are war crimes of the highest order. Those \n     responsible must be apprehended and tried.\n       Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the \n     Security Council established the ad hoc International \n     Tribunal in 1993 to prosecute violations of international law \n     in the territories of the former Yugoslavia. This Tribunal \n     was an innovation that renewed the hope that, after the many \n     conflicts during the past half-century in which international \n     law was routinely flouted and justice was denied to the \n     victims of crimes against humanity, the legacy of Nuremberg \n     would be fulfilled.\n       Instead, the Tribunal has been stymied by the international \n     community's failure to arrest war criminals. Today only seven \n     of the seventy-five indicted individuals are in custody. The \n     Office of the Prosecutor continues to amass evidence, lead \n     investigations, conduct searches, issue indictments, and hold \n     in absentia hearings. But the failure of the international \n     community to take action to arrest those indicted and bring \n     them to trial in The Hague puts at risk not only the \n     credibility and effort of the Tribunal, but the concept of \n     international law and justice as well.\n       The failure of the international community to take actions, \n     moreover, has not been caused by any difficulty in locating \n     the indicted war criminals, or, even, in many cases, any \n     potential danger in making arrests.\n       In fact, it is my understanding that the whereabouts of \n     over 40 of the 68 unextradited indicted war criminals are \n     well known. Let me present several examples:\n       The camp commanders of the Omarska concentration camp, \n     where systematic rape of Bosnian women was a regular part of \n     a campaign of oppression, were working openly last year in \n     the local police force in Prijedor in Republika Srpska. \n     (Source: Coalition for International Justice (CIJ), \n     Washington Post)\n       Zeljko Mejakic, the commander of the Omarska camp indicted \n     for rape and crimes against humanity was the deputy commander \n     of the Omarska police station for much of last year. (Source: \n     Boston Globe)\n       Predrag Kostic, a camp guard at Omarska indicted for crimes \n     against humanity, is frequently sighted at the ``Express'' \n     restaurant in Prijedor (Source: CIJ, New York Times).\n       Radovan Karadzic, indicted for genocide following the Serb \n     attack on Srebrenica and whose current home in Pale is well \n     known, is building a house in Koljani (near Banja Luka) and, \n     according to stories in the Associated Press, ``makes little \n     effort to conceal his daily movements.'' (Source: Human \n     Rights Watch, AP)\n       Stevan Todorovic, indicted for a series of atrocities, \n     lives in Donja Slatina, a three-minute drive away from Camp \n     Colt--a 1,000-troop, U.S.-manned SFOR base. To commute to his \n     job with Bosnian state security, Todorovic drives past the \n     base on a road regularly traveled by NATO patrols. (Source: \n     Washington Post)\n       Drago Josipovic, indicted for his role in the execution of \n     Muslim civilians, is a chemical engineer at the local Vitezit \n     explosives factory and lives in his family house in the \n     village of Santici. (Source: CIJ)\n       Radovan Stankovic, a member of the Serb paramilitary unit \n     Pero Elez, and who was in charge of a detention facility \n     where women were regularly raped, works as a policeman in \n     northwest Bosnia. According to a story in Reuters, his \n     whereabouts are well-known to the International Police Task \n     Force and U.N. officials. (Source: Reuters)\n       Blagoje Simic, who has been indicted for failing to halt \n     the torture and abuse of Muslim and Croat civilians, \n     continues to serve as municipal president in Bosanski Samac. \n     Simic was quoted in a Boston Globe article as saying, ``I'm \n     not uncatchable. But I think that someone important still \n     hasn't ordered those arrests to be done.'' Asked who that \n     might be by the Globe reporter, Simic replied ``President \n     Clinton.'' (Source: Boston Globe)\n       These are but a handful of the indicted war criminals who \n     have been regularly seen by credible journalists, \n     representatives of non-\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\n     governmental organizations, and others throughout the former \n     Yugoslavia. In fact, the U.S. State Department spokesperson \n     commented on March 14 of this year that: ``There are a number \n     of indicted war criminals who live in Croatia who have not \n     been turned over to the War Crimes Tribunal. And there are \n     certain individuals that we're watching very closely. We've \n     told the Croatian government that we know who these people \n     are. They've been named by the tribunal as indicted war \n     criminals. We know where they live.''\n       It has become clear that neither Serb authorities within \n     Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina nor Croat \n     authorities in the Federation are meeting their obligations \n     to hand over indicted war criminals--and that the United \n     States is doing very little to force them to meet these \n     obligations.\n       Regular reports about the whereabouts of several indicted \n     war criminals indicate that many lead remarkably open lives. \n     Last fall the Coalition for International Justice published a \n     comprehensive report on the whereabouts, jobs, and everyday \n     habits of 37 of the indicted war criminals. Earlier this \n     year, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki issued a report documenting \n     that many of the people running the towns, police forces and \n     businesses of the Serbian portion of Bosnia are the same \n     people who orchestrated the horrors of ethnic cleansing. In \n     case you have not had the opportunity to see them, I have \n     attached copies of both these reports.\n       The United States, unfortunately, must bear a large share \n     of the blame for the fact that indicted war criminals remain \n     at large in the former Yugoslavia.\n       In the letter to my office last October 10, you stated that \n     ``IFOR will detain indicted war criminals and hand them over \n     to the International Tribunal if they are encountered by IFOR \n     personnel during the normal course of their duties and the \n     tactical situation permits.'' (This mandate regarding war \n     criminals, I understand, has been subsequently extended to \n     SFOR.) Even if we rule out some of the reported war \n     criminal sightings as false, it defies credulity to \n     suggest that so many people in the former Yugoslavia \n     except for SFOR have had regular contact with indicted war \n     criminals.\n       The SFOR rules of engagement regarding war criminals appear \n     to be interpreted so narrowly that it seems that an indicted \n     war criminal would, in effect, have to actively seek out and \n     surrender to SFOR if SFOR troops were to arrest them.\n       Indicted war criminals must be arrested and brought to \n     trial if the Tribunal is to have meaning as the ultimate \n     international arbiter of guilt or innocence in the commission \n     of war crimes. If indicted war criminals are not brought to \n     justice, the international community will have betrayed both \n     the legacy of Nuremberg and the victims of the war that tore \n     Yugoslavia apart. This failure will also set a dangerous \n     precedent that will give encouragement to others elsewhere in \n     the world who may consider the use of rape and genocide as \n     tools of war.\n       In addition, it is my firm belief that the continued \n     presence of indicted war criminals in former Yugoslavia will \n     set the stage for the renewal of violence, bloodshed, and \n     civil war when SFOR departs next year. We will have \n     sacrificed all the gains of the Dayton process because we \n     will have chosen to compromise with war criminals.\n       I once again call upon you to take an aggressive stand to \n     see that the indicted war criminals are brought to justice. \n     Specifically, I encourage you to:\n       Examine the feasibility of the United States and SFOR \n     taking a more active role to apprehend indicted war criminals \n     still at large as well as cooperating more closely with the \n     United Nations, the International Civilian Police Task Force, \n     and civilian authorities in the former Yugoslavia on this \n     issue;\n       Investigate appropriate additional sanctions, which can be \n     enforced either unilaterally or through the United Nations \n     system for the Republika Srpska and Croatia, unless and until \n     they cooperate fully with the Tribunal;\n       Explore the necessity of any additional U.S. assistance to \n     the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former \n     Yugoslavia; and,\n       Move quickly to implement the permanent international body \n     with the power, authority, and resources to investigate, \n     apprehend, and bring war criminals to trial that you spoke of \n     earlier this year.\n       I would also appreciate your clarification of the SFOR \n     rules of engagement for detaining war criminals.\n       Mr. President, you have been called upon to serve the \n     United States at a time of great international change and \n     uncertainty. Unless the United States takes a position of \n     aggressive leadership on this issue in the international \n     community, we run the risk that future historians will \n     conclude that the lessons of current U.S. foreign policy are \n     that crimes against humanity, genocide, and the use of rape \n     as an instrument of war are acceptable--and that those who \n     perpetrate these crimes can do so with impunity. Mr. \n     President, I know that you share my belief that leaving such \n     a legacy would be unacceptable.\n       I look forward to hearing your thoughts and plans on this \n     very important matter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dianne: Thank you for writing again regarding indicted \n     war criminals in the former Yugoslavia. I continue to share \n     your concerns. My foreign policy team is examining several \n     options to assist and enhance the ability of the Tribunal to \n     bring indicted war criminals into custody.\n       We are increasing pressure on the parties by linking \n     multilateral and bilateral economic assistance to their \n     compliance with their obligation under the Dayton Accords to \n     turn over indicted war criminals. In addition, we have begun \n     working with the UN and its International Police Task Force \n     (IPTF) in Bosnia to improve the performance of the IPTF in \n     identifying indictees and their whereabouts.\n       We continue to work closely with the Tribunal, especially \n     the Office of the Chief Prosecutor, by providing a wide range \n     of assistance, including legal and investigative support. The \n     United States also provides the Tribunal intelligence and \n     information pursuant to Section 555 of the Foreign \n     Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act of 1997. On May 2 we contributed $450,000 \n     to the Tribunal's forensic exhumations program in the former \n     Yugoslavia.\n       I have also nominated David Scheffer as Ambassador-at-Large \n     for War Crimes Issues. If confirmed, Mr. Scheffer will \n     coordinate our work in this area and focus on the tasks that \n     are critical to the success of both the Yugoslav and Rwanda \n     War Crimes Tribunals. Finally, knowing our mutual concern for \n     this grave issue, I have asked Robert Gelbard, my Special \n     Representative for Implementation of the Dayton Accords, to \n     give you a confidential briefing as soon as possible on our \n     specific plans to re-energize this critical component of the \n     Dayton peace process.\n       Thanks again for your letter and your continuing support \n     for our efforts to bring peace and justice to the people of \n     the Balkans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7311-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CO-SPONSORSHIP OF SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 29\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support \nas a cosponsor to Senate Concurrent Resolution 29. This resolution \nrecommends the integration of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  Ever since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, there has been \ntalk of expanding NATO membership to include countries of Central \nEurope and the former Baltic Republics. These Baltic countries are \ncontinually striving to transform their political and economic \ninstitutions in accordance with democratic ideals and free market \nprinciples. We have seen remarkable achievements in this respect, from \ncountries that have endured many years of communist occupation.\n  I believe that expanding NATO to include Latvia, Lithuania, and \nEstonia would benefit bi-lateral trade and investment through a stable \nsecurity environment. Furthermore, these countries have made great \nstrides in the areas of human rights, civil liberties and the rule of \nlaw, and have also actively participated in the Partnership for Peace. \nThey should be rewarded for these efforts. Most importantly however, \nenlargement of NATO to include these Baltic States would secure a \nprincipal gain of the cold war by strengthening new free markets and \ndemocracies in the region.\n  Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are all working very hard to satisfy \nthe prerequisites of entry into NATO. As such, I am supportive of all \nefforts to integrate them in the membership of that organization as \nsoon as the process permits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7314-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7314-S7315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COSPONSORSHIP OF SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 19\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support \nas a cosponsor to Senate Concurrent Resolution 19. This resolution \nrecommends the return of, or compensation for, foreign properties that \nwere wrongly confiscated in formerly Communist countries and by certain \nforeign financial institutions.\n  I join my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission in calling for \nrestitution to the many victims who have suffered property losses at \nthe hands of Communist and Fascist dictatorships. These victims had \ntheir property confiscated solely because of their religion, national \nor social origin, or expression of opposition to the regimes in power. \nIn fact, many churches, synagogues, and mosques were destroyed\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\nand/or confiscated by these repressive regimes.\n  Private property ownership is one of the key hallmarks of a free \nsociety, as are the freedom to practice one's own religion, express \none's own social or national traditions, and speak against one's \ngovernment. Violation of these freedoms, and disrespect for these \nconcepts, is a glaring signal that a country is ignoring democratic \nnorms and violating international law.\n  Even more egregious is the fact that some financial institutions \ncooperated with these repressive regimes in converting to their own \npersonal use those financial assets belonging to Holocaust victims, and \ntheir heirs and assigns.

Mr. President, 50 years ago this week, a young 22-\nyear-old rookie named Larry Doby took the baseball field for the first \ntime as a Cleveland Indian. Although Larry did not make a hit during \nthat first at bat, he did something more: he made history. On that day, \nJuly 5, 1947, Larry Doby became the first African-American to play in \nthe American League. I have had the great privilege of knowing Larry \nsince our days growing up together in the streets of Paterson, NJ. I \nhave developed a deep admiration for him. I ask that the text of an \narticle that appeared recently in the Washington Post that captures \nLarry's character be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 8, 1997]\n\n   Neither a Myth Nor a Legend--Larry Doby Crossed Baseball's Color \n                         Barrier After Robinson\n\n                          (By David Maraniss)\n\n       There is only one person alive who knows what it was like \n     to be a black ballplayer integrating the white world of the \n     major leagues during the historic summer of 1947. If you are \n     young or only a casual follower of baseball, perhaps you have \n     not heard of him.\n       Larry Doby is 72 years old now, and his calm manner seems \n     out of style in this unsporting age of self-obsession. He is \n     neither a celebrity nor the stuff of myth, simply a quiet \n     hero with an incomparable story to tell.\n       This season, as the national pastime commemorates the 50th \n     anniversary of the breaking of the color line, the attention \n     has focused inevitably on the first black player of the \n     modern era, Jackie Robinson, who shines alone in baseball \n     history as the symbol of pride against prejudice. But Doby \n     was there, too, blazing his own trail later that same year. \n     He was brought up by the Cleveland Indians on July 5, 1947, \n     three months after Robinson broke in with the Brooklyn \n     Dodgers. Some of the strange and awful things that happened \n     to No. 42 in the National League happened to No. 14 in the \n     American League as well.\n       ``I think I'm ahead of a lot of people because I don't hate \n     and I'm not bitter,'' Doby says softly now. He has spent a \n     lifetime ``turning negatives into positives,'' but he is also \n     sharp and direct in pointing out what he considers to be \n     myths surrounding the events of a half-century ago.\n       Jackie Robinson in death has gone the way of most American \n     martyrs, transformed from an outsider struggling against the \n     prevailing culture into a legend embraced by it. In the \n     retelling of his legend it sometimes sounds as though most \n     people always loved him. Doby knows better. He was there and \n     he remembers. After that first season, he and Robinson \n     barnstormed the country with Negro leagues all-stars. They \n     rarely discussed their common experience in white baseball \n     (``no need to, we both knew what the situation was''), but a \n     few times late at night they stayed up naming the players in \n     each league who were giving them problems because they were \n     black.\n       It was a long list.\n       ``Many people in this world live on lies. Know what amazes \n     me today?'' Doby asks, his deep voice rising with the first \n     rush of emotion. ``How many friends Jackie Robinson had 50 \n     years ago! All of a sudden everyone is his best friend. Wait \n     a minute. Give me a break, will you. I knew those people who \n     were his friends. I knew those people who were not his \n     friends. Some of them are still alive. I know. And Jack, he's \n     in heaven, and I bet he turns over a lot of times when he \n     hears certain things or sees certain things or reads certain \n     things where these people say they were his friends.''\n       Playing and traveling in the big leagues that year was a \n     grindingly lonely job for the two young black men. Which \n     leads to Doby's second shattered myth: the notion that \n     Robinson, by coming first, could somehow smooth the way for \n     him.\n       ``Did Jackie Robinson make it easier for me?'' Doby laughs \n     at his own question, which he says is the one he hears most \n     often. ``I'm not saying people are stupid, but it's one of \n     the stupidest questions that's ever been asked. Think about \n     it. We're talking about 11 weeks. Nineteen forty-seven. Now \n     it's 50 years later and you still have hidden racism, \n     educated racist people. How could you change that in 11 \n     weeks? Jackie probably would have loved to have changed it in \n     11 weeks. I know he would have loved to have been able to \n     say, `the hotels are open, the restaurants are open, your \n     teammates are going to welcome you.' But no. No. No way. \n     No way.''\n\n\n                              The Embrace\n\n       There was no transition for Larry Doby, no year of grooming \n     in the minors up in Montreal like Robinson had. One day he \n     was playing second base for the Newark Eagles of the Negro \n     leagues, and two days later he was in Chicago, pinch-hitting \n     for the Cleveland Indians in the seventh inning of a game \n     against the White Sox. ``We're in this together, kid,'' Bill \n     Veeck, the Indians' owner, had told him at the signing, and \n     that was enough for Doby. He trusted Veeck, then and always.\n       Doby was only 22 years old, and his life to that point had \n     been relatively free of the uglier strains of American \n     racism. At East Side High in Paterson, N.J., he had been a \n     four-sport star on integrated teams. He remembers being \n     subjected to a racist insult only once, during a football \n     game, and he responded by whirling past the foul-mouthed \n     defensive back to haul in a touchdown pass. That shut the guy \n     up. In the Navy on the South Pacific atoll of Ulithi during \n     World War II, he had taken batting practice with Mickey \n     Vernon of the Washington Senators and found him to be \n     extremely friendly and encouraging. Vernon later sent him a \n     dozen Louisville Slugger bats and put in a good word for him \n     with the Washington club.\n       Wishful thinking. It would be another decade before the \n     Senators broke their lily-white policy, but Veeck, who had \n     both an innate empathy for life's underdogs and a showman's \n     readiness to try anything new, was eager to integrate his \n     Indians as soon as possible. Doby was not the best black \n     player (that honor still belonged to old Josh Gibson), but he \n     was young and talented. Through the Fourth of July with the \n     Newark club in 1947, he was batting .414 with a league-\n     leading 14 homers.\n       His Newark teammates gave him a farewell present, a kit \n     with comb, brush and shaving cream, but there was no \n     celebration when he took off to join the Indians. ``We looked \n     at it as an important step as far as history was concerned, \n     but it was not the type of thing you would celebrate in terms \n     of justice for all, because you were going to a segregated \n     situation,'' Doby says. ``Maybe someone smarter than me would \n     be happy about that, but I wasn't. You know you're going into \n     a situation where it's not going to be comfortable. That's \n     what you're leaving. What you're leaving is comfortable \n     because you are with your teammates all the time, you sleep \n     in the same hotel, you eat in the same restaurants, you ride \n     in the same car.''\n       When Doby was introduced to the Cleveland players that \n     afternoon of July 5 a half-century ago, most of them stood \n     mute and expressionless, essentially ignoring his existence. \n     There were a few exceptions. Second baseman Joe Gordon told \n     him to grab his glove and warmed up with him before the game, \n     a practice they continued throughout the year. Catcher Jim \n     Hegan showed he cared by asking him how he was doing. And one \n     of the coaches, Bill McKechnie, looked after him. ``He was \n     like Veeck, but there every day on the road--nice man,'' Doby \n     recalls.\n       But there was no roommate for him on the road, no one in \n     whom he could confide. In every city except New York and \n     Boston, he stayed in a black hotel apart from the rest of the \n     team. Equally troubling for him, he rarely got the chance to \n     play. After starting one game at first base, he looked at the \n     lineup card the next day and was not there. Same thing the \n     rest of the year. The manager, Lou Boudreau, never said a \n     word to him about why he was on the bench. He was used as a \n     pinch hitter, and could not adjust to the role. He finished \n     the year with only five hits and no home runs in 32 at-bats \n     over 29 games.\n       After the last game of the season, he was sitting at his \n     locker, wondering if that was the end of the experiment, when \n     McKechnie came over to him and asked whether he had ever \n     played the outfield. No, Doby said, always infield, in high \n     school, college at Long Island University for a year, Negro \n     leagues, the streets, wherever. ``Well,'' Doby recall \n     McKechnie telling him, ``Joe Gordon is the second baseman and \n     he's going to be here a while. When you go home this winter \n     get a book and learn how to play the outfield.''\n       He bought a book by Tommy Henrich, the Yankees outfielder, \n     and studied the finer points of playing outfield: what to do \n     on liners hit straight at you (take your first step back, \n     never forward), throwing to the right bases, hitting the \n     cutoff man. He started the next season in right, and within a \n     few weeks was over in center, where he developed into\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\n     an offensive and defensive star, a key figure on the fearsome \n     Indians teams from the late 1940s to mid-1950s. With Doby \n     driving in more than 100 runs four times and tracking down \n     everything in center, the Indians won the World Series \n     against the Boston Braves in 1948, and lost to the Giants \n     in 1954 after winning a league-record 111 games during the \n     regular season.\n       It was during the '48 season that Doby set several firsts. \n     After batting over .300 during the regular season, he became \n     the first African American to play on a championship club and \n     the first to hit a home run in the World Series. His blast \n     won the fourth game that fall against the Braves. In the \n     locker room celebration afterward, a wire service \n     photographer took a picture that was sent out across the \n     nation showing something that had never been seen before: a \n     white baseball player, pitcher Steve Gromek, hugging the \n     black player, Doby, who had won the game for him.\n       Doby says he will never forget that embrace. ``That made me \n     feel good because it was not a thing of, should I or should I \n     not, not a thing of black or white. It was a thing where \n     human beings were showing emotion. When you have that kind of \n     thing it makes you feel better, makes you feel like, with all \n     those obstacles and negatives you went through, there is \n     someone who had feelings inside for you as a person and not \n     based on color.''\n       It was a rare situation that went easier for the black \n     person than his white friend. Gromek received hate mail and \n     questions from his neighbors when he went home. What are you \n     doing hugging a black man like that? Hey, was his response, \n     Doby won the game for me!\n       But the world did not embrace Doby as warmly as Gromek had. \n     In St. Louis one day, McKechnie restrained him from climbing \n     into the stands to go after a heckler who had been shouting \n     racist epithets at him the whole game. His anger erupted one \n     other time in 1948, when he slid into second base and an \n     opposing infielder spit in his face. ``I didn't expect to be \n     spit on if I'm sliding into second base, but it happened. I \n     just thank God there was an umpire there named Bill Summers, \n     a nice man, who kind of walked in between us when I was ready \n     to move on this fella. Maybe I wouldn't be sitting here \n     talking if that hadn't happened. They wanted to find anyway \n     they could go get you out of the league.''\n       Al Smith, a left fielder who joined the Indians in 1953 and \n     became Doby's roommate and close friend, said there was one \n     other way opposing teams would go after black players.\n       Whenever Al Rosen or some other Indian hit a home run, the \n     pitcher would wait until Doby came up, then throw at him. \n     ``They wouldn't knock the player who hit the home run down, \n     they'd knock Doby down.''\n       Common practice in those days, says Doby--he and Minnie \n     Minoso, a Cuban-born outfielder who was an all-star seven \n     years despite not becoming a regular in the major leagues \n     until age 28, and Roy Campanella, a three-time NL most \n     valuable player after playing for the Baltimore Elite Giants \n     of the Negro leagues, were hit by pitches 10 times more often \n     than Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Joe DiMaggio.\n       ``You don't think people would do it simply because of \n     race,'' Doby says. ``But what was it? Did they knock us down \n     because we were good hitters? How you gonna explain DiMaggio, \n     Williams and Musial? Were they good hitters? So you see, you \n     can't be naive about this kind of situation.''\n       But there was one setting where Doby and the other blacks \n     on the Indians' team felt completely protected--when teammate \n     Early Wynn was on the mound. ``Whenever Early pitched we \n     didn't have any problems getting knocked down. Early, he \n     would start at the top of the opposing lineup and go right \n     down to the bottom. They threw at me, he'd throw at them.''\n       The segregation of that era offered one ironically \n     comforting side effect to Doby. Black fans in the late 1940s \n     were directed out to the cheap seats, the bleachers in left \n     and center and right. They were a long way from the action, \n     but very close to Doby. ``When people say, `You played well \n     in Washington,' well, I had a motivation factor there. I had \n     cheerleaders there at Griffith Stadium. I didn't have to \n     worry about name-calling. You got cheers from those people \n     when you walked out onto the field. They'd let you know they \n     appreciated you were there. Give you a little clap when you \n     go out there, and if you hit a home run, they'd acknowledge \n     the fact, tip their hat.''\n\n\n                           Back to Cleveland\n\n       At the All-Star Game at Jacobs Field in Cleveland on \n     Tuesday, all of baseball will finally tip its hat to Lawrence \n     Eugene Doby. Finally, he will emerge from the enormous shadow \n     of the man he followed and revered, Jackie Robinson. The \n     American League, for which he works as an executive in New \n     York, has named him honorary captain of its team, and he has \n     been selected to throw out the first pitch. The prospect of \n     standing on the field in front of a sellout crowd to be \n     honored has led Doby to think about what has changed since he \n     broke in with the Indians 50 years ago.\n       ``A lot of people are complaining that baseball hasn't come \n     along fast enough. And there is much more work to be done,'' \n     Doby says. ``But if you look at baseball, we came in 1947, \n     before Brown versus the Board of Education [the 1954 Supreme \n     Court decision integrating public schools], before anyone \n     wrote a civil rights bill saying give them the same \n     opportunities everyone else has. So whatever you want to \n     criticize baseball about--it certainly needs more \n     opportunities for black managers, black general managers, \n     black umpires--remember that if this country was as far \n     advanced as baseball it would be in much better shape.''\n       Doby rises from his chair and walks around his den, taking \n     another look at history. Here is a picture of him at the \n     first of seven straight all-star games to which he was \n     selected. He is posed on the dugout steps with three other \n     black players. ``There's Camp and Newk [pitcher Don Newcombe] \n     and Jackie,'' he says. ``I'm the only American Leaguer, \n     fighting those Dodgers.''\n       Nearby is the picture of ``Doby's Great Catch,'' taken in \n     Cleveland in a game against Washington on July 20, 1954. \n     ``What a catch,'' he says softly, sounding modest even in \n     praise, as though it was someone else who climbed that fence \n     to make the play.\n       And in the corner is a picture of the football team at \n     Paterson's East Side High back in the early 1940s. One black \n     player in the crowd--the split end. ``I was always the one \n     guy,'' he says, looking at the image of his younger self. \n     Sometimes he was overshadowed or all but forgotten, and in \n     the history books it says he came second, but Larry Doby is \n     right. He always was the one guy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7315-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7316-S7317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF JEAN SKONHOVD, STEPHANIE BROCKHOUSE, LEANN PRUSA AND TOM \n         BERG'S ASSISTANCE DURING THE NATURAL DISASTERS OF 1997\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \ntoday to recognize the important work of Sioux Valley Hospital nurses, \nJean Skonhovd, Stephanie Brockhouse, Leann Prusa, and Tom Berg, in \nongoing disaster recovery efforts in South Dakota.\n  Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South \nDakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold \ntemperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane \ncleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead \nlivestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As \nif surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents \nof the upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother \nNature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. Record levels on the \nBig Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of \nWatertown, SD to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the \ncity without sewer and water for three weeks. The city of Bruce, SD was \ncompletely underwater when record low temperatures turned swollen \nstreams into sheets of ice.\n  The 50,000 residents of Grand Forks, ND, and 10,000 residents of East \nGrand Forks, MN, were forced to leave their homes and businesses as the \nRed River overwhelmed their cities in April. The devastation was \nastounding; an entire city underwater and a fire that gutted a majority \nof Grand Forks' downtown. Residents of both cities recently were \nallowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and \ndifficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning.\n  In the midst of this crisis, Jean Skonhovd, Stephanie Brockhouse, \nLeann Prusa, and Tom Berg scrambled to travel to Grand Forks and help \nthe victims of the disaster. Not thinking of themselves, these nurses \nfrom Sioux Valley Hospital rearranged their personal lives to volunteer \ntheir expertise to assist others. Their skill and professionalism shone \nthrough as they admirably performed their jobs in chaotic \ncircumstances. Their ability to perform emergency services in these \ntrying times deserves our respect and admiration.\n  While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction \nwrought by this year's snowstorms and floods, I have been heartened to \nwitness first-hand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together \nwithin their community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from \nvicious winter weather and rising flood waters. The selfless actions of \nthese nurses from Sioux Valley Hospital illustrate the resolve within \nSouth Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble.\n  Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair \nour impacted communities. Jean Skonhovd, Stephanie Brockhouse, Leann \nPrusa, and Tom Berg of Sioux Valley Hospital illustrate how the actions \nof a community can bring some relief to the victims of this natural \ndisaster, and I ask\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\nyou to join me in thanking them for their selfless efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7316-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THANK YOU FOR STAFF WORK ON DISASTER RELIEF BILL\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, now that the disaster relief money \nis flowing to disaster victims, I would just like to take a moment to \nthank some special people for their hard work in passing the disaster \nrelief law several weeks ago.\n  First, I would like to thank my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate \nfor their help in passing the disaster relief legislation, which is \nalready helping people back in my home State of North Dakota. I know it \nwas a grueling process and a difficult time for many of you, but I want \nyou all to know that your efforts have already proven to be worth it. \nOn behalf of the people of North Dakota, I want to thank you for your \nhelp.\n  Legislation like the disaster relief bill is only possible when there \nis a bipartisan effort, not only among senators but among their staffs \nas well. You know, I often wonder if the people who watch us on C-SPAN \nor who read about the Senate in the newspaper fully understand just how \nimportant our staffs are to the work we do here. So, while our staffs \noften work out of the spotlight, I'd like to put the spotlight on some \ntruly special individuals whose work on the disaster relief bill \nrepresents public service at its finest.\n  First, I'd like to thank Steve Cortese, the majority staff director \nfor the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Jim English, the \nCommittee's minority staff director. Like most things, good legislation \ndoesn't just happen--it takes hard work to write the language, \nnegotiate painstaking compromises, and make the literally hundreds of \ndifficult decisions legislation like the disaster bill requires. I'm \ngrateful that when the people of the upper Midwest needed the help, \nthese positions of great responsibility were held by such gifted and \nthoughtful public servants as Steve Cortese and Jim English.\n  I would also like to thank Mary Hawkins, who led my office's effort \non the bill. Her vast experience in Congress was constantly on display \nthroughout the effort to pass this legislation. A legislative expert \nand a good negotiator, Mary's contribution was inestimable.\n  Finally, I would also like to thank Doug Norell, my legislative \ndirector, who brought a combination of knowledge of Congress and \nknowledge of North Dakota to the table in this process, in addition to \na dedication to do the right thing for our State and a willingness to \nwork as hard as it took to get it done.\n  Dedicated men and women on both sides of the aisle helped make this \nbadly needed disaster relief legislation a reality, and North Dakota is \nvery grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7317-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ST.

Mr, President, the city of St. Albans, VT, this \nyear celebrates its centennial, and thousands of citizens turned out on \nJuly 5 to mark the occasion in a festive and flawless celebration \nblessed by Vermont's glorious July weather.\n  There was a grand parade organized by the St. Albans Rotary Club. \nThere was music. There were recollections and mementos of the city's \nrich history. And there was a community photograph.\n  In an article about the centennial published in the Burlington Free \nPress, reporter Richard Cowperthwait captured the festivities and the \nsense of history that all Vermonters share. Included in the article is \nthis apt observation from St. Albans Mayor Peter DesLauriers: ``We've \ngone through the life and death of our railroad; we've gone through \nfires; we've gone through all of these things and today--right now--I \nthink we're literally on the top of the heap here.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, July 6, 1997]\n\n                    St. Albans Celebrates 100 years\n\n                       (By Richard Cowparthwalt)\n\n       St. Albans.--The Main Street banner said it all Saturday; \n     ``Celebrate St. Albans.''\n       That is just what thousands did on a resplendent day that \n     marked the city's centennial. Activities ranged from an hour-\n     long parade, ethnic festival and community photograph to \n     fireworks at nearby St. Albans Bay.\n       ``I don't know how they could ever top this,'' St. Albans \n     resident Madonna Vernal said. ``It's a beautiful place.''\n       During the past century, the city has seen its ups and \n     downs. It has evolved from a booming railroad hub to a \n     depressed area with double-digit unemployment to a once-\n     again-lively county seat with a rising economy.\n       ``It's a very proud day for the City of Albans,'' Police \n     Chief David Demag said. ``This event was very impressive. It \n     was very much hometown USA.''\n       City officials, residents and visitors from as far away as \n     Belgium pointed to the success of the day and the beauty of \n     downtown Taylor Park. It is situated in the midst of the St. \n     Albans Historic District, between turn-of-the century brick \n     buildings on Main Street and the imposing churches, Franklin \n     Superior Courthouse and St. Albans Historical Society museum \n     building on Church Street.\n       ``I'm impressed by the buildings'' as well as by the \n     friendliness of the people, said Myriam Van Dooren, a Belgian \n     who is visiting friends in Fairfield.\n       Mayor Peter DesLauriers said the city's centennial \n     homecoming celebration came off without a hitch on a day that \n     had abundant sunshine and temperatures in the 70s. The \n     pleasant conditions contrasted sharply with Friday's \n     unsettled weather that did not stop a crowd estimated at more \n     than 500 from turning out on Taylor Park for seven hours of \n     musical entertainment.\n       DesLauriers said the city of about 7,600 has persevered \n     through trying times since its first mayor and aldermen were \n     elected March 2, 1997--109 years after the town of St. Albans \n     was organized.\n       ``We've gone through the life and death of our railroad; \n     we've gone through fires; we've gone through all of these \n     things and today--right now--I think we're literally on the \n     top of the heap here, ``DesLauriers said.\n       ``The morning parade, which was organized by the St. Albans \n     Rotary Club, was the signature event of the centennial. There \n     were about 30 floats with St. Albans' history on display. \n     They ranged from legendary local musician Sterling Weed \n     driving a horse-drawn wagon to a depiction of the Oct 19, \n     1864, Civil War raid that put St. Albans on the map.\n       Following the parade, a crowd gathered near the \n     intersection of Main and Bank streets for a community \n     photograph by local photographer Leonard Parent.\n       ``I wish we could do this more often, not just once every \n     100 years,'' City Council member James Pelkey said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7317-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will debate the DOD \nappropriations bill. I urge all Senators who have amendments to be \npresent on Monday to offer their amendments. I know the distinguished \nPresiding Officer is very anxious to get this legislation up and the \namendments will be considered and disposed of so we can complete action \non this bill as early as possible on Tuesday.\n  Under a previous order, at 6 p.m., the Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to conduct a cloture vote on the nomination of Joel \nKlein, to be an Assistant Attorney General. Therefore, the next \nrollcall vote will occur at 6 p.m. on Monday, July 14.\n  Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of \namendments to the DOD appropriations bill. Senators should be aware \nthat next week, the Senate hopes to complete action on four major \nappropriations bills. That would be perhaps a record if we could \ncomplete four, but I think we can do that. If we can get through the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill at a reasonable hour on \nTuesday, we hope to go to energy and water appropriations, and we are \nhopeful we can maybe take up foreign operations and legislative. In \nsome order, we will work on those bills next week.\n  We will expect to be in session and have votes throughout the day and \nperhaps into the night next week, because we are committed to \ncompleting all the appropriations bills, if at all possible, before the \nend of the fiscal year. I have a commitment from the Democratic leader \nto work with us in that effort, and we have the support of the \nadministration to complete action on these appropriations bills. There \nis no need for these bills to be amended endlessly. There is no need \nfor us to delay action on them. We already reached agreement on the \noverall number, and I know that the committee chairman, Mr. Stevens, \nfrom Alaska, is going to be very diligent in his work. These are going \nto be good bills when they come out of the committee, and there is no \nneed for 100 amendments per bill. I ask my colleagues for their \ncooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/11/senate-section/article/S7319-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 14, 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

ASSESSMENT OF CYCLICAL READINESS POSTURE OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--(1) Not later than 120 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and \n     the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives a report on the readiness posture of the \n     Armed Forces described in subsection (b).\n       (2) The Secretary shall prepare the report required under \n     paragraph (1) with the assistance of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff. In providing such assistance, the Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff shall consult with the Chief of the \n     National Guard Bureau.\n       (b) Readiness Posture.--(1) The readiness posture to be \n     covered by the report under subsection (a) is a readiness \n     posture for units of the Armed Forces, or for designated \n     units of the Armed Forces, that provides for a rotation of \n     such units between a state of high readiness and a state of \n     low readiness.\n       (2) As part of the evaluation of the readiness posture \n     described in paragraph (1), the report shall address in \n     particular a readiness posture that--\n       (A) establishes within the Armed Forces two equivalent \n     forces each structured so as to be capable of fighting and \n     winning a major theater war; and\n       (B) provides for an alternating rotation of such forces \n     between a state of high readiness and a state of low \n     readiness.\n       (3) The evaluation of the readiness posture described in \n     paragraph (2) shall be based upon assumptions permitting \n     comparison with the existing force structure as follows:\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\n       (A) That there are assembled from among the units of the \n     Armed Forces two equivalent forces each structured so as to \n     be capable of fighting and winning a major theater war.\n       (B) That each force referred to in subparagraph (A) \n     includes--\n       (i) four active Army divisions, including one mechanized \n     division, one armored division, one light infantry division, \n     and one division combining airborne units and air assault \n     units, and appropriate support and service support units for \n     such divisions;\n       (ii) six divisions (or division equivalents) of the Army \n     National Guard or the Army Reserve that are essentially \n     equivalent in structure, and appropriate support and service \n     support units for such divisions;\n       (iii) six aircraft carrier battle groups;\n       (iv) six active Air Force fighter wings (or fighter wing \n     equivalents);\n       (v) four Air Force reserve fighter wings (or fighter wing \n     equivalents); and\n       (vi) one active Marine Corps expeditionary force.\n       (C) That each force may be supplemented by critical units \n     or units in short supply, including heavy bomber units, \n     strategic lift units, and aerial reconnaissance units, that \n     are not subject to the readiness rotation otherwise assumed \n     for purposes of the evaluation or are subject to the rotation \n     on a modified basis.\n       (D) That units of the Armed Forces not assigned to a force \n     are available for operations other than those essential to \n     fight and win a major theater war, including peace \n     operations.\n       (E) That the state of readiness of each force alternates \n     between a state of high readiness and a state of low \n     readiness on a frequency determined by the Secretary (but not \n     more often than once every 6 months) and with only one force \n     at a given state of readiness at any one time.\n       (F) That, during the period of state of high readiness of a \n     force, any operations or activities (including leave and \n     education and training of personnel) that detract from the \n     near-term wartime readiness of the force are temporary and \n     their effects on such state of readiness minimized.\n       (G) That units are assigned overseas during the period of \n     state of high readiness of the force to which the units are \n     assigned primarily on a temporary duty basis.\n       (H) That, during the period of high readiness of a force, \n     the operational war plans for the force incorporate the \n     divisions (or division equivalents) of the Army Reserve or \n     Army National Guard assigned to the force in a manner such \n     that one such division (or division equivalent) is, on a \n     rotating basis for such divisions (or division equivalents) \n     during the period, maintained in a high state of readiness \n     and dedicated as the first reserve combat division to be \n     transferred overseas in the event of a major theater war.\n       (c) Report Elements.--The report under this section shall \n     include the following elements for the readiness posture \n     described in subsection (b)(2):\n       (1) An estimate of the range of cost savings achievable \n     over the long term as a result of implementing the readiness \n     posture, including--\n       (A) the savings achievable from reduced training levels and \n     readiness levels during periods in which a force referred to \n     in subsection (b)(3)(A) is in a state of low readiness; and\n       (B) the savings achievable from reductions in costs of \n     infrastructure overseas as a result of reduced permanent \n     change of station rotations.\n       (2) An assessment of the potential risks associated with a \n     lower readiness status for units assigned to a force in a \n     state of low readiness under the readiness posture, including \n     the risks associated with the delayed availability of such \n     units overseas in the event of two nearly simultaneous major \n     theater wars.\n       (3) An assessment of the potential risks associated with \n     requiring the forces under the readiness posture to fight a \n     major war in any theater worldwide.\n       (4) An assessment of the modifications of the current force \n     structure of the Armed Forces that are necessary to achieve \n     the range of cost savings estimated under paragraph (1), \n     including the extent of the diminishment, if any, of the \n     military capabilities of the Armed Forces as a result of the \n     modifications.\n       (5) An assessment whether or not the risks of diminished \n     military capability associated with implementation of the \n     readiness posture exceed the risks of diminished military \n     capability associated with the modifications of the current \n     force structure necessary to achieve cost savings equivalent \n     to the best case for cost savings resulting from the \n     implementation of the readiness posture.\n       (d) Form of Report.--The report under this section shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified \n     annex.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``state of high readiness'', in the case of a \n     military force, means the capability to mobilize first-to-\n     arrive units of the force within 18 hours and last-to-arrive \n     units within 120 days of a particular event.\n       (2) The term ``state of low readiness'', in the case of a \n     military force, means the capability to mobilize first-to-\n     arrive units within 90 days and last-to-arrive units within \n     180 days of a particular event.\n\n     SEC. 1036.

REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FAMILY \n                   NOTIFICATION AND ASSISTANCE PROCEDURES IN CASES \n                   OF MILITARY AVIATION ACCIDENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a need for the Department of Defense to \n     improve significantly the family notification procedures of \n     the department that are applicable in cases of Armed Forces \n     personnel casualties and Department of Defense civilian \n     personnel casualties resulting from military aviation \n     accidents.\n       (2) This need was demonstrated in the aftermath of the \n     tragic crash of a C-130 aircraft off the coast of Northern \n     California that killed 10 Reserves from Oregon on November \n     22, 1996.\n       (3) The experience of the members of the families of those \n     Reserves has left the family members with a general \n     perception that the existing Department of Defense procedures \n     for notifications regarding casualties and related matters \n     did not meet the concerns and needs of the families.\n       (4) It is imperative that Department of Defense \n     representatives involved in family notifications regarding \n     casualties have the qualifications and experience to provide \n     meaningful information on accident investigations and \n     effective grief counseling.\n       (5) Military families deserve the best possible care, \n     attention, and information, especially at a time of tragic \n     personal loss.\n       (6) Although the Department of Defense provides much needed \n     logistical support, including transportation and care of \n     remains, survivor counseling, and other benefits in cases of \n     tragedies like the crash of the C-130 aircraft on November \n     22, 1996, the support may be insufficient to meet the \n     immediate emotional and personal needs of family members \n     affected by such tragedies.\n       (7) It is important that the flow of information to \n     surviving family members be accurate and timely, and be \n     provided to family members in advance of media reports, and, \n     therefore, that the Department of Defense give a high \n     priority, to the extent practicable, to providing the family \n     members with all relevant information on an accident as soon \n     as it becomes available, consistent with the national \n     security interests of the United States, and to allowing the \n     family members full access to any public hearings or public \n     meetings about the accident.\n       (8) Improved procedures for civilian family notification \n     that have been adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration \n     and National Transportation Safety Board might serve as a \n     useful model for reforms to Department of Defense procedures.\n       (b) Reports by Secretary of Defense.--(1) Not later than \n     December 1, 1997, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the advisability of establishing a \n     process for conducting a single, public investigation of each \n     Department of Defense aviation accident that is similar to \n     the accident investigation process of the National \n     Transportation Safety Board. The report shall include--\n       (A) a discussion of whether adoption of the accident \n     investigation process of the National Transportation Safety \n     Board by the Department of Defense would result in benefits \n     that include the satisfaction of needs of members of families \n     of victims of the accident, increased aviation safety, and \n     improved maintenance of aircraft;\n       (B) a determination of whether the Department of Defense \n     should adopt that accident investigation process; and\n       (C) any justification for the current practice of the \n     Department of Defense of conducting separate accident and \n     safety investigations.\n       (2) Not later than April 2, 1998, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on assistance provided by \n     the Department of Defense to families of casualties among \n     Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the department. The \n     report shall include--\n       (A) a discussion of the adequacy and effectiveness of the \n     family notification procedures of the Department of Defense, \n     including the procedures of the military departments; and\n       (B) a description of the assistance provided to members of \n     the families of such personnel.\n       (c) Report by Department of Defense Inspector General.--(1) \n     Not later than December 1, 1997, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Defense shall review the procedures of the \n     Federal Aviation Administration and the National \n     Transportation Safety Board for providing information and \n     assistance to members of families of casualties of \n     nonmilitary aviation accidents, and submit a report on the \n     review to Congress. The report shall include a discussion of \n     the following matters:\n       (A) Designation of an experienced non-profit organization \n     to provide assistance for satisfying needs of families of \n     accident victims.\n       (B) An assessment of the system and procedures for \n     providing families with information on accidents and accident \n     investigations.\n       (C) Protection of members of families from unwanted \n     solicitations relating to the accident.\n       (D) A recommendation regarding whether the procedures or \n     similar procedures should be adopted by the Department of \n     Defense, and if the recommendation is not to adopt the \n     procedures, a detailed justification for the recommendation.\n       (d) Unclassified Form of Reports.--The reports under \n     subsections (b) and (c) shall be submitted in unclassified \n     form.\n\n     SEC. 1045.

ASSESSMENT OF THE CUBAN THREAT TO UNITED STATES \n                   NATIONAL SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has been an avowed enemy of Cuba for \n     over 35 years, and Fidel Castro has made hostility towards \n     the United States a principal tenet of his domestic and \n     foreign policy.\n       (2) The ability of the United States as a sovereign nation \n     to respond to any Cuban provocation is directly related to \n     the ability of the United States to defend the people and \n     territory of the United States against any Cuban attack.\n       (3) In 1994, the Government of Cuba callously encouraged a \n     massive exodus of Cubans, by boat and raft, toward the United \n     States.\n       (4) Countless numbers of those Cubans lost their lives on \n     the high seas as a result of those actions of the Government \n     of Cuba.\n       (5) The humanitarian response of the United States to \n     rescue, shelter, and provide emergency care to those Cubans, \n     together with the actions taken to absorb some 30,000 of \n     those Cubans into the United States, required immeasurable \n     efforts and expenditures of hundreds of millions of dollars \n     for the costs incurred by the United States and State and \n     local governments in connection with those efforts.\n       (6) On February 24, 1996, Cuban MiG aircraft attacked and \n     destroyed, in international airspace, two unarmed civilian \n     aircraft flying from the United States, and the four persons \n     in those unarmed civilian aircraft were killed.\n       (7) Since the attack, the Cuban government has issued no \n     apology for the attack, nor has it indicated any intention to \n     conform its conduct to international law that is applicable \n     to civilian aircraft operating in international airspace.\n       (b) Review and Report.--Not later than March 30, 1998, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall carry out a comprehensive review \n     and assessment of Cuban military capabilities and the threats \n     to the national security of the United States that are posed \n     by Fidel Castro and the Government of Cuba and submit a \n     report on the review to the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the \n     House of Representatives. The report shall contain--\n       (1) a discussion of the results of the review, including an \n     assessment of the contingency plans; and\n       (2) the Secretary's assessment of the threats, including--\n       (A) such unconventional threats as--\n       (i) encouragement of migration crises; and\n       (ii) attacks on citizens and residents of the United States \n     while they are engaged in\n\n[[Page S7367]]\n\n     peaceful protest in international waters or airspace;\n       (B) the potential for development and delivery of chemical \n     or biological weapons; and\n       (C) the potential for internal strife in Cuba that could \n     involve citizens or residents of the United States or the \n     Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (c) Consultation on Review and Assessment.--In performing \n     the review and preparing the assessment, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall consult with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States \n     Southern Command, and the heads of other appropriate agencies \n     of the Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 1047.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A FOLLOW-ON FORCE \n                   FOR BOSNIA.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) United States military forces were deployed to Bosnia \n     as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     Implementation Forces (IFOR) to implement the military \n     aspects of the Dayton Agreement.\n       (2) The military aspects of the Dayton Agreement were being \n     successfully implemented.\n       (3) Following the recommendation of the Secretary General \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on December 11, \n     1996, to extend the presence of NATO forces in Bosnia until \n     June 1998 so that progress could be achieved in implementing \n     the civil aspects of the Dayton Agreement, the President \n     announced his decision to extend the presence of United \n     States forces in Bosnia to participate in the NATO \n     Stabilization Force (SFOR) until June 1998.\n       (4) The cost of United States participation in operations \n     in Bosnia from 1992 through June 1998 is estimated to exceed \n     $7,000,000,000.\n       (5) The President and the Secretary of Defense have stated \n     that United States forces are to be withdrawn from Bosnia by \n     June 1998.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States ground combat forces should not \n     participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     after June 1998;\n       (2) the European Security and Defense Identity, which, as \n     facilitated by the Combined Joint Task Forces concept, \n     enables the Western European Union, with the consent of the \n     North Atlantic Alliance, to assume political control and \n     strategic direction of NATO assets made available by the \n     Alliance, is an ideal instrument for a follow-on force for \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (3) if the European Security and Defense Identity is not \n     sufficiently developed or is otherwise deemed inappropriate \n     for such a mission, a NATO-led force without the \n     participation of United States ground combat forces in \n     Bosnia, may be suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina;\n       (4) the United States may decide to appropriately provide \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force, including command and control, intelligence, \n     logistics, and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in the \n     region;\n       (5) the President should inform our European NATO allies of \n     this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly \n     urge them to undertake preparations for a Western European \n     Union-led or NATO-led force as a follow-on force to the NATO-\n     led Stabilization Force if needed to maintain peace and \n     stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and\n       (6) the President should consult with the Congress with \n     respect to any support to be provided to a Western European \n     Union-led or NATO-led follow-on force in Bosnia after June \n     1998.\n\n     SEC. 1084. ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS REGARDING THE \n                   SAFETY, SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY OF UNITED \n                   STATES NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on \n     earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on \n     nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using \n     weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of \n     the nuclear stockpile are essential to ensure its credibility \n     as a deterrent.\n       (2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       (3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States \n     is prohibited by section 507 of the Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102-377; 42 \n     U.S.C. 2121 note) from conducting underground nuclear tests \n     ``unless a foreign state conducts a nuclear test after this \n     date, at which time the prohibition on United States nuclear \n     testing is lifted''.\n       (4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the Secretary of Energy to ``establish and \n     support a program to assure that the United States is in a \n     position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued \n     deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons \n     designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive \n     test ban on nuclear explosive testing is negotiated and \n     ratified.''.\n       (5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the President to submit an annual report to \n     Congress which sets forth ``any concerns with respect to the \n     safety, security, effectiveness, or reliability of existing \n     United States nuclear weapons raised by the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program of the Department of Energy''.\n       (6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that ``to \n     assure that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under \n     a test ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our \n     confidence in the safety, reliability, and the performance of \n     our weapons''. This decision was codified in a Presidential \n     Directive.\n       (7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1994 also requires that the Secretary of \n     Energy establish a ``stewardship program to ensure the \n     preservation of the core intellectual and technical \n     competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons''.\n       (8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the \n     safety and reliability of the United States nuclear stockpile \n     is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. \n     The ability of the United States to maintain warheads without \n     testing will require development of new and sophisticated \n     diagnostic technologies, methods, and procedures. Current \n     diagnostic technologies and\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\n     laboratory testing techniques are insufficient to certify the \n     future safety and reliability of the United States nuclear \n     stockpile. In the past these laboratory and diagnostic tools \n     were used in conjunction with nuclear testing.\n       (9) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed ``the \n     establishment of a new annual reporting and certification \n     requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe \n     and reliable under a comprehensive test ban''.\n       (10) On the same day, the President noted that the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the \n     responsibility, after being ``advised by the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, \n     and the Commander of United States Strategic Command'', to \n     provide the President with the information to make the \n     certification referred to in paragraph (9).\n       (11) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code, is responsible \n     for providing advice to the Secretary of Energy and Secretary \n     of Defense regarding nuclear weapons issues, including \n     ``considering safety, security, and control issues for \n     existing weapons''. The Council plays a critical role in \n     advising Congress in matters relating to nuclear weapons.\n       (12) It is essential that the President receive well-\n     informed, objective, and honest opinions from his advisors \n     and technical experts regarding the safety, security, and \n     reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.\n       (b) Policy.--\n       (1) In general.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (A) to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear \n     weapons stockpile; and\n       (B) as long as other nations covet or control nuclear \n     weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, to retain a \n     credible nuclear deterrent.\n       (2) Nuclear weapons stockpile.--It is in the security \n     interest of the United States to sustain the United States \n     nuclear weapons stockpile through programs relating to \n     stockpile stewardship, subcritical experiments, maintenance \n     of the weapons laboratories, and protection of the \n     infrastructure of the weapons complex.\n       (3) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) the United States should retain a triad of strategic \n     nuclear forces sufficient to deter any future hostile foreign \n     leadership with access to strategic nuclear forces from \n     acting against our vital interests;\n       (B) the United States should continue to maintain nuclear \n     forces of sufficient size and capability to hold at risk a \n     broad range of assets valued by such political and military \n     leaders; and\n       (C) the advice of the persons required to provide the \n     President and Congress with assurances of the safety, \n     security and reliability of the nuclear weapons force should \n     be scientifically based, without regard for politics, and of \n     the highest quality and integrity.\n       (c) Advice and Opinions Regarding Nuclear Weapons \n     Stockpile.--Any director of a nuclear weapons laboratory or \n     member of the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council, or the Commander \n     of United States Strategic Command, may submit to the \n     President or Congress advice or opinion in disagreement with, \n     or in addition to, the advice presented by the Secretary of \n     Energy or Secretary of Defense to the President, the National \n     Security Council, or Congress, as the case may be, regarding \n     the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile.\n       (d) Expression of Individual Views.--A representative of \n     the President may not take any action against, or otherwise \n     constrain, a director of a nuclear weapons laboratory, a \n     member of the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council, or the Commander \n     of United States Strategic Command for presenting individual \n     views to the President, the National Security Council, or \n     Congress regarding the safety, security, and reliability of \n     the nuclear weapons stockpile.\n       (e) Definitions.--\n       (1) Representative of the president.--The term \n     ``representative of the President'' means the following:\n       (A) Any official of the Department of Defense, the \n     Department of Energy who is appointed by the President and \n     confirmed by the Senate.\n       (B) Any member of the National Security Council.\n       (C) Any member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       (D) Any official of the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (2) Nuclear weapons laboratory.--The term ``nuclear weapons \n     laboratory'' means any of the following:\n       (A) Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (B) Livermore National Laboratory.\n       (C) Sandia National Laboratories.\n\n     SEC. 1085.

SENSE OF SENATE ON UTILIZATION OF SAVINGS DERIVED \n                   FROM BASE CLOSURE PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1988, the Department of Defense has conducted 4 \n     rounds of closures and realignments of military installations \n     in the United States, resulting in the closure of 97 \n     installations.\n       (2) The cost of carrying out the closure or realignment of \n     installations covered by such rounds is estimated by the \n     Secretary of Defense to be $23,000,000,000.\n       (3) The savings expected as a result of the closure or \n     realignment of such installations are estimated by the \n     Secretary to be $10,300,000,000 through fiscal year 1996 and \n     $36,600,000,000 through 2001.\n       (4) In addition to such savings, the Secretary has \n     estimated recurring savings as a result of the closure or \n     realignment of such installations of approximately \n     $5,600,000,000 annually.\n       (5) The fiscal year 1997 budget request for the Department \n     assumes a savings of between $2,000,000,000 and \n     $3,000,000,000 as a result of the closure or realignment of \n     such installations, which savings were to be dedicated to \n     modernization of the Armed Forces. The savings assumed in the \n     budget request were not realized.\n       (6) The fiscal year 1998 budget request for the Department \n     assumes a savings of $5,000,000,000 as a result of the \n     closure or realignment of such installations, which savings \n     are to be dedicated to modernization of the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Sense of Senate on Use of Savings Resulting from Base \n     Closure Process.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     savings identified in the report under section 2832 should be \n     made available to the Department of Defense solely for \n     purposes of modernization of new weapon systems (including \n     research, development, test, and evaluation relating to such \n     modernization) and should be used by the Department solely \n     for such purposes.\n DIVISION C--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL SECURITY AUTHORIZATIONS AND \n                          OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS\n      TITLE XXXI--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAMS\n         Subtitle A--National Security Programs Authorizations\n\n     SEC. 3101.
