Under the previous order, Senator Wellstone of \nMinnesota is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Idaho approached me \nand said he needed to take 5 minutes for an amendment that he wants to \nlay down. Is that correct?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague, Senator \nCraig, be allowed up to 5 minutes to offer his amendment and speak on \nhis amendment, after which I then would retain the floor and be able to \nspeak for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me first of all thank Senator Wellstone \nfor his courtesy.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2316\n\n (Purpose: To condition United States ratification of the protocols on \nspecific statutory authorization for the continued deployment of United \n   States Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the NATO \n                                mission)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk that I call \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho (Mr. Craig), for himself, and Mrs. \n     Hutchison, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, proposes an \n     executive amendment numbered 2316.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       (  ) Statutory authority for deployments in bosnia and \n     herzegovina.--Prior to the deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, there must be enacted a law \n     containing specific authorization for the continued \n     deployment of the United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina as part of the NATO mission in that country.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, again thanking my colleague, Senator \nWellstone, for his courtesy, I will be brief. It is a very direct and \nsimple amendment but I think a most powerful amendment. Let me read it.\n\n       Statutory Authorization for Deployments in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina--Prior to the deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, there must be enacted a law \n     containing specific authorization for the continued \n     deployment of the United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina as part of the NATO mission in that country.\n\n  That is the substance of the amendment. This amendment would require \nthat before the President can deposit the instruments of ratification, \nhe must receive authorization from this Congress for the mission in \nBosnia.\n  Last May, President Clinton publicly embraced the idea of a new NATO \nmission. It is my concern that the President's vision of a new NATO \nwill signal the end of NATO as a defense alliance and the beginning of \na new role as a regional peacekeeping organization. The President \ndeclared, ``We are building a new NATO. We will remain the strongest \nalliance in history, with smaller, more flexible forces prepared for \nour defense but also trained for peacekeeping. It will be an alliance \ndirected no longer against a hostile block of nations but instead \ndesigned to advance the security of every democracy in Europe--NATO's \nold members, now members and nonmembers alike.''\n\n  I cannot support the President's call for a new NATO to be a de facto \npeacekeeping organization worldwide.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton's peacekeeping operation in Bosnia \nhas been going on now for more than 2 years without authorization from \nCongress, with costs mounting far beyond any estimate, with the \nmission's end date repeatedly broken. The mission in Bosnia is now what \nwe were promised it would not be, an unauthorized, open-ended, nation-\nbuilding deployment with no withdrawal criteria.\n  As costs for NATO's mission in Bosnia continue to add up, the \nPresident seems eager to take on new peacekeeping operations. Make no \nmistake; the U.S. is paying the lion's share of the peacekeeping in \nBosnia. We all know these costs are high for the Defense Department. \nThe Defense Department is forced to come to Congress for supplemental \nfunds. We are now meeting in a conference of the Appropriations \nCommittee to deal with those very issues for the Defense Department.\n  In 1995, the President vowed that U.S. troop deployment in Bosnia \nshould and will take about 1 year and cost about $1 billion. Three \nyears and $8 billion later, the administration now admits we do not \npropose a fixed end date for the deployment.\n  Let me be clear. My amendment is not a war powers resolution. It does \nnot say the President cannot continue the deployment in Bosnia without \nauthorization, nor does it cut off funds\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\nfor Bosnia, nor does it set an end date for the mission, nor does it \nestablish a withdrawal criteria. It does, however, require the \nPresident to cooperate with Congress to set reasonable parameters for \nthat mission before the President gets a blank check in the form of a \nnew NATO for more of other area missions. The commitment of U.S. troops \nto Bosnia is a commitment of U.S. blood, and expansion of NATO is an \nexpansion of this commitment. The decision to place U.S. troops in \nharm's way is a commitment that none of us take lightly. We owe it to \nour troops to obtain authorization for peacekeeping missions. That is \nwhat my amendment sets forth.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield 1 minute, 60 \nseconds?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I would be \npleased to yield him 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. There is no need for that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield my colleague 1 minute after which I will \nretain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho and I are going to \nhave a chance to debate this issue later this afternoon. But I would \njust say to those who heard what he had to say in the introduction, \nconsider the following: This is a treaty. This is not a conference \nreport. This is not a piece of legislation. This is a treaty. And we \nshould not be effectively legislating on a treaty. This treaty is going \nto go back to every other nation to sign, and we are going to say, by \nthe way, there is a paragraph in here that says, ``The Senate \nauthorization committee,'' and they are going to think they are reading \nGreek. It has nothing to do with the treaty.\n  I do not in any way belittle his concern; it is worthy of debate, but \nit should not be on a treaty. I will make that point more forcefully \nwhen we get into the debate.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n30 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to NATO \nexpansion. NATO expansion has been described by the distinguished \nforeign policy expert, Professor Ronald Steel, ``as a bad idea whose \ntime has come.'' My fervent hope is that he's only half right in that \nit will turn out to be ``a bad idea whose time hasn't come.''\n  Why do I oppose the expansion of NATO? Two fundamental reasons. First \nbecause I've yet to hear a plausible case made for expanding NATO, \nwhich makes me think we are talking about a policy still in search of a \njustification. And second, because I believe it will sour our relations \nwith Russia, promote internal changes within Russia harmful to U.S. \ninterests, and may even imperil our own security and that of our \nallies.\n  Since the two basic reasons for my opposition tend to be intertwined, \nI'll deal with them together rather than separately.\n  Mr. President, I've yet to hear an explanation of why we should be \nexpanding the NATO miliary alliance toward Russia's borders when there \nis no Russian military threat. The Russian military has collapsed. If \nthere was any doubt about this, it should have been erased by the \nRussian army's inability to quell tiny, rag-tag Chechnyan forces. Even \nPolish sources have questioned Russia's capability to threaten its \nformer Eastern Bloc allies in the foreseeable future.\n  Moreover, arms control agreements signed between 1987 and 1993, \npushed through by Presidents Reagan and Bush working with President \nGorbachev, have helped to establish a new security structure that makes \na surprise attack in Central Europe virtually impossible. The security \nsituation in Central Europe is more stable than it has been at any time \nin this century. There is peace between states in Europe for the first \ntime in centuries.\n  Under these circumstances, why in heaven's name are we rushing to \nexpand a military alliance into Central Europe?\n  Secretary Albright has claimed that expanding NATO will produce an \n``undivided'' Europe. I believe the Secretary is mistaken. What it will \ndo is re-create a dividing line in Europe, only farther east than the \noriginal Cold War dividing line. President Clinton himself, before he \ndecided to back NATO expansion, said that it would ``draw a new line \nthrough Europe, just a little farther east.'' He was right then and I \nam right now.\n  Mr. President, since a Europe without dividing lines is vital if the \ncontinent is to be peaceful, prosperous and secure, why are we now \nconsidering a step that is sure to re-divide Europe?\n  What would a re-divided Europe mean? Well, for one thing, the U.S. is \ncommitted to bringing the Baltic states into NATO if expansion \nproceeds. In my view this could have devastating consequences for world \npeace. In this connection, I recently read an outstanding piece \nentitled ``NATO Expansion and the Baltic Iceberg'' by Michael \nMandelbaum, Professor of American Foreign Policy at the Paul H. Nitze \nSchool of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity and Director of the Project on East-West Relations of the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations. I have had the good fortune to meet with \nProfessor Mandelbaum and I found him to be a perceptive critic of NATO \nexpansion who views the issue through the lens of history. He \nsuccinctly describes the dilemma that would be created by the \ncommitment to expanding NATO to the Baltic states.\n  Professor Mandelbaum outlines three options:\n\n       . . . the American government might try to expand NATO to \n     the Baltic countries but fail because of Western European \n     objections. . . . If on the other hand Washington did somehow \n     prevail on the Western Europeans to admit the Balts, or \n     failing that, offered them a unilateral alliance like the \n     Japanese-American Security Treaty, the United States would be \n     obliged to provide for their defense. This option surely \n     require re-creating in some form the military deployments of \n     the Cold War. American troops and American nuclear weapons \n     would have to be stationed within the borders of the three \n     countries. . . . Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia might well \n     turn out to be defensible only with nuclear weapons, as West \n     Berlin was during the Cold War, in which case NATO expansion \n     would return the world to the hair trigger nuclear standoff \n     of the 1950's and 1960's.\n       Because of the determined opposition to Baltic membership \n     the Western Europeans will mount, and the huge risks \n     including the Balts will entail, the likeliest option for the \n     United States is the third: Having agreed to defend three \n     countries in Central Europe that are not remotely threatened, \n     the United States will renege on its commitment to defend the \n     Balts precisely because they might be threatened. This option \n     would enshrine in the foreign policy of the United States the \n     principle that American security guarantees are available \n     only to those who don't need them . . . It would break a \n     promise the Balts have received from the United States. . . .\n       The damage to American interests that each of the three \n     options would inflict would be infinitely greater than \n     whatever modest embarrassment rejecting the NATO expansion \n     that is now before the Senate would cause. And rejecting the \n     plan is the only sure way to avoid the damage. Rejection, \n     that is, is the only way to steer the American ship of state \n     clear of the large menacing iceberg toward which the Clinton \n     administration is now guiding it.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of Professor \nMandelbaum's article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 NATO Expansion and the Baltic Iceberg\n\n                        (By Michael Mandelbaum)\n\n       NATO expansion is the Titanic of American foreign policy, \n     and the iceberg on which it is doomed to founder is Baltic \n     membership in the Atlantic Alliance.\n       The problem of NATO membership for Lithuania, Latvia, and \n     Estonia is one that, if the proposal to admit Poland, \n     Hungary, and the Czech Republic is ratified by the Senate, \n     the United States will be able neither to avoid nor to solve. \n     The only way to steer clear of this geopolitical iceberg is \n     to reject the plan for expansion that the Clinton \n     administration has placed before the Senate.\n       If expansion proceeds, the United States is committed to \n     bringing the Balts into the Alliance. That commitment has \n     been expressed in many places and in many forms: at the \n     Madrid Summit last summer at which formal invitations to join \n     NATO were issued to the three Central European countries; in \n     the Baltic-American Charter signed by President Clinton in \n     January; in the resolution of ratification the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee has reported; in numerous statements by \n     American officials, such as Madeleine Albright's assertion \n     that no European democracy will be denied admission to NATO \n     ``because of where it sits on the map''; and by assurances \n     given to officials of the Baltic\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\n     countries and representatives of Baltic-American groups.\n       Moreover, if Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are, \n     as the Clinton administration says, ``entitled'' to NATO \n     membership, then so, too, are the Balts. Lithuania, Latvia, \n     and Estonia are just as democratic, just as pro-Western, just \n     as much in need of the stability that NATO membership \n     allegedly confers, and suffered just as much under Communism \n     as the three Central European countries whose candidacies the \n     administration has chosen to favor. Thus, even if there were \n     no commitment to the Balts, logic and justice would prohibit \n     excluding them while including the Poles, Hungarians, and \n     Czechs. But there is a commitment, which ratifying membership \n     for the Central European countries would trigger.\n       All politically relevant Russians, however, including Boris \n     Yeltsin, have said, repeatedly and emphatically, that Baltic \n     membership in NATO, which would bring the Western military \n     alliance, from which they are excluded, to their borders, is \n     entirely unacceptable to them. The Russians have said that \n     Baltic membership would cast into doubt all existing \n     agreements between Russia and the West, including the \n     historic treaties reducing nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. \n     They have made it clear that they would regard Baltic \n     membership NATO as a provocation, to which they would \n     respond.\n       The admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to \n     the Atlantic Alliance would therefore confront the United \n     States with three--and only three--options, all of them bad.\n       First, the American government might try to expand NATO to \n     the Baltic countries but fail because of Western European \n     objections. Such objections are all but certain on the part \n     of countries that have already made it clear that they are \n     going along with the first round of expansion largely to \n     humor the Americans and that they will contribute nothing to \n     its costs. Because of Russian opposition, Western Europeans \n     are privately negative, sometimes adamantly so, about Baltic \n     membership. If the United States pressed the issue, as it \n     would be bound to do given the commitment the Clinton \n     administration has made, the result would be a serious \n     crisis at the core of the Alliance, with charges of bad \n     faith and recklessness echoing back and forth across the \n     Atlantic, that could end by destroying NATO itself.\n       If, on the other hand, Washington did somehow prevail on \n     the Western Europeans to admit the Balts, or, failing that, \n     offered them a unilateral alliance like the Japanese-American \n     Security Treaty, the United States would be obliged to \n     provide for their defense. This second option would surely \n     require recreating in some form the military deployments of \n     the Cold War. American troops and American nuclear weapons \n     would have to be stationed within the borders of the three \n     countries. This would not be cheap, which is one reason, \n     although hardly the only one, that the Clinton \n     administration's estimate of the price of expansion, which \n     does not include cost of fulfilling the American commitment \n     to the Balts, is ludicrously low.\n       Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia might well turn out to be \n     defensible only with nuclear weapons, as West Berlin was \n     during the Cold War, in which case NATO expansion would \n     return the world to the hair-trigger nuclear standoff of the \n     1950s and 1960s. That is why Senator Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan's warning that NATO expansion could, \n     unintentionally, ``raise the prospect of nuclear war to the \n     most intense point it has reached since the beginning of the \n     Nuclear Age'' is not hyperbole. It is, rather, a reasonable \n     assessment of the consequences of policies to which, if \n     Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic join NATO, the United \n     States and Russia are already committed.\n       Because of the determined opposition to Baltic membership \n     the Western Europeans will mount, and the huge risks that \n     including the Balts would entail, the likeliest option for \n     the United States is the third: Having agreed to defend three \n     countries in Central Europe that are not remotely threatened, \n     the United States will renege on its commitment to defend the \n     Balts precisely because they might be threatened. This option \n     would enshrine in the foreign policy of the United States the \n     principle that American security guarantees are available \n     only to those who do not need them. It would also accomplish \n     exactly what its champions claim NATO expansion is designed \n     to avoid: It would draw a new line of division in Europe and \n     consign friendly democracies to the wrong side of it. It \n     would break a promise the Balts have received from the United \n     States. It would give the Russians what the Clinton \n     administration has sworn it will never permit: a veto on the \n     question of which countries belong to NATO.\n       Moreover, it would fortify the Communists and nationalists \n     in Russia, who would be able to say to their pro-Western, \n     democratic political opponents: ``We tried your preferred \n     policy, cooperation with the West, and what was the result? \n     NATO expanded to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \n     without consulting us, against our wishes, and in flagrant \n     violation of the promise not to do so given to Mikhail \n     Gorbachev and Eduard Shevardnadze at the time of German \n     unification in 1990. Then Russia adopted our tactics: \n     standing firm, drawing a line, and making threats. And what \n     is the result? NATO expansion has stopped in its tracks. Our \n     way of dealing with the West has been vindicated.'' This is \n     hardly a lesson that it is in the interest of the United \n     States to teach Russia. The fact that it is the lesson that \n     Russia is all too likely to learn is one reason that, \n     according to Alexei Arbatov, a member of the unimpeachably \n     democratic Yabloko faction in the Russian State Duma and the \n     leader in the effort to persuade the Duma to ratify the START \n     II arms reduction treaty, Russians--who have advocated \n     cooperation with the West--feel betrayed by NATO expansion.\n       Since no American president will ever be able to say, \n     definitely and absolutely, that the Baltic countries will \n     never join NATO, however, even this third option will not put \n     an end to the matter. Russians will always have to believe \n     that NATO might expand to the Baltic countries, and this \n     prospect will therefore poison Russian-American relations far \n     into the future.\n       The damage to American interests that each of the three \n     options would inflict would be infinitely greater than \n     whatever modest embarrassment rejecting the plan for NATO \n     expansion that is now before the Senate would cause. And \n     rejecting the plan is the only sure way to avoid the damage. \n     Rejection, that is, is the only way to steer the American \n     ship of state clear of the large, menacing iceberg toward \n     which the Clinton administration is now guiding it.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the administration often claims its aim \nin expanding NATO is to foster democracy, stability, and economic \nreform in Central Europe. But there already is democracy, stability and \neconomic reform in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. Besides, if \nthis was our aim wouldn't the European Union, whose fundamental purpose \nis to spur growth and stability through integration, be a better \nvehicle for accomplishing these goals than NATO, which is after all a \nmilitary alliance? If our goal is to expand markets and democracy, why \ndon't we use our leverage to promote the expansion of the European \nUnion?\n  Central European states covet membership in the European Union for \nthe economic benefits they believe it would confer. Wouldn't it be \nbetter for the United States to exert our leadership, our great \ninfluence, to promote expansion of the European Union which threatens \nno one rather than expand a military alliance that threatens the one \ncountry on which European security depends most?\n  What worries me most though, Mr. President, is that NATO expansion, \nneedlessly risks poisoning Russia's relations with the U.S. for years \nto come and increases the odds that Russian ultra-nationalists and \nanti-U.S. forces will gain power in the post-Yeltsin Period. NATO \nexpansion threatens to turn the clock back to the worst days of the \nCold War, something that few Americans and few Europeans want.\n  Former Russian officials say and some former American officials \nconfirm that by seeking to expand NATO, the U.S. is violating a \ncommitment made when Moscow agreed to Germany's reunification and \nremaining in NATO, withdrawing Russian troops from Germany, and \ndisbanding the Warsaw Pact. While there is some disagreement over what \ncommitment was actually made to Gorbachev, there is no question that \nRussian officials say they had firm U.S. assurances that NATO would not \nbe expanded. The Russian perception that we are reneging on our word \ncan only erode trust and poison future relations.\n  On this point, I will quote Susan Eisenhower, Chairman, The Center \nfor Political and Strategic Studies, testifying before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, March 19, 1998:\n\n       It is Russian democrats who feel betrayed by NATO \n     expansion--not the hard liners who are benefitting from it. \n     Gorbachev says that we were verbally assured that NATO would \n     not expand if the Soviet Union agreed to German unification \n     and its place in NATO. Under the war-time Four Powers Act, \n     Moscow had a legal right to refuse such an arrangement, and \n     would have if the Soviets had imagined that less than a \n     decade later some and eventually all of their former allies \n     would be gazing at them from the other side of a military \n     alliance. Russian hard liners, always deeply skeptical of \n     Western intentions, say this ``betrayal'' is par for the \n     course, and they mock the Russian democrats for trusting the \n     West too much.\n\n  Eisenhower, who met Gorbachev on a recent trip to Moscow, reported \nthat Gorbachev was deeply disturbed by NATO Expansion's impact on those \nwho promoted cooperation with the West, adding:\n\n       ``Russia has been swindled,'' he asserted, and it is \n     feeding into the wild ideas of those who hold ``conspiracy \n     theories'' that the West is intent not only on the Soviet \n     Union's demise but also Russia's. ``NATO expansion has \n     poisoned the atmosphere of trust,'' he said.\n\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, it is worth pointing out that the sense of betrayal \nisn't confined to former President Gorbachev, but is shared by our \nnatural allies in today's Russia, political leaders who are committed \nboth to democracy and U.S.-Russia cooperation. For example, there is \nDr. Alexei Arbatov, deputy chairman of the Defense Committee of the \nDuma. Dr. Arbatov is a member of the leadership of Yabloko, Russia's \nlargest unimpeachably democratic party, a strong advocate of U.S.-\nRussia cooperation, and a leader in the effort to ratify the START-II \nTreaty in the Duma. He was involved in the START-I negotiations in \nGeneva, and later served as a consultant on all the major Soviet-\nAmerican and Russian-American arms control issues, including the START-\nII and CFE treaties.\n  Here are Dr. Arbatov's thoughts on NATO expansion in light of \nRussia's agreement to German reunification and other concessions:\n\n       . . . Nobody took the trouble to warn Russian that as a \n     result of all these concessions and sacrifices, NATO--the \n     most powerful military alliance in the world--would start \n     moving towards Russian borders. To the contrary, Moscow was \n     repeatedly told by the West that it would be accepted as an \n     equal and genuine partner and that no major decision on \n     international security would be made without it. Well the \n     NATO summit in Madrid came as a clear manifestation that such \n     decisions may and will be made and Russia's opinion really \n     matters only so long as it is in line with the Western \n     position . . . At best, NATO expansion to the East is \n     regarded in Russia as a mistaken policy. . . . At worst it is \n     regarded as the consummation of a `grand design' to encircle \n     and isolate Russia, establishing strategic superiority and \n     finally destroying Russia, ending once and for all Russia's \n     role as a European power.\n\n  If this is how a democrat and advocate of U.S.-Russian amity sees it, \nimagine how more conservative, more nationalist forces who could come \nto power in the future see it.\n  Mr. President, am I missing something? Is there some compelling, \nover-riding reason that makes NATO expansion so vital to U.S. interests \nthat we must imperil our relations with Russia for years to come and \nrevive Russian mistrust and paranoia? If this is so, I would appreciate \nit if one of my colleagues or the Administration could tell me, and \nmore important the American people, what that compelling, over-riding \nreason is.\n  There is no question in my mind that colleagues who support NATO \nexpansion do so because they believe it would be in the interests of \nthe United States and think it would be the right thing to do. I \nquestion no colleage on that. But I am troubled by the fact that U.S. \narms makers have played a major role in lobbying for NATO expansion. \nAnd this lobbying has been confined just to the United States. As \ndifficult as it may be to believe, McDonnell Douglas helped the \nHungarian Government win public support in a referendum on joining NATO \nby financing a CD-ROM game called ``Natopoly'' that was distributed \nfree to libraries throughout Hungary. The Washington Post described it \nas a ``piece of slick, unabashedly pro-NATO software.''\n  Mr. President, U.S. arms makers seem to equate expanding NATO with \nexpanding profits. To explain what I mean, let me quote from a June 29, \n1997 New York Times article entitled, ``Arms Makers See Bonanza in \nSelling NATO Expansion'':\n\n       At night, Bruce L. Jackson is president of the U.S. \n     Committee to Expand NATO, giving intimate dinners for \n     Senators and foreign officials. By day, he is director of \n     strategic planning for Lockheed Martin Corporation.\n       Mr. Jackson says he keeps his two identities separate, but \n     his company and his lobbying group are fighting the same \n     battle. Defense contractors are acting like globe-hopping \n     diplomats to encourage the expansion of NATO, which will \n     create a huge market for their wares.\n       . . . ``The stakes are high'' for arms makers, said Joel L. \n     Johnson, vice president for international affairs at the \n     Aerospace Industries Association. . . . ``Whoever gets in \n     first will have a lock for the next quarter century.'' The \n     potential market for jets alone is $10 billion, he said. . . \n     . ``Then there's transport aircraft, utility helicopters, \n     attack helicopters,'' Mr. Johnson said--not to mention \n     military communications systems, computers, radar, radios, \n     and other tools of a modern fighting force. ``Add these \n     together, and we're talking real money,'' he said.\n\n  And the real ``real money'' he's talking about is more likely to come \nfrom the U.S. taxpayers than from new NATO members. In fact, it appears \nas if funds are already coming from the U.S. taxpayer to subsidize arms \npurchases by potential NATO members.\n  Let me also draw from a study by William D. Hartung, the author of \nthe report which is entitled Welfare for Weapons Dealers 1998: The \nHidden Costs of NATO Expansion.\n  I will read the summary of his key findings. Mr. President, how much \ntime do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes 36 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. Hartung wrote:\n\n       Potential new members of NATO are the largest recipients of \n     subsidized military loans from the U.S. Government: \n     Allocations for potential NATO members now dominate the \n     Pentagon's FMF loan program, representing 44.8 percent of the \n     $540.1 million in FMF loans for fiscal year 1997 and 61.2 \n     percent of the $647.5 million for fiscal year 1998.\n       NATO expansion is good news for Boeing and Lockheed Martin, \n     but is a potential disaster for U.S. taxpayers: Lockheed \n     Martin has been promising ``100 percent economic cooperation \n     and up to 100 percent financing'' for countries that buy F-16 \n     fighters. Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Textron all have deals \n     in the works to produce U.S.-designed weapons in East and \n     Central Europe as an inducement to get officials there to \n     ``buy American''. . .The questionable terms on U.S. military \n     loans to the region could leave U.S. taxpayers to pick up the \n     tab for hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in \n     potential defaults. The likely result of all this furious \n     marketing activity would be a U.S.-subsidized re-arming of \n     East and Central Europe that will fatten the bottom line of \n     U.S. weapon makers at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, if Mr. Hartung is right, and I think there is a good \nchance he is, NATO expansion will be a double whammy for U.S. \ntaxpayers. They will wind up subsidizing U.S. arms merchants in a \nventure that will bring them less, not more, security.\n  I now want to mention Senator Nunn, who I join in opposing NATO \nexpansion. He deserves a great deal of credit for being the first \nSenator, to my knowledge, to raise fundamental questions about the \nwisdom of NATO expansion. Because of my enormous respect for Senator \nNunn's knowledge of national security and defense issues, his concerns \nabout NATO expansion influenced my own thinking.\n  Senator Nunn delivered one of the most incisive statements I have \never heard on the issue when he appeared on the Jim Lehrer Newshour \nshow in March of 1997. He addressed both the possible impact of NATO \nexpansion on our national security and on Russia domestically.\n  Here is what Senator Sam Nunn had to say:\n\n       I'll start with the question, what are the greatest threats \n     to the United States? Clearly, the No. 1 threat to the United \n     States today is the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, whether chemical or biological or nuclear.\n\n  I agree with Senator Nunn, that should be the foundation of our \nforeign policy, our No. 1 concern.\n\n       Then my question would be: Does NATO expansion help in the \n     fight against proliferation of these weapons going to the \n     third world rogue countries or terrorist groups? And my \n     answer to that is no, it makes the cooperation that we have \n     underway with Russia more difficult, perhaps not impossible, \n     but more difficult.\n       The second question I ask is about nuclear threats. Does \n     NATO expansion help us in terms of easing the nuclear \n     trigger, while Russia still has thousands and thousands of \n     nuclear weapons, or is it harmful? And I think the answer to \n     that is it makes it more difficult because it puts enormous \n     pressure on the Russian military. They're extremely weak, \n     conventionally now. They're not a threat to countries we're \n     taking in, but their reaction is likely to be a reliance, a \n     heavy reliance on nuclear weapons. So the answer that I have \n     to both of those key questions relating to the threat is that \n     it makes it--NATO expansion makes our security problems more \n     difficult.\n       The third question is the question of Russia itself. The \n     greatest change we've had in the threat to the United States \n     has been the breakup of the Warsaw Pact and movement towards \n     democracy and market reform in Russia. That has a long way to \n     go. But the question I ask, is NATO expansion going to make \n     reform more likely in Russia or less likely? I think it makes \n     it more difficult because it puts pressure on our friends, \n     the democrats in Russia, and it gives a great political \n     issue to the demagogues there and the people on the \n     extreme left and the extreme right.\n\n  I think my colleague, Senator Nunn, is absolutely right. It works at \ncross-purposes to stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. I think it makes the nuclear threat more real, as Senator \nNunn suggested, and it absolutely plays into the hands of the\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\nworst forces in Russia and to the disadvantage of democrats in Russia.\n  Mr. President, the push for a larger NATO has already hurt our \nrelations with Russia, as shown by the stalling of the START II \nagreements in the Duma, troubling frictions with Russia recently on \nissues ranging from U.S. policy toward Iraq, to proliferation issues, \nto the management of Russia's nuclear material.\n  My colleague, Senator Moynihan, has had a distinguished career in \ndiplomacy and international relations, and he was recently quoted as \nwarning that extending the NATO alliance toward the frontier of Russia \nrisks ``the catastrophe of nuclear war.'' I cannot honestly say whether \nI think his analysis is right or wrong, but I have to ask myself is \nthere any compelling reason for the U.S. rush to expand NATO if there \nis the slightest chance that it could trigger a nuclear war down the \nroad. Why are we taking such a chance?\n  Dr. Arbatov, while in Washington last month to attend meetings at the \nCenter for Political and Strategic Studies, took issue with those in \nthe West who contend that Russians don't really care about NATO \nexpansion. The following is a summary from his remarks that Arbatov \napproved:\n\n       Contrary to what is being said by many Western proponents \n     of NATO, Russians do care about NATO expansion, and they are \n     almost unanimously opposed. It is true that most Russians, \n     like most Americans, are primarily concerned about everyday \n     things and making ends meet. But almost everyone who has any \n     interest in foreign affairs is very concerned. Millions of \n     pensioners who remember World War II, all the military, \n     workers in defense industries, intellectuals, government and \n     political elites care very deeply about this issue. And \n     nearly the full spectrum of Russian politicians is opposed to \n     the expansion of NATO.\n\n  I want to conclude this way. Susan Eisenhower points out that not \nonly are Russia's progressive forces being put under enormous pressure \nby NATO expansion, but there are signs Russian conservatives are \nalready using it to their own advantage. Eisenhower stresses:\n\n       There is already tangible evidence that NATO expansion has \n     given conservative forces--\n\n  Which has a different meaning, I say to my conservative colleagues \nhere, than conservativism in America.\n\n     a platform. On January 23, the Duma overwhelmingly passed a \n     resolution stating that NATO expansion is the ``most serious \n     military threat to our country since 1945.'' It also said \n     that Baltic membership in NATO would be incompatible with the \n     NATO-Russian Founding Act . . . The resolution requested that \n     the Yeltsin government devise a program to counteract NATO \n     expansion.\n\n  In pursuing NATO expansion, why is the administration disregarding \nthe warnings of Russian democrats, George Kennan and other \ndistinguished Russian scholars, that NATO expansion is likely to sow \nthe seeds for the reemergence of antidemocratic and chauvinist trends \nin Russia? That is a serious threat, I say to my colleagues, to our \nlives, our children's lives, and our grandchildren's lives.\n  I am especially puzzled by this since it must be evident to both \nsupporters and foes of NATO expansion that European security and \nstability is greatly dependent on Russia's transition to democracy. A \ndemocratic Russia is unlikely to ever threaten its neighbors.\n  Why then are we considering a step that will weaken Russia's \ndemocrats and strengthen ultra-nationalists who oppose democracy? \nGeorge Kennan has said--George Kennan who wrote the famous Mr. X \narticle in Foreign Affairs; George Kennan, perhaps the most prominent \nthinker about Russia in our country--George Kennan with the most \ndistinguished career possible has said that expanding NATO ``may be \nexpected to inflame nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic \ntendencies in Russian opinion [and] to have an adverse effect on the \ndevelopment of Russian democracy. * * *''\n  Let me repeat that quote. George Kennan has said that expanding NATO \n``may be expected to inflame nationalistic, anti-Western and \nmilitaristic tendencies in Russian opinion [and] to have an adverse \neffect on the development of Russian democracy * * *''\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully consider George Kennan's wise \nwords, the heartfelt words of Russian democrats, and the prophetic \nwords of Senator Sam Nunn and join me in opposing ratification of NATO \nexpansion.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes left.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3739-5", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3744-S3745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE MURDER OF BISHOP JUAN GERARDI CONEDERA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in the 2 minutes I have remaining, I \njust want to bring to the attention of my colleagues that wonderful \nbishop in Guatemala, Juan Gerardi--a man of justice--who was \nassassinated on Sunday. He was the director and founder of the Human \nRights Office of the Archdiocese of Guatemala. It has been absolutely \ndevastating to the forces for democracy in Guatemala and to the forces \nfor human rights.\n  On the floor of the Senate today, I just want to say that I believe, \nas a Senator, that our Government should make it crystal clear to the \nGovernment in Guatemala that we want a full accounting. I urge the U.S. \nAmbassador to Guatemala to ask the Guatemalan government to swiftly \ninvestigate this crime; it is a terrible setback to the effort to shine \na light into the dark corners of our hemisphere's history.\n  What we know so far is that on Sunday, April 26, Bishop Gerardi was \nassaulted and killed as he entered his home. His attacker, whose \nidentity is unknown, smashed the Bishop's head with such brutality that \nhis features were obliterated and his body could only be identified by \nhis ring. Nothing was stolen from Bishop Gerardi's body or his house, \nnor was his car stolen.\n  When you have a courageous Catholic bishop who has been such a strong \nadvocate for human rights murdered, we need to know--the people in \nGuatemala need to know--what happened. There needs to be \naccountability.\n  Mr. President, this vicious crime is all the more terrible because of \nthe context in which it occurred. On Friday, Bishop Gerardi had \nreleased the Archdiocese's report on past human rights violations in \nGuatemala entitled ``Guatemala: Never Again.'' He directed the Catholic \nChurch's effort to gather information on the long, tragic history of \nmassacres, killings, and torture in that country. These efforts are an \nimportant part of the people of Guatemala's efforts to come to terms \nwith their past, through a full and accurate accounting of past human \nrights abuses.\n  I do not prejudge this. I do not know who committed this brutal \nassassination. But like the Catholic Church in our country and like \npeople all across the world who care so much about democracy and human \nrights, as a Senator, I do call on the Government of Guatemala to \nlaunch an immediate investigation into the murder of Bishop Gerardi, \nand to make sure that they bring this to closure and we find out who \nwas responsible for this barbaric act. Whether or not this was a crime \nagainst a man who was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time or a \ncarefully calculated attack against the Bishop and his work, the truth \nmust be brought to light. Adding another mystery to the labyrinth of \ndeaths, disappearances, and shattered lives in Guatemala would compound \nthe tragedy of the loss of one of Latin America's great human rights \nleaders.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement from the \nHuman Rights Office of the Archbishop of Guatemala, as well as a copy \nof my letter to the U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I thank my colleagues for their courtesy. I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Office of Human Rights,\n\n                                          Archbishop of Guatemala.\n       In the Face of the Abominable Assassination of Monsenor \n     Juan Jose Gerardi Conedera, The Human Rights Office of the \n     Archbishopric of Guatemala Announces:\n       1. Its profound pain and indignation for the cowardly and \n     brutal assassination of Monsenor Gerardi, the founder and \n     General Coordinator of this office.\n       2. On Sunday, April 26 at around 10:00 pm, when he was \n     entering his house after doing a routine family visit, \n     Monsenor Gerardi was attacked by an individual who was not \n     identified. The assassin first hit Mons. Gerardi on the back \n     of the head with a piece of cement, and later delivered blows \n     to the bishop's face, disfiguring it. The individual returned \n     to a site near the crime ten minutes later, having changed \n     his clothes since they had been soaked with the bishop's\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\n     blood. No object of value was stolen from the house, nor was \n     his vehicle taken (which he was getting out of when \n     attacked), nor was any personal item touched by the assassin.\n       3. Forty-eight hours earlier, Monsenor Gerardi had presided \n     at the Metropolitan Cathedral, along with other bishops from \n     the Guatemalan Episcopal Conference, for the public \n     presentation of the report entitled, ``Guatemala: Nunca \n     Mas.'' The report documents and analyzes tens of thousands of \n     cases of human rights violations that occurred during the \n     armed conflict. Mons. Gerardi was the coordinating bishop for \n     the Interdiocesan Project ``The Recuperation of Historic \n     Memory'' which produced the report.\n       4. Mons. Gerardi was Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of \n     Guatemala since 1984. From 1967 to 1976 he was bishop of Las \n     Verapaces, where he laid the groundwork for the Indigenous \n     Pastoral. Later he was named bishop of El Quiche, where he \n     had to confront the time of the worst violence against the \n     population. The assassination of various priests and \n     catechists and the harassment of the Church by the military \n     obliged him to close down the diocese of El Quiche in June of \n     1980. Weeks before that, Mons. Gerardi had escaped an ambush. \n     When he was president of the Episcopal Conference, the \n     authorities denied him entry into his own country and he was \n     forced to remain in exile for two years until he was able to \n     return in 1984.\n       5. The assassination of Monsenor Gerardi is a ruthless \n     aggression against the Church of Guatemala--which for the \n     first time has lost a bishop in a violent manner--and against \n     the Catholic people, and represents a heavy blow to the peace \n     process.\n       6. We demand that the authorities clarify this tragedy \n     within a period of time not to exceed 72 hours, because if \n     impunity is allowed to extend to this case it will bring \n     grave cost to the Republic of Guatemala.\n       7. To the people of Guatemala and the international \n     community we ask your resolute support and solidarity in this \n     difficult moment for the Catholic Church. This treacherous \n     crime has shocked everyone, but in this time of trial we \n     should remain firm and united in order to keep the violence \n     and terror that the Guatemala people have suffered from \n     taking possession of Guatamala and make us lose the political \n     space which has been won at such great sacrifice.\n       As Monsenor Gerardi said, in his April 24th address at the \n     presentation of the REHMI report, ``We want to contribute to \n     the building of a country different than the one we have now. \n     For that reason we are recovering the memory of our people. \n     This path has been and continues to be full of risks, but the \n     construction of the Reign of God has risks and can only be \n     built by those that have the strength to confront those \n     risks.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Donald Planty,\n     U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala, Embassy of the United States, \n         Guatemala City, Guatemala.\n       Dear Ambassador Planty: I was profoundly shocked and \n     saddened when I received the news of the murder of Bishop \n     Juan Gerardi, Coordinator of the Human Rights Office of the \n     Archbishop of Guatemala.\n       The circumstances, as I understand it, still remain \n     unclear. However, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of \n     Guatemala City suggested that this murder could be related to \n     the public release of the REHMI Report on Friday, April 24th, \n     just 48 hours before this deplorable killing.\n       It appears that many believe that this case does not fall \n     into the category of ``common crime.'' Former President \n     Ramiro de Leon Carplo, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, and \n     others have voiced their concerns about the possible \n     political nature of this incident and I am sure this question \n     is on the mind of many other Guatemalans.\n       I urge you, Ambassador Planty, to let the officials of the \n     Guatemalan government know that Members of Congress \n     anticipate a full and thorough investigation of this tragic \n     event. We hope to learn not only who the perpetrators were, \n     but whatever other factors and motivations, if any, were \n     involved in this terrible crime.\n       Thank you for your attention to my concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul Wellstone,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity to \nengage in this debate over the proposed expansion of the NATO treaty. \nIt is an important occasion for this body, for our country, and for the \nshape of the post-cold war world. To quote Emerson, who had in turn \nbeen quoted by the great American statesman Dean Acheson about the \ndawning of the post-World War II era, ``we are present at the sowing of \nthe seed of creation.''\n  It is a debate which has properly engaged the best minds in American \nforeign and national security policy. George Kennan, the architect of \nthe successful ``containment'' strategy with which NATO won the cold \nwar, has said,\n\n       Expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American \n     policy in the entire post-Cold War era. Such a decision may \n     be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and \n     militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an \n     adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to \n     restore the atmosphere of the Cold War to East-West \n     relations; and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions \n     decidedly not to our liking.\n\n  That is the quote of Mr. Kennan. My predecessor, and someone whose \nviews on national security matters I most value, former Senator Sam \nNunn, has said, ``NATO expansion makes our security problems more \ndifficult,'' and Senator Nunn cowrote a recent magazine article with \nformer Senator Howard Baker, Alton Frye and Brent Scowcroft which \nstates that, ``by premature action on new members, the Senate could \ncondemn a vital alliance to creeping impotence.''\n  On the other hand, the architect of America's detente strategy, Henry \nKissinger, testified to our Senate Armed Services Committee that,\n\n       Failure to expand NATO is likely to prove irrevocable. \n     Russian opposition is bound to grow as its economy gains \n     strength; the nations of Central Europe may drift out of \n     their association with Europe. The end result would be the \n     vacuum between Germany and Russia that has tempted so many \n     previous conflicts. When NATO recoils from defining the only \n     limits that make strategic sense, it is opting for \n     progressive irrelevance.\n\n  And Zbigniew Brzezinski, with whom I served in the Carter \nAdministration, has testified that,\n\n       NATO enlargement has global significance--it is central to \n     the step-by-step construction of a secure international \n     system in which the Euroatlantic alliance plays the major \n     role in ensuring that a peaceful and democratic Europe is \n     America's principal partner.\n\n  Mr. President, these are strong and important words from some of our \ncountry's premier experts on international relations, and of course \nthey point the Senate in diametrically opposite directions in the \ncurrent debate. However, and I will return to this point later, in my \nview they all raise the right questions and ultimately can help point \nus in the right direction as we take up the critical questions of \nwhether NATO and whether Europe will remain with us regardless of what \nwe do on the pending resolution of ratification. Though I certainly \nacknowledge the importance of the impending decision, I would counsel \nthat we not engage in exaggeration or hyperbole about the consequences \nof this single choice. It is but the first, and in my opinion probably \nnot the most important, question we must answer as we feel our way in \nthis unknown ``new world order,'' and no one, and certainly not this \nSenator, knows for certain how the future will unfold in Russia, or in \nthe rest of Europe, for that matter.\n\n  So I welcome and I appreciate the thoughtful commentary which has \nbeen submitted on both sides of this issue. I have benefited from it, \nand I certainly believe that neither side has a corner on wisdom or \nconcern for our future security. In this same spirit, I would like to \nthank the distinguished Majority Leader for responding to two requests \nI made, one in a letter I co-signed with a number of other Senators on \nMarch 3, and the other in a personal\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\nnote I sent to him on March 25, that he delay final Senate action on \nthe resolution of ratification to allow for more debate, and for more \ninformation to be obtained on several important policy questions. While \nI thought, and think, that for a variety of reasons, it would be better \nto delay this vote until the beginning of June, I appreciate the \npostponement he did arrange because it allowed me to make my own \n``inspection tour'' of Europe to assess the situation there in person \non the ground.\n  I have just completed a twelve day, 12,000 mile tour of Europe. My \ntravels took me to London, Camp Robertson, V Corps Headquarters and \nRamstein Air Force Base in Germany, and NATO Headquarters in Belgium. \nThey also took me to Eagle Base in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On my trip, I \ntried to get a realistic look at our Western alliance as we approach \nthe end of the 20th Century. Our relations with our European allies, \nparticularly through NATO, are of special importance to the United \nStates. As I have already indicated, the issue of NATO expansion to \nnations formerly a part of the Warsaw Pact, especially the pending \nproposal to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in NATO, \nis of paramount importance as we consider the crucial matter of the \nfuture of the Western alliance in this body.\n\n  During my journey, I also attempted to get a feel for the disposition \nand readiness of our military forces in Europe, and the attitude and \nmorale of our troops deployed on our expeditionary mission to Bosnia.\n  Any attempt at gaging the temperature of our NATO alliance must begin \nwith a sense of European history. President Kennedy once said that the \nthing that he cherished most in the White House was ``a sense of \nhistory,'' and the thing he feared most was ``human miscalculation.'' I \nhad the same feeling as I toured Europe. In order for us to not \nmiscalculate in terms of our diplomatic and military policy in these \nareas, we must have a sense of history of the region. Winston Churchill \nonce observed about the value of history that, ``One can not know where \none is going unless one knows where one has been.'' This is certainly \ntrue in Europe.\n  To illustrate the lessons of history, I have in mind a trip I took to \nthe Waterloo battlefield in Belgium made famous by Napoleon's encounter \nwith the Duke of Wellington there in 1815. In addition to some \nfascinating lessons regarding battlefield tactics which created 48,000 \ncasualties in one afternoon, I gained some other valuable insights \nwhich I think are instructive as we approach the NATO expansion debate.\n  One lesson that I learned was that although Napoleon had great \nloyalty from his band of seasoned veterans who had marched with him \nthrough the various Napoleonic wars which had plagued Europe until \n1815, by the time of Waterloo he was actually outnumbered 3 to 1. \nEurope had finally coalesced against him. At a crucial moment in the \nbattle, it was a Prussian commander who brought his forces from as far \naway as Austria and Germany to come decisively to the aid of \nWellington. The Prussian commander massed his forces to help Wellington \ndefeat Napoleon's Grand Armee and the Napoleonic Guards. The lesson for \nme is clear. Europe has been swept over by one conqueror or another \never since Roman Times. But, when European nations form a strong \nalliance, they can defeat any enemy.\n  I think this is an important lesson in history to apply to our \npresent day understanding of Europe, particularly in terms of our NATO \nalliance. In this century from time to time, Germany, then Russia, has \ntried to dominate Western and Eastern Europe. Each time, alliances were \nformed against the hostile force. NATO, the most successful European \nalliance in history, will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary next year. \nIt is not surprising to me that Western Europe, primarily because of \nNATO, has seen its longest extended peace in centuries.\n\n  Another lesson of history I learned on this trip was the importance \nof American leadership in helping Europe form alliances that protect it \nfrom invasion without and turmoil within. It was after all a British \nleader across the channel, Wellington, who acted as a catalyst to lead \nthe disparate nations of continental Europe to defeat Napoleon. That \nwas in the last century. This century, it has been an ally across the \nAtlantic, America, who has led the disparate nations of Europe in an \nalliance to defeat those who would conquer it. Beginning in World War \nI, throughout World War II, during the Berlin Airlift, and, finally, \nthrough to the conclusion of the Cold War, America has been a catalyst \nin bringing European nations together to defend and protect our shared \ninterests. American leadership and American guarantees of security with \ncommitment of our forces on the ground in Europe has provided what one \nFrench diplomat called an ``insurance policy'' that if things go wrong \non the continent ``America will come.''\n  As America approaches the close of this century and the dawn of the \nnext, our nation finds itself fully engaged, committed and involved in \nthe life of Europe. Our diplomats, politicians and military forces are \nstretched over the continent. They provide a level of diplomatic clout \nand military force projection second to none. America in this part of \nthe world is looked upon as an honest broker in dealing with age-old \nEuropean factional disputes. The security and stability in Europe since \nWWII principally guaranteed by NATO is the prime reason Europe is the \nnumber one trading and investment partner of the United States today. \nIncreasingly, as the European Union develops, forms its own currency \nand expands its influence into Eastern European countries, it will \nbecome the largest economic trader and investment block on the planet. \nAs America enters into the 21st Century, we will have an opportunity to \nexpand our trans-Atlantic trading and investment partnerships to an \nextent hitherto unknown to us.\n  Make no mistake about it, this opportunity for record economic \ngrowth, and the opportunity to spread the gospel of free market \neconomics and the benefits of trade, travel and commerce, has come \nabout because European states, and especially newly independent Eastern \nEuropean nations, now perceive themselves at the dawn of a new era of \npeace and stability. They are, indeed, ``present at the sowing of the \nseed of creation.''\n\n  Russia has imploded. The Soviet Empire is no more. Where Russia goes \nfrom here is anybody's guess. Churchill once described Russia as ``a \nriddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.'' The mystery of where \nRussia is headed is still with us. We in this country and our European \nallies wish our Russian friends well. Through the Partnership for \nPeace, the Founding Act and other entities, we as a matter of policy \nwant to pursue a future based on cooperation rather than conflict. As a \ndemocracy ourselves, we in the United States wish the Democratic \nmovements in Russia Godspeed. As a market economy, we believe our type \nof economic freedom, which brings with it the blessings of growth and \nopportunity, will sooner or later take hold in Russia as it has in \nother parts of the world. Democratic notions such as the rule of law, \ncivilian control of the military and human rights now penetrate the \nthickest of barriers and the strongest of curtains. We know, too, it \nwill take time for these principles to grow naturally in Russia. Many \nof us feel strongly that Russia will sooner or later make it through \nthis very difficult transitional period. No one knows, however, how \nlong that will take.\n  Whatever the future of Russia, the future of Eastern Europe is more \nand more clear. One of the most powerful messages I received on my trip \nis that there is a new era of hope and opportunity dawning in Eastern \nEurope. Long denied by the Cold War, a host of Eastern European \ncountries now see an opportunity for their moment in the sun. This is \nparticularly the case for the states who have been invited to join \nNATO--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. A short time ago, the \nParliament in the Czech Republic overwhelmingly voted to join NATO. As \nthe vote was declared, the entire body stood up and applauded. As the \ngreat 19th Century French writer Victor Hugo observed, ``An invasion of \narmies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come.'' The \nnations of Eastern Europe are emerging into the light after fifty years \nof the Cold War. The notion that they and their people can enjoy the \nstability and prosperity experienced by Western Europe is an idea whose \ntime has come.\n  Certainly, one of the great challenges currently facing NATO is the \nissue of\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\nBosnia. On my recent trip, I had the marvelous opportunity to fly on a \nhelicopter to an American outpost--Camp Bedrock--in Bosnia on Easter \nSunday.\n  It was near Tuzla in Northeast Bosnia. While flying over the \ncountryside, it seemed I was watching a colorized version of a World \nWar II documentary about war-torn Europe. I saw portions of villages \nburned to the ground. I had not seen such devastation since I was in \nVietnam thirty years ago. On my visit, I got a chance to visit American \nforces in Bosnia. I found them surprisingly cheerful and confident in \ntheir mission of peace-keeping in that war-weary countryside. I'm very \nproud of our forces. They are paying a personal price every day in \nrisking their lives on our behalf.\n  When I returned from my trip, I received an e-mail from one of the \nservicemen I spent Easter Sunday with in Bosnia. He wrote:\n\n       My name is First Lieutenant Brian Brandt. We met today and \n     shook hands in the mess hall here on Eagle Base, Bosnia. I \n     would like to thank you for visiting and sharing in our \n     Easter Mass . . . The greatest burden on today's soldiers is \n     being asked to do more with less and our frequent deployments \n     away from home. I am an OCS graduate and have 14 years of \n     service. In this time I have seen many good and bad things \n     within our services. As we move into the next century I hope \n     we don't find ourselves short. No amount of peace or \n     technology can make up for an Army of over tasked and under \n     trained soldiers. Please carry this message with you to \n     Congress.\n\n  A few days after I visited Camp Bedrock, I was in Brussels. An \nAmerican businessman approached me and asked me if I had ``hope'' about \nBosnia. I had to reply, ``Yes.'' I have hope because I believe Europe \nhas learned some painful lessons over the last two centuries. One of \nthose lessons is that alliances--whether against Napoleon, Hitler or \nStalin--can win. Secondly, I have hope because Americans have learned \nsome lessons about European history as well. Particularly, I think \nwe've learned one of the lessons about American involvement on the \nEuropean continent. The lesson is this: ``Pay me now, or pay me \nlater.'' In other words, we as a nation are involved in Europe--\nmilitarily, economically, culturally. Better to get in on the takeoff \nbefore it turns into a ``crash landing!'' Better to work through the \nEuropean Alliance, in particular through NATO, to prevent a conflict \nthan to risk that conflict turning into a greater confrontation or, \neven worse, war itself.\n  The European community proved incapable of reaching the necessary \nconsensus to act decisively in Bosnia. The U.N. tried to control the \ntensions but was neither trained nor equipped for the task, even though \na limited number of European nations were supportive. Finally, under \nAmerican leadership NATO stepped in. With its command and control \nsystems well established, with its alliance relationships previously \nworked out over the years, it was able to field a stabilization force \nwhich has succeeded beyond the wildest expectations for it. In Bosnia, \nthe NATO alliance now works with non NATO members, including Russia for \na combined alliance of 37 nations.\n\n  That's why the killing has stopped.\n  That's why troops and tanks have been disarmed.\n  That's why minefields are being dismantled.\n  That's why refugees are returning.\n  That's why elections are being held.\n  That's why war criminals are being identified and hauled before an \ninternational tribunal. That's why further excesses of any warring \nparty--as in Kosovo--bring immediate international outrage.\n  That's why those who perpetrated war are now hunted down and \ndiscredited.\n  That's why political moderates are coming to the fore and condemning \nthe extremists.\n  The effort in Bosnia involves the largest alliance of nations ever to \ncoalesce against a common enemy on the continent of Europe. Maybe we've \nlearned and acquired a sense of history after all.\n  I applaud all the members of the alliance for their contributions to \npeace and stability in Bosnia, particularly the NATO members, and \nespecially the Russians, for coming together in a unified effort to \nprevent further bloodshed, enhance stability and pave a pathway for \npeace. I hope it is a harbinger of good things to come in the next \ncentury in terms of enhanced cooperation and communications among our \ncountries for the betterment of mankind.\n  I especially want to applaud our American servicemen and women and \ntheir American military commanders who are working to bring peace and \nstability in Bosnia. They are working in a tasking and demanding \nenvironment filled with diplomatic and military minefields. Special \nthanks go to General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, who came with his wife and joined me for Easter Sunday services \nwith the troops in Tuzla. He joined me and Congressman Patrick Kennedy, \na respected member of the U.S. House National Security Committee, for a \nvery special Easter Mass in a Catholic Chapel. A particular \nresponsibility rests on the shoulders of U.S. General Wes Clark, the \ntop NATO Commander. His diplomatic and military skills have been tested \nto the maximum, and have been put in full play to hold the NATO \nAlliance together militarily in a challenging environment in the \nBalkans. A dear friend and a great Georgian, LTG Jay Hendrix, commands \nthe U.S. Army V Corps out of Germany. He faces the daunting challenge \nof deploying and replacing the troops in the Bosnian expedition. \nGeneral Eric Shinseki is the overall commander of all military forces \non the ground in Bosnia. He has a tough task in Sarajevo. Major General \nLarry Ellis is the ``muddy boots general'' on the ground in Tuzla who \nmusters the morale of all of his forces, and is doing a great job in \nthe American sector. All of the men and women involved in this effort \nare a credit to the United States, the European Alliance and the cause \nof human dignity and freedom in the Balkans. I am proud of them all. I \nwill support continued funding of their efforts to bring peace and \nstability to this troubled part of our world.\n\n  A proper consideration of the issue of NATO expansion requires \nconsideration of American, as well as European, history. As I discussed \nearlier, the leading voices on American foreign policy currently offer \ndivided counsel on this issue. It is obvious that no clear consensus \nhas yet formed as to America's post-Cold War strategy.\n  This lies in stark contrast to previous eras in our history when our \napproach to the world has generally been guided by a unifying vision. \nIn our earliest days, we were galvanized by seeking to gain our \nindependence. Then Manifest Destiny took hold as we boldly expanded \nwestward into frontier country. During the same time, the Monroe \nDoctrine guided our relations with Europe and Latin America. This \nperiod was interrupted by the Civil War and the painful Reconstruction \nEra. As the United States entered the 20th Century and Americans turned \ntoward commerce, the industrial revolution made its biggest impact on \nAmerican economic development. This Gilded Age saw the rise of the \nLabor movement, the Depression and set the foundation for the New Deal.\n  Throughout all of this time, it would be fair to sum up our general \nphilosophy on foreign policy as an attempt to continue to follow \nPresident Washington's recommended approach, contained in his Farewell \nAddress of September 17, 1796:\n\n       Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. \n     Cultivate peace and harmony with all . . . The Nation which \n     indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual \n     fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \n     animosity or to its affection, either of which is \n     sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its \n     interest . . . Steer clear of permanent alliances, with \n     any portion of the foreign world . . . There can be no \n     greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors \n     from nation to nation.\n\n  That approach changed when, following the two great 20th Century \nworld wars and alternating cycles of isolationism and engagement, \nAmerica emerged as the major global economic and military power. We \nthen became united around the fight against Communism which, in the \nform of the Soviet Union, posed the only grave threat to our physical \nsurvival we have ever faced. The Cold War guided our thinking, and NATO \nwas the main military expression of that strategic vision.\n  Now we are in a new era. No one has quite coined the term for it. \nSome call it the ``New World Order,'' but I prefer to call it The Age \nof Democracy. What I find different and indeed magical\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\nabout this new era is the fact that while it brings with it the spread \nof democracy and democratic principles around the world to places that \nhave been burdened by tyranny, it is doing so not through the threat of \nforce, but through the promise of peace. However, thus far we are not \nin consensus on how we shape our national security policies to meet the \nchallenges of the new era.\n  I believe the critics of the proposed expansion of NATO are right \nwhen they focus on the need for policies which draw Russia into \ncooperation rather than confrontation with the United States and the \nWest. From the control of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons \nproliferation to containment of Saddam Hussein, to the termination of \nthe Cold War legacy of Mutual and Assured Destruction, the \nparticipation and cooperation of Russia is of vital importance in \nsecuring this peaceful Age of Democracy which we are entering.\n  I also believe the critics are right that we are going to have to be \nextremely careful in when and how we approach consideration of \ninclusion of the Baltic states and former Soviet Republics in NATO or \nany other unified military command structure.\n  And, over the long-term, I believe the critics are right that it is \nthe expansion of the European Union, and its ultimate promise of what \nChurchill called a ``United States of Europe,'' which offers the \nstrongest foundation for Eastern European economic and political \ndevelopment, and for Europe at long last being able to be fully \nresponsible for its own security.\n  However, after much reflection and after having seen the ``ground \ntruth'' on my recent trip, I have concluded that supporters of NATO \nexpansion are absolutely correct that other than NATO there is no \nentity at present which is able to step up to the plate and fill the \nsecurity void that currently exists in Central Europe. The European \nUnion is currently considering the proposed admission of six nations, \nincluding Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, plus Slovenia, Cyprus \nand Estonia, but that process is likely to take until 2003, at the \nearliest. Furthermore, the Union has a number of important questions, \nsuch as its decision-making process and the division of sovereignty \nbetween it and its component nations, which must be worked out before \nit can offer an effective voice on foreign and defense policies.\n  As for Russia, I believe we must make every effort to seek \ncooperative and mutually beneficial relations. Regardless of how the \nSenate votes with respect to the pending treaty, I believe supporters \nof NATO enlargement are correct that we and the Russians will have the \nsame set of mutual interests to work for; namely, the non-proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction, and stability around Russia's borders \nin Europe, the Middle East and Asia. We should see what the future \nbrings in Russia, with the European Union, and with all of the former \nmembers of the Warsaw Pact before we decide the next steps with respect \nto NATO, including both its membership and mission.\n  It is in this context that I as a member of this body consider the \nissue before the Senate of expanding the NATO treaty to include the \nnations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. For a long time I \nhave asked myself the question, ``Can we afford it?'' As a member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, I've heard witness after witness \nquestion the wisdom of expanding NATO, particularly at this time and \nespecially in terms of the painful transition going on in Russia today. \nI have also heard NATO enlargement questioned from a budgetary point of \nview in terms of its cost to American taxpayers. In the wake of what \nI've learned on my trip, however, I now ask myself, ``Can we afford not \nto do it?''\n  I've concluded that Russia will do whatever it is going to do. We can \nencourage cooperation. We can support democratic principles and human \nrights. We can move forward with arms control agreements, especially \nStart II and move on to Start III. These are critical items on the \nAmerican agenda, and critical items on the Russian agenda as well. We \nmust move forcefully in expanding consultation and cooperation on all \nthese fronts.\n\n  But, we in this country must heed the call of the Eastern European \nnations for help in fulfilling their destiny. Their destiny is with the \nWest, as is Russia's destiny one day. In my view, the expansion into \nthe Eastern European community by the Western European community \nthrough the expansion of NATO, and a gesture of cooperation to the \nRussians through the Partnership for Peace and the Founding Act is a \nplus, not a minus, for our national security. The good news is that so \nmany people in Eastern Europe and Russia want to identify with the \nWest. They want the peace and prosperity offered by Western European \nideas and values and Western European organizations. It is for this \nreason that I intend to vote for NATO expansion. I believe, as Prime \nMinister Tony Blair said in going to Northern Ireland after I had a \nbrief meeting with him, ``I feel the hand of history on my shoulders. I \nhave hope. I have faith. I don't know how it will work out, but I must \ntry.''\n  No one can know for certain how NATO expansion will work out, and I \ncertainly believe we must make our future decisions based on what \nexperience teaches, but in this current decision I think the hand of \nhistory is on our shoulders. I think we must work in faith and hope. I \nthink we must try. I don't know how the future of Russia will unfold, \nbut I think it is important for the Western community of nations led by \nthe United States, in the spirit of friendship and cooperation, to \nreach out in faith and hope to the Eastern European nations, and try to \nhelp them create a new future for themselves.\n  On my recent trip, I visited an American battlefield cemetery. The \nplace was the famous Flanders Fields Cemetery in Belgium. It was a \nCanadian, Colonel John McCrae, who wrote the famous poem about World \nWar I, ``In Flanders Fields.'' Colonel McCrae was later killed in that \nWar. But he challenged all of us for the rest of this century to live \nup to the hope that the soldiers in that war had that their sacrifice \nin bringing peace and stability in Europe would not be in vain. As I \nlaid a wreath at the cemetery, I thought of all those in this century \nsince World War I who have given their lives for peace and prosperity \nin Europe. I support the pending NATO enlargement as a further \nexpansion of a peace process that began with American involvement in \nWorld War I at Flanders Fields, and continues until this day. Surely we \nhave learned some lessons of history this century that will keep us \nfrom miscalculating. Surely we do not want to repeat the mistakes of \nthis century in the next.\n\n  Mr. President, I learned many lessons on this trip. The most \nimportant lesson I learned, however, is that American men and women \ndeployed in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the Balkans are making a \npositive difference in the lives of millions of people in those parts \nof the world. Our American diplomats, soldiers, sailors, marines, \nairmen, guardsmen are our greatest asset. They spread American values \nand ideals wherever they go because they treat people with dignity. \nThey talk the talk. They also walk the walk.\n  More than anything I learned on my trip, Mr. President, is that the \nlegacy of American involvement in Western and Eastern Europe in this \ncentury has been a courageous and positive one. It is because of our \npeople who have given their lives and risked their reputations this \ncentury in the cause of peace, stability, freedom, human rights, the \nrule of law, civilian control of the military, economic justice and \ndemocratic ideals that America plays such a strong hand in diplomatic \nand military missions throughout Europe. That story is not lost on \nnations further East, including Russia and the newly independent states \nof the former Soviet Union.\n  I returned from my trip to Europe and Bosnia even more proud of my \ncountry and our ideals than when I left. As a new century dawns, I'm \nsure Americans will learn from history and not miscalculate. At this \nmoment in history, we are the key players in the progress of a European \nAlliance, especially NATO, and we should be a key player when the \nAlliance expands into Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. While I \nbelieve we must constantly seek emerging answers on such key questions \nas the security situation in the Baltic States, the evolution of the \nEuropean Union, the political situation in Russia, and the impact on \nthe readiness of American military forces, and should be prepared to \nguide our future policy choices based on those answers,\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\n I support the proposed first round of NATO expansion. As the only \ncurrently available alternative, I also support funding for a follow-\non-force in Bosnia. As our troops and diplomats do their duty, they can \ncount on support from this Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to speak in morning business on an \nissue that I believe is of great importance to many families across the \nUnited States. It is the question of health care.\n  Many people watch the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and \nwonder what this debate in the operations of this body have to do with \ntheir lives. They look at the bills and wonder who has written them and \nhow it can affect them, and many times just write it all off as \npolitics. But the issue I am about to speak to and the issue which I \nbelieve should be part of our legislative agenda is the issue of health \ncare.\n  Mr. President, we are in a state of crisis in this country, a crisis \nof confidence over America's health care system. A majority of the \nAmerican people no longer believe their insurance companies are \nproviding them with the quality of service or choice of doctors they \nwere promised when they paid their premiums. Eighty percent of American \nconsumers believe that insurance plans often compromise the quality of \ncare to save money. Ninety percent of Americans say a patient \nprotection act to regulate health insurance plans is needed. Such an \nact has been introduced, and we are hoping that we can bring it to the \nfloor for consideration before we adjourn, because we have precious few \ndays left this year to consider important legislation.\n  Unfortunately in America some health insurers have put cost savings \nbefore life savings. Such cost-cutting practices are only inviting \ntragedy.\n  I brought to the floor today a photograph of a couple from the \nChicago area, the Garvey family. I would like to tell you the story of \nthis typical American family and what happened to Mrs. Garvey on a \nvacation to Hawaii. Barbara Garvey, a wife and mother of seven from \nChicago, suffered from severe arthritis. During a once-in-a-lifetime \nvacation with friends to Hawaii, Mrs. Garvey discovered some bruises on \nher body. She was worried. She was immediately sent to the hospital and \nexamined. After examination, there was a diagnosis that she was \nsuffering from aplastic anemia.\n  There she was in Hawaii, thousands of miles from home, with a friend, \nwith this terrible diagnosis. Doctors in Hawaii decided the only option \nwas to perform an emergency bone-marrow transplant. Both Mrs. Garvey's \nHMO doctor in Chicago and the attending physician in Hawaii agreed that \nwith no immune system and no ability to clot, a commercial flight back \nhome to Chicago to receive treatment would put her at great risk for \ninfection and stroke.\n  Imagine, there you are, thousands of miles away from home, told that \nyou have to face this emergency bone-marrow transplant and you can't \nmove; you have to do it now. And if you do not, you could have serious \nconsequences.\n  They advised Mrs. Garvey to receive this emergency treatment as \nquickly as possible in Hawaii. Her insurance policy covered it. It \nwasn't a matter of debating that. But when she called the HMO that \nmanaged the policy, they refused to accept any treatment in Hawaii. The \nclerk at the HMO said to Mrs. Garvey she had to travel back from Hawaii \nto Illinois for this treatment. They wouldn't pay for it unless she \ndid. And it is very expensive. She didn't have the ability to pay for \nthe expensive treatment.\n  So she made the only decision she could. She got back on the airplane \nto come back to Chicago. On the plane, as predicted by her treating \nphysician, Mrs. Garvey suffered a stroke that left her paralyzed on her \nright side, robbing her of her ability to speak. She was left too weak \nand unstable to even undergo the bone-marrow transplant. She developed \nan infection and after 9 days at a Chicago Hospital, Barbara Garvey \ndied of a cerebral hemorrhage and complications.\n  She was 55 years old, on a Hawaiian vacation, in need of emergency \nmedical treatment, but the decision by an HMO clerk cost her her life. \nShe left behind her husband Dave, seven children, and numerous \ngrandchildren.\n  I might say to my colleagues in the Senate and those listening, this \nshould not happen in America. Health insurers should not make decisions \nthat are best left to doctors and trained health professionals.\n  Mr. President, we should take up and pass meaningful patient \nprotection this year in Congress. We have a bill, S. 1890, the \npatient's bill of rights, that would prevent tragedies like this from \nhappening. The bill would allow for both an independent appeals process \nand for legal accountability for medical decisions made by health \ninsurers. Without such accountability, insurers have no incentive to \nprovide necessary and timely care to people such as Barbara Garvey when \nthey need it the most.\n  It may surprise some people to learn that many HMO plans across the \ncountry, if your doctor says he wants you to receive treatment, require \nyou to call the insurance company. If the insurance company says no, \nno, we don't cover that treatment or we won't give it the way the \ndoctor wants it, and you go ahead and follow the insurance company's \nlead and something bad occurs, guess who is held accountable. Guess who \nis liable in court. The insurance company? In many instances, no. The \ndoctor, the doctor who really wanted to do it differently, who thought \nit was best for you and your family to receive a different treatment, \nends up the person holding the bag.\n  That is not fair. We should each be accountable for our conduct, and \nin this situation no doctor should be held accountable for a decision \nthat was made by the insurance company. The insurance company should \nstand on its own feet.\n\n  Now, we only have a few days remaining in the session. It is hard to \nbelieve that in April we are talking about leaving, but it is going to \nbe an abbreviated session for reasons that are beyond me. The political \nleaders have decided it is time for us to get out of town. They think \nwe have about 60 days to act and don't have much time to consider many \nissues. I hope that we don't leave town without thinking a little bit \nabout this issue, an issue which most Americans are seriously concerned \nabout, the quality of health care and the accountability of HMO's. \nWhatever we are going to do will not alleviate the pain the Garveys \nhave endured, but we can fix the system. We can save families the pain \nof losing a loved one because some insurance companies put business \nbefore wellness.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, for standing up for the rights of patients in health \nmaintenance organizations. This is an issue of enormous importance, and \nI think it is clear the Senate ought to be spending time talking about \nhow real patients are suffering as they try to make their way through \nthe health care system. I wish to tell the Senator that I very much \nappreciate his addressing this issue today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3749-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3749-S3751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SECRET WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION DECISIONS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, the poster that is next to \nme today is a photograph of one of the most important doors in the \nworld. It\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\nis an entry to the World Trade Organization, an organization where \ndecisions are made on an ongoing basis that affect the lives of \nmillions of Americans and billions of citizens around the world, \ndecisions that are directly related to their ability to have good-\npaying jobs, decisions related to their health, their safety and their \nwell-being.\n  Mr. President, these are decisions, as our colleagues can see from \nthis photograph next to me that recently appeared in the New York \nTimes, that the World Trade Organization makes behind closed doors. In \nfact, they seem to think it is so important to do their business in \nsecret that the World Trade Organization has posted it in five \nlanguages--five languages--just to make it clear that the public, not \njust the public in the United States, but citizens around the world, \nare barred from learning of the deliberations that go on behind those \ndoors at the World Trade Organization.\n  I do not come to this floor as a protectionist. In fact, I have voted \nfor every market-opening trade agreement that has come before the \nSenate and, during my years in the other body. Trade, open and expanded \ntrade, is the lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest. In my home State of \nOregon, one out of every five jobs depends on international trade.\n  But I am concerned because the World Trade Organization's decisions \nhave enormous implications for the daily lives of our citizens, and I \ndo not think it is right that those decisions are made behind closed \ndoors. I do not think that a new focus by the World Trade Organization \non openness is inconsistent with the principles of expanded and free \ntrade.\n  If the World Trade Organization had open meetings and could hear \nevidence from outside experts, it is possible some of their decisions \nwould have turned out differently. Take, for example, the recent case \nthe United States lost involving shrimp imports. The World Trade \nOrganization overturned a U.S. ban on imported shrimp caught without \nturtle excluder devices. If expert witnesses had been allowed to \ndemonstrate the effectiveness of these devices in protecting an \nendangered species, I expect that the World Trade Organization would \nhave upheld U.S. law. But experts were shut out of those proceedings. \nEnvironmental groups, just as so many business groups have done, \ncondemned that ruling saying, ``Three unaccountable trade bureaucrats \nsitting behind closed doors in Geneva should not have the power to make \nup rules that sabotage global environmental protection.'' The World \nTrade Organization holds more than 150 scheduled meetings a year, and \nhundreds of others. According to World Trade Organization rules, the \nMinisterial Meeting, which is to be held at least once every 2 years, \nshall ordinarily be held in private. The meetings of the General \nCouncil are also held in private. All other World Trade Organization \nmeetings follow the same rules. In fact, one observer noted the World \nTrade Organization carries out all its activities in strict \nconfidentiality in meetings closed to the public, including the press \nand nongovernmental organizations.\n\n  Next month, the world's major trading nations will meet in Geneva for \nthe second ministerial conference. They will also be celebrating the \n50th anniversary of the world trading system. I urge the President of \nthe United States, if he chooses to go to Geneva, to use that \nopportunity to call for an end to the closed meetings of the World \nTrade Organization.\n  A few weeks ago, with the bipartisan support of our colleagues, the \nSenate adopted my amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill \nthat simply tells the President to instruct the U.S. Representatives to \nthe World Trade Organization to open the organization's doors to the \nworld's public.\n  Today I am joined by several of my colleagues in a letter to the \nPresident urging that he attach a top priority to opening up the World \nTrade Organization. On a bipartisan basis, Senator Abraham, Senator \nKerrey, Senator Connie Mack, Senator D'Amato, and Senator Rockefeller \nhave joined me in urging that the United States not accept closed \nmarkets overseas, but also not accept closed doors in Geneva.\n  Eliminating the secrecy of meetings takes on a greater sense of \nurgency in light of the growing power of the World Trade Organization. \nJust this year, the World Trade Organization is working behind closed \ndoors on new rules on trade in agriculture, financial services, \ninformation technology, government procurement, and many other areas.\n  As the World Trade Organization becomes more enmeshed in global \nstandard-setting and multinational regulations, the agency's secrecy \nbecomes even more disturbing. For example, an important industry group, \nthe American Insurance Association, has publicly criticized the closed-\ndoor nature of the road to Geneva.\n  The type of secrecy that is employed at the World Trade Organization \nwould not be tolerated here in the United States. In our country, when \na Federal agency proposes a new rule or regulation, it must seek public \ncomment. We hold hearings. There is debate in the press.\n  But that fundamental openness is missing in Geneva. The World Trade \nOrganization doesn't have to seek public comment on its actions. It \ndoesn't have to allow the public to watch its deliberations. And this \nis wrong. The World Trade Organization ought to be held accountable for \nits decisions and actions. They should not be allowed to withhold from \nthe public information about their activities in meetings.\n  The press has a special place in the gallery here in the U.S. Senate. \nIn Geneva, the delegates vote by secret ballot about whether to release \na statement after the meeting is over.\n  The President of the United States, to his great credit, has called \nfor greater openness in the World Trade Organization's dispute \nsettlement process. This was listed as a principal U.S. trade \nnegotiating objective in the fast track legislation of last year. In \nrecent testimony before a House committee, senior U.S. officials said \nthat the United States will seek greater transparency in the settlement \nprocess in the World Trade Organization. And Mickey Kantor, President \nClinton's first trade negotiator, has said, ``These are very important \nissues. But it is like they are being dealt with somewhere in a closet \nand no one is watching.''\n  Agricultural trade is just one area where private decisionmaking at \nthe World Trade Organization has enormous public implications. Since \nthe 1980s, food imports to the United States have doubled. At the same \ntime, while most imported food is wholesome, public health scientists \nare saying they are seeing more outbreaks of disease linked to imported \nfood--raspberries from Guatemala; carrots from Peru; strawberries, \nscallions, and cantaloupes from Mexico--the list goes on and on, and \nsome point to the illnesses from this produce as an unintended \nbyproduct of the fact that the safety issues are not debated in the \nopen at the World Trade Organization.\n\n  So, our message is simple. The decisions of the World Trade \nOrganization on food safety or other key standards should not be made \nbehind closed doors. The World Trade Organization has the regulatory \npower to decide whether an Oregon wheat farmer can sell his wheat \noverseas and whether an Oregon cattle rancher can sell his beef in \nEurope. A November 28, 1997, WTO report on relations with \nnongovernmental organizations found that the World Trade Organization \nrestricts the availability of documents on these and many other \nimportant issues for our constituents.\n  The World Trade Organization's dispute settlement process is binding. \nLast November, an opinion piece in the Journal of Commerce stated:\n\n       World Trade Organization dispute settlement process \n     operates largely in the dark with confidential briefs, closed \n     hearings, unsigned opinions and non-transparent, ad hoc panel \n     appointments. Clearly defined rules on procedure, conflicts \n     of interest and other ethical issues for litigants and judges \n     are not established.\n\n  Opening dispute settlement to public view, as the President has \ncalled for and as our bipartisan group of Senators calls for today, is \nessential to maintaining the integrity of the process.\n  Last December, 129 Members of the Swiss Parliament criticized the \nWorld Trade Organization for its lack of democracy, calling for greater \ntransparency. The Swiss should know. They have a front row seat on the \nproceedings in Geneva, and even they believe that it is difficult, if \nnot impossible, to come up with information about these important \nproceedings.\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\n  I close with this last comment. The call for openness at the World \nTrade Organization is a pro-trade position. It will strengthen this \norganization. Sunshine will be beneficial to the cause of free and \nexpanded trade, a cause that I have consistently voted for in my years \nin the U.S. Congress. But if there is a continued lack of \naccountability, if there is a continued obsession with secrecy, I \nbelieve that is going to undermine the cause of expanded trade in the \nworld. I am very hopeful that as we look to bring more openness to the \nWorld Trade Organization, we will see the importance of doing the \npublic's business in public all through the world.\n  Mr. President, many of our colleagues are aware that I am trying to \nbring more openness to the U.S. Senate, with Senator Grassley, by \nbarring the right of a Senator to put a secret hold or objection on \nbusiness here in the U.S. Senate. So I am very hopeful that this year \nwill see changes, changes in the rules in the U.S. Senate, that will \nbring more openness to the way decisions are made here, changes at the \nWorld Trade Organization so there is more openness and more \naccountability in the way decisions are made there.\n  I hope I will be able to come back to this floor in the months ahead \nwithout this poster, and say the World Trade Organization has taken \ndown the ``private'' signs and shown the public how it is making its \ndecisions and why. Doing the public's business in public is more likely \nto generate confidence in the important decisions that are made at the \nWorld Trade Organization and here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of S. 660, \nknown as the University of Alaska lands bill.\n  Alaska entered the Union in 1959 as the largest State with about 360 \nmillion to 365 million acres of land, an area one-fifth the size of the \nUnited States. As part of our Statehood Compact, we were to be treated \nlike other States and, from the standpoint of land provided for our \nland grant education system, namely the University of Alaska, we were \nto be accorded a reasonable amount of land for our land grant college.\n  Today, Alaska ranks 48th out of 50 States in the federal land granted \nfor higher education. We have approximately 112,000 acres. It is \nimportant that I put this in perspective, because the State of New \nMexico has 1.3 million acres; Oklahoma has 1,050,000 acres; Indiana has \n436,000 acres; New York, 990,000 acres. And here sits Alaska, 48th, \nwith 112,000 acres.\n  Something is lacking with regard to the issue of equity. We are the \nonly federal land grant college in the country without the federal \nland. We received less than one-half of the Federal land that was \npromised. There is only one other State that has less land in its land \ngrant system, and that is the State of Delaware with approximately \n90,000 acres. Here is Alaska with 360 million acres receiving 112,000; \nNew Mexico and Oklahoma over 1 million acres.\n  This bill I have offered provides the university with land to support \nitself financially and to continue, obviously, to act as a responsible \nsteward of the land for the education of our greatest resource, our \nchildren.\n  Specifically, this bill would grant the university 250,000 acres of \nFederal land within our State. I might add that the Federal Government \nhas approximately two-thirds of the landmass of our State, which is \nsomewhere in the area of 200 million acres. So we are not talking about \ntransferring very much. We are talking about 250,000 acres out of 200 \nmillion, or thereabouts.\n  In addition to this initial grant, if the State of Alaska chooses to \ngrant the University land, we propose an acre for acre match, up to \n250,000 additional federal acres. This option would be solely at the \noption of the State.\n  Again, the bill would provide 250,000 acres to be transferred to the \nState of Alaska, specifically for its university land grant system, and \nthen if the State provides additional acres, there would be a provision \nfor up to another 250,000 acres of matching Federal land.\n  There are areas that the university cannot select land from within \nthe Federal domain. They cannot select land within conservation units; \nthey cannot select land within the LUD II areas designated in the \nTongass National Forest. They cannot select land conveyed to the State \nor Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act Corporation land. They cannot \nselect land with connection to any Federal military institution.\n  This legislation also provides for what we think is a legitimate \nexchange, because the university does hold some rather sensitive land. \nThey have land on the Alaska Peninsula in the Maritime National \nWildlife Refuge. The university has land in the Kenai Fjords National \nPark. The university has lands in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park \nand Preserve and the Denali Park and Preserve. The University would be \nrequired to relinquish these lands under this legislation.\n  To give you some idea of some of the inholdings the university has, \nmany, many years ago there was a major discovery in Glacier Bay \nNational Park by the Newmont Mining Company, and that was a large \nnickel reserve. It has never been mined, but it was patented. The \npatent was turned over to the university. They are willing to give some \nvery sensitive environmental lands back to the Federal Government in \nexchange for a fulfillment of their federal land grant.\n  It is not without equity, Mr. President. I know of no other State \nthat has given lands back to the federal government in exchange for \nlands given to it for its higher educational system.\n  S. 660 allows the State the option to participate in the process, as \nI indicated. I think it is time the Federal Government lived up to its \ncommitment to the State of Alaska, as it has to the other States, by \nallowing Alaska to participate in a realistic Federal land grant for \nthe education of the young people of our State.\n  Let me advise the Presiding Officer how this process would basically \nbe addressed. The University of Alaska, like most universities, has a \nboard of regents. In our case, the board of regents is appointed by the \nGovernor. They bear the responsibility of responding not only to the \nlegislature and the Governor but the people of Alaska on how they \nutilize the land.\n  Clearly, some of the land would be for development to help fund the \nuniversity and would set up an endowment. We often look with envy to \nour sister State, the State of Washington to the south, where the \nUniversity of Washington has large landholdings in the downtown Seattle \narea. From those leases which the university holds, there has been \nsignificant real estate development. The funding from the lease \npayments goes to the university, an endowment of sorts, and funds the \nuniversity's needs.\n  Some have expressed the concern that this land may be developed and \nthere will not be the careful consideration given relative to the \nbalance associated with how the land is used. But that is a legitimate \nresponsibility of the board of regents. My answer is, if you cannot \ntrust the board of regents, appointed people who are accountable to \nother Alaskans, as well as our Governor and the legislature, who can \nyou trust?\n  So I think what we have here, Mr. President, is an issue that begs \nthe question of why Alaska should be treated any differently than any \nother State. We should have a reasonable amount of land for our land-\ngrant college.\n  We are faced with a situation where we have an institution somewhat \nin crisis because it does not have the ability to have funding from an \nendowment, and, as a consequence, its entire operational budget must be \nmet annually by the State legislature, which has resulted in a decline \nin maintenance\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\nand other normal types of expenditures that most land grant university \nsystems enjoy from the endowment that is generated from the \nlandholdings that they have. But that is not the case with Alaska, and \nthat is why we feel it is so important to rectify this situation.\n  I conclude by indicating that some of America's environmental groups \nare in opposition to this. They are fearful that the university will \nmake Federal land selections and develop that land. My answer to that \nis, what is wrong with responsible development? It provides jobs, it \nprovides a tax base, and it would provide a regular source of funding \nfor the university. To suggest that we cannot develop certain areas \nwithin strict accordance with environmental considerations I think is \nreally selling Alaska and America's can-do technology short. We can \nresponsibly develop these areas if given the opportunity.\n  In the interest of equity and fairness, I encourage my colleagues to \nreflect on the merits of treating Alaska in the same manner in which \nother States were treated when they came into the Union by adequately \nfunding their land-grant holdings so that they can meet the needs of \nthe higher education system; namely, the University of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I know we have a pending amendment. I \nwould like to speak on the whole issue of NATO enlargement at this time \nbecause I was not able to make my opening statement yesterday at the \nappointed time because we had the other amendment of which I was \ncosponsor with Senator Smith.\n  I believe this Senate will not vote on a more important matter than \nthe one before the Senate this week. The advocates of unfettered \nenlargement of NATO argue that we are expanding the frontiers of \nfreedom in Europe. It is true that freedom won the cold war. But the \nspirit of that freedom was the American commitment to defend Europe \nagainst the Soviet Union.\n  Therefore, at the heart of this debate is a simple question: Is the \nUnited States prepared to add countries to the list of those that we \npledge to defend as we would our own shores? In answering that \nquestion, the Senate should look to the future. Instead, many \nsupporters of the resolution have been talking about the past.\n  They have argued, not without merit, that expanding NATO is necessary \nto correct the map of Europe that was drawn incorrectly at the end of \nWorld War II. And many argue that it is right and just that these three \ncountries before us today become part of the West, since the West \nturned its back on them at Yalta more than half a century ago.\n  I think the Senate should be looking to the future to decide if this \nidea is the right one at this time. What are the future threats to \nTransatlantic security? Is expanding the alliance the best means of \naddressing those threats? Must the United States continue to be the \nglue that holds Europe together, as was necessary during the cold war?\n  This is an interesting time to consider expanding our military \nobligations. Today, the President has said the United States will have \nan open-ended commitment of thousands of U.S. troops in Bosnia. This \nmission has already cost the United States $8 billion. That is in \naddition to our NATO requirement, our commitment, our allotment. It \nappears likely that a major conflict will break out in the Serb \nprovince of Kosovo, raising the question whether U.S. troops will be \ndrawn deeper into the morass.\n  We have also learned just this week that the chief U.N. weapons \ninspector has declared that Iraq's Saddam Hussein has not complied with \nU.N. resolutions to destroy his biological and chemical weapons, so the \nallies may have to take military action to force him to comply. Again, \nthat will mean a disproportionate burden for the United States.\n  While we are adding new commitments, our military readiness is in \ndecline. Last year, the military had its worst recruiting year since \n1979. The Army failed to meet its objective to recruit infantry \nsoldiers, the single most important specialty of the Army. At the \nNational Training Center, where our troops go for advanced training, \nunits rotating in typically come with a 60-percent shortage in \nmechanics and a 50-percent shortage in infantry. These are often due to \nthe fact that these personnel are deployed abroad for missions such as \nBosnia, so advance training is suffering.\n  This year, more than 350 Air Force pilots have turned down the \n$60,000 bonuses they would have received to remain in the cockpit \nanother 5 years. A 29-percent acceptance rate for the bonus compares \nwith 59 percent last year and 81 percent in 1995.\n  Recently, a lack of critical parts for F-16 aircraft forced two \nfighter squadrons in Italy to cannibalize grounded aircraft to ensure \nthey can continue to conduct the NATO peace enforcement mission over \nBosnia.\n  Mr. President, these are just some of the indicators that show our \nmilitary is being stretched too thin. The fact is, these defense cuts \nthat we have made over the last few years of almost 50 percent have put \nour security at risk. This has been made worse by the diversion of U.S. \nresources and readiness in Bosnia and elsewhere.\n\n  In the midst of all this, the President presents the Senate with a \nproposal to expand NATO to include three new countries without first \nanswering such questions as what is the mission of a post-cold war \nNATO? The Senate has been put in a dilemma. On one side, we have \ncolleagues who strongly support the resolution of ratification and \noppose conditions and reservations that any of us may wish to add.\n  Throughout this debate, I have heard supporters say that the proposal \nto add these new members is moral and just and needs no further \nthought. We have been told that the United States owes these countries \nmembership in NATO, and it has been implied that to question this \nassumption is to question the very merits of the cold war and NATO's \nrole in winning that role.\n  Many of us who have reservations about this proposal are the \nstrongest supporters of NATO--I certainly am--and our American \nleadership in the alliance is also very important. I think NATO is the \nbest defense alliance that has ever been put together in the history of \nthe world. I want to make sure we preserve it, which is why I am \nquestioning some of the assumptions about enlargement that are not \nbased on any facts that we have seen and which have been brought up at \nthe North Atlantic Council or in the U.S. Senate.\n  There are many other places in the world where only the United States \ncan and will lead. I cherish the role that NATO played in winning the \ncold war, and it is because of that commitment to support NATO that I \ntake the ramifications of enlargement so seriously.\n  Many of us with reservations want to see the United States take its \nfair place in the world and assume its fair share of the \nresponsibility. But we do not think we should be involved in every \nregional conflict, dissipating our strength and endangering our role as \na superpower, a superpower capable of responding where no one else can \nor will. This doctrine was set in this country as far back as John \nQuincy Adams, who said to the American people that we will be tempted \nto go out and right every wrong, but if we do, we will dissipate our \nstrength and we will no longer be effective.\n  On the other side of the dilemma is the failure of the President to \nnegotiate conditions that address U.S. costs and the heavy burden for \nEuropean security that we already bear. He promised the three countries \nunder consideration--all of whom are worthy countries--that their \nadmission into the alliance was a fait accompli.\n  But too many issues remain open, and it has been left to the full \nSenate the responsibility, a responsibility unsuited to a legislative \nbody, I might\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\nadd, to address the mission of NATO and what the criteria for new \nmembership should be. I, for one, believe it may even be premature for \nthe Senate to be considering the question. While the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee has held a number of hearings on NATO enlargement \nduring this Congress, several matters have not been yet thoroughly \naired. For example, we still await a strategic rationale for an \nexpanded NATO from the President. What will NATO's future mission be? \nWhat will be the role in executing that mission?\n  The resolution before the Senate requires the President to report on \nthese matters within 6 months of our approval of NATO enlargement. I \ncan think of no better example of putting the cart before the horse. If \nwe approve that sequence, the Senate is, in effect, saying it agrees \nwith the President that we need to expand NATO, but we haven't decided \nwhy. It seems to me the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services \nCommittee, and even the Intelligence Committee, should have the \nrationale from the administration now, not in 6 months.\n\n  There are other issues that need further discussion. On January 16 of \nthis year, the Clinton administration signed a security charter with \nLithuania, Latvia, and Estonia that raises important questions: What \nare we committed to do in this charter? Have we given these countries a \nsecurity guarantee? Why have no other NATO members signed the Baltic \ncharter? I just think we need to discuss this in the context of where \nwe are going with NATO over the long-term.\n  The Senator from Virginia has introduced an amendment to take a 3-\nyear time-out after this first phase of enlargement so that we can \nbegin to consider these important issues without the pressure of \nadditional countries that would be waiting on the doorstep with \nadmission promised to them. This would permit us to discuss additional \nmembership on the merits, rather than because of personalities.\n  A new development since the last Foreign Relations Committee on NATO \nenlargement is the violence in the southern province of Kosovo. It is \nvery important that we consider the impact this could have on the U.S. \nand her allies. I think these issues need to be addressed if we are \ngoing to look at what NATO is and what everyone in NATO will agree it \nshould be.\n  There are other issues. How much will it cost? I will speak in \ngreater detail later, because there will be an amendment on cost. But \nno one knows how much it is going to cost. Estimates that vary from a \nfew million to $125 billion are not credible. It is impossible to say \nthat we know what the cost to the United States will be. A range of a \nfew million to $125 billion cannot be taken seriously.\n  I am also concerned about the chances we have of importing into the \nalliance ethnic, border, and religious disputes that have riven Europe \nfor centuries. I will have an amendment in that regard.\n  After looking at the underlying resolution and the Kyl amendment that \nwas passed yesterday, which could be interpreted--I hope it isn't--as \ndrawing us into one of those ethnic conflicts, my amendment will say \nthat we want NATO to determine a border and ethnic dispute resolution \nprocess before we have to make a decision on what our role will be, so \nthat there will be no question of what process will be followed to make \npeace, and so that it will not rise to the level of common defense \nnecessities for the United States.\n  The American people cannot believe that this U.S. Senate would act on \na resolution that would draw U.S. troops into harm's way for an ethnic \nconflict that has been boiling in Europe for a hundred years if there \nis not a U.S. security interest involved.\n  Opponents of my proposal will say that that will weaken U.S. \ninfluence in NATO, but I don't understand that concern. We should \ncertainly be confident enough in our leadership that we would be able \nto discuss candidly with our allies the limits of our involvement in a \nparochial dispute.\n  Mr. President, the resolution before us is far from a finished \nproject. Many of us who do not serve on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and would like to support the resolution, particularly as it \napplies to the three countries, good countries, that are doing the \nright thing toward democracy and a free market. But we do believe too \nmuch has been left out. It is not right to say that this resolution \ncannot be improved. There are several good proposals that will be \nintroduced in the Senate, which we will have a chance to debate and \nvote on, which would make this resolution one that all of us can \nsupport in good conscience.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider each amendment on its merits and not \nbased on a preconceived notion that this resolution needs no refinement \nand that any change would somehow be a bad change. The Senate has a \nconstitutional responsibility to express its will on international \ntreaties. That is a double responsibility when we are talking about the \npotential of U.S. troops going into a conflict in which they could lose \ntheir lives.\n\n  The Senate's responsibility in the Constitution is to advise and \nconsent, not just consent. Mr. President, our responsibility in the \nConstitution is every bit as important and clear as is the President's \nresponsibility. The signers of our Declaration of Independence and the \nwriters of our Constitution came from a historical point in which they \nhad a king who declared war and also executed that war. They \nspecifically rejected the idea of one person having all the power. They \ndispersed the power because they wanted it to be a well-debated and \ndifficult decision to send U.S. troops into harm's way.\n  Mr. President, our founders were right. It is the Senate's \nresponsibility to meet their test of advice and consent when our troops \nand our American security is at stake. I hope we can make this \nresolution one that all of us can proudly support, one that has \nconditions that are responsible in the stewardship of the security of \nthe United States. That is our responsibility under the Constitution, \nand that is what we must do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will discuss today the Senate \nImmigration Subcommittee's plans for a series of hearings on reform of \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I outlined my agenda as the \nincoming chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration. During that \ndiscussion, I noted that the time had perhaps come to consider \nfundamental reform of the INS. In particular, I raised the question as \nto whether an agency charged with both policing our borders and \nproviding services to those seeking to come here legally and become \ncitizens could perform either mission well.\n  Nothing I have observed since that time has persuaded me that these \nconcerns were misplaced. To the contrary, the problems I have observed \nwith the Service's functioning leave me persuaded that the current \nstructure simply does not work. I also remain of the view that \nsplitting responsibility for INS's different missions is an important \npart of the solution.\n  In my view, Mr. President, we must take a hard look at all aspects of \nthe current INS structure. Right now, for example, the distribution of \npolicymaking authority between headquarters and field offices seems \nhaphazard, at best. There also seems to be almost no mechanism for \nimplementing priorities and holding workers responsible for failing to \ndo so. INS's bureaucratic culture appears to tolerate and almost expect \nfailure on too many occasions.\n  I want to spend a few minutes setting forth some examples of these \nrather serious problems.\n  Most people are, by now, familiar with the story of ``Citizenship \nU.S.A.,'' how what began as a laudable effort to reduce the backlog of \nlegal immigrants waiting to become Americans ended up sacrificing the \nintegrity of the naturalization process, leaving a bitter aftertaste to \nwhat should have been the joyous experience of becoming a citizen of \nthis great country. In the\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\ncourse of that effort, thousands of criminal background checks were not \ncompleted, leading to the naturalization of people who had committed \ndisqualifying crimes.\n  As a result of the program's deficiencies, INS is already working to \nrevoke the citizenship of 369 immigrants and is considering action on \nalmost 6,000 other cases.\n  Revocation of citizenship, however, is properly an onerous procedure, \nconsiderably more difficult than denying it in the first place to those \nthe law says should not receive it.\n  This particular episode has already received considerable attention, \nand I will not go through the details again.\n  What has received less attention, however, and is in some ways even \nmore worrisome, is what this episode revealed about serious \ndeficiencies in all aspects of INS operations.\n  To begin with, many of the flaws that produced improper \nnaturalizations in Citizenship USA had been identified years before, \nbut gone unaddressed.\n  A 1994 report of the inspector general's office identified two major \nproblems with INS's background check process.\n  First, it found that the INS did not verify that fingerprints \nsubmitted with applications actually belonged to the applicant.\n  Second, the INS failed to ensure that background checks were \ncompleted by the FBI.\n  A General Accounting Office study conducted the same year confirmed \nthese findings. Yet the problems went unaddressed for two years.\n  In November of 1996, after several front page stories reported on \nimproper naturalizations, the INS Commissioner finally ordered that no \nnaturalizations go forward without a completed FBI background check and \nunless new, more careful procedures for processing background checks \nhad been followed.\n  In an audit completed five months after that directive was issued, \nhowever, Peat Marwick found that only 1 out of 23 INS offices was \nactually complying with this policy. 7 offices were only marginally \ncompliant, and 15 were not complying with the new procedures at all. It \nwas only a few months ago that KPMG and INS were finally able to say \nthat the new procedures were being followed.\n  Allegations of fraud in testing also predate Citizenship USA.\n  Indictments were handed down against 20 defendants in California this \npast January. But investigations into these allegations have been \nongoing for several years and the INS received complaints as early as \n1992 that should have alerted the agency to the potential for serious \ncriminal fraud.\n  Criminal cases may take considerable time to develop and I am not \ncriticizing anyone for taking the time necessary before bringing these \nparticular prosecutions.\n  My point, however, is that INS took no separate action to close the \nserious loopholes these allegations pointed toward until this year, the \nday before I chaired a hearing to look into the issue.\n  Mr. President, Peat Marwick also conducted a separate audit of all \nnaturalizations done between August 1995 and September 1996. It \nconcluded that we can be confident that naturalization was proper in \nonly 8.6% of the 1 million cases naturalized during that period.\n  The other 91.4% of cases either contained insufficient documentation \nto support a proper decision or (in 3.7% of the cases) involved an \noutright improper grant of citizenship.\n  Thus, in addition to the 3.7% of cases improperly naturalized, we \nsimply do not know whether almost 90% of those granted citizenship \nduring that period met the requirements for naturalization.\n  It may well be that the vast majority of cases with insufficient \ndocumentation were decided properly.\n  But the American people deserve to know that citizenship is being \nconferred only on deserving people, just as the vast majority of legal \nimmigrants who come here to play by the rules and make a contribution \ndeserve to gain citizenship without a cloud of doubt hanging over its \npropriety.\n  Unfortunately, these audits indicate that INS simply does not keep \ncomplete and accurate naturalization files and cannot even locate many \nfiles that should be in its possession.\n  I have also heard numerous tales of fingerprints being taken and lost \nrepeatedly, of inconsistent accounts being given about the status of \npeople's files, and of an inability to get resolution on the simple \nquestion of a person's status.\n  Under these circumstances, Mr. President, it comes as no surprise \nthat the backlogs Citizenship USA was designed to address are now back \nwith a vengeance. As many as 1.8 million people are caught up in the \nnation's naturalization backlog and in some places the wait for \ncitizenship can last up to two years.\n  Press reports suggest that INS officials have been attributing this \nslowdown to new procedures put in place in response to Congressional \npressure. But when the subcommittee ranking member and I asked whether \nthe new fingerprinting process might cause delays, the INS official in \ncharge of developing them assured us that they would not.\n  Unfortunately, naturalization is only one area where the INS has not \nperformed either its enforcement or its service mission adequately.\n  For example, INS does not seem able to figure out how to deport \ncriminal aliens directly after they have finished serving their \nsentences, and hence claims it cannot detain all of them pending \ndeportation.\n  At the same time, INS seems to detain many people with strong asylum \nclaims in the same cells as hardened criminals. Who is detained, who is \nnot, and for how long seems to depend less on the person's particular \nequities as the district in which he or she is found.\n  When I first raised the issue of fundamental INS restructuring and a \nsplit of its missions, I was not sure the idea would be seriously \nconsidered. But, as more problems have come to light, people \nincreasingly seem agreed that reform is needed.\n  The key issue is rapidly becoming not whether there will be a \nrestructuring but what form it should take in order to solve INS \nproblems.\n  The latest adherent of this view is the Administration. A few weeks \nago, I received a letter from Attorney General Janet Reno, Assistant to \nthe President for Domestic Policy Bruce Reed and Director of Management \nand Budget Franklin Raines, laying out the Administration's proposals \non the matter.\n  This letter acknowledges INS problems and their seriousness. The \nAdministration also recognizes that one major source of these problems \nis INS' dual role as enforcer of our immigration laws and provider of \nimmigration and citizenship services.\n  Whether the Administration's proposed remedy is adequate to the task, \nhowever, remains to be seen.\n  The Administration proposes to retain the current INS and have it \nperform all its current functions. Its plan would then untangle INS' \noverlapping and confusing organizational structure, replacing it with \ntwo clear chains of command, one for enforcement and the other for \nservice provision.\n  I will study this proposal closely. But I also will look at \nalternatives.\n  In particular, while separating lines of authority into enforcement \nand service is a good start, I am not convinced that it will suffice to \nallow officials to pursue each mission with sufficient enthusiasm and \nenergy.\n  I also worry that, by retaining the current agency, even with \nsignificant restructuring, we may end up retaining the bureaucratic \nculture of toleration for failure that we must end.\n  Finally, I think everyone, including the Administration, understands \nthat no reform plan could command the support necessary to carry the \nday without careful scrutiny of all relevant problems, the means the \nplan would use to address them, and the manner in which the plan would \nwork in practice.\n  These are issues I intend to address through the series of oversight \nhearings I will launch shortly after the next recess.\n  Because I believe this is a serious issue, I do not think it is \nnecessarily one that can be resolved this Congress.\n  But I hope these hearings will help us formulate legislation this \nsession that can serve as a starting point for further discussions. I \nlook forward to working with all interested parties in this important \nendeavor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is always interesting in the morning to \nstart your day by reading the newspapers. I did that as well this \nmorning. I think that most of the things that we read are pretty \naccurate and pretty correct. But every now and then I think what we \nread, while it may be accurate and correct, doesn't tell the entire \nstory. I think this morning, if you look at the papers around the city, \nmost of the headlines that I saw were accurate in the sense that they \ntalked about Social Security and the condition of Social Security. The \nstories in the press this morning dealt with that. That was all based \non the recent Social Security report.\n  It talked about the good news dealing with Social Security. I look at \nthe headlines in the Washington Post, ``Forecast Brightens for Social \nSecurity.'' The Wall Street Journal headline was ``Economy gives Social \nSecurity a Reprieve.'' A New York Times article, ``Surging Economy is \nLifting Social Security, U.S. finds.'' The headline in the USA Today \nwas ``Social Security Wins Three-Year Reprieve.''\n  All of that is very accurate. All of it is very, very true. All of it \nis based on the Social Security trustees' annual report that they give \nto Congress and to the American people and to the President of the \nUnited States.\n  If you just read those headlines, you will say, ``Well, things are \nreally good in the area of Social Security.'' The good news, I think, \nwas based on the fact that the trustees' report pointed out that the \npayroll tax that we pay every month will be able to cover Social \nSecurity benefits through the year 2013 as opposed to the early \nprojections that the payroll tax is only going to be enough to pay for \nbenefits through the year 2012. They say that when you combine the \npayroll tax and the interest paid on the reserves that are in the \nSocial Security trust fund, that would be enough money to cover the \nbenefits to retirees through the year 2021 instead of just through the \nyear 2019.\n  They further point out that it is good news that the Social Security \ntrust fund, when you add everything up, will not be depleted until the \nyear 2032 instead of the year 2029. All of that is good news. The \nPresident correctly spoke about the fact that we added 3 more years to \nthe Social Security program because of the strength of the economy \nbasically. But the reason I take the floor today is to point out ``the \nrest of the story,'' as the words go, in other areas, because there is \nanother part of the story that didn't seem to get the attention that I \nthink it should have gotten from the press, because the stories don't \nhighlight the other trust fund that I think is equally important and \nwas also released yesterday by the trustees' report. The other trust \nfund that I am referring to is the Medicare trust fund, the Medicare \npart A trust fund, which basically pays the expense of 38 million \nAmericans going to the hospital to receive health care.\n\n  But the story that is only sort of mentioned as a footnote is that \nnot only have we not run a surplus in the Medicare trust fund since \n1995, including deficit spending of $9.3 billion last year, they did \nnot point out that the part A trust fund is going broke 2 years earlier \nthan we had anticipated just this past January.\n  What the report says is that instead of going broke in the year 2010, \nit is going to be depleted in the year 2008. And the numbers I just \ncited for Social Security, talking about 2032 and 2013, those are dates \nthat are at least a little bit further out. But the report said that we \nare going to be going broke in the Medicare trust fund 2 years earlier \nthan they had in January. I think that is incredibly significant.\n  Prior to the balanced budget bill that we passed last year, the \nhospital insurance fund, which pays for Medicare hospital coverage, was \nestimated to become insolvent in the year 2001, just around the corner. \nSo last Congress we struggled and did what I call the ``SOS'' approach, \n``same old, same old,'' by essentially reducing reimbursements to \ndoctors and hospitals. And particularly in addition to that, what we \ndid to sort of save the program in Medicare was to transfer home health \ncare from part A to part B, at least we transferred part of it. We \ntransferred about 60 percent of it, which amounts to about $174 billion \nover the next 10 years. We just took it out of this column, which was \nhaving a lot of trouble being paid for by the payroll tax and moved it \nover to part B, which is 25 percent paid for by a premium, and then the \n75 percent is paid for by the General Treasury of the country out of \ngeneral revenues.\n  So what we did, we put a Band-Aid on Medicare. We tried to save it \nfrom going busted in the year 2001 and we extended it out to the year \n2008.\n  It is interesting that the Congressional Budget Office earlier this \nyear had said, well, we thought the trust fund was going to be solvent \nuntil the year 2010. But now we have this new report just out \nyesterday, brand new, overlooked generally by the press, in my opinion, \nthat said the Medicare trust fund was going to be insolvent not in the \nyear 2010, but that the trust fund will be depleted in the year 2008. \nSo unlike Social Security, where people are saying it is getting better \nthan we first thought, Medicare is getting worse, and it is getting \nworse more quickly than was originally anticipated even in January of \nthis year.\n  We look at the year 2021 as the key year in Social Security because \nthat is the year when you add taxes and the interest in the trust fund. \nIt will no longer be enough to cover Social Security benefits. That is \nthe year we all talk about Social Security, that we are not going to \nhave enough money to pay benefits--when you add money coming in plus \nthe interest on that money, we are not going to have enough to pay the \nbenefits in the year 2002.\n  I want to tell my colleagues that we passed that point in Medicare a \nlong time ago. Medicare is already passed the point where the money \ncoming in and the interest on the money coming in is not enough to pay \nfor the benefits. We passed that in 1995 when the accumulated taxes and \ninterest in Medicare were no longer enough to pay the benefits of \nMedicare. So we are not talking the year 2021 as in Social Security. We \nare talking about we already passed that point when it comes to \nMedicare. That is how much more difficulty the Medicare system is in \nthan the Social Security system. We have been running a deficit in the \nprogram since 1995. Last year, it was $8.3 billion more in benefits \nthan we had in money coming in and the interest in the trust fund. It \nis obvious we cannot continue that.\n\n  I would like to quote a couple of the other highlights from the \nreport which I think are significant. The trustees' report says that to \nbring the health insurance Medicare part A trust fund into balance over \nthe next 25 years under their intermediate assumptions would require \neither that outlays be further reduced by 18 percent, or that taxes be \nincreased by 22 percent or some combination of the two over that \nperiod. That is, they say, ``the current HI payroll tax of 1.54 percent \nwould have to be immediately raised to about 1.81 percent or the \nbenefits reduced by a comparable amount.''\n  I haven't heard anyone in my State of Louisiana that I have the \nprivilege of representing telling me to raise their payroll tax by 22 \npercent, and I have not heard a single person come in and say, \n``Senator, would you please cut my benefits by 18 percent.'' More of \nwhat I hear is, ``Don't increase my taxes and don't decrease my \nbenefits.''\n  But I will say to all of our colleagues that that is not an option. \nThat is not an option. The report further says that prior to the \nBalanced Budget Act of last year, the part A expenditures were \nestimated to grow at an average rate of about 8 percent a year in \nMedicare. From 1998 to the year 2002, what we did last year in the \nbalanced budget amendment reduces annual growth to an estimated average \nof 3 percent. Thereafter, however, expenditure growth is expected to \nreturn to the level of about 7-percent increases every year in Medicare \ncosts.\n  The report further says that ``the balanced budget provisions are \nestimated to substantially reduce the gap between income and \nexpenditures over the next 5 years, but with a return to steadily \nincreasing deficits in the year 2003 and later. After 2002, the gap \nbetween income and expenditures will\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\nwiden steadily so that by the year 2007 there would be a $26 billion \nshortfall in that year alone.''\n  Those are very sobering statistics. Unfortunately, I think they are \nvery accurate. I have long been very concerned that we in the Congress \nand the public have this sort of false sense of security that because \nevery year I get my Medicare benefits and I still get the coverage I \nneed, there really is not a problem; that the people who are talking \nabout a problem are sort of like Chicken Little who ran around the \ncountry saying, ``The sky is falling. The sky is falling.'' It never \nfell, and they didn't believe Chicken Little any longer. I think people \ndon't believe Congress anymore. If you look at the headlines I talked \nabout, I think they miss the point about Medicare which is much more \nimmediate. It is around the corner, good news and bad news. Good news \nthat Social Security is in pretty decent shape. We made 3 more years \nextra out of the program. But the bad news and the very legitimate \nconcern we should have is that Medicare is predicted to go insolvent \neven earlier than before, 2 years earlier than we had previously \npredicted.\n  So I hope that more people will take a look at the trustees' report. \nIt is a good report. It is a sobering report and one that every \nAmerican, whether they are on Medicare or whether their parents are on \nMedicare or their grandparents are on Medicare, should take a look at \nand know that there must be a growing awareness among all people in our \ncountry that if we are going to continue to have the greatest system of \nhealth care for America's seniors, we have to start making decisions \nnow and recommendations now if we are going to prevent what this report \nsays is going to happen in the not too distant future.\n  The trustees' report noted--I will conclude with this:\n\n       More far-reaching measures will be needed to prevent the \n     trust fund's depletion as the baby boom generation starts \n     reaching age 65 and starts receiving their benefits. . . . In \n     this regard, the work of the Bipartisan Commission will be of \n     critical importance to the Administration, the Congress and \n     the American public.\n\n  I could not agree more. I commend this very sobering report to all \nAmericans, because it, indeed, is a wake-up call as to what this \nCongress needs to be seriously considering in the very short period of \ntime we have left.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3755-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3756-S3782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROTOCOLS TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY OF 1949 ON ACCESSION OF POLAND, \n                    HUNGARY, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the treaty.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     executive amendment numbered 2317.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution, insert the \n     following:\n\n     NEGOTIATION WITH ALLIES REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A \n                   PROCESS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES AMONG OR BETWEEN \n                   ALLIES.\n\n       (A) Prior to the first deposit of any of the United States \n     instruments of ratification of any of the Protocols, the \n     United States representative at the North Atlantic Council \n     will introduce at the NAC a proposal for consideration by all \n     allies and aimed at establishing a process for dispute \n     resolution among allies. The proposal shall be limited to \n     addressing those disputes--\n       (i) between or among allies that are within the collective \n     security purview of the NATO alliance and address territorial \n     or other such disputes within the alliance's area of \n     operations and responsibility, and;\n       (ii) in response to which at least one disputant has \n     credibly threatened the use of military force.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It \nrequires the U.S. Representative to NATO to make a proposal to our \nallies regarding the resolution of disputes that fall short of article \nV conflicts.\n  Before discussing what my amendment does, I would like to say what it \ndoes not do. It does not require that NATO adopt a dispute resolution \nprocess, although I think it should. It does not tell the President \nwhat his ambassador to NATO should propose, although I hope the \nadministration will take the opportunity to provide meaningful \nleadership in this area. It does not treat new members of NATO any \ndifferently from current members. In fact, that is the premise of the \namendment, that there be a dispute resolution process that applies to \nall members, current and prospective, so there are no surprises should \na dispute arise.\n  I think it would show strong leadership to anticipate that there \nmight be disputes in Europe where we have seen disputes of varying \nkinds over the course of history. But to have a dispute resolution \nprocess that is not looking at two particular countries and individual \npersonalities, but rather to have a dispute resolution process so \neveryone knows what the ground rules are and everyone would comply with \nthose, having had a say in the way they are drawn up.\n  Why is this needed? Simply put, because the history of the 20th \ncentury demonstrates clearly that great conflicts can arise from small \ndisputes. If we are going to expand NATO to include an ever-growing \nnumber of new countries, it is simply folly to pretend that no such \ndisputes will ever occur within the alliance, or that they would not \naffect the alliance in its ability to stay together.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service assessment of a \nnumber of sources, there are at least 11 ongoing disputes in Europe \nthat have a moderate or high potential for violence or escalation. Some \nof those are listed behind me.\n  For example, three involve Albania. While Albania is not being \nconsidered for membership in NATO today, many have said that it should \nbe considered in the next wave of new members. So I think if we set \nsomething in place now, we are not saying that it would apply just to \nAlbania; we are not making it personal. But what we are saying is \n``let's recognize the obvious. NATO currently has no process to \npeacefully resolve disputes, which will only grow in number as the \nalliance enlarges.'' We have had a conflict involving Greece and Turkey \nfor most of the history of the alliance.\n  Opponents to my amendment would say that this proves that we don't \nneed a dispute resolution process, because we can handle future \nconflicts the way we have handled the Greece-Turkey conflict. Mr. \nPresident, we have not handled the Greece-Turkey conflict. We have \navoided handling it. In 1974, these two supposed NATO allies almost \nwent to war over the island of Cyprus. That conflict continues today. \nEach country regularly threatens the other with war over sea and \nairspace violations, weapons proliferation, and the treatment of each \nother's compatriots in Cyprus.\n  If the best that my opponents can say of my amendment is to point to \nGreece and Turkey as proof that we don't need it, then there really can \nbe no opposition to it at all. The fact is, the cold war imposed a \ndiscipline on the alliance that probably did keep such conflicts in \ncheck. That discipline is no longer in place. If we do not at least \ndiscuss a process by which NATO can peaceably resolve disputes, then \nthe alliance will lose credibility as we turn a blind eye to a growing \nnumber of disputes similar to that of Greece and Turkey. Such a process \nmight even have ended that conflict, permitting both of those countries \nto move on and focus on their own strengths and their own economies.\n  In a letter to the President last summer, I joined with nearly two \ndozen Senate colleagues to raise this and a number of other questions \nregarding NATO enlargement. We asked the President about the importance \nof border-dispute resolutions and should we\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\nnot be anticipating this so we could resolve them, not in the heat of a \ndispute, but in a vacuum of such disputes so we would be able to go \nforward in an objective way.\n  In his response to us, the President said, in effect, that NATO \ndoesn't need a dispute resolution process because the European \ncountries have themselves established a number of bilateral treaties \nregarding their borders. But we are changing the makeup of NATO. We can \ncertainly anticipate what more members--many with long-standing \ndisputes, ethnic disputes, border disputes--will do to the alliance. We \nmust go in with our eyes wide open and prepare for some potential \nescalation of conflicts or new conflicts to arise as we add new and \ndiverse members.\n  My amendment simply requires that before NATO expansion goes into \neffect, the U.S. Representative at NATO should open discussion about \ndispute resolution. My amendment restricts the issues that should be \nconsidered in such a proposal, and it certainly restricts it to \nterritorial and security matters so as not to permit an agricultural \ncrisis, for example, to trigger a NATO process.\n  My amendment further requires that any U.S. proposal be aimed at \ndisputes in which at least one of the parties has threatened the use of \nmilitary force. That is it. There is no reason to be concerned that \nthis proposal is going to do something drastic. It is not directing any \noutcome, but it is saying we must raise this question. Let's talk about \nit when there is not the heat of a crisis.\n  Opponents to it, though, say that it will dilute U.S. influence in \nNATO.  How could U.S. leadership be weakened by our representative in \nNATO raising a topic that the European countries themselves believe is \nso important that they have signed 12 treaties on the matter already? \nIt is because of our leadership in NATO that this could happen in a way \nthat I think would provide stability in the alliance, and I don't know \nwhy it would even be resisted.\n\n  Why would we be thinking of adding new members to this alliance if we \ndidn't have enough confidence in our leadership to know that we could \nopen for discussion such an issue and that it would be good for \neveryone to address? It seems to me that the argument about U.S. \nleadership being diluted is much more relevant to the question of \nwhether there should be new members, rather than whether all members \nshould acknowledge their potential border problems.\n  I have had conversations with foreign ministers and ambassadors from \neach of the three prospective NATO members. They have told me that as \nlong as any dispute resolution process applies to all members evenly, \nthen they support the idea.\n  I also spoke with former U.S. representatives to NATO and to other \nEuropean capitals. They, too, have told me that NATO should discuss \nthis matter. Former NATO Ambassador Bob Hunter has said that he thought \nthis was a positive approach. President Reagan's Ambassador to the \nU.S.S.R., Jack Matlock, said--and he is, I would say, a leading \nauthority on European security--that, ``NATO has no policy on how to \ndeal with ethnic unrest, and they need it badly.'' This is a quote \ndirectly from Ambassador Matlock, who is a seasoned and career \ndiplomat.\n  (Ms. Collins assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yesterday, we adopted an amendment that could be \ninterpreted to endorse NATO's role in responding to ethnic or religious \ndisputes. If it is legitimate that NATO be involved in ethnic or \nreligious disputes, why would it not be equally legitimate that NATO \ndiscuss a process to avoid or resolve such disputes?\n  My amendment would initiate that discussion. I had much stronger \nlanguage in an earlier amendment that I was considering, but I have \ntalked to many Members of the other side, I have talked to many \nAmbassadors and people who have dealt with the security of Europe for a \nlonger time than I have, and they felt that it was too strong to give \ndirections. So I have pulled back that language. But I think to open \nthe discussion, to open our eyes to the fact that any time we add \nmembers to an alliance, we should certainly expect that there would \nthen be more potential for disagreements, I think that will be a \nresponsible approach to our responsibility in the Senate.\n  I hope my colleagues will accept this amendment. It is one of the \namendments that I think would strengthen the responsible role we play, \nit would strengthen U.S. leadership, and, most of all, Madam President, \nit would strengthen the NATO alliance to anticipate problems and have a \nprocess by which we could address them. What could be more responsible \nand more reasonable than that?\n  I do hope we can adopt this amendment. It will be one of the \namendments that I think would help me be able to vote in good \nconscience for this resolution that is before us today.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nwith respect to the Moynihan amendment regarding the EU, the Senate \nproceed to that amendment at 12 noon on Thursday and there be 1 hour \nfor debate equally divided; that following the conclusion or yielding \nback of time, the amendment be laid aside and Senator Warner be \nrecognized to offer an amendment relating to a 3-year pause on which \nthere will be 2 hours for debate equally divided; that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on, \nor in relation to, the Moynihan amendment, to be followed by a vote on, \nor in relation to, the Warner amendment, following 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided in the usual form prior to each vote.\n  Madam President, I point out that this has the consent of the \nDemocratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2317\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, while my colleague from the \nDemocratic side is getting prepared to respond to the Hutchison \namendment, I will simply say that it is painful to me to not be on her \nside of an issue. I am one of Senator Hutchison's greatest fans, but I \nsimply must oppose her amendment simply because NATO has for so long \nbeen a place where contending European countries have come together in \na common purpose and not pursuing national agendas for their common \ndefense. There are many places, many forums, in which dispute \nresolutions currently take place, and to turn NATO into something that \nis no longer a place for common defense but a place for nationalistic \nresolution I think would do a grave disservice, even an undoing of \nNATO, and dissipate its strength.\n  I plead with my colleagues, as appealing as this amendment sounds on \nthe surface, I think it would be very hurtful to the future of Europe. \nI point out that whether or not you can point to Greece and Turkey, I \nsuggest that NATO membership of those two countries has caused them not \nto come to greater blows in the recent past and I hope will yet be an \ninfluence for them not to come to blows in the future.\n  I think, clearly, NATO has served a historic purpose, in its informal \nway, of contributing to Prussian-French rapprochement and healing. The \nsame can be said as between Britain and Spain, between Spain and \nPortugal. Many of the boundary disputes that have raged in Europe for \ncenturies have begun to dissipate, in large part, because of NATO and \nbecause it brings all of these countries together in a common purpose \nand for the good of all of Europe.\n  Madam President, I thank you for the time and yield the floor to my \ncolleague.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield for a colloquy?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I will.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I wonder if the Senator from Oregon is aware that all \nwe are doing is asking our NATO Ambassador to bring this up for \ndiscussion.\n  Isn't it a responsible thing to at least bring it up, start talking \nabout what\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\nwould be in a border dispute resolution? And then if there was not a \nconsensus, of course, it could be rejected. What could be wrong with \njust asking that it be brought up for discussion among our allies?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. To my friend from Texas, I do not suppose in the \nabstract there is anything wrong with anything being discussed in NATO. \nBut I would simply fear that we are changing its complexion, turning \nits focus away from a collective alliance for security and into a place \nfor dispute resolutions.\n  I think, those European countries, as I have discussed this issue \nwith them, they have said to me, well, this is the place we come \ntogether, not the place where we come to divide again. And I think they \nwould quickly say, let us leave this to the United Nations, let us \nleave this to the European Union, let us leave it to other bodies where \nthese kinds of resolutions can be sought.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I just say to my friend from Oregon, we left Bosnia \nto the United Nations. My friend from Oregon, we left Bosnia to the \nUnited Nations. If we had the ability to have something in place by \nwhich we could have had a process long before Dayton to discuss these \nissues and perhaps bring them to the table together for a resolution, I \ndo not think we would be in a potentially unending commitment in \nBosnia.\n  I just ask if a border dispute resolution process would not be part \nof collective security, if it would not help us prevent conflict rather \nthan always reacting when things are already exploding before our eyes?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It is a point to be debated. I think it would be \nduplicative at best and at worst could be very harmful to the unity \nthat NATO by its dynamics currently creates.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I find myself once again in an uncomfortable position. I \nadmire and like my friend from Texas. And maybe she is not, but I am \nlooking for something to agree with her on, but this is not the one.\n  She has been, as she always is, persistent and effective in making \nher case. She and I have been sort of at this dispute about dispute \nresolutions privately and also in our official capacity of attending \nthe observer group meetings. And so here it is on the floor.\n  I just rise today to strongly oppose the amendment because its \nprescription, I think, is both unnecessary for NATO as an organization \nand, quite frankly, harmful--harmful--to continued U.S. leadership to \nthe alliance. Let me explain what I mean by that. And none of this will \ncome as any surprise to my friend. I do not expect to change her mind \nat all, but I do want to make the case why I think this is a bad idea.\n  It is unnecessary because the North Atlantic Council, which is now \nknown as the NAC, the principal political organ of NATO, is by its very \nnature already a dispute resolution mechanism. That is the place we \nmake decisions in NATO. All actions in the NAC--all of them--are taken \nby consensus, which comes, in almost every circumstance, after very \nlengthy formal and informal discussions among the 16 nations who are \nmembers of the NAC.\n  For example, all delegations to NATO are housed in the same \nheadquarters building in Brussels. Every working day there is a wide \nvariety of meetings among delegates and member countries. Some are \nbriefings; some are informal group meetings; and some are one-on-ones. \nEvery Tuesday, NATO ambassadors or so-called perm representatives meet \nin an informal luncheon, which is strictly an off-the-record luncheon. \nA lot is resolved there as well. The purpose of these luncheons is to \nwork out tough questions out of the glare of the press and publicity \nand to be able to be brutally candid with one another.\n  In addition, the North Atlantic Council holds a weekly formal meeting \nwhich is on the record. By that time, issues in dispute, in almost \nevery circumstance, have already been settled. As the alliance grew \nfrom 12 in 1949 to 16 in 1982, it has expanded its areas of common \nendeavor rather than retreated due to the inability of each to reach \nconsensus decisions. Even during the divisive Bosnia debate, which has \nbeen referenced here, when one ally favored the Serb position and \nanother the Muslim, the alliance still agreed to the largest historic \ncommitment leading to the Dayton peace implementation force.\n\n  This amendment notes that the North Atlantic Treaty does not provide \nfor a dispute resolution process by which members can resolve \ndifferences among themselves. As true as that statement is, it is also \nequally irrelevant. NATO has a remarkably good track record in \nresolving disputes among its members, or at least in previewing them \nand then preventing them from escalating into open conflict.\n  In fact, I think we ought to declare it the sense of the Congress \nthat NATO is to be congratulated for having aided immeasurably in \nhelping two of its members, France and Germany, to resolve their age-\nold antagonisms that caused two world wars in this century alone. That \ndid not need a formal dispute mechanism. That was a consequence of the \nway the NATO negotiations take place now among its members.\n  I think it should be the sense of the Congress that NATO is to be \ncongratulated, notwithstanding the comments of my friend from Texas, \nfor having prevented two members, Greece and Turkey, from going to war \non more than one occasion.\n  I am told my friend has indicated that that may have been the case in \nthe past, but no longer. The truth of the matter is, NATO is still \ndeeply involved in preventing the disagreement over Cyprus and the \nAegean, certain islands, the transfer of weapons. It is the real place \nwhere most of the resolution takes place, because those Greek generals \nand those Turkish generals and the Greek perm representative and the \nTurk perm representative, they pass each other in the corridor every \nday. They meet every day. They probably talk every day.\n  More recently, we ought to congratulate NATO for having integrated \nGermany so well with its neighbors so that the rest of Europe is now \ncomfortable with a larger united Germany. Up until 12 years ago, there \nwere as many people in the West as the East who were concerned about a \nunited Germany. There was as much talk among parliamentarians in the \nEast as the West about a united Germany--not a prospect in 1948, 1955, \n1965, 1975, and I would argue even 1985 that anyone was rushing to \nembrace on the continent.\n  Why did it go off so smoothly? NATO. NATO. More importantly, we ought \nto congratulate NATO, under American leadership, for having resolved \nall these disputes while assembling the most awesome defensive military \nalliance in history, one that no foe has dared to attack for 49 years.\n  The only change to the NAC as a result of the enlargement that is \nabout to take place with the addition of three new countries, the only \nchange will be the addition of their three perm representatives, of \ntheir generals, of their people in the same building at the same \nmeetings interfacing on the same questions.\n  Some may worry that they will carry their own hostilities with \nneighbors into the NAC. I would argue that not only is that not likely \nto happen, if past is prologue, they have put away those hostilities in \norder to be able to get into NATO.\n  NATO--just the prospect of membership to NATO has caused each of \nthose countries, in varying degrees with varying degrees of disputes \noutstanding, to settle those border disputes, to settle those ethnic \nrivalries. I mentioned half a dozen times on the floor I doubt whether \nanyone on this floor would have predicted 2 years ago, let alone 20 \nyears ago, that Romania would be accommodating a Hungarian minority or \nthat Poland would have settled all of its border disputes.\n  A President whom I personally admire and politically disagreed with \nbut my friend from Texas, I expect, politically and personally admired, \nRonald Reagan, used to say, ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' This \n``ain't'' broke. Trying to fix something that ``ain't'' broke is likely \nto damage it, in my opinion.\n  Each of the three candidate countries has recently concluded a \nbilateral agreement with its neighbors resolving any outstanding issues \nthat may lead\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\nto conflict, Poland with Germany, Poland with Ukraine, Poland with \nLithuania, Hungary with Slovakia, Hungary with Slovenia, Hungary with \nRomania, the Czech Republic with Germany, and now that they will be \nsitting at the same table, making the same profound decisions, dealing \nwith the same issues, again, if past is prologue, there is little to no \npossibility that concerns of my friend are likely to come to fruition.\n  Maybe most importantly, in my view, it would be extremely hard for \nthe U.S. leadership of the alliance to create a binding dispute \nresolution mechanism separate from the NAC, because that would mean \nrelinquishing what I thought was of concern to my friend from Texas, as \nwell as my friend from Virginia and my friend from New Hampshire, and \nall those who oppose enlargement.\n  What do they keep talking about? We are basically going to get \nourselves entangled with more people. We will get involved in a more \nunwieldy operation. We are going to be in a position where actions are \ntaken. The mere action of bringing them in will negatively impact their \nrelationships with Russia. This is going to cause friction within \nEurope because now some countries are left out and some countries are \nleft in, and it goes on and on and on. I respect their concerns.\n  But if you have those concerns, why would you now want to change the \norganization of which we are a member, where we can now veto anything \nNATO wants to do--anyone, anything. All we have to do in the NAC is \nsay, ``Sorry, no; we vote no, no,'' and it is done, finished, over. We \nlead the alliance.\n  Now I admit, we lead the alliance as a consequence of the size of our \nmilitary, the nature of our equipment, our command and control, and our \nphenomenal economic power. I acknowledge that. But we politically lead \nthe alliance, as well, not only for those reasons but because we have \nthe ability to stop anything we want.\n  Now, I ask my friends in this body, why would we, a noncontinental \npower who is, in fact, a European power, why do we want now to sign up \nas we enlarge NATO--and I respectfully predict that we are going to \nenlarge NATO. The vote will be overwhelming. We will enlarge NATO, in \nmy humble opinion. Now, why are we now going to say, look, we are going \nto have a new mechanism, a new mechanism, the equivalent of \nunilaterally giving up our most potent weapon politically; that is, \nthis new mechanism will say, hey, you know, if most of the European \ncountries want to do something we think is foolhardy and against our \ninterests, we have to submit to a binding resolution. And if, in fact, \nthe binding resolution results in a decision different from the one we \nhave taken, then we have one of two choices. We either go along and \nconsider it to be bad policy or we leave NATO--as I understand the \nresolution.\n  I think this would be the political equivalent to unilateral \ndisarmament, robbing ourselves of the final protection against any \nmischief, should it arise. I think this would inevitably erode American \nsupport for NATO itself as it comes to be perceived as a forum where \nAmerica does not lead but where America's influence has been self-\nrestrained.\n  Sandy Vershbow, our current U.S. Ambassador to NATO, recognizing this \nthreat, called me from Brussels a couple weeks ago to express his \nstrong opposition and fervent prayer, wanting me to assure him--which I \ncould not do--don't worry, this will not pass. He thinks, our present \nAmbassador to NATO, any such mechanism would be totally \ncounterproductive to American interests in NATO.\n\n  In remarks on this floor last month, the Senator from Texas likened \nher NATO dispute resolution mechanism to the National Labor Relations \nBoard. Mr. President, NATO is not the NLRB. I know she didn't mean it \nis. She was making a comparison of how the mechanism would function. \nBut NATO is an alliance that has protected the free world for 49 years. \nIt has worked well the way it is presently constructed. The United \nStates is a leader of that alliance, and it would be totally \nirrational, in my view, to squander that leadership by tampering with \nthe North Atlantic Council.\n  We heard yesterday from Senator Kyl, and from me, mainly from Senator \nKyl, about the strategic doctrine of NATO and what it would be in the \nfuture and what we were insisting on in this body. We can insist all we \nwant. We can instruct the President to vote any way, tell our NATO \nAmbassador to vote any way he wanted, and if, in fact, we are outvoted, \nit wouldn't matter, like it does now. We vote no now, it ends--done, \nfinished, over, no action. But if we submit to binding arbitration, \nwhat we say in this floor is diluted. So this also, in my view, dilutes \nour power, our responsibility as the body that is given the \nconstitutional responsibility to, as was stated by Professor Corwin in \nanother context, to struggle for the right to conduct American foreign \npolicy.\n  I say to my friends who are worried about dispute resolutions and \nborder disputes, right now I see my friend from Virginia is on the \nfloor again. Amazing how we attract one another to the floor these \ndays. My friend from Virginia, who knows a lot about NATO and the Armed \nServices Committee, has expressed concern about what NATO may get \ninvolved in in the future. I think he would be strongly opposed to this \nbecause right now if NATO countries decided to get involved in a border \ndispute in Europe that we did not want to be involved in, under this \noperation being suggested, we would have to go or leave NATO. We would \nnot be given a choice. If we lose in binding arbitration, we \nparticipate in an operation we disagree with or practically leave NATO. \nThat is a practical matter. The Senator knows he can only work by \nconsensus.\n  I realize this is extremely well-intended, but I used to go to a \nCatholic grade school, as well as a Catholic high school, but the \ndistinction was in the Catholic grade school the nuns taught me. I know \nthis will come as a shock to all my colleagues. Occasionally, I would \nbe kept after school for disciplinary reasons, and it wasn't because I \nspoke too much then, because I used to stutter very badly so I hardly \nspoke at all. Maybe that is why I speak as much now.\n  All kidding aside, I used to have to stay after school. I say to my \nfriend from California, if you were a bad boy or a bad girl, in fifth, \nsixth, seventh, or eighth grade, you would have to write something on \nthe board 500 times.\n  And the one that I used to have to write the most, that Sister \nMichael Mary would most often choose for me to write--God rest her \nsoul, as my mother would say--particularly because she would say I \nalways had some rational excuses as to why I did what I did, she always \nused to make me write the following phrase 500 times on the blackboard: \n``The road to hell is paved with good intentions.''\n  Well, this will not take us to hell, but this is a road to disaster \nthat is paved with very good intentions. It is unnecessary, it is \ncounterproductive.\n  One other thing. While I was off the floor temporarily, I am told by \nstaff that the distinguished Senator from Texas said that when we had a \nmeeting with the foreign ministers--``we'' being Senator Roth, Senator \nBiden, the Senator from Texas, and I don't know how many other Senators \nattended that meeting right downstairs in the room of the \nAppropriations Committee, their Capitol meeting room. We met with them \nat length, all of them that were here. The distinguished Senator asked \nthem whether or not they thought a dispute resolution mechanism was a \nworthwhile thing. They all said yes, initially. And I said, ``Please, \nwill everybody hold up for just a moment.'' I said, ``Let me explain to \nyou''--and I ask the Senator, if she disagrees with the explanation, to \nsay so--``what my distinguished friend from Texas means. That is a \nresolution mechanism, different than the NAC, that would be binding \narbitration. Do you still agree?'' Every single one of them said, ``No; \nwe do not agree.'' They said that with all of us present.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, on that point, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Essentially, all the distinguished Senator from Texas is \nasking is that we lay down the proposal, and if the NAC repeats the \nposition that you just recited, that is the end of the purpose of the \namendment. Therefore, I am wondering why we would preclude a simple act \nof a proposal being put before the NAC by the U.S. representative, not \ninstructing the NAC as to what to do but simply to say, take it into \nconsideration. It is a very simple, straightforward amendment.\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator pardon me for a moment to ask my staff a \nquestion?\n  Mr. WARNER. Sure.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I say to my friend that, to be honest \nwith you, initially I was under the impression that this was to provide \nfor this dispute resolution mechanism.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have clarified that point.\n  Mr. BIDEN. You have. Secondly, I was reminded by my staff that our \npresent NATO Ambassador called me personally, and maybe others, asking \nthat he not be put into a position of even having to introduce it, \nbecause he thought it was such a serious mistake to even raise that \nspecter.\n  Now, it seems to me that if I were a member of the NAC presently, if \nI were France, I might like this dispute resolution mechanism. They \nhave been trying very hard to take over your fleet, without supplying a \nship. They have been trying very hard to take titular leadership of \nNATO--I will get a lot of letters on this. I see Senator Roth's senior \nstaff saying: There he goes again with the French.\n  Mr. WARNER. He is a Francophile of some stature.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, and I am a quarter French heritage.\n  But my point is this. I think it is dangerous to even introduce this \ninto the NAC. Why would we possibly say to anyone in NATO, now, that we \nwant you to consider us being able to give up our right to dictate the \noutcome of any decision made by NATO that is in a positive sense? Why \nwould we even want to do that? That would be a question to my friend \nfrom Virginia, other than responding to my other colleague. Why would \nwe want to do that?\n  Mr. WARNER. First, I want to add a fact. I consulted with the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, and she said that she, in turn, has \nconsulted with Ambassador Hunter, who preceded the Ambassador you just \nreferred to, the incumbent--and, by the way, the incumbent, we all \nknow, was associated with the Senate and was a staffer at one time. He \nhas risen through the ranks and has now gotten due recognition and was \ngiven that very important post. He carries with him an extraordinary \ncorporate knowledge of this institution and the general subject of \nNATO. So I think the appointment is a good one.\n\n  But Ambassador Hunter gave some technical advice in the preparation \nof the amendment. I read the language in paragraph 1 down there, \n``between and among allies . . .'' and so on. I sought clarification of \none or two words, and I was advised Ambassador Hunter was the source of \nsome of that language. I am not suggesting that Hunter said this is the \nright thing to do, but at least he gave some technical advice.\n  The amendment is so straightforward. It simply says we will take--and \nmany of us have grave concerns about the missions of NATO as they are \nnow being formulated--and they, regrettably, will not be made known \nuntil a year hence, at the very time we are asked to vote. I have \ndwelled on that point and will continue tomorrow.\n  The point is that I think the Senator is entitled to ask for the \nsupport of her colleagues, not to simply table it. If the NAC turns it \ndown, so be it, because as this new definition of missions comes out, \nthere could well be provisions--and I will not prejudge it--that deal \nwith the ever-increasing number of ethnic, religious, and border \ndisputes. Speaking for myself, I want NATO's participation, at the very \nminimum, in trying to resolve certainly by force of arms. So this seeks \nto have maybe some tribunal within NAC that listens to the parties and \nhears them out.\n  Madam President, as the wise Senator from Delaware knows, Greece and \nTurkey have had some very fundamental disagreements for many years. As \na matter of fact, one person whom I respect, with a corporate \nknowledge, told me that the reason they were given NATO membership was \nto avoid a conflict between the two of them. I am not suggesting the \ncredibility of that statement, but it was made. And NATO has, in many \nways, arbitrated through the years, and continues to arbitrate in some \nmeasure, this longstanding dispute as it relates to Cyprus.\n  The point is, in that sense, NATO is arbitrating the very types of \ndisputes that the Senator from Texas had in mind. I think it is within \nthe purview of this very important deliberation we are having now to \nsimply ask Senators to allow the amendment to be passed for the sole \npurpose of laying down a proposal.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, the Senator doesn't often confuse me. We \nvery often agree, and when we disagree, I usually understand clearly \nwhy we disagree. Let me explain my confusion, and if the Senator wishes \nto respond, I would appreciate it. If not, I understand.\n  The Senator has been the most vocal and articulate opponent of NATO \nand/or the United States alone getting involved in what he believes to \nbe intractable civil conflicts, border disputes, that have hundreds of \nyears of history that precede them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senator is correct. I remain of that \nview.\n  Mr. BIDEN. And I respect that. But what confuses me is, with the \nSenator's grave concern, why would he even want to give the NAC, or \nNATO, a possibility of taking away his power to influence those \noutcomes? He says that he is worried about--and I know him to be--the \nnext strategic doctrine NATO may come out with.\n  Right now the way NATO is constructed organizationally is if they \ncome out with a doctrine that we sign off on, or intend to sign off on, \nthe distinguished Senator from Virginia can come to this floor, pass a \nresolution and/or an amendment to a piece of legislation instructing \nthe President not to sign on, and he can make that prevail depending on \nthe number of votes available. If this were to be put before NATO, \nwhich would, by the way, imply at a minimum that the United States \nsupported it, and the President doesn't, we do not support it. We \nwouldn't table something we don't support. People do not go around \ntabling things and asking for consideration that by implication they \ndon't support. This administration does not support that. The last \nadministration, to the best of my knowledge, does not support that.\n  But why would this Senator even put in play the possibility that his \ninfluence over whether or not we are involved in a border dispute is \nrendered null and void? For if this were tabled, and if NATO adopted \nthis, we would be in the position of taking exception to getting \ninvolved in a border dispute quite possibly, and if the dispute \nmechanism resolution requiring binding arbitration were in effect, the \nSenator would have no, no, no impact over whether or not that occurred, \nother than passing a resolution suggesting we would throw off from \nNATO.\n  I don't understand, even though that is not likely to happen, why the \nSenator would even want to put himself in that possible position. The \nhigher one is concerned with being involved in border disputes seems to \nme to increase in direct proportion the need for opposition to this \namendment. Those who are willing to get involved in every border \ndispute who think we should be the policeman for all of Europe, central \nEurope, the former Soviet Union, that we should do whatever our \nEuropean friends think should be done, they should be for this because \nit doesn't matter. It may very well be that we have a President who \ndoesn't want to get involved in those disputes. But a majority of the \nmembers of NATO do, and they think that is good foreign policy.\n  But I am perplexed. The more one is concerned about border disputes, \nthe less they should be willing to give an absolute veto power that we \nnow have--absolute. There is no need to discuss it. There is no need to \ndo anything. The President of the United States picks up the phone, the \nSecretary of State picks up the phone and says to our Ambassador to \nNATO, ``Vote no.'' Done, over, gone, finished, no troops, no NATO. Why \nwould you want to give up that lock? It is beyond me.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to try to answer that because what we \nare trying to do is not have it come up to NAC but to have border \ndisputes and a process that everyone has agreed to, and if anyone \ndoesn't agree, including us, it wouldn't go into effect.\n  The Senator from Delaware quoted from my statement, but he forgot to \nsay that I laid out the labor arbitration as just an example of what it\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\ncould look like. I was only trying to provide one option, one thought. \nThe purpose is not to have border dispute resolutions come to NAC. It \nis to have an agreed-upon procedure at the lowest level so that every \ncountry would know what the ground rules are so that they could handle \nit at the lowest level and there wouldn't be an eruption at the highest \nlevel.\n  I say to the Senator from Delaware, who I admire very much, that all \nthe United States Ambassador has to do is say, ``I don't think this is \na good idea,'' when he does start talking to the allies. It will go \nnowhere. Why would anyone be afraid to talk about this in anticipation \nof problems that could occur? There are 11 potential border disputes \nthat have been identified by the Congressional Research Office as \nhaving a medium to high probability of escalation. It is, I think, an \nopportunity to keep a Bosnia from rising to the level it has. If we had \na mechanism in place with the Croats, the Serbs and the Moslems could \nhave gone to an arbitration process, or could have agreed on a process \nearly on how they would like to settle the dispute in the former \nYugoslavia.\n\n  All we are talking about is putting the idea on the table. We are not \ntalking about a result. I don't know why we should fear a discussion. \nWhy should we fear bringing this up just to see what our allies would \nlike to do about potential border conflicts? NATO is not going to be \nthe same. When you add new members, regardless of who they are, you \nhave to anticipate that there may be a change in the alliance. When \nWest Germany became a member it changed the alliance. When Spain became \na member it changed the alliance. When France decided not to be a part \nof the military operation, it changed the alliance.\n  What I am trying to do with this amendment is provide leadership. If \nwe have the veto, as the Senator from Delaware has said, we can veto. \nBut why not bring it to the table for discussion?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I see my friend is rising to speak. Let me respond to the \nquestions directed to me very briefly.\n  I recall my friend from Virginia--I keep referring to my friend from \nVirginia because he is on the Armed Services Committee. We have been \nhere a long time. We have been back and forth to Brussels zillions of \ntimes. So I don't mean that to suggest he agrees with me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, it is a term of endearment and it rests \nequally on both sides. I just regret that the Senator is of the wrong \nparty. Other than that, he is doing good.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As my friend will remember, a man named Werner was a very \ndynamic leader of NATO, a German who was made the number one man in \nNATO. I recall being in Brussels. Don't hold me to the year. I think it \nwas somewhere around 6 over 8 years ago. There was a lot of saber \nrattling going on relative to Greece and Turkey.\n  I remember asking Werner about what this all meant. We were about to \nhave a meeting. He was having a luncheon for me, as they do for any \nSenator who will go over and pay attention, and with the permanent reps \nand some of the military. He said to his assistant general so and so, \nand general so and so, one a Turk and one a Greek, ``Call them in the \noffice.'' They called them in the office. He basically said, ``What is \ngoing on, fellows? What is the deal?'' The Turkish and Greek military \nrepresentatives of NATO sat there and in the privacy of that room \ndiscussed the politics in their own country; why they didn't see there \nwas much of a problem, but you have to understand it is going nowhere.\n  If any formal mechanism is put in place, the ability of that Greek \ngeneral and that Turkish general to walk into a room and totally off \nthe record say, ``We think this, we think that,'' and talk about it in \nfront of a German, and an American, all members of NATO, that would \nevaporate. Now we will have set up a bureaucratic deal, no matter what \nit is, no matter how tenuous it is, now it is posture.\n  One of the things that we get done--and it will come as a shock to \nsome people, but in the Chamber it will not come as a shock--is how do \nwe most often on this floor resolve the disputes when we really get \ndown to it at the last minute in a crunch on any important issue.\n  We go back to one of those two rooms. There is no press. There is no \nfloor. There is no record. And I say, ``OK, what's the deal? If I \nchange this, can you do that?'' Isn't that how we do it? That is how \nNATO does it. Now, if we were required by law, by our governments, by \nour parties, that the only time we could meet is if we say, ``I will \nmeet you at 3:30; we will meet in room S. 107, and we will have two \npeople there, and I will formally table my concern,'' that is what \nworries me.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I know that is not what the Senator intends. What I am \nsuggesting after 25 years of watching this thing, I think that is what \nwill happen.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If I can answer the Senator's----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, could I just respond to the Senator \nfrom Delaware quickly--and, of course, I would like to have the Senator \nfrom Oregon respond also--if I could just say that nothing that the \nSenator from Delaware has said would be prevented from happening. \nPeople could certainly go into a room and settle a dispute. What we are \ntrying to do----\n  Mr. BIDEN. What is broken?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is have an option that they would be able to go way \nbelow the level of the North Atlantic Council, where they could go into \na dispute resolution process, something that would be devised by the \ncouncil, and if somebody on the council didn't like it, it would never \nsee the light of day.\n  What is the problem with opening the discussion?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, it is done that way now. That is exactly \nwhat is done now. On Bosnia, what did we do?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. On Bosnia, what we did is take it to the whole \ncouncil, and everybody got involved.\n  Mr. BIDEN. With all due respect, Madam President----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is why we are funding the commitment in Bosnia \ntoday, because in the United Nations----\n  Mr. BIDEN. With all due respect, what happened, whether the Senator \nagrees with the policy or not, the Secretary of State, the National \nSecurity Adviser, and their designees got on a plane, and they flew to \nParis, and they flew to London, and they flew to Madrid, and they flew \nto Bonn, and they flew to Berlin, and they flew all over, and they met \nindividually with the governments, not in Brussels.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. But now the United States of America is paying the \nlion's share and our troops are in harm's way in Bosnia, if the \nPresident has his way, in perpetuity. Is that the answer you want for \nevery ethnic dispute that can occur for the next century in Europe?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, if I may be recognized, with all due \nrespect----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Whether or not--and we disagree in the policy. I have been \non this floor for 4 years saying we should be involved. But whether or \nnot we should, NATO has nothing to do with that. NATO troops ended up \nthere, but not because the American President went to a NAC meeting or \nour Ambassador to NATO at a NAC meeting raised this issue. It is \nbecause there was a policy decision made by a President, supported by \nthis Senator--he didn't do it because of me, but supported by this \nSenator--to try to persuade NATO to do that. Whether or not there was a \ndispute resolution mechanism in place in NATO that was formal or \ninformal is irrelevant to that question. The President of the United \nStates first picked up the phone and called Tony Blair. Then he called \nChirac. Then he called--and the list went on. Then they ended up in \nNATO.\n  So I understand what the Senator is trying to deal with. To use an \nold expression, she in a sense is trying to fight the last war. We \nfought that war about Bosnia in the Chamber here. My team won; her team \nlost. But NATO enlargement and a dispute resolution mechanism have \nnothing to do with that decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If the Senator will yield, as I understood the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\nfrom Texas, her original idea was that we should say to the American \nAmbassador to NATO to raise it with the NAC and to present this idea, \nthat they discuss a dispute resolution. And in that, I think you said \nit is even OK for the Ambassador to say, ``I think that's a bad idea; I \nthink we need to settle that right now. If this is a bad idea, let's \nsay so.'' And I would hate to begin a debate with our European allies \nby saying we want to discuss what we think is a bad idea even though \nthe Senate somehow thinks it is a good idea. It is either a good idea \nor it is a bad idea. That is why I would say no.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me just say to the Senator from Oregon --\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me say, if I could address that \nresponse very briefly--\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I hope he wouldn't put forth an idea that he thought \nwas a bad idea.\n  What I hope is that he would lay out the issue for discussion, and if \nthe result is not something that the United States thinks is the best \nresult, after everyone has had a say in what kind of process it would \nbe, of course, we would not lose our veto power. But I would certainly \nhope that he would not go in and say, ``I am putting forward an idea \nthat I think is a bad idea.''\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I apologize. I thought I heard the Senator from \nTexas say that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is a valid question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I could join this distinguished group \nand respond to everybody, the Senator from Texas is asking for a very \nsimple procedural act. And I agree with my colleague from Delaware; \nwhen an ambassador goes in with a proposal, it has to have the force \nand effect of not a bad idea but that we conscientiously think is \ncorrect.\n  Now, I remember Manfred Werner; we all do. What a magnificent person. \nHe was NATO, and no one in this Chamber, particularly John Tower, the \nlate John Tower, could express higher regard for Werner than yourself, \nmyself, and others. But the point is, we don't know what NATO is going \nto look like after we accept 12 nations, going from 16 to 28, and \nbringing in a realm of geography.\n  We understand the Cyprus dispute. It is age old. We understand how \ntwo senior military officers assigned to NATO could come into Manfred \nWerner's office and sit down and informally discuss it. But I look upon \na proliferation of problems of unknown--of unknown description, and it \nseems to me that perhaps we should address the potential for far more \nproblems than ever envisioned as we begin to access country after \ncountry after country.\n  Therefore, I think it would be advisable to explore the possibility \nof having some procedure by which, hopefully, the use of arms could be \navoided, or if arms were being used in a dispute, that somehow NATO, \nwith a wrestful and forceful hand, could put it to rest.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, let me just say that I agree with my \nfriend, the Senator from Virginia, that why wouldn't we put out every \npossible effort with every potential idea that could keep us from \nhaving an escalation that would require arms conflict, or would allow \nfor armed conflict? Precisely for the reason that the Senator from \nDelaware has stated: Perhaps we do need another step in the process.\n  What if the two generals in the back room can't agree? Why not have a \nsafety valve that would give another option when all else has failed? \nWhy not go the extra mile? We are not trying to guarantee the result \nwith my amendment; we are only trying to guarantee that there will be \nan effort, that we will try to come forward with a process that \neveryone would agree is a good process. If the United States thinks the \nend result is not a good one, it has the final ability to veto, as the \nSenator from Delaware has pointed out.\n  Why not try? What are we afraid of? That we would not be able to put \nthis on the table for discussion, to see if a process can be agreed \nupon by all of our allies in a consensus, and, if so, have the \nopportunity for another layer at the very lowest levels before it \nescalates into a situation as we see in Bosnia today?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I don't want to get anyone's hopes up or \ncause fear on anyone's part. I am not following in a recent line of \ndeparture from the Democratic side to the Republican side, but having \nreached the advanced age of 55, I cannot see from over there this \nchart, and that is why I am walking over.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. At the advanced age of 55, you are now sitting in \nStrom Thurmond's chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think the Senator's point is very well made. I hope it \nbrings me luck. He is one of my closest friends in the Senate. And as \nhe pointed out in a Roll Call article he got framed for me and signed--\nit was an article featuring him and his aides--I am the only person in \nthe Senate who could beat Strom Thurmond's record if I served in the \nSenate until I reached age 73, which I am sure my constituents will not \nlet happen.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator is warming the chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am not really warming the chair. I am serious. I could \nnot see it. If I may beg the indulgence of my Republican colleagues, \nlet me answer, because I think at least anything useful that could be \nsaid on my part has been said, with one exception, and I will say this \nand cease and desist.\n  As I read the amendment, on line 5 it says, ``establishing a process \nof dispute resolution among allies.''\n  Now, the Senator from Texas has pointed out--and she has been a very, \nvery, very forceful leader in opposition to our present policy in \nBosnia. I wish she were not as effective, because she and I disagree. \nBut she raised Bosnia again. I don't know how this dispute resolution \nmechanism of any nature would involve Bosnia at all. Serbia is not an \nally, Bosnia is not an ally, Herzegovina is not an ally, Croatia is not \nan ally, Moldavia is not an ally.\n  Looking over here, Romania--Romania is listed in the potential border \ndisputes, ethnic Romanians in Moldavia versus Russia. None of those \nparties, Moldavia, Russia or Romania, are our allies. Bulgaria-Serbia, \nEstonia-Russia, Latvia-Russia, Estonia-Russia, Croatia-Serbia, \nMacedonia-Albania, Moldavia-Russia, Yugoslavia Serb-Bosnia, Serb-\nCroats, Serbs-Kosovo, Serbs-Macedonia, Albanians-Serbs, Hungarians--\npossibly; Serbs--Albanians-Kosovoans, Greeks-Albanians, Albanians-\nMacedonians.\n  None of those concerns, not a single solitary one, involves allies. \nThey would not be covered by even the unstated illusory mechanism that \nmight be created if we don't table this. My reason for being opposed to \nthis is a little bit like what Senator John Pastore from the State of \nRhode Island told me in 1973. I said, ``I'm not sure about this, \nSenator''--a vote. And he said, ``Let me give you a piece of advice, \nJoe.'' He talked with a gravelly voice. He said, ``When in doubt, vote \nno.''\n  I am in grave doubt, at a minimum. I cannot possibly see how what the \nSenator is suggesting in any way--I don't fully understand it. She is \nnot proposing a particular mechanism. But I can't envision any \nmechanism that would have any impact on any of the things that are \nlisted on that chart. Not a single one. Not a single one would fall \nwithin the definition of her resolution.\n  Bosnia would not fall within the definition of her resolution.\n  I know, ever since Ross Perot, all of us have gotten chart mania. You \nknow, me, too. I have my charts back there. Maybe the chart was just \nwheeled out by mistake. But it, the chart, has no relevance to the \nresolution, none at all. I say as a Democrat on this side of the aisle \nnow--I guess I should not be so flip about it. I do not mean to be. But \nall kidding aside, I really, truly, as they say--I don't get it. The \nexamples the Senator from Virginia and Texas are worried about would \nnot fall within the purview of this resolution even if such a dispute \nmechanism were arrived at. Nothing on the chart would fall within the \npurview of this resolution. I don't know what would that is not already \nworking. And I don't know what is broken. I can't think of a single \nexample--I would like to hear one--where NATO was unable to come up \nwith a dispute resolution within the present structure. So that is why \nI oppose this. I will oppose it.\n  I have great respect for my friend from Texas. I mean that sincerely. \nBut I strongly disagree with this and I will urge my colleagues to vote \n``No.'' I thank her for her indulgence.\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\n  I have been asked to yield to Senator Craig for a consent request, \nunanimous consent request. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank my colleagues. I would like to offer up a \nunanimous consent request for the good of the order and the remainder \nof the afternoon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 5 p.m. be \nequally divided between the majority and the minority. I further ask \nunanimous consent that at the hour of 5 p.m., the Senate proceed to a \nvote on or in relation to the Hutchison amendment No. 2317, to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the Craig amendment No. 2316.\n  I finally ask consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided in the usual form prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, and I'm not sure I will \nobject, I want to be certain that would mean the Senator from Delaware \nwould--or one of us, the Senator from North Carolina--would control, I \nguess we would control 27 minutes, 27\\1/2\\ minutes, is that right, \neach? Is that correct? That is a question, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I apologize to the Senator. Would he repeat that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. As I understand it, if we agree to this unanimous consent \norder, then there is 27 minutes on a side to dispose of the debate on \nthe amendment of the Senator from Texas and the amendment of the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I don't believe that will leave enough time. The Senator \nfrom California has been patiently waiting here. She wants 15 minutes. \nYou and I have not even engaged your amendment yet. Senator Levin wants \n5 minutes. So I would, for the moment, object. But I am sure we can \nwork something out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to suggest that I take 3 \nminutes to finish on my amendment and then everything else could be on \nSenator Craig's amendment for the rest of the afternoon.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object to that because I wish to speak on the Hutchison \namendment and I wish to have 15 minutes of time. I have been waiting \naround for hours. I might be able to get it down to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That's fine. I did not realize the Senator was on my \namendment. She certainly should have that right, after which then I \nwill want to have some time reserved. So whatever can be worked out \nthat gives her her time, and then I could close on my amendment at the \nappropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am willing to extend to 5:10, the time at \nwhich we would start the votes. I will say to the Senator from \nCalifornia, I certainly respect her right and her need to debate. I \ncan't say how long the Senator from Delaware plans to speak on my \namendment. I have said about all there is to say on my amendment, and \nwithin a few minutes I could say the bulk of it. I know the Senator \nfrom Missouri also wished to lay down an amendment, I believe. That \nwould take a minimal amount of time. But it is important. We have \nSenators who have obligations by 5:20, and that is what we are trying \nto meet.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, believe me, I was trying to get this \ntime earlier in the day. In the interests of comity I will take 10 \nminutes and speak fast. I must do that.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we have enough time within this time to \ndebate and finish the amendment of the Senator from Texas. But the \nSenator from Idaho has a very, very important amendment. If I agree to \nthis request, it leaves me a total of 4 minutes to respond to his \namendment, and nothing has been said in opposition to his amendment \nyet. If the Senator from Missouri speaks, it will leave less time.\n  So I assume it's the leader's desire to have two votes by 5:10 or \nthereabouts. I don't know how we can do that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me withdraw the unanimous consent \nrequest at this time. We are wasting valuable debate time. The debate \ncan go forward. We will see if we can come up with an agreement a few \nminutes from now. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me just propose a unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from California be allowed 10 minutes on my \namendment, after which I would have a maximum of 5 minutes and we would \nclose my amendment, and then everything else could be negotiated on the \namendment of Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from California is finally recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank you. Did the Senator want her 3 minutes at this \ntime, or does she wish to take it after my remarks?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. After the Senator from California has finished her \nremarks, I will close on my amendment and then they can determine what \nthey want to do with the rest of the time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I have listened carefully to this debate, and I think \nwhat the Hutchison amendment really gets to is what NATO is all about. \nPerhaps it comes down to how each of us sees NATO. Frankly, I see NATO \nas a military alliance that has been extremely successful, that has \nworked very well, and I don't want to see anything happen to NATO that \nwould change the focus of what it really is.\n  As I listened to my friend, and I know she in her heart wants to have \na mechanism to resolve the disputes that may erupt and are currently \nerupting, I understand her intention, but as I look at the amendment, I \nthink what will happen is there will be a procedure set up for every \ngroup that has a gripe about another ethnic group to come to a forum, \nto present their case, and perhaps some of them will bring propaganda, \nthat it could turn NATO into a little sideshow, into a world sideshow, \na propaganda stage. I am very concerned about that. Again, I think the \nreason I am concerned is that I support NATO enlargement. I have been \nwaiting to get some time to talk about why. I think this amendment \nwould, in fact, take us off course of what we are trying to do.\n  It is important to say that just at the prospect of a country joining \nNATO there have been 10 major accords that have occurred. In other \nwords, the fact that principles that we have laid down, and some of \nthem are called Perry principles, named after William Perry, we said \nthat if you want to join NATO, you have to have a commitment to \ndemocratic reform, you have to have a commitment to a free-market \neconomy, you have to have good, neighborly relations--good, neighborly \nrelations. And because NATO is going to be open to countries that \nfollow these reforms, and others, it seems to me that is one of the \nbest ways we have for resolving problems.\n  The agreement has been made between Poland and Lithuania, Poland and \nthe Ukraine, Hungary and Romania, Italy and Slovenia, and Germany and \nthe Czech Republic. So while we come up with charts and ways to show \nthe disputes, we also should celebrate the fact that because we have \nopened up NATO to countries, assuming they make certain reforms, among \nthem good, neighborly relations, that that has been an incentive.\n  Mr. President, everyone approaches this issue from his or her own \nexperiences. I am very strong on this NATO expansion, because I \nremember well back when I was a teenager watching the television \nreports of the Hungarian revolution being cut short by Soviet tanks. I \nthink back to those years in 1956 watching freedom crushed and watching \npeople's dreams crushed and thinking to myself, oh, my God, I wish we \ncould do something but we really can't do anything because of the Iron \nCurtain, because of what was going on\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\nin the world. I remember feeling so powerless.\n  I feel so proud that all these many years later I can do something \npositive, to say to that country and to other countries, ``You will \nnever have to go through that again.'' I feel good about that.\n  I don't want to see us get off our course, to change what the role of \nNATO is, to turn it into maybe a mini United Nations, to set up false \nhopes because, indeed, the Senator herself said it may well be that \nnothing comes of all of this. If nothing comes of all of this, why do \nwe have to set up a whole new elaborate procedure? I think it is \nsetting up false hopes. I think it is setting up a world stage for \npropaganda. I think it is setting up a situation where we are getting \noff what our mission in NATO ought to be about. To me, it is very, \nvery, very serious.\n\n  I believe that expanding the NATO alliance to include Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic, and focusing on that and holding out \nhope for other nations to join and not changing the focus to these hot \nspots, if we stick to what NATO is, we are going to see greater peace \nand security throughout Eastern Europe, the same peace and security \nthat we were able to provide Western Europe for the past 49 years.\n  It is important to note that no American soldier has had to fire a \nshot to defend one NATO ally, nor has a NATO member ever had to wage \nwar to fulfill its security guarantees. This is an incredible record. \nNATO is a military alliance. It works. If you turn it into something \nelse, you are playing a game with it, and the stakes are far too great, \nbecause a peaceful, secure Europe is necessary for a peaceful, secure \nAmerica. We are inextricably linked. In two World Wars, American troops \nhave fought and died.\n  The bottom line is, if we do believe that NATO has worked on the \nworld stage--and the proof is there, never was a shot fired by this \nalliance--then we should not get off course and adopt amendments that \nare going to take us away from that goal.\n  I know some of my colleagues worry about the situation with Russia, \nbut I do feel we are handling that. We have set up a way to have a \ndialog with Russia. I really believe whether you listen to our \nSecretary of State or former majority leader Senator Bob Dole, or Colin \nPowell, or veterans groups, they are all saying we should stick to our \nmission in that part of the world, which means a military alliance, not \nsome dispute resolution organization that invites everybody onto a \nworld stage.\n  Whether it is Henry Kissinger or Secretary Baker or Madeleine \nAlbright, they all are saying the same things. And the President \nhimself: ``A new NATO can extend the blessings of freedom and security \nin the new century, we can bring Europe together not by the force of \narms but by possibilities of peace, that is the promise of the moment \nand we must seize it.''\n  I am worried this amendment, though extremely well intended, will \ntake our eye off what we need to do in Europe, which is, yes, to add \ncountries to the alliance that are willing to undertake free-market \neconomy reforms, that are willing to reach out to their neighbors and \nsolve disputes, that are willing to become truly democratic nations, \nthat are willing to have civilian control over their military. These \nare the reforms.\n  If we turn away from the very simple goals of NATO and expand the \nmission and change the mission, it looks to me like, again, we are \nsetting up a mini United Nations or something here.\n  What is it going to cost? Already there are complaints about the \ncosts. What is it going to cost to do all this, and what are the \nprocedures going to be? If it is a sham, if it is not going to come to \nanything, if, as the Senator from Texas says, our Ambassador could just \ncall someone up and say, ``Forget it, we're not interested''--imagine \nthe news on that, imagine the press conferences held around the world \nby every ethnic group that says, ``The U.S. stopped us from having a \ndispute resolution.''\n  I worry about this amendment because I am such a strong supporter of \nNATO enlargement, and I want us to keep focused on what we have to do \nand think we are on the path. And as well intended as it may be, I \nthink this takes us off the path.\n  Thank you very much. I thank the Senator from Texas for her \ngenerosity in giving me these 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. For purposes of unanimous consent, Mr. President, let me \ntry this again so we can notify our Members of a vote at 5 o'clock. I \nask unanimous consent that the time between now and 5 o'clock be \nequally divided between the majority and minority. I further ask \nunanimous consent that at 5 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the Hutchison amendment No. 2317. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that at 4:25 Senator Ashcroft be recognized to lay aside the \npending amendment and he call up an amendment, for debate only, until \n4:55, and at such time there be 5 minutes equally divided for closing \nremarks on the Hutchison amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I would like to inquire of \nthe Senator from Delaware whether he heard this unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have. And it is my understanding--the \nreason I am not objecting is that there are no other Democrats looking \nto speak on the Hutchison amendment, and I wanted to reserve at the end \nof the time for purposes of explanation, our respective explanations, \nof the Hutchison amendment of at least a couple minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I get 5 minutes out of that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, I ask it be amended that we \ntake 5 more minutes out so we have a total of--\n  Mr. LEVIN. For the Craig amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Oh, no.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Craig amendment will not be debated until tomorrow.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We are only talking about a Hutchison amendment. I have no \nobjection, as long as I understood it correctly. And I apologize. I was \nin the back of the room.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further objection? Does the Senator \nfrom Missouri have an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will close on my amendment then, \nexcept for the last reserved 2 minutes that Senator Biden will take, \nafter which I will close.\n  Mr. President, I have now heard from the Senator from Delaware and \nthe Senator from California that the 11 disputes which have been put \ntogether by the Congressional Research Service have no relation to what \nwe are doing today. And yet the countries mentioned for inclusion in \nthe next wave of NATO expansion are Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nEstonia, and Romania. And Albania has also been mentioned.\n  It is relevant that we have ongoing disputes within the area that we \nwill be considering for inclusion in NATO. Mr. President, it is a \nmatter of preparing for the future. We are changing NATO. Every time a \nnew member is included, it changes the alliance. We hope it will \nstrengthen the alliance. We must look to what the future potential \nconflicts in the alliance would be. And the more you expand it, the \nmore potentials for conflict there are.\n  Let me read to you the amendment that we passed yesterday. It defines \n``common threats'' in NATO to include ``conflict in the North Atlantic \narea stemming from ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic \ndisputes or the actions of undemocratic leaders.'' That is the \ndefinition of ``common threats.''\n  In the paragraph following the next paragraph, the capacity to \nrespond to common threats is addressed. ``NATO's continued success \nrequires a credible military capability to deter and respond to common \nthreats.''\n  So, Mr. President, it could be that we are opening NATO and changing \nits very nature by the amendment that was passed yesterday. It could be \nthat we are looking at involvement in ethnic and religious enmity and \nrevival of historic disputes or the actions of undemocratic leaders in \na future mission for NATO.\n\n  If we are going to change the nature of NATO in this way, my \namendment is even more important. Why are we afraid to lead? Why are we \nafraid to put on the table a border dispute resolution process which \neveryone would have to agree to so that we will know what the process \nis before there is an\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\neruption that goes beyond our ability to contain it without military \nforce?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the distinguished \nSenator has expired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I will finish my comments \nin the last 5 minutes. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2318\n\n(Purpose: To require a Presidential certification that NATO is and will \n     remain a defensive military alliance, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity to \ncomment on an important aspect of this great Nation's efforts to defend \nfreedom generally, and in this specific instance, through the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization.\n  The Senate is being asked to give its stamp of approval to a new \nNATO, not only changing in membership, but changing in its scope and \npurpose. The focus of the change in NATO upon which we are being given \nthis opportunity to vote is the expansion of the membership of NATO.\n  But I would submit that there is something far more important than \nsimply this change in the numerics of NATO, simply this change in the \nnumber of nations that are members of the alliance. There is an \nalteration of NATO more profound than the expansion of its membership, \nand the Senate should not overlook this crucial aspect of the debate.\n  Let me just say that I believe NATO has been one of the most \nsuccessful defense organizations in the history of mankind. NATO has \nbeen an agency to preserve the peace and has done that so successfully \nthat we have not had to offer American lives on European soil in the \nsecond half of the 20th century. That is in stark contrast to the first \nhalf of the 20th century where hundreds of thousands of American \nsoldiers fought for freedom and hundreds of thousands gave their last \nfull measure of devotion in liberty's defense.\n  I think the success of NATO, though, is something that should be \nrespected by preserving NATO and not changing the character of the \nalliance. And, to be frank, since the threat of the Soviet Union no \nlonger exists, a number of officials associated with NATO have come to \nthe conclusion that this laudable organization, this most successful of \nall alliances, should be devoted to new ends and new objectives.\n  I submit that if we allow, in this vote, the devotion of NATO's \nresources to new objectives and to new ideas, we will be undermining \nthe very success and purpose for which NATO was constituted 50 years \nago.\n  Let us just look at some of the statements of administration \nofficials as they convey what they propose for the scope and mission of \nNATO in the future. Here is William Perry, the immediate past former \nU.S. Secretary of Defense, who left office recently and was replaced in \nthat office by one of our own, former Senator Cohen, now Secretary \nCohen.\n  This is testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March \n19, 1998. Of course, it was Secretary Perry who was a part of \nnegotiating this expansion of NATO, which we will vote on in the \nSenate. Here is what Secretary Perry says:\n\n       The original mission of NATO--deterring an attack from the \n     Soviet Union--is obviously no longer relevant. The original \n     geographical area of NATO responsibility is no longer \n     sufficient. The original military structure of NATO is no \n     longer appropriate. . .the new missions--\n\n  This is important language--\n\n       new missions of NATO should be preventive defense--creating \n     the conditions for peace in Europe. . .the geographical area \n     of NATO interests should be anywhere in the world--\n\n  This is operative language here.\n\n       The geographic area of NATO should no longer be confined to \n     the North Atlantic area.\n\n  If you will read article VI of the treaty, we get into a very clear \nspecification of territory, and it is exacting. It talks about \nlatitudes and longitudes and the like.\n  Here Secretary Perry reveals what the real agenda is, that we would \ncreate a new geographic area for NATO and it would be ``anywhere in the \nworld where aggression can threaten the security of NATO members. . .''\n  Secretary Albright has also urged that ``an expanding North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization must extend its geographic reach beyond the \nEuropean continent and evolve''--key word, evolve-- ``into a force for \npeace from the Middle East to central Africa.''\n  We are changing the mission of NATO from a mission which was designed \nto protect the territory of the member nations to being some kind of \ninternational policing operation.\n  With that in mind, it is my intention to send to the desk an \namendment which would require that the President certify that actions \nby NATO are in keeping with the terms of the treaty itself. I send the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], for himself, Mr. \n     Roberts, Mr. Helms, Mr. Warner, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n     Faircloth, and Mr. Bond, proposes an executive amendment \n     numbered 2318.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In section 3(1), strike ``(A) The fundamental importance of \n     collective defense.--'' and all that follows through \n     ``interests of NATO members.'' at the end of paragraph (1)(A) \n     and insert in lieu thereof the following new condition:\n       (2) The fundamental importance of collective self-\n     defense.--\n       (A) Presidential certification.--Prior to the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that--\n       (i) NATO is and will remain a defensive military alliance, \n     and that Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which \n     provides for the collective self-defense of NATO members \n     against armed attack, continues to constitute the heart of \n     that treaty; and\n       (ii) the United States will only support a military \n     operation under the North Atlantic Treaty that is commenced \n     on or after the date of adoption of this resolution of \n     ratification--\n\n       (I) if the operation is intended for the purpose of \n     collective self-defense in response to an armed attack on the \n     territory of a NATO member; or\n       (II) in response to a threat to the territorial integrity, \n     political independence, or security of a NATO member.\n\n       (B) Construction.--The Senate declares that nothing in the \n     North Atlantic Treaty, the Strategic Concept of NATO, or any \n     other document setting forth the fundamental purposes, \n     objectives, or missions of NATO shall be construed as \n     altering the constitutional authority of the Congress or the \n     President.\n       (C) Exclusions from meaning of ``NATO military \n     operation''.--The term ``NATO military operation'' does not \n     include any NATO training mission or exercise.\n       (3) Additional requirements regarding the strategic concept \n     of nato.--\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank a number of individuals for their willingness \nto cosponsor the amendment, not the least of which is the individual \ninhabiting the Chair at this time, the Senator from Kansas, Senator \nRoberts, Senator Helms, Senator Warner, Senator Hutchinson, Senator \nFaircloth, and Senator Bond. I am pleased they would support this \neffort.\n  I indicate that this amendment, which is to reinforce the original \nintent of the treaty to protect the security, the political \nindependence, and territorial integrity of these treaty nations, is \nwhat has been and will continue to be a part of our commitment in NATO, \nand that is reflected in the amendment.\n  We have the former Secretary of Defense, William Perry, saying there \nshould be a global mission for NATO. We have Secretary Albright saying \nwe should expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into a ``force \nfor peace from the Middle East to central Africa.''\n  We have witnessed what happens when our soldiers are involved in so-\ncalled peacekeeping organizations and operations in Africa. Not too \nlong ago in Somalia, 18 Americans died in a peacekeeping effort. \nFrankly, the tragedy in Somalia disrupted our foreign policy in Africa \nfor years, and we lost 18 Americans in the process. We have little to \nshow for it. As we noted just 2 weeks ago, one American, a part of a \nhumanitarian team to Somalia, was taken hostage within this last month. \nWe withdrew from Somalia, the warlords are back in business there, and \nwe have not made the kind of progress we ought to make.\n  I think the first thing to say is that there was a purpose for NATO. \nIt was\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\nmanifestly successful, the most successful military alliance ever, and \nit saved Americans from having to spend their lives in Europe in \ndefense of freedom. The success of NATO is incontrovertible.\n  The second point I make, those now asking for an amendment to the \ntreaty are asking to change it from what it was, a treaty to defend the \nterritory of NATO nations, into a ``global organization,'' according to \nWilliam Perry and to become ``a force for peace from the Middle East to \ncentral Africa,'' according to Secretary of State Albright.\n  Now, just to make it clear that these proposals are a dramatic change \nfrom the intention and character of NATO, let me just quote Tom \nConnally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, at the \ntime of NATO's establishment. ``Let us not forget that this treaty is \nlimited in scope.'' Doesn't sound very global. ``Its main purpose is to \nmaintain the peace and security of the North Atlantic area.'' Doesn't \nsound much like Middle East and central Africa. ``We do not propose to \nstretch its terms to cover the entire globe.''\n  Now it is not impossible to change a treaty, but if this treaty is to \nbe changed it ought to be changed through the appropriate \nconstitutional processes in which the Senate plays a central role in \noffering its advice and consent.\n  Tragically, the focus of all our attention is on three countries to \nbe added to the NATO alliance. But it has not been on this new mission. \nIt has not been on this attempt, this aspiration, to convert the treaty \nfrom one which defends the territory of NATO nations to a treaty which \nwould, in fact, attempt to be a force for peace across the Middle East \nand into central Africa. This responsibility and this problem has not \ngone unnoticed.\n  In last week's New York Times, an editorial reads as follows: ``The \nWhite House has provided no military rationale for expanding NATO \neastward while Europe is at peace and democracy and free markets are \ntaking root in Russia. Instead, the ratification resolution \npromiscuously opens the door to NATO military actions almost anywhere \nin the world. That startling expansion of NATO's license to conduct \nmilitary operations demands extensive debate.''\n  That is the New York Times recognizing what so many in the Senate \nhave failed to recognize, that we are not just dealing with this treaty \nin terms of three additional members. We are dealing with an intended \nexpansion that would take NATO from a limited treaty designed to \nprotect a specific territory into a global organization; if you will, a \nUnited Nations called NATO, with a standing army subject to deployment \nat the authorization of the NATO council around the world.\n\n  I think that deserves debate. I think it deserves our inspection. I \nthink there are reasons why we should have real reservations with \nregard to the transformation of a treaty before our eyes.\n  Now, some have argued that my amendment will impose new constraints \non NATO not contained in the treaty. Let me make it clear that the \namendment which I have sent to the desk merely asks that the President \ncertify that any action taken under the treaty is in strict conformance \nwith the limitations and language of the treaty itself.\n  Those who oppose this treaty are those who are opposed to living by \nthe rules of the treaty. Let those who are willing to live within the \nlimits of the treaty sign the rules and play the game. Let those who do \nnot want to play by the rules object to this amendment and say we want \nthe President to have latitude to go beyond the limits of this treaty, \nto send American forces, in conjunction with NATO forces, into central \nAfrica, to send them into the Middle East in operations outside the \nscope of the treaty, to deploy American lives in settings where it is \nan international policing operation, in settings where it is not \nrelevant or essential to the security interests of NATO.\n  Given the level of international trade that exists, it is pretty easy \nto understand that there would be those who would suggest that any \ncountry, anywhere, could be an interest of another country. If we are \ngoing to convert this treaty to a defense-of-interest treaty instead of \na defense-of-territory treaty, we are fundamentally altering the scope \nof NATO.\n  Now, the parameters of the treaty have long been understood. I have \njust indicated that Senator Tom Connally understood the alliance was \nlimited in scope. A focused and limited NATO was the alliance that was \nratified. This expanded scope of NATO has never been subject to the \nSenate's advice and consent. Truman's Secretary of State Dean Acheson \nalso defined the limits of the NATO treaty in a letter transmitting the \ntreaty to President Truman, a great Missourian. Secretary Acheson \nacknowledges the parameters of the treaty and stated flatly that the \nNorth Atlantic Council will have ``No powers other than to consider \nmatters within the purview of the treaty.''\n  If Acheson viewed the treaty as limitless in scope, why would he \ntestify about the careful limits in various articles? The Foreign \nRelations Committee, in its report on the treaty, took pains to show \nthat NATO was not an old-fashioned military alliance. The report \nstates, ``In both intent and language it is purely defensive in nature. \nIt comes into operation only against the Nation which by its own action \nhas proved itself an international criminal by attacking a party to the \ntreaty. If it can be called an alliance, it is an alliance only against \nwar itself.''\n\n  This was the intention. I don't think we are going to find central \nAfrican states attacking NATO. I don't think we will find countries \nfrom central Africa launching a war machine against the North Atlantic \nnations. But the Secretary of State wants to be able to deploy NATO \nforces there in her concept of a force for peace, and I translate that \ninto deploying American troops. The President has sought and asserted \nhis right to deploy American forces as Commander in Chief. This \namendment does not seek to infringe on that right. It has to do with \nprotecting American interests by maintaining the scope and integrity of \nNATO. I don't think we should try to convert the NATO alliance into \nsomething it was never intended to be.\n  With that in mind, there is a real contrast in terms of what the NATO \nconcept of defense was in the past and what we are currently being told \nNATO ought to be. In NATO's strategic concepts of the past, collective \ndefense was of paramount importance, a priority.\n\n       NATO defense planning is limited to the defense of the \n     treaty area. . .\n       NATO military authorities have no responsibilities or \n     authority except with respect to incidents which are covered \n     by articles 5 and 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty. . .\n\n  Article VI specifies the territory rather directly and \ncomprehensively and tells you what we are really looking at when we are \ntalking about NATO. Here is article VI of the treaty. This is how \ndefinite and specific it is:\n\n       For the purpose of article 5, an armed attack on one or \n     more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack on \n     the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North \n     America, on the Algerian departments of France, on the \n     territory of Turkey, or on the islands under the jurisdiction \n     of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the \n     Tropic of Cancer. . .\n\n  That doesn't sound like central Africa to me. It has the specificity \nand particularity of a carefully drafted treaty that was designed to \nprotect territories, not to be another mini-U.N. with a standing army, \nthe forces of which can be deployed anywhere around the world. The \nlives of Americans and the treasure of America should not be directed \ninto international policing operations through a transformed NATO never \napproved by the American people. We should remain true to the North \nAtlantic Treaty.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       On the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, \n     when in or over these territories, or any other area in \n     Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were \n     stationed on the date when the treaty entered into force, or \n     the Mediterranean Sea, or the North Atlantic area north of \n     the Tropic of Cancer.\n\n  Article VI clearly specifies that NATO is a defensive instrument, an \nalliance designed to protect the territory. To convert it into \nsomething else more or less than that is to involve ourselves in what I \nwould have to say is ``treaty creep.'' We have heard of ``mission \ncreep.'' We know what happened in Somalia as the mission expanded, \nwhich threatened the lives and safety of our soldiers. We lost lives \nbecause we undermined our preparedness;\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nwe hadn't planned or designed the operation for that into which it \nevolved.\n  I suggest that if we allow NATO to creep into a wide variety of \ninternational policing operations that it wasn't designed for, it will \nundermine and hollow out NATO. We have seen what international \ndeployments have done to our own military in terms of our preparedness, \nour maintenance, and our ability to have the fighting force ready that \nwe need. I think it would be perilous indeed if we were to change the \nnature of this important defensive alliance and amend it in a way that \nwould make it a global police operation instead of the defense of \nterritory that it was designed to be.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I have submitted this amendment. I am delighted to \nhave as a cosponsor of this amendment the Senator from Kansas, and I \nknow he wants to make remarks. I have about 10 minutes remaining in my \ntime.\n  Senator Grams would like to be listed also as an original cosponsor \nof this amendment. I am delighted, and I know the Senator from Kansas \nwill welcome his cosponsorship as well. I thank the Senator from \nKansas. I look forward to his remarks, which will exhaust the last 10 \nminutes of the time to which I have been allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, can I inquire as to precisely the amount \nof time available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Ashcroft; the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner; the \nSenator from North Carolina, Senator Helms, and others, in calling for \nthe adoption of our amendment to the resolution of ratification as \nreported by the Foreign Relations Committee and as amended by the \nSenate.\n  As the Senator pointed out, we seek to replace the broad language \nstill in the resolution that expands the scope of NATO's purpose. We \nadd in the amendment what we consider to be clarifying language that \nupholds, as the Senator has pointed out, NATO's fundamental military \nmission as explained in article V of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. \nWe seek to ensure, particularly in light of the passage of the Kyl \namendment, that NATO's purpose is still fundamentally one of collective \nself-defense.\n  Our amendment does not strike any of the Kyl amendment as passed by \nthe Senate. Nor does our amendment restrict or alter the basic \nauthority of the President to dispatch American forces whenever and \nwherever a genuine threat to America's national security does emerge. I \nwill repeat that. Our amendment does not restrict or alter the basic \nauthority of the President to dispatch American forces whenever and \nwherever a genuine threat to America's vital national security does \nemerge.\n  I think that the debate we are having today on NATO has vast \nimplications in regard to the future.\n  Will NATO continue to operate, as it has for more than 50 years, as a \nmilitary organization for the collective self-defense of its members? \nOr will its mission be changed so that it becomes, as the Senator has \npointed out, a multinational military police organization?\n  To transform NATO into what could be described as a ``nuclear \nsupercop'' with authority to operate in all corners of the globe is \nunnecessary, and, quite frankly, I think it is dangerous.\n  As we enter the 21st century, it is critical that the original scope \nof the North Atlantic Treaty be preserved, for several reasons, all \nrelating to America's vital national security and national defense. \nNow, NATO was established as a defensive military alliance whose \nstrategic position today is, yes, significantly altered by the \ndissolution of the Soviet empire--we all know that--but whose \nfundamental military capability remains essential to deter military \naggression stemming from regional, nationalist and totalitarian \ntendencies.\n  The Ashcroft-Roberts-Warner-Helms-and-others amendment seeks to \nprevent the decline of NATO into another outlet for ``nation building'' \nand ``peacekeeping'' deployments. There is nothing wrong with those \ndeployments, except that many times they have no end game, no clear end \npurpose in terms of time, and they put American lives at risk for no \nvital U.S. national interest. I don't think NATO should be a mechanism \nof convenience through which any President can commit the United States \nto resolving long-time ethnic, religious, economic, and political \nconflicts worldwide. That is what the President said in Warsaw and in \nBucharest in speeches--military matters no longer matter, and he \nmentioned these various concerns--ethnic, religious, economic, and \npolitical conflicts. It was never intended, nor is it designed and \nmaintained, to be primarily a peacekeeping and humanitarian \norganization. Other organizations can do this; it is fine work, but it \nis not for NATO. The Senate needs to discourage any transformation of \nthe most successful defensive military alliance in history into an \ninternational police force. Mr. President, I hope that the Senate has \nnot hastened this regression with the adoption of any previous \namendments. There is some disagreement on that.\n  A second valid reason for adopting our amendment is to define a \ndefinitive and consistent course for the future of American military \ninvolvement in Europe. Let me emphasize and stress that it is in our \ninterests, and the world's vital interests, for the United States to \nremain constructively engaged in Europe.\n  However, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, it has been \nmade painfully clear to me that we cannot have additional military \nresponsibilities internationally without funding them. To be perfectly \nfrank, the current administration defense budgets, plainly put, are not \nadequate to meet the basic needs of modernization, maintenance, quality \nof life, and training needs. Yet, the administration ordered American \nforces to more than 100 countries worldwide. We already hear the report \nof a hollow military.\n\n  Should we vastly change the scope of NATO's military requirements \nand, by implication, our commitment to it at a time when our forces are \nstrained by lack of resources? I don't think so. To do so, I fear, will \nfurther weaken our own force structure and place in danger the lives of \nour military men and women who are already being asked to do a tough \njob without the proper tools.\n  The Ashcroft-Roberts-Warner-Helms amendment provides a commonsense \ndeclaration of NATO's primary purpose that does not--I want to \nemphasize this does not--preclude the President of the United States \nfrom dispatching U.S. troops, equipment, or aid anywhere that he \nbelieves is necessary. It simply precludes the President from saying \n``We're doing these things as a member of NATO'' if it is not in \nresponse to threats as described in article V of the North Atlantic \nTreaty.\n  I know there is going to be opposition to this amendment by claiming \nwe are imposing limits on NATO military operations and also \ndecisionmaking. That is not the case. Our amendment seeks to preserve \nthe military nature of the alliance. Steering NATO away from missions \nnot defensive or military in nature is not limiting military \ndecisionmaking--rather it is upholding the original mission.\n  It also may be argued that the North Atlantic Treaty has worked well \nfor 50 years and has appropriately never been changed or reinterpreted, \nand, I think the line goes, ``We shouldn't open that Pandora's box \nnow.'' I could not agree more.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate is being asked to pass a ratification \nresolution that does open Pandora's box. The New York Times, in a \nrecent editorial, said this: ``. . . the ratification resolution \npromiscuously opens the door to NATO military actions almost anywhere \nin the world.''\n  Some may claim that the Ashcroft-Roberts-Warner-Helms amendment takes \naway U.S. flexibility--the U.S. advantage in the NATO alliance in \nregard to convincing our allies to bear more of the burden of Europe's \noverall security. Further, some may claim that some allies could use \nthis amendment as an excuse to abstain from missions where we want them \ninvolved.\n  I respectfully disagree on both accounts.\n  The first claim assumes our European allies cannot see for themselves \ntheir own legitimate security interests. The second assertion ignores \nrecent\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\nhistory. What was the greatest military contingency the United States \nfaced in the last 25 years? What was the greatest immediate threat to \nour interests and those of our allies? I am talking about vital \ninterests. It was the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the subsequent war \nin the gulf.\n  The remarkable coalition of nations and forces put together by \nPresident Bush and Secretary Baker was completely out of NATO's \npurview. Yet, our allies joined the fight. Why? Because the threat was \nreal, the threat was clear, and events overtook subtle differences. It \nis the nature of threat that determines the behavior of our allies, not \nthe existence of provisions they may construe as loopholes in \nmultilateral security agreements. Beside, if the mission is pursuant to \nthe North Atlantic Treaty, allied participation is assured. If it is \nnot, why should NATO be leading the charge?\n  Mr. President, the Ashcroft-Roberts-Warner-Helms amendment is an \nimportant effort to preserve the limited responsibility of a military \nalliance in which we have a tremendous stake, a tremendous stake \nhistorically and financially, and, most importantly, in terms of \nAmerican lives. I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE AMENDMENT NO. 2317\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on the Hutchison \namendment. There are now 5 minutes equally divided on the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would appreciate the opportunity to \nclose on my amendment. Whatever the opposition would like to say, I \nwould like to yield and then be able to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to encourage my colleagues \nto vote against the Hutchison amendment. I do it with reluctance \nbecause of my admiration of the Senator from Texas. But I believe her \namendment, though much different than her original proposal, \nnevertheless remains a bad idea, because it essentially changes NATO \nfrom a system of collective defense to a dispute resolution. There are \nother forums for such resolutions, such as the OSCE. And these things \nshould be resolved anyplace but NATO.\n  Second, I believe this amendment would undermine the authority of the \nNorth Atlantic Council. Its mission needs to remain on defense.\n  Third, NATO would become a catalyst, even a magnet, for alliance \ntensions and border disputes. It must not become that.\n  Finally, we should keep the focus on NATO on what unites Europe in \nNATO; and that is common defense, not on what divides Europe, which are \nborder disputes and ethnic hostilities.\n  With great respect for my colleague from Texas, I nevertheless rise \nin opposition to her amendment and ask my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, while I have great respect for the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, I strongly oppose this amendment and \nI urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Last month, when we first addressed this amendment, I stated the \nreasons for my opposition. In the intervening time, nothing has changed \nmy perspectives. Indeed, my opposition has only hardened.\n  This opposition is based on four very clear and simple points:\n  First, the establishment of a formal dispute resolution mechanism \nwithin the Alliance would undercut the authority of the North Atlantic \nCouncil, the Alliance's supreme decision-making body.\n  Second, the proposal would change the focus of the Alliance from \ncollective defense to dispute resolution. That would fundamentally \ntransform the very culture of the Alliance, one that is now primarily \nderived from its mission of collective defense.\n  Third, the establishment of a dispute resolution mechanism would \nintroduce into NATO a dangerous catalyst for inter-Alliance tensions. \nIt would serve as a magnet for disputes that exacerbate tensions within \nthe Alliance.\n  And fourth, by inviting and exacerbating tensions and disputes into \nthe Alliance, this proposal would weaken the Alliance's ability to \nfulfill its core mission of collective defense.\n  When it comes to formal dispute resolution, we should look toward the \nUnited Nations or the OSCE--an international organization in Europe \ndedicated to preventing, mediating and bringing an end to disputes \nbetween countries. But, I don't think that we want to transform NATO, \nthe most successful military alliance in history, into another OSCE.\n  I fear that this proposal implies that the NAC--and the Alliance--has \nfailed in fostering cohesion among its European members over the last \nfifty years. I do not believe any of us would say that is true.\n  Let us not forget that in its current form, NATO has proven itself to \nbe a remarkable forum through which differences between Allies have \nbeen mitigated and managed. The clearest example of this influence is \nthe alliance's positive contributions to relations between Turkey and \nGreece. This success is very much due to the trust this fostered \nthrough the Alliance's focus on war-fighting. We must be careful to not \nundercut this success.\n  Yet that is exactly what this proposal would do. If the Alliance were \nto follow through on this proposal articulated by the good Senator from \nTexas, it would establish a new body possibly independent from the NAC. \nThat is a major change to the Alliance. It will create a process that \nin no small way will distract members of the Alliance from the core \nmission of collective defense. It will serve as an incentive for them \nto use the Alliance as a means to pursue a laundry list of other \nmatters--many of a strictly national, and not Allied, concern.\n  That's how this proposal would invite tensions within the Alliance. \nThat's how it would undercut its mission of collective defense. That \nmission requires cohesion and it requires focus. This amendment \nportends to undercut both.\n  Moreover, offering this amendment implies that the United States \nregards Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as unstable and more \ncontentious than other members. I do not believe that is the sense of \nthe Senate.\n  As well intentioned this amendment may be, it contradicts its own \nobjectives and would severely damage the vital interests of the \nAlliance.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, is the time that is equally divided \nnow finished?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon still has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 2\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it was said by the distinguished Senator from Oregon, \nfor whom I also have great respect and I think he is doing a fine job \nin the Senate, but he said that we have other mechanisms for dispute \nresolutions. My problem with that is that the OSCE not only is a very \ndifferent kind of organization in which we are 1 vote out of 50, but if \na dispute resolution is not passed in the OSCE, we aren't pledging \nmilitary involvement by the United States. The OSCE is a good \norganization, and I hope we can use it. What I am trying to do is to \nrecognize that we are changing NATO as we add new members. When we \nadded West Germany, it changed. We want NATO to be strengthened by the \nnew members, and we know that new members are coming down the pike. In \nfact, members that are in dispute right now have been mentioned as \npotential new members of NATO. Why would we be afraid?\n  As my amendment says, to introduce to the North Atlantic Council a \nproposal for consideration by all allies aimed at establishing a \nprocess for dispute resolution--to keep our alliance strong, we must \nhave a mechanism where disputes that we know are pending today by \npotential future members, or things we have not even thought might \noccur, if they do, why not have\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\na process that everyone has agreed is the way to hold this to a low \nlevel rather than raising to the high level of the North Atlantic \nCouncil?\n  Mr. President, we have seen border disputes in Europe erupt. We want \nto do everything. We want to go the extra mile to make sure we can \nresolve small things at a low level because small things can become big \nthings. Then we would have troops at stake. Our security could be at \nstake. We want to lower the rhetoric.\n  That is what this amendment does. It does not guarantee the outcome \nof our proposal. It says we will lead. The United States will lead to \ntry to make sure that we have a process before we need it, before \npersonalities are involved where we can solve problems.\n\n  I hold up the New York Times of today: ``Greek Cypriots To Get \nMissiles from Russians.'' ``Turkey has warned that it may take military \naction to block the sale of S-300 missiles'' going into that part of \nthe world.\n  If we had talked about a process where we could be helpful in \nresolving disputes like this, wouldn't we be better off? Why would we \nfear talking and having a forum that would allow us to solve these \nproblems before they escalate and our troops could be called in to \nmilitary action? It is our responsibility to lead, and I am asking my \ncolleagues to make sure we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hutchison \namendment No. 2317. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nHollings) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cochran pertaining to the introduction of S. 2007 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2319\n\n   (Purpose: To set forth managers' amendments to the resolution of \n                             ratification)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order at \nthis time to offer a managers' amendment on behalf of Senators Helms \nand Biden. I further ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nconsidered agreed to and the motion to reconsider to be laid upon the \ntable. I announce again that these are a series of amendments that have \nbeen cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith] for Mr. Helms, for \n     himself, and Mr. Biden, proposes an executive amendment \n     numbered 2319.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The managers' amendment which the Senator from Oregon has \njust offered addresses several of the amendments which have been \noffered by our colleagues. Let me very briefly highlight a few of them.\n  First, we have an amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman affirming \nthe importance of the Partnership for Peace program.\n  Second, there is a provision offered by Senator Hutchison of Texas \nrelated to the strategic importance of NATO.\n  Third, there is an amendment offered by Senator Specter related to \npayments owed to the victims of Nazi Germany oppression.\n  Fourth, there is a requirement for a report on future rounds of \nenlargement. This amendment is a combination of amendments offered by \nour colleagues, Senators Bingaman, Harkin, and Jeffords.\n  This is a very useful amendment, in my view, because it will require \nthe executive branch to submit a detailed analysis related to the \npossible new members of NATO, including cost and military readiness \nissues before--before--a nation is invited to begin accession talks. \nThis will, I hope, allow the Senate to have a better understanding of \nthe ramifications of admitting new members in the future and thereby \nenable the Senate to fulfill its constitutional function of providing \nadvice to the President in the negotiation of treaties.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is an amendment related to intelligence \nissues which was proposed by the chairman and vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska.\n  I appreciate very much the cooperation of all our colleagues and urge \nthe approval of the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The executive amendment (No. 2319) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I realize there is no unanimous consent \nagreement, but our colleague, Senator Reed, has been here on the floor \nseeking to speak on NATO, and I yield for that purpose. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  For the last several days, this Senate has been considering the \nexpansion of NATO, which is a complicated issue that has profound \nconsequences for the world we live in and for the future and security \nof the United States.\n  This decision which will shape the security structure of not just \nEurope, but the entire globe, for decades to come. It will also \ndetermine in large part whether new emerging democracies and free \nmarkets coming out of the shadow of totalitarianism will perish or \nflourish. It is not a decision that is without controversy, but it is a \ndecision that I believe we must make in the affirmative, and I will \nsupport the expansion of NATO, the underlying legislation that we are \ndebating today.\n  NATO was originally created because unstable conditions in Europe \nthreatened not only the peace of Europe but the security of the United \nStates. In the late 1940s, Europe was still in shambles after World War \nII. Economies were crumbling, political systems had endured great \npressure, and factions arose. There was a very real threat, in fact, \nthat many countries\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\nwould succumb to the blandishments of communism.\n  The possibility of a Communist victory in Europe was all too real. \nCommuniques between the Soviet Union and the West had broken down. \nBerlin had been blockaded. Tension was at an all-time high. Communists \nwere battling for control in Greece, France, and Italy; a Communist \ncoup had already taken place in Czechoslovakia.\n  So when 12 countries came together to sign the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization protocols, their goal was to protect the peace and \nstability of Europe and, indeed, the peace and stability of the world. \nThe parties affirmed among themselves that their goal and their \ncommitment was to ensure a peaceful and stable Europe, because within \nthe context of that peace and stability they could begin to rebuild \ntheir economies and their democracies, and the strength of those \ndemocracies and those economies would truly preserve the peace.\n  As the Foreign Relations Committee stated in its report to the Senate \nin 1949, NATO would, ``free the minds of men in many nations from a \nhaunting sense of insecurity, and enable them to work and plan with \nthat confidence in the future which is essential to economic recovery \nand progress.''\n  In the last 50 years, the signatories' handiwork has borne itself out \nnobly, effectively, and efficiently. This assurance of peace and \nsecurity was--and it is important to note--not limited to the original \nsignatories to this treaty. In fact, Article X of the treaty allows for \nthe admittance of new members to NATO. And since it was signed in 1949, \nNATO has expanded to include Turkey, Greece, Germany, and Spain.\n  In the 50 years since its inception, 50 years of progress and peace \nand stability in Europe, we have seen a remarkable revival in Western \nEurope. Their countries have been rebuilt. Their economies are \nthriving. Historical tensions between France and Germany have been \nchanneled from hostility to cooperation. Although tensions still exist \nbetween some NATO partners, such as Greece and Turkey, NATO provides a \nforum and a place in which they can peacefully and amicably settle \nthese disputes. It has been a resounding success. More importantly, \nNATO has stemmed the march of communism and contributed significantly \nto its collapse.\n  Because the true goal of NATO is for European peace and security--\nbecause it was not narrowly focused as any specific set of countries to \nthe exclusion of others at its inception--I think it is appropriate \nthat we consider the applications of those countries who are emerging \nfrom the shadow of the Soviet Union. I think it is, in fact, \nappropriate that we consider the countries of Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic because they, too, need that sense of confidence, that \nsense of stability, that sense of peace that will allow them to build \ntheir economies and, perhaps more importantly, build their democracies, \nso that they, too, can participate in the free assembly of nations in \none of the proudest forums, NATO. NATO membership will also help these \ncountries modernize their militaries and better defend themselves.\n  Now, I think most people would concede that this is an appropriate \nstep in terms of the benefits I have listed. However, there are those \nwho question this expansion, question it in terms of NATO having been \nconceived at a particular moment in history when a particular threat \nconfronted Europe, the threat of an expansionist Soviet Union. Today, \nthat has changed. The Soviet Union has collapsed, and, rightfully, \npeople ask, ``Where is the threat that would motivate and suggest the \nenlargement of NATO?''\n  Well, there are still threats to peace, still threats to Europe, \nstill threats to the world community of free nations. In 1991, NATO \nrecognized these changing conditions and authored a new strategic \nconcept. This concept places more emphasis on crisis management, on \npeacekeeping, and peace enforcement. And it is appropriate and \nsignificant to know that these countries who seek admission today--\nPoland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary--are already participating with \nNATO in this new strategic approach.\n  These countries have contributed approximately 1,500 soldiers to our \npeacekeeping operations in Bosnia through the Partnership for Peace \nprogram. The U.S. offices have been very impressed with the \ncooperation, the professionalism, and skill of the Hungarians in their \noperations at our base in Taszar, one of the major marshalling and \nstaging points for our operations in Bosnia. All of these indicate that \nthese countries are cooperating already, are seeking involvement, are \nseeking engagement, and I believe can benefit from association, \nintegration, and participation in NATO.\n  Also, the expansion of NATO would help to quell the tensions that \nexist, the historical rivalries that exist, among these new areas \nemerging from Communist domination. As Secretary Cohen stated, we would \n``dampen nationalism and ethnic tensions by bringing new member states \ninto NATO's security framework. The re-nationalization of defense, with \na country obtaining weapons of mass destruction, `arming itself against \nan enemy, real or perceived,' could be averted by enlargement.''\n  This is an extremely valuable goal and objective. If we leave these \ncountries to their own devices, they very well may feel threatened \nenough to re-arm themselves, to begin an arms race within that region, \nthat sensitive region between the old NATO boundary line and the lines \nof the Commonwealth of Independent States. That, I think, would be a \nreal mistake.\n  There are signs already that the prospect of membership in NATO are \nbeginning to provide very, very positive movements to resolve ancient \nand long-held tensions. For example, Hungary has entered into \nagreements with Slovakia and Romania, in 1995 and 1996 respectively, \nguaranteeing the rights of ethnic minorities. This is evidence that the \nprospect of NATO membership is already producing positive effects \nwithin these countries.\n  Again, of great significance is the fact that NATO membership for \nthese countries would, I hope and believe, eliminate the need for them \nto build up arms independently against perceived threats. If we don't \nact to accept these countries, they very well could start an arms race \nin the area that would be detrimental to the peace not only of Europe, \nbut of the world, and add to the tensions in the areas that are \nsensitive, those areas around the borders of Russia.\n  Having said all this, and having talked about the benefits  that are, \nI think, obtainable through expansion of NATO, it would be, I think, \nincomplete to suggest that there are not factors which weigh on the \nother side. There are possible consequences that must be carefully \nwatched with respect to the management of the enlargement of NATO.\n\n  There are, in fact, valid reservations that have been made with \nrespect to this expansion. One of the major issues that has \nconsistently been brought forward and presented to us is the possible \nadverse reaction of Russia. Russia is sensitive to the growth of NATO. \nThey have seen for centuries the progress of military forces invading \nRussia through the plains of Poland. They are sensitive to this. Their \nsensitivity has been manifested in many different ways.\n  For example, the chairman of the upper House of Russia's Duma has \nsaid that START II won't be approved if NATO expands. In October of \n1996, the Duma, in fact, passed a resolution opposing enlargement by a \nvote of 307-0.\n  Russian officials contend that the ``Two plus Four'' treaty which \nunited Germany in 1991 prohibits the expansion of NATO. Although the \ntreaty does not contain such language, there is suggestion by some of \nour diplomats that, in fact, there was a verbal commitment not to \nexpand NATO.\n  All of these things manifest an opposition to NATO, but there are \nother signs indicating that Russia is prepared to accept this \nexpansion, they are prepared to accept the integration of Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic. For example, in May of 1997, in Paris, \nNATO allies and Russia signed a ``Founding Act on Mutual Relations, \nCooperation and Security Between NATO and the Russian Federation.'' \nThis Founding Act outlines the nature of the military presence in \nEastern Europe upon expansion of NATO, and it also establishes a \nPermanent Joint Council between NATO and Russia to undertake \nconsultations on matters of mutual interest.\n  Russia also continues to perform under the agreement, START I. In \nfact,\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\nthey are taking out and dismantling their nuclear platforms ahead of \nschedule under START I.\n  Although we must be concerned with the reaction of Russia, I believe \nwith respect to these three countries, Russia is prepared to accept \nexpansion will not undermine our cooperative efforts to disarm the \nworld and also be a force for cooperative peace in the world between \nthe West and Russia.\n  Now, there are signposts ahead which we must be very careful of. The \nrapid integration, for example, of the Baltic States would send a \nprofound sense of shock to Russia. Any further expansion beyond these \nthree countries must be watched terribly carefully. I think we must be \ncareful as we move forward not to rapidly and precipitously increase \nmembership in NATO. To do so would, I think, undercut the benefits \nwhich we are obtaining through this limited expansion to these three \ncountries.\n  Now, there is another issue which has been raised and which is also \nvitally important, and that is the cost of this expansion. We \nunderstand that numbers sometimes are in the eye of the beholder, and \nthe cost figures that have been suggested for NATO expansion range \nacross a very broad spectrum, from $19 billion over 15 years to a mere \n$1.5 billion over 10 years. Now, the CBO estimates are the most \npessimistic. Their numbers for expansion would see total costs over 15 \nyears for all of NATO expansion as roughly $61 billion to $125 billion, \nwith our share about $5 billion to $19 billion.\n  The Rand Corporation has weighed in. They have estimated over 15 \nyears a total cost of $14 billion to $110 billion. The administration's \ncosts also show a wide variability. Again, NATO itself has projected \nprobably the lowest cost, $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.\n  All of this suggests that the issue of costs--and, more importantly, \nwho pays for it--is vitally important to our considerations and is an \nissue we must continually watch and be very careful about. The bulk of \nthese costs belong to those nations who are joining, but I think we \nhave to question whether they have the economies to sustain such costs \ndespite their best indications and willingness to do so.\n  Our allies also must be a source of burden sharing as we go forward, \nbut many of their comments suggest that they have an unwillingness to \ndo more than what they are obligated to do. President Chirac has stated \nthat, ``France has no intention of increasing its contribution to cover \nNATO enlargement.'' Even though all of the NATO countries accepted \ntheir NATO cost estimate, we recognize that estimate is most optimistic \nin terms of cost.\n  We must be very concerned about this. But at this juncture, I think \nthat will be a factor that, in and of itself, should not prevent the \nexpansion from going forward. We have to assume that costs will be \nincurred. We have to vigorously, through our efforts, ensure that they \nare fairly borne by all parties. We have to also do that in the context \nof our own national defense priorities and an increasingly tight \ndefense budget. But I believe we can work through these issues and we \ncan, in fact, ensure that the costs are not excessive and, in fact, \nthey are fairly borne.\n  There is another set of issues that we face and that we should \nconsider today, and that is the challenges of interoperability. The \nquality of NATO must be maintained. It is, today, the preeminent \ncoalition force in the world. We have demonstrated that in Bosnia. But \nwe are finding in these new entrants--Poland, the Czech Republic, and \nHungary--armies that have aging Soviet equipment, armies that are heavy \nwith high-ranking military officers without well-trained and, in many \ncases, noncommissioned officers.\n  Another factor is that these countries' pilots will typically fly \nonly 40 to 60 hours in a year, whereas NATO requires at least 180. \nCommunications is an issue. The language of NATO is English, yet \nreports are that many countries have not yet provided the kind of \ntraining and upgrading that is necessary so that their officers can \nspeak English fluently and can participate effectively in NATO.\n  I think these obstacles can be overcome. NATO, in the past, has \nreached out and embraced new countries, many times embracing those \ncountries that have equipment problems, that have different cultural \nand language bases than those in Western Europe. I think we can do it \ntoday. But, once again, we have to be very careful that we when do \nthis, that we do it appropriately.\n  Let me just, once again, emphasize a point that is very important. \nToday's expansion--the acceptance and integration of Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic--I hope does not set off a rush to judgment with \nrespect to other countries. These three countries have a history that \nis very closely related to Western Europe. These three countries have \nalready shown their commitment to democracy, to free market economies. \nThese three countries have much in common with the culture of Western \nEurope, which is at the core of the NATO experience.\n  So I strongly suggest that whatever we do with respect to expansion \ntoday, we do not presume to rush into further expansion tomorrow. Quick \nentry of more members will compound all of the problems I talked \nabout--problems of costs, interoperability, the north-south \nrelationship within NATO. Today I will support the integration of \nPoland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, but I would be very wary of \nthe integration of other countries into NATO.\n  In conclusion, I want to say that we have had a very thoughtful and \nprincipled debate on this issue. This is not an easy decision; it is a \nvery important decision. Back in 1949, when the United States first \njoined NATO, it was also a momentous occasion, one that was noted in \nthe biography of President Harry Truman by David McCullough. Back then, \nhe wrote that joining NATO ``marked a radical departure with \ntradition--the first peacetime military alliance since the signing of \nthe Constitution--but had such an agreement existed in 1914 and 1939, \nTruman was convinced, the world would have been spared two terrible \nwars.''\n  The past 50 years have proven President Truman right. NATO has \nallowed democracy and free markets to thrive, has allowed peace to be \nmaintained within Europe, and that peace has inspired others within the \nformer Soviet Union. Today we have another opportunity. I hope that the \nexpansion of NATO, the entry of these three new countries into NATO, \nwill provide the same stability, the same peace, well into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Today, if we do in fact move forward and vote for the expansion, we \ntake on a very solemn and important obligation, and that is to make \nthis expansion work for peace and stability of the world, to ensure \nthat we have not only the plan but the resources to ensure that NATO \ncontinues to be a force for peace in Europe and around the world. I \nbelieve we can do that. I believe we must do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when I gave thought to what I wanted to \nsay today, the words and deeds of two great Americans came to my mind--\nthe words belong to Abraham Lincoln--the deeds were my father's.\n  In many respects, this debate was launched a half century ago in \nEurope. There, on the battlefields in Germany and France, Italy and \nBelgium, American soldiers fought and died to secure our future--our \nfreedom. My father was one of those men. Standing shoulder to shoulder \nwith friends, with fellow countrymen, he saw many fall in combat--never \nto rise again--never to return to their families--never to worship in \ntheir churches--to play an afternoon game of baseball with their sons \nand daughters.\n  My dad was proud to serve his country as a platoon guide--he was \nproud of the soldiers who became life-long friends, bound together over \ntime by their common mission.\n  Decades before Staff Sergeant McConnell shipped out to the Rhineland, \nAmerican heroism was memorialized in Lincoln's Address at Gettysburg. \nPresident Lincoln's words echoed across Europe's plains of courage and \nglory.\n\n       We cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what \n     we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It \n     is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated to the \n     unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so \n     nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to \n     the great task remaining before us . . . a new birth of \n     freedom.\n\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\n\n  Freedom.\n  That is the purpose President Lincoln defined for our nation--the \nnoble calling my father served--the mission we must finish here today.\n  The debate this week centers on the wisdom of America, once again, \nexpanding her horizons--adding to her security family--advancing \nfreedom.\n  To reach this point, the Senate and Administration have struggled, \noften in open conflict, to redefine the terms of our relationship with \nEurope, and more particularly, Russia. These deliberations are as much \nabout American responsibilities and interests, as they are about \nRussia's role and ambitions.\n  The commitment of my father and his fellow soldiers laid the moral \nfoundation of this debate. The politics of Europe's future followed \nlater and, to me, seemed joined in 1993. The Wall had fallen yet more \nthousands of Russian troops occupied the Baltic nations. Ever sensitive \nto Russian concerns, the Administration was reluctant to press Moscow \nto withdraw. Understandably, the Baltic nations were deeply concerned \nthat they would never be free from Russia's imperial grasp. Against \nstrong Administration opposition, the Senate voted 89-8 to condition \naid to Russia on achieving an agreement for a withdrawal timetable. \nRemarkably, within weeks, negotiators produced a concrete plan for \naction.\n  This was my first direct experience with Russia's approach to the \nregion. I think it is fair to say I learned a lesson Henry Kissinger \nsums up well--``It is, in fact, ambiguity about dividing lines not \ntheir existence, and ambivalence about Western reactions, not their \ncertainty that tempt nationalists and militarists.''\n  Sadly, fuzzy thinking, grey-beige lines and Moscow myopia continued \nto dog the Administration's European policy throughout 1993, 1994, and \ninto 1995. No where was this mistaken course more apparent that the \nAdministration's firm and abiding opposition to establishing a road map \nor criteria for admission to NATO. Senior officials engaged in a simple \nshell game arguing Eastern and Central European nations were not \nqualified to meet the standards to join NATO's ranks, yet they refused \nto define those standards. I recall a particularly frustrating session \nwhen Secretary Christopher appeared before the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, and I questioned him on this point. I asked him what \nexactly an applicant must do to join NATO? He claimed it was all \nspelled out in the NATO charter. ``Where?'' I pressed. ``Right there,'' \nhe demurred.\n  Of course, there were no specific terms for admission nor had any \nbeen imposed on other recent entrants. This game, which bent to Russian \ndemands not to expand NATO, continued, eventually taking on new shape \nwith the introduction of the Partnership for Peace. Dismissed by \nleaders in Poland as ``treachery'' and a ``second Yalta,'' the \nPartnership drew no admissions distinction between the historical \nvictims of Russian aggression and the aggressor--everyone was welcome \nto join!\n\n  The President's team explained that this approach avoided \nestablishing new blocs in Europe and would erase all dividing lines. \nWhat it erased was any sense of comfort in Central Europe about U.S. \nresolve, responsibility or commitment to stand up an ever ambitious \nKremlin as it widened control over what Moscow deemed its ``sphere of \ninfluence''.\n  Administration briefers and papers systematically dodged the serious \nsecurity issues related to expanding NATO. In preparing for a 1994 \nTreaty summit, Administration talking points declared, ``We do not \nbelieve the summit should set a specific timetable or criteria for \nmembership (in NATO) or identify preferred candidates . . . The \n(Partnership for Peace) will not give the Poles, Czechs or Hungarians \nall they want, but we think they will recognize it is an important step \nforward on NATO's part. At the same time it should not create problems \nin Russia.''\n  The explanation was dismissed by a characteristically blunt Lech \nWalesa as ``a tragedy''.\n  July of 1994 was the real low point in the drive to expand NATO. It \nis marked in my mind by two events: the Senate defeated 53-44 an \namendment I offered on admissions standards and the President traveled \nto Europe.\n  The amendment hardly seemed controversial--it was a reporting \nrequirement asking the President to define specific military, political \nand economic standards for admission to NATO and then provide an \nassessment of what it would take to guarantee that Poland, Hungary, the \nCzech Republic and Baltic nations were capable of fulfilling military \ninteroperability and other NATO responsibilities.\n  The Administration's overwhelming opposition was given a voice by the \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Pell, who warned \nthat this reporting requirement singled out certain countries and \n``draws dangerous new lines in Europe.''\n  Just about this time, President Clinton left for Poland. Ever \neloquent, he tried to reassure the Polish Assembly that the U.S. \n``would not allow the Iron Curtain to be replaced by the veil of \nindifference.'' His comments prompted the Chairman of their Foreign \nAffairs Committee to observe his speech was ``beautiful, but did little \nto satisfy our security expectations.'' Walesa publicly lamented the \nfact that the Administration did not seem to understand Poland's \n``history and geography cautioned not to take this moment for \ngranted.''\n  What turned this debate around? When exactly did the Administration \nstop taking Central European security for granted?\n  I can pinpoint the moment--the month--when I saw and heard the \nchange.\n  On February 9, 1995, Deputy Secretary Talbott appeared before the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee and spoke in vague generalities about \nAmerican ``hopes and expectations'' for European security. I asked \npoint blank, ``Is it correct that there is no timetable and no \ncriteria'' for admission to NATO? His response was simple, ``That is \ncorrect.''\n  In March, with the arrival of Richard Holbrooke as the new Assistant \nSecretary for European Affairs, the policy changed. In a little noticed \nappearance before the Subcommittee, Holbrooke announced a major \ndeparture in American policy. He said, ``Expanding NATO eastward is our \nhighest priority . . . if NATO is a 16 car train, with a car for each \nmember, the U.S. is clearly the engine.''\n  This was the clearest definition of American purpose and leadership I \nhad heard since President Clinton's election, and then Secretary \nHolbrooke went further. During the hearing, I asked and he answered six \nquestions bearing on the standards for NATO eligibility including the \nrelevance of democratic institutions, civilian control of the military, \nthe size and NATO compatability of the armed forces, and a nation's \nfinancial and infrastructure requirements. Getting straightforward \nanswers was ground breaking!\n\n  From that moment forward, I found cooperation and support for funding \nand program initiatives which strengthened the military capabilities of \npotential entrants. In 1996, 1997, and 1998 the Subcommittee was able \nto set aside funds for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and then \nLithuania, Estonia and Latvia to improve military training, equipment \nand capabilities with a view to accelerating their timetable for \nadmission.\n  Mr. President, I could argue that Mr. Holbrooke's assignment to the \nEuropean Bureau marked a key transition point in the NATO debate. \nHowever, there were many other factors which contributed to turning the \ntide. A shift in control of the Senate, our disastrous policy in \nBosnia, Russia's role in destabilizing Georgia and abominable conduct \nin Chechnya--among many factors focused attention on the urgent need to \nrevitalize U.S. leadership in a stronger Atlantic security alliance.\n  1995 marked the point when the Administration seemed to grasp a very \nbasic concept articulated by Henry Kissinger--``an alliance depends on \ndrawing lines around a specified territory that members undertake to \ndefend. Basing European and Atlantic security on a no-man's land \nbetween Germany and Russia runs counter to historical experience, \nespecially that of the interwar period.''\n  This Treaty reflects the fact that we have finally reached a point, \nwith bipartisan agreement, where we draw new, bright lines in Europe. \nThe vote this week affirms our commitment to protect our partners and \nour principles with an iron clad military guarantee.\n  Now is not the time for ambiguity. Today, is not the occasion to \nequivocate, qualify or confuse the message we\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\nsend to friends, allies and potential foe. Expanding our horizons and \nenlarging NATO safeguards our interests as it strengthens the sense of \nsecurity in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the next class of \nentrants.\n  Shortly before the Madrid summit, leaders across Europe were asked \nabout the importance and implications of expansion. Their answers offer \na commanding vision of American interests in NATO's future.\n  Czech President Vaclav Havel offered a compelling view:\n\n       Membership is the best tool for a collective European \n     defense, and for the defense of democratic values of states \n     under the rule of law . . . Members will now work together to \n     face a spectrum of threats, including local and regional \n     conflicts.\n\n  The Chairman of Lithuania's Parliament strengthens the case for \nexpansion:\n\n       NATO's declared open door policy . . . and firm stand on \n     the principle that the Baltic countries have an unrestricted \n     sovereign right to their own choice will only aid the \n     emerging new Russia in living up to its obligations of normal \n     European behavior.\n\n  Romania's President's goes further:\n\n       The process for preparing for NATO enlargement has led in \n     less than four years to a broad and profound stability and \n     solidarity in Central Europe.\n\n  Both he and Mr. Havel acknowledge that the enlargement process \nstimulated resolution of age-old border and ethnic policy disputes.\n  Poland's President's made a final point:\n\n       Enjoying traditionally close ties with the United States \n     and being at the same time a profoundly Europe oriented \n     society, Poland will contribute to the alliance's cohesion. \n     As for the military dimension, the alliance will gain \n     reliable and modernizing armed forces. We shall continue our \n     active policy aimed at ensuring Central Europe remains a zone \n     of stable and harmonious relations.\n\n  Central Europe's leaders have summed up with clarity and conviction \nthe strategic political, economic, and security justification both for \nNATO and its expansion. They make clear that the importance of our \ndecision this week will only increase over time.\n  While I am convinced of the arguments in favor of expansion, there is \none concern raised by some of my colleagues which I wish to address--\nthat is the doubt about providing security guarantees to new members.\n  I know there are Senators who would prefer to narrowly define the \nterms of participation of new members or limit our contribution or \ncommitment to their defense. Unfortunately, such determinations would \ncreate a caste system--dismissing new or future members to second class \ncitizen status. This would be a terrible mistake and undermine an \nalliance forged and strengthened by its tradition of common purpose, \ncommon defense, in short, a commitment to equality.\n  NATO's strength and credibility would be compromised by any decision \nto qualify new members with ambiguous standing. There should be no \nside-deals, doubts or questions raised about the deployment of weapons \nor troops on a new member's soil. This Treaty must be implemented with \nthe firm understanding that new members are full partners entitled to \nfull protection and expected to bear full responsibility. We cannot \ncreate damaging divisions within the alliance by imposing restrictions \non the nature of participation.\n  Only instability and uncertainty would result from creating such a \ndouble standard for defense. Only Democracy's opponents would gain \nground. Only those who have long maligned closing the gap between East \nand West--who yearn for the days of despots and communists kings--would \nwin.\n  We should not cast votes which serve to encourage Zhirinovsky's storm \ntroopers. Our call is to stand by the champions of free market \nprinciples--to stand up for the voices which appeal for democracy's \nday.\n  I'm sure there may still be a senator or two unconvinced that \nAmerican lives should be laid down to defend Budapest or Prague. Let me \nremind those colleagues of remarks made by Margaret Thatcher when she \ncalled Great Britain to the defense of the Falklands. She said, ``To \nthose--not many--who speak lightly of a few islanders beyond the seas \nand who ask the question, `Are they worth fighting for?' Let me say \nthis: right and wrong are not measured by a head count of those to whom \nthat wrong has been done. That would not be principle but expediency. \nThe Falklanders are not strangers. They are our own people.''\n  With more than 23 million Americans of Central and East European \ndescent, Prime Minister Thatcher's insight and the analogy reach across \nour nation into every community.\n  NATO exists to defend principle not expediency.\n  I know some of my colleagues feel we are rushing to judgment. For \nthose friends and colleagues, I call attention to the fact that I \nbelieve this debate has gone on at least five years--it has taken a \nlong time and much effort to bring the Administration to this important \ndecision.\n  The cause is important--the reasoning sound. Our vote to expand \nNATO's European frontier strengthens the pillars of democracy and free \nmarket principles, stimulates dispute resolution, balances and \nrestrains Russian ambitions, reduces military tensions, and adds new \nsecurity capabilities.\n  In short, we take one step closer to finishing the mission President \nLincoln called upon our nation to faithfully serve.\n  Freedom.\n  I know my father and his friends would have been proud to defend our \nchoice, our invitation to Poland, to Hungary and the Czech Republic to \njoin NATO.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, every one of us has memories of historical \nevents that stay with us forever. Those times in history that are so \nmomentous, they strike at our heart and leave a lasting imprint for all \nour years.\n  I think back to the fall of 1956, when the people of Hungary bravely \nrenounced the shackles of tyranny, only to have their dreams of freedom \nand democracy brutally suppressed. I will never forget sitting around \nthe television with my family, watching the TV footage of this major \nchallenge to Soviet rule be crushed by tanks. Those were dark days for \nHungary, as they were for Poland, the Czech Republic, and all nations \nbehind the Iron Curtain.\n  The memory of those times makes me appreciate to my core how \nwonderful it is that the countries of the former Soviet Union are now \nfree and that three of them have the opportunity to join the peaceful \ncommunity of nations that make up the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization. To me, the post-Cold War Era will be truly over when all \nthe nations of Europe--west and east--join in an alliance that will in \nand of itself indicate a Europe at peace.\n  Mr. President, I support NATO expansion, and do so for one primary \nreason: I truly believe that expanding the NATO alliance to include \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will lead to greater peace and \nsecurity throughout Eastern Europe--the same peace and security that \nAmerican leadership was able to provide Western Europe for the past 49 \nyears. In that time, no American soldier has had to fire a shot to \ndefend a NATO ally, nor has NATO ever had to wage war to fulfill its \nsecurity guarantees.\n  A peaceful, secure Europe is necessary for a peaceful, secure \nAmerica. We are inextricably linked. In two World Wars, American troops \nhave fought and died as a result of instability in Europe. Through \ncollective defense, an enlarged NATO will help reduce the chance of \nanother major European conflict.\n  The formation of NATO in 1949 has enabled Europe to flourish into the \nprosperous region it is today. I believe history will show that the \ntransformation of a war-ravaged Europe in the first half of the \ntwentieth century to the safe and secure Europe we have seen in the \nsecond half of the century is among the most remarkable achievements of \nour time. I believe NATO can bring that same stability to the former \nWarsaw Pact nations.\n  What is also remarkable are the recent achievements of Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic. These nations have made great strides \nto reform their economic and political systems to conform with \ninternational norms and to provide greater freedom for its citizens. \nThese nations have placed their armed forces under civilian control and \nhave resolved historical disputes that have threatened the region. In \nall, ten major accords have settled ethnic and border disputes \nthroughout Eastern Europe. These include agreements between Poland and \nLithuania, Poland\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nand the Ukraine, Hungary and Romania, Italy and Slovenia, Germany and \nthe Czech Republic.\n  During the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's thorough debate on \nthe NATO issue, Colonel Herbert Harman, the National Commander of the \nReserve Officers Association, stated that, ``over time, the defensive \nnature of NATO will become clear to all parties, and with it, the \nrealization that NATO threatens no one.'' I agree. NATO is strictly a \ndefensive alliance. It does not aim to pose a military threat to Russia \nor any other nation. I know some of my colleagues do not see it this \nway, but Russia is making moves toward democracy and those have been \nrecognized by the NATO-Russia Founding Act. The Founding Act, signed in \nMay 1997, created the Permanent Joint Council, a useful forum where \nNATO and Russia can consult on security issues of mutual interest. This \nwill help facilitate a trusting and constructive relationship between \nNATO and Russia. Last fall, Ambassador Thomas Pickering put it best \nwhen he said, ``it is in the security interest of the United States, \nNATO, and the States of Central Europe to have constructive relations \nwith Moscow, and to integrate a peaceful Russia into the world \ncommunity.'' I would also point out that NATO has an open door policy \nto other nations wishing to join NATO, including Russia, as long as \nNATO members determine it would promote European security and the \nstrategic interests of the Alliance.\n  Mr. President, there is a long list of high-ranking officials and \norganizations who support NATO expansion. These include every living \nformer Secretary of State, the former Majority Leader Senator Dole, \nformer National Security Adviser Colin Powell, several veterans \ngroups--including the American Legion--and many, many others. Let us \nhear the thoughts of some of these distinguished people on NATO \nexpansion.\n  Secretary Henry Kissinger says that NATO enlargement ``represents \nabove all an overriding American political interest.'' Secretary James \nBaker claims, ``The Cold War's legacy of great power confrontation in \nEurope will be truly ended only when it is replaced by a collaborative \nstructure between former antagonists. The expansion of NATO should be \nseen in this light.'' Our current Secretary of State, Madeleine \nAlbright, states that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, ``will \nnot just be consumers of security by the United States but producers of \na more secure Europe; and also because the United States has interests \nin Europe, producers of security for the United States.'' Senator Dole \nmaintains, ``The enlargement of NATO will strengthen security, freedom, \nand peace in Europe. It will secure the gains of democracy in Central \nEurope.''\n  Once again, I support expanding NATO to include the nations of \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and want to thank both the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nfor all their hard work on this historic issue. Let me end with the \nwords of President Clinton, who said, ``A new NATO can extend the \nblessings of freedom and security in a new century . . . we can bring \nEurope together--not by force of arms, but by possibilities of peace. \nThat is the promise of this moment. And we must seize it.''\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of the \nleader, that the following amendments, declarations, and conditions be \nthe only remaining in order, other than the pending amendment, and \nfollowing the disposition of the listed issues, the Senate proceed to \nvote on the committee reported amendment, as amended, to be followed by \nadoption of the resolution of ratification, all without further action \nor debate, following 90 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The list of amendments, declarations and conditions is as follows: An \namendment by Senators Warner and Moynihan mandating a 3-year \nmoratorium, under a 2-hour agreement, with an up-or-down vote; Senator \nMoynihan's amendment that defers membership until members of EU, under \na 1-hour agreement; Senator Stevens' amendment on cost; Senator \nStevens' amendment on caps; Senator Inhofe's amendment on submission of \nthe Kyoto Protocol; Senator Robert Smith's amendment on Bosnia;  \nSenator Conrad, tactical nuclear weapons; Senator Nickles, strategic \nconcept of NATO; Senator Bingaman, Baltics; Senator Bingaman, strategic \nconcepts; Senator Harkin, costs; Senator Harkin, arms control; Senator \nBiden, relevant amendment; and Senator Helms, relevant amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after extensive study, discussions, and \ndeliberation, I have decided to vote against ratifying the treaty to \nexpand NATO. Since my college days, when I wrote my senior thesis on \nU.S.-U.S.S.R. relations, I have supported a strong U.S. role in \ninternational affairs. I oppose NATO expansion now because it does not \nfulfill NATO's basic purpose in countering the U.S.S.R. military threat \nthat existed from 1945 to 1991 but, instead, creates a new potential \nthreat from Russia.\n  As a frequent participant in the North Atlantic Assembly meetings \nsince the spring 1981 session in Venice, I have always felt that the \nUnited States consistently paid more than its fair share of the NATO \nburden. Our national interests were so substantial in countering the \nSoviet threat in Western Europe that it was worthwhile not to withdraw \nbecause other nations did not do their part in burden sharing.\n  As noted in my votes and previous floor statements, I do not believe \nour vital national interests justify the extent of our contribution in \nBosnia. In my judgment, that is a matter where European nations should \nhave taken charge. It is always hard to say when century-old \nhostilities in the Balkans may threaten the peace, but the issue is \nsufficiently a European obligation that I do not think the United \nStates should again be pulling the ``laboring oar''--that is, doing \nmore than our share.\n  The inclusion in NATO of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary is \nthe unmistakable start of bringing in more nations than the United \nStates should be obligated to defend. It is getting us deeper into \npotential quicksand, like Bosnia. Perhaps even more important, \nincluding those countries poses more of a risk of a Russian military \naction against them than assurances of their national security. There \nis the obvious risk that Russia, with a deteriorating army, may choose \nto use its enormous nuclear arsenal.\n  The representations that Russian President Boris Yeltsin does not \nobject to NATO enlargement do not answer the threat that Russia might \nretaliate under a new leader. President Yeltsin's government is \nunstable. His health may be even worse. Radical Russian elements have \nalready used NATO expansion as a potential argument to take over the \nRussian Presidency. Final action on expansion of NATO may give them the \npolitical weapon to succeed. So instead of strengthening NATO, the \nexpansion may subject NATO to attack with the possible focus on its \nnewest members.\n  In 1949, the United States and its allies in Europe literally joined \nforces to define the post-World War II world. The North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization was established with a clear mission: collective defense \nof its members. NATO became the centerpiece of the U.S. policy of \ncollective security and defined our military commitment to our allies \nin Europe. Throughout the Cold War, NATO protected U.S. interests and \nU.S. allies in Europe by providing a framework through which to \novercome the political instabilities in post war Europe. NATO started \nout as a military alliance of 12 members and eventually expanded to a \nmilitary alliance of 16 members. Turkey and Greece have been members \nsince 1952, Germany since 1955, and Spain since 1982.\n  Then, in 1989, the political landscape in Europe changed. The Berlin \nWall fell. The Cold War was over. The Warsaw Pact disbanded. In 1990, \nthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics disintegrated. In its stead, \nacross central and eastern Europe and in Russia itself, fledgling \ngovernments began the transition to democracy and market-oriented \neconomies. The original goal of NATO had been fulfilled.\n  Immediately after the fall of communism, NATO began to reevaluate its \nrole and purpose. NATO has redefined\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\nits organization to focus not only on collective defense, but also on \n``promoting stability throughout Europe through cooperation and by \ndeveloping the means for collective crisis management and \npeacekeeping.'' Furthermore, what started out as a military \norganization of first 12 then 16 nations is now holding out the \npossibility of membership for at least 12 new members and even more if \nthe Administration's rhetoric comes to fruition.\n  My former colleagues Senator Howard Baker and Senator Sam Nunn, along \nwith former national security advisor Brent Scowcroft and Alton Frye \nfrom the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in February that the \nAdministration's premise that NATO should be open to many additional \nmembers ``is a prescription for destroying the alliance'' which will \nantagonize Russia. In their words, NATO expansion is ``an ill-defined \ninvitation for new members unrelated to either military threats or \nmilitary capabilities.''\n  I agree with their interpretation that an expanded NATO is unrelated \nto current military threats and capabilities. I question U.S. \nparticipation in an organization increasingly devoted to ``crisis \nmanagement and peacekeeping.'' While NATO was originally designed to \ncounter the threat of communism, it will increasingly be called upon to \ncounter new threats facing the region: particularly civil unrest and \nethnic conflict in Eastern and Central Europe. Membership in NATO \ninvolves a serious commitment to defend other members if attacked. As \nNATO expands, the United States may well be obligating itself to become \ninvolved in a potentially great number of conflicts that are strictly \nEuropean in nature and not a direct threat to vital U.S. national \nsecurity interests. I do not believe the United States should commit to \ninvolvement in ethnic and civil hotspots throughout Europe, but should \nreserve the option to decide on such involvement on a case by case \nbasis.\n  Furthermore, NATO reports from the July 1997 NATO summit in Madrid \nstate that the end of the Cold War has provided the opportunity to \n``build an improved security architecture in the whole of the Euro-\nAtlantic area without recreating dividing lines.'' This line of \nreasoning is unsound. If NATO is in fact to remain a primarily military \nalliance, how can including new members not recreate dividing lines? It \nis likely that the new dividing lines will antagonize Russia.\n  Last year, in an open letter to the President, 50 former Senators, \ncabinet secretaries and ambassadors, as well as arms control advisors \nand foreign policy experts, called for postponement of NATO expansion \nuntil other security options are explored. In their letter, they \nexpressed concerns about drawing ``a new line of division in Europe, \nbetween the `ins' and the `outs' of NATO,'' which would actually work \nto increase regional instability and decrease the security of those not \nincluded.\n  George Kennan, most noted for the policy of containment of Russian \nexpansive tendencies, who later disclaimed the view that containment \nmeant stationing military forces around Soviet borders, wrote in the \nNew York Times last year that ``expanding NATO would be the most \nfateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era.'' He \nwent on to ask:\n\n       Why, with all the hopeful possibilities engendered by the \n     end of the cold war, should East-West relations become \n     centered on the question of who would be allied with whom \n     and, by implication, against whom in some fanciful, totally \n     unforeseeable and most improbable future military conflict?\n\n  Kennan pointed out that the Russians are not impressed with American \nassurances that NATO expansion does not reflect hostile intentions. In \nfact, he notes, the Russians ``would continue to regard it as a rebuff \nby the West and would likely look elsewhere for guarantees of a secure \nfuture.'' What comes to mind is forcing Russia to move even closer to \nChina or Iran.\n  Michael Brown, then senior fellow at the Center for Science and \nInternational Affairs at Harvard, cautioned early on in 1994, when NATO \nwas first addressing the question of new members, that ``NATO expansion \nshould be tied to strategic circumstances: If Russia takes steps to \nthreaten Central Europe militarily, NATO should offer membership to as \nmany states in the region as possible.'' Otherwise, Brown pointed out, \ncorrectly I think, that ``Russian aggression would be encouraged, not \ndiscouraged by NATO expansion.''\n  Potential Russian presidential candidates are already preparing \nthemselves for the next Russian presidential election in 2000 and NATO \nexpansion is already on the platform. Alexander Lebed, a likely top \ncontender for the Russian presidency, wrote in an opinion piece last \nyear that NATO expansion is drawing Russia into ``a process of mutual \nprovocations.'' He cautioned that ``a reversion to old ways threatens \nthe system of agreements which until recently had provided stability in \nEurope.''\n  One year later, the Russians remain quite clear on how they view NATO \nexpansion. Russia's ambassador to the United States, Yuli Vorontsov, \ncommented in the March 10, 1998 Washington Post on what he calls the \n``authentic Russian view'' of NATO expansion.\n  In his article, Ambassador Vorontsov advises that ``Russia's attitude \ntoward NATO enlargement has been and remains unequivocally negative. \nThe signing of the Russia-NATO Founding Act does not alter that \nattitude in any manner.'' He goes on to say, ``If enlargement goes \nforward, there are no guarantees that everything positive we have \ndeveloped in the relationship between Russia and leading Western \ncountries will not be put in severe jeopardy.''\n  The most telling Russian reaction to date has been the Russian Duma's \ndelayed vote on ratification of the START II treaty. Lebed contends \nthat the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and other arms control \ntreaties could all be reconsidered.\n  In my college senior thesis, I was very much impressed by the famous \nwords of Winston Churchill, which he gave in a 1939 London radio \nbroadcast when he was first lord of the admiralty. Commenting on his \ninability to forecast the action of Russia, Churchill described Russia \nas ``* * * a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.'' But \nperhaps more telling is the oft-forgotten phrase following. Churchill \nwent on to say that ``* * * perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian \nnational interest.'' NATO expansion is clearly not in the Russian \nnational interest, and the West can expect Russia to react accordingly.\n  I believe that the United States and Russia must maintain a real \nbalance of power if we are going to coexist as peaceful nations. \nClearly, if NATO is to remain a strictly military alliance, expanding \nNATO to the east means tilting the balance of power toward the west. If \nthe desire is to create greater economic and political cooperation \namong Western and Central European nations, there are already existing \norganizations such as the European Union, the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe and others to take up this task.\n  Many claim that there is now a security vacuum in Central Europe that \nNATO expansion can address. On the contrary, I believe NATO expansion \nis creating just such a vacuum. It is implausible to think that Russia \nwould send conventional troops into Central Europe any time soon.\n  While it is probable that there are lingering fears of Russian \naggression in the countries of Central Europe, Russia's current Army \ncapabilities make such an advance next to impossible. Furthermore, the \nWest would never tolerate a repeat of past Russian aggression in these \ncountries.\n  On the other hand, it is plausible to think that Russia will revisit \nthe status of its relations with the Baltic nations, Ukraine and \nBelarus. Oddly enough, these may be the countries most likely to be \nadversely affected by NATO expansion and the very nations not to be \nincluded in the first round of new members. We must also not forget \nRussian military involvement in Georgia and in the Armenia-Azerbaidjan \nconflict. How will NATO expansion influence Russian military action in \nthe Caucasus?\n  In 1992, I presented remarks at the North Atlantic Assembly meeting \nin the Netherlands while I was part of a Senate delegation visiting the \nAssembly, commenting then that there was an unease among the American \npeople over the cost of U.S. foreign relations obligations. That is not \nto say that the predominant U.S. view would ever return to the \nisolationist ideology of the\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\n1930s, but the question I posed then was: What is fair and equitable? \nAs a longtime member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, I believe many Americans still feel \nthe same unease when it comes to U.S. contributions to areas clearly \noutside our vital national interests.\n  Again in 1993, after returning from the next North Atlantic Assembly \nmeeting, in remarks on the Senate floor, I commented on the debate \nunder way in NATO at the time on inviting new members to join the \nalliance. There were signs at the time that NATO and the North Atlantic \nAssembly were looking more toward economic matters than defense \nmatters. Furthermore, when we talked to the Director of the Center for \nStrategic Stability, he made the point that the Russians were very \nconcerned about an expanding alliance. The concern then was what would \nhappen with respect to Russia being isolated. I do not believe this \nquestion has been adequately addressed.\n  Last January, I made remarks on the Senate floor concerning my \nparticipation in the 1996 North Atlantic Assembly meeting. I noted that \nNATO has been perhaps the most successful international collective \nsecurity arrangement in the world's history, ultimately achieving its \nonce thought unattainable goal of containing and outlasting the empire \nof the former Soviet Union through a vigilant deterrence rather than \nactual conflict. It was this successful because it was more than a \nmutual defense pact. It is the coming together, across the Atlantic, of \nthe power of the ideas of freedom and democracy. However, I pointed out \nthat NATO's very success in achieving its original aim is the basis of \nthe present quandary of the alliance. I asked then, and I repeat now: \nIn the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union there are many \nreasons--including our responsibility to wisely spend American \ntaxpayers' dollars--why we must ask what is NATO for now, what \ncountries should be a part of the Alliance, and what roles and burdens \nshould be played and borne by the different members of the North \nAtlantic community?\n\n  In the year since I gave these remarks, there has been much \ndiscussion and debate on NATO expansion, here in the Senate and in the \nmedia. I believe the situation now in Bosnia gives us reason to pause \nand reflect on these questions before we commit the United States to \neven more security obligations in Eastern and Central Europe.\n  During my visit last December to Bosnia, I asked our troops to \nestimate how long we would need to stay there to avoid the resumption \nof bloodshed which would happen if they left on Congress' schedule. The \nanswer was a ``generation,'' given the intensity and longevity of the \nreligious and ethnic tensions in the region. There is no doubt about \nthe dire consequences if fighting resumes among the Muslims, Serbs and \nCroats. The entire region would be destabilized. Certainly, the current \nsituation in Kosovo is cause for great alarm. Russia has come out on \nthe side of the Serbs against the United States and Europe. In the \nshort term, the ability of the West to work with Russia will aid in the \nresolution of this issue. This picture changes in the long-term. \nAlbania, Kosovo's neighbor to the south, is on the long list of \ncountries proposed for NATO membership.\n  There is significant question as to how far can U.S. military \nresources be stretched on the current $268 billion defense budget. The \ntop military brass in Bosnia had no answer to my question on priorities \nin deciding how to spend among Bosnia, Korea, Iran, Iraq and the \nworld's other hot spots.\n  Now we add to this the additional costs of NATO expansion. Although \nthe Administration says the total cost of expansion will be $27 to $35 \nbillion--the U.S. portion being $1.5-$2 billion over 10 years--other \nestimates for the cost of NATO expansion range as high as $125 billion. \nThere are many unanswered questions about the cost of NATO expansion.\n  We have good reason to conclude that the estimates of the \nadministration as usual, are deceptively low.\n  If we use Bosnia as an example, how much more are we willing to spend \nin Europe than the Europeans themselves? Doing our part does not mean \ndoing more than other major European nations. This is not the Cold War \nwhere the United States squared off against the USSR and our dominant \nrole in NATO protected our vital national interests. Obviously, Bosnian \nstability is of much greater concern to the European nations than it is \nto the U.S. although you wouldn't know it from the contributions in \nBosnia today. This also does not mean that the United States cannot \nplay an important strategic role in the region, for the United States \nhas played a successful leading role in the War Crimes Tribunal for the \nFormer Yugoslavia.\n  The United States will always play a role in peace and security in \nEurope. We all applaud the great success of the new countries of \nEastern and Central Europe on their transition to democracy and free-\nmarket economies. However, as we move into the 21st century, I believe \nthis is not the time for NATO expansion.\n  We would be moving away from the basic premise that NATO was expanded \nto protect Western Europe from Soviet attack. We would be looking at a \nRussia now, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which is not \nstable. We are trying to build up our relationships with Russia. \nCertainly this would be very counterproductive.\n  As I noted earlier, I recall very well in my studies at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania noting in my college thesis on United \nStates-U.S.S.R. relations the description of Winston Churchill that \nRussian foreign policy was a mystery surrounded by a puzzle wrapped in \nan enigma. It is puzzling as to what the Russian will do next. They are \nenigmatic.\n  While we are on the path which has a reasonable possibility of \nleading to peace and stability, the inclusion of new NATO members I do \nbelieve would be counterproductive.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the expansion of NATO at this time.\n  I intend to vote against the ratification of this treaty.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I have \nlistened rather attentively to the debate the past 3 days. It has all \nbeen heartfelt. A lot of it has been very thoughtful. I think it has \nbeen instructive for the Senate to hear this debate.\n  I spent a lot of time reading a lot of articles, doing a lot of \nresearch and trying to reach a conclusion that I felt not only was \ncorrect, but one that I would feel very comfortable with not just today \nbut in future years.\n  I have heard a lot of people say the average man on the street in \nRussia does not really care about NATO expansion. I agree with that. He \nor she doesn't care about it right now, just as the American people are \nnot zeroed in on partial-birth abortion right now. But you wait until \nOctober and November comes and all those 30-second spots start \nappearing on television, and those awful, barbaric films are shown just \nbefore the election, and you will find that virtually everybody in \nAmerica cares about that issue. And when the election in Russia is held \nin the year 2000, you can rest assured the hard-liners are going to \nhave a picnic.\n  Mr. President, I have read a number of times that we should not let \nthe Russian hard-liners dictate our foreign policy. I agree with that. \nBy the same token, I do not think we ought to gratuitously allow the \nRussian hard-liners to dictate internal policy in Russia as well as \nforeign policy to come.\n  I am one who believes that peace on the Eurasian Continent and \nprobably in the world is dependent on our engaging Russia over the next \nseveral years. I do not denigrate any of the arguments for \nratification. I think a lot of the arguments are very compelling for \nexpanding NATO. But when I weigh what I believe will be the cost \nsometime in the future compared to the benefits, I believe the cost is \nlikely to far outweigh the benefits.\n  What do we get out of it? Not NATO but the United States. How are we \nenriched? How is our security aided by taking in these three countries? \nIf, as I believe at some point the hard-liners in Russia are going to \nhave a field day with this, just as there are people in this body and \nin the United States who cannot give up on the cold war, I think we are \ngoing to pay a heavy price.\n  Nobody should cling to the naive belief that a lot of this expansion \nis not dictated by the hard-liners in this country. We have our own. We \nhave\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\npeople who after 50 years of fearing the great Russian bear and \ncommunism and the Soviet Union have a very difficult time turning loose \nthat philosophy.\n  I hear it said that we gave our word to Poland, the Czech Republic, \nand Hungary, and we must follow through on our word. I hear it said \nthat they have suffered enough. And God knows, we can all relate to \nthat. We all know what Eastern Europe endured under the foot of \ncommunism and the U.S.S.R. for 45 years after World War II. Not only \nare we sympathetic, in my opinion, without the expansion of NATO, the \nUnited States and our allies in Europe would come to the rescue of any \nof these countries if they were threatened. But we should bear in mind \nalso in that connection that it was not Russia, it was not the Soviet \nUnion that invaded Czechoslovakia, that invaded Poland and Hungary.\n  We hear all of these soothing assurances from proponents of \nenlargement that NATO is a defensive alliance; we have no aggressive \nintentions. I believe that. Of course, that is true. But I am not \nRussia. I ask the Members of this body, if the shoe were on the other \nfoot how would they feel? Incidentally, I might say that one of the \nmost powerful speeches I have ever heard made on the Senate floor was \nabout 30 seconds long during the Panama Canal Treaty debate. That was \nby far the most volatile political issue to confront this body since I \nhave been in the Senate. Everybody that was going to vote for it--and \nit had 67 votes--was trying to cleanse their skirts with their \nconstituents back home. And Henry Bellmon, a wonderful Republican \nSenator from Oklahoma, stood at his desk at about where the Senator \nfrom Indiana is seated right now and said: ``I have agonized about this \nfor 6 weeks. The President's called me. The Secretary of State's called \nme, and people on the other side have called me. Mr. President, I have \ndecided that I think we ought to treat the Panamanians the way we would \nwant to be treated, and therefore I am going to vote for the \ntreaties.'' He shortly thereafter announced he would not run again \nbecause he knew he could not possibly be reelected in Oklahoma with \nthat vote. You talk about a profile in courage. That is probably the \nmost dramatic illustration of it I have seen since I have been in the \nSenate.\n\n  And so I ask you this: If this treaty were being executed by Russia, \nMexico and Canada, and Russia was saying not to worry, don't worry \nabout us lining up with Mexico and Canada on your border, we have no \naggressive intentions, how would that go over?\n  Mr. President, we cannot deny what this treaty is all about. It is to \nhem Russia in. The Russians are not stupid.\n  Look at some of the declarations in the resolution itself. Paragraph \n(2)(A)(i). It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding the collapse of communism in most of Europe \n     and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States \n     and its NATO allies face threats to their stability and \n     territorial integrity including [listen to this] the \n     potential for the emergence of a hegemonic power in Europe.\n\n  That is No. 1. ``The potential for the emergence of a hegemonic power \nin Europe.''\n  Now, the Russians would never guess who we were referring to with \nthat. Further:\n\n       The invasion of Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic, or \n     their destabilization arising from external subversion, would \n     threaten the stability of Europe and jeopardize vital United \n     States national security interests.\n\n  Who would invade Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic? The Russians \nwould never guess who we were referring to in this resolution.\n  Listen to this:\n\n       Extending NATO membership to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n     Republic will strengthen NATO, enhance security and stability \n     in Central Europe, deter potential aggressors, and thereby \n     advance the interests of the United States and its NATO \n     allies.\n  Question: Who do you think the potential aggressor is?\n  Or, perhaps the Russians will never see or know about a letter I \nreceived in my office last week from Mr. Bruce Jackson, president of \nthe United States Committee to Expand NATO. Here is what he said:\n\n       Dear Senator:\n       I am forwarding a copy of Charles Krauthammer's opinion \n     piece which appeared on April 17 in the Washington Post while \n     the Senate was in recess. While I cannot say that every \n     member of the U.S. Committee to Expand NATO shares Dr. \n     Krauthammer's views on Russia, we are in complete agreement \n     with his conclusion:\n       NATO expansion is simply a return to--a ratification of \n     normality . . . It is the easiest U.S. foreign policy call of \n     the decade.\n       If you need any additional information, call me.\n\n  This is the Committee to Expand NATO, saying we agree with virtually \neverything Dr. Krauthammer said in his article in the Washington Post. \nAnd what did Dr. Krauthammer say? Listen to this headline. This is the \nheadline of the Krauthammer article that that committee says they agree \nwith totally. ``Is NATO expansion directed against Russia? Of course it \nis.''\n  What would our response be if we were in Russia's shoes? Their \nconventional forces are in shambles, their economy is a basket case, \ntheir people are demoralized and they are experiencing the fifth \nconsecutive year of economic negative growth. The most dangerous thing \nin the world is for a bully to jump on somebody who is weak. You know \nwhat I have always said? I think government has a role in our lives. I \nthink government has a role in protecting the weak from the bully. I am \nnot saying the United States is a bully. But I am saying, when we \nexpand NATO at a time when Russia is on their hunkers and everybody \nknows it--mostly the Russians--what would our response be? We have \nassured Russia orally we will not put nuclear weapons in Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic. But we have refused to put that in \nwriting. You think of that.\n  Again, I am going to come back to the broken promise of all broken \npromises in just a moment. But here we are telling Russia that we will \nnot put nuclear weapons in the three countries that we are taking into \nNATO, ``So you have nothing to fear.'' But we don't want to put it in \nwriting. And yesterday the U.S. Senate, by a vote of 90 to 9, said the \nvery foundation of NATO requires a nuclear presence in Europe and those \nthree countries were not excluded in that amendment.\n  The Russians would have to be naive beyond all imagination to believe \nthat Dr. Krauthammer wasn't saying it exactly right. NATO enlargement \nis designed to hem Russia in.\n  Mr. President, the last time Russia took our word for something was \nin 1990. It was in a meeting during a meeting between Secretary of \nState Baker and Mikhail Gorbachev, and the promise was very simple, \naccording to Jack Matlock, who was our Ambassador to Russia at the \ntime. When the Soviet empire was falling apart and the Germans were \nclamoring to reunify the west and east, we promised Mikhail Gorbachev \nthat if he would not interfere with the reunification of Germany, we \nwould never move NATO 1 foot further east toward Russia. I have no \ndocumentation to prove that, but I called Jack Matlock, who knows what \nhappened, and asked him. He assured me in roughly a 30-minute \nconversation, over and over and over, that not only did the United \nStates promise Russia we would not move any further--wouldn't move NATO \nany further east toward Russia, Helmut Kohl later joined in the \npromise. I am not saying that Gorbachev had that much option. I am \nsaying we made the promise. Again, an oral promise.\n  Let me go back to the rationale some people use for saying we have to \ngo through with this. It is because we promised the Czech Republic, \nPoland, and Hungary that we would do it. How about our promises to \nRussia that we would not?\n  So, what are we doing to Russia? We are forcing them to rely more and \nmore heavily on nuclear weapons. And the more you rely on nuclear \nweapons, the lower the hair trigger for nuclear war. Why are they \ndepending on nuclear weapons? It is cheaper. They can maintain a \nnuclear force at a fraction of the cost of maintaining a conventional \nforce in case NATO did attack them.\n\n  Are we safer with the Russians depending on nuclear weapons? Of \ncourse we are not. That is another big negative to this whole thing. \nAnd the Duma says they are not going to ratify START II. Maybe they \nwill. I hear arguments on both sides of that. But I can tell you this, \nSTART II is extremely important to the security of the world and it is \nextremely important to the security of the United States. But the Duma \nhas not ratified\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\nit. They have talked about it for almost 2 years now and they have not \nratified it.\n  So, what does that mean? It means we have to maintain our nuclear \nforces on a high state of readiness, at an extra cost of several \nbillion dollars a year. There has been a lot of talk about who is going \nto pay for all of the new weaponry for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic. Nobody has mentioned the fact that instead of destroying \nweapons, as we would under START II, we may very well not only keep \nthem but keep them on a high state of readiness, and it is already \ncosting us several billion dollars a year to maintain the extra nuclear \nforces.\n  What are our friends in Russia saying? Mr. President, I feel this may \nbe the most salient point I can make in the debate on why I do not \nintend to vote for the expansion of NATO. What are our friends--who we \nare depending on to democratize and bring sanity to the Soviet Union \nand bring that poor, bedraggled nation into the 20th century--what are \nthey saying?\n  Victor Chernomyrdin, everybody thought he was a rational, moderate \nperson. Vice President Gore is genuinely fond of him and met with him \nmany times. What does he think about this? Here is what he said:\n\n       We will never agree that the expansion of NATO is needed \n     now, since its doctrine of confrontation with the Warsaw \n     Pact, the Soviet Union and Russia, has not essentially \n     changed.\n\n  That is one of our good friends. Then: The Russian Federation \nNational Security Blueprint which was signed by Boris Yeltsin:\n\n       The prospect of NATO expansion to the east is unacceptable \n     to Russia since it represents a threat to its national \n     security.\n\n  What did the State Duma, the principal legislative body in Russia, \nsay 3 months ago? This wasn't way back in the past, it was January 23 \nthis year. They passed a resolution saying:\n\n       Given the weakening of Russia's defense capacity, NATO \n     enlargement means the appearance of the most serious military \n     threat to our country since 1954.\n\n  And here is Yuli Vorontsov, Ambassador to the United States:\n\n       I would say that movement of NATO forces close to the \n     Russian borders is generally being considered by all \n     political forces in Russia as a threat. You can ask anybody \n     there. Do not just ask Communists; we know what they will \n     say. Ask liberals, ask democrats, ask young and ask old. \n     Nobody in Russia is applauding this move, because everybody \n     is afraid it is going to be a military threat.\n\n  That is what our friends in Russia say. What they say is, ``You're \ncutting our legs off right under us. We want to be friends. We want \nRussia to move into the 21th century, and we want peace on the Eurasian \ncontinent. So what in the name of God are you doing threatening us with \nthis expansion?''\n  Bill Clinton made one of the most poignant statements he has ever \nmade in his life back in 1992 when he was running for President. April \n1992--listen to this beautiful statement:\n\n       What does a democratic Russia mean to Americans? Lower \n     defense spending, a reduced nuclear threat, a diminished risk \n     of environmental disasters, fewer arms exports and less \n     proliferation, access to Russia's vast resources through \n     peaceful commerce, and the creation of a major new market for \n     American goods and services.\n\n  That is what President Clinton said in a beautiful statement in 1992 \nwhen he was candidate Clinton.\n  What does Admiral Bill Crowe say? And Admiral Crowe, incidentally, \nfavors the expansion of NATO, but he wrote some beautiful words about \nit. Listen to it. I think everybody in this body and everybody whoever \nknew him has a profound respect for Bill Crowe, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, recently Ambassador to the Court of St. James. He \nsaid:\n\n       Put bluntly, the outcome of events in Russia can directly \n     affect the future of the free world. The epic journey of that \n     great nation is far from over . . . If the Russian people \n     ultimately return to some form of autocracy, it would be a \n     genuine disaster, not only for them but for us as well. In \n     essence, I would judge that Russia is our number one foreign \n     policy challenge, and it would be folly to treat it \n     otherwise.\n\n  Yet we are engaging in precisely what he said--folly. What did Jack \nMatlock, who was our Ambassador to the Soviet Union at the time, say?\n\n       In making a major effort to bring more members into NATO \n     when countries who wish to join face no military threat, the \n     administration undermines its ability to protect the United \n     States and its allies from potential nuclear leakage from \n     Russia.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Russia may have no choice other than to accept an enlarged \n     NATO, but in the ensuing atmosphere of political \n     estrangement, close cooperation in nuclear matters, never \n     easy, will become even more difficult. It will also be much \n     harder to maintain the momentum of weapons destruction if it \n     appears to Russian military planners that they must maintain \n     a nuclear option in order to balance an expanding NATO.\n\n  Mr. President, did you know that we have spent billions of dollars in \nRussia helping them dismantle their nuclear weapons? That is what we \ncall Nunn-Lugar money around here. It is the best money we have ever \nspent. I promise you, Mr. President, I promise you that the Russians \nare going to ultimately say, ``Get out. We thought you were serious \nabout dismantling our nuclear weapons and dismantling yours, but if you \nare going to treat us this way and show this kind of bad faith toward \nour good faith in dismantling our nuclear weapons and letting you do \nit, it is over.''\n  Our former colleague Sam Nunn who was the most revered person on \nmilitary matters I ever served with--and believe you me, Sam Nunn and I \nhad plenty of disagreements--is opposed to NATO expansion. Here is what \nSam Nunn said:\n\n       I believe it is essential for the Clinton administration \n     and our allies to start laying the groundwork now for a \n     ``soft landing'' for U.S.-Russian relations in the wake of \n     NATO enlargement. Unless this is accomplished soon, there \n     will be a significant deterioration in U.S.-Russian and \n     allied-Russian relations, and a political climate may \n     emerge in Russia which erodes the ability and the \n     willingness of Russian leaders to make rational decisions \n     on critical foreign policy matters.\n       Even those Russians who are most inclined to seek \n     compromise and who see no military threat in the admission of \n     Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO would find \n     the expansion of NATO into the geopolitical space claimed by \n     the former Soviet Union intolerable.\n\n  Of course they find it intolerable.\n  Mr. President, I do not speak out of fear of Russia. I do not speak \nout of denigration of my colleagues who think this is absolutely the \nright thing to do. It is no secret that President Clinton and I have \nbeen close friends for 25 years, and I have, I think, the best record \nin the Senate of supporting his legislation. Maybe one other Senator \nhas a better record than I have. But I think he would be the first \nperson to understand my strong feelings that this is a mistake.\n  When I about this subject, I think of all throughout history, from \nNapoleon to Hitler, who have underestimated Russia. And I can tell you \nwe are underestimating Russia, we are assuming that she is always going \nto be an economic basket case, that she will never be able to build her \nconventional forces and that she will always accept our soothing \nassurances that our intentions are defensive and not offensive.\n  One of the best books I ever read in my life, Mr. President, is \ncalled ``The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam,'' by Barbara \nTuchman. No young person should be allowed to graduate from high school \nand certainly not from college without reading Barbara Tuchman's ``The \nMarch of Folly.''\n  Bill Lind, who most of the people in this body know, an expert on \nmilitary affairs of some note, widely respected, wrote an article about \nNATO enlargement not long ago, and he refers to this magnificent book, \n``The March of Folly.'' He said:\n\n       It is folly to humiliate a Great Power during an historical \n     moment of weakness. It is folly to reignite a cold war within \n     the West--and Russia is rightfully part of the West--as the \n     world moves into an era of conflicts among cultures. It is \n     folly to risk pushing a weak Russian government further \n     toward loss of legitimacy, when its replacement may be a \n     variety of non-state entities ranging from mafias through \n     religious groupings, some of which would inevitably possess \n     remnants of the Soviet nuclear arsenal.\n\n  Bill Lind goes on to say:\n\n       In her glorious book, ``The March of Folly,'' Barbara \n     Tuchman writes: ``A phenomenon noticeable throughout history \n     regardless of place or period is the pursuit by governments \n     of policies contrary to their own interests. Mankind, it \n     seems, makes a poorer performance of government than of \n     almost any other human activity. In this sphere, wisdom, \n     which may be defined as the exercise of judgment acting on \n     experience, common sense and available information, is less \n     operative and more frustrated than it should be. Why do \n     holders of high office so often act contrary to the way \n     reason points and enlightened self-interest suggests?''\n\n  Mr. President, Barbara Tuchman's definition of ``the march of folly'' \nwas\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\nwhen nations take action, and there is a small minority of people \nsaying, ``If you do this, you're going to be sorry,'' and it turns out \nthe warning was not heeded. Nations went ahead headlong, and the march \nof folly continued to the considerable detriment of the nation that did \nnot listen.\n  Admiral Yamamoto told the Japanese warlords, ``I've been to the \nUnited States. I will participate in the attack on Pearl Harbor. I will \nserve my Emperor and do the best I can. But you are foolish if you \nthink you're going to conquer the United States. I've been there. I've \nseen their industrial might.''\n  In World War I, the commander of all the German U-boats said, ``I \ncannot sink the amount of shipping you tell me I have to sink in order \nto defeat the United States.'' Yet they went headlong and paid no \nattention to him.\n  Even when the Greeks attacked the Trojan fortress, and placed the \nTrojan horse outside the gates, one person, Laocoon said, ``Don't let \nthat horse in here. What have the Greeks ever done for us? It is a \ntrick'' But he was a solitary voice, so the Trojans brought the wooden \nhorse into the city. The rest is history. Fifty-five of the best Greek \nsoldiers piled out of the horse and took the Trojan fortress.\n  There are not too many dissenters in this debate. I am one of them \nand I hope to God I am wrong. I can tell you that in my opinion we are \ngoing against our enlightened self-interest and continuing the march of \nfolly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there has been significant, considerable \ndebate on this issue over the past several days, and then several days \nbefore that before the Easter recess. Many of the arguments have been \nmade, discussions have been had, and debate has been engaged in \nregarding the merits and demerits of NATO expansion.\n  I think it is important to put a little bit of historical perspective \nto this and then I would also like to bring a little bit of perspective \nas a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, because, after all, \nNATO is a military alliance. It is designed for military purposes \nprimarily. And it is important that we look at the military capacity \nand capability of the three nations that are being discussed as \npotential members of NATO.\n  So I would like to bring that portion of the discussion to the debate \nso that Members are aware of some of the facts and considerations \nrelative to that portion of the NATO debate.\n  First, the historical perspective.\n  This June will mark the 50th anniversary of the start of the Berlin \nBlockade. Fifty years ago, the United States had passed the Vandenberg \nResolution which laid the groundwork for U.S. participation in regional \nand other cooperative defense alliances. This resolution served to show \nAmerican support for the commitment European nations had undertaken in \nthe Brussels treaty the previous year to defend against external \nthreats. The resolution marked a formal recognition that the United \nStates had to become constructively engaged in European and world \naffairs if it were to be successful in influencing and supporting the \nbroader adoption of democratic principles in the world-market economy.\n  We had, with tragic consequences, retreated from world affairs \nearlier in this century, only to pay considerable costs in terms of not \nonly monetary costs but, more importantly, in terms of lives because we \nwere drawn into those affairs as a matter of necessity.\n\n  Two successive World Wars demonstrated unequivocally Europe's \nimportance to our own national interests, and the Members of this body, \nin 1948, were determined that the United States not be forced to catch \nup to world events again.\n  Growing concern at the time about the intentions of the Soviet Union \nwere, of course, pivotal to the debate regarding the formation of the \nalliance. After World War II, Soviet troops remained in Germany and the \nother Central/Eastern European countries that the Soviets occupied \nduring the war.\n  During the course of the Berlin Blockade, in the midst of that not \ninconsiderable crisis, the United States engaged Canada and the \nBrussels treaty powers in discussions that culminated in the \nestablishment of NATO in 1949. Interestingly enough, Mr. President, the \nreaction then in this body, and in other corridors that were discussing \nthe feasibility of this reaction to both the Vandenberg Resolution and \nthe North Atlantic talks, was decidedly vociferous.\n  Eminent scholars and statesmen--George Kennan among them--decried the \nU.S. decision to pursue this alliance with Britain, Canada, France, and \nother nations. Kennan, who was the original advocate of containment, \ndescribed the proposed alliance as provocative and potentially \ndestabilizing. Interestingly enough, that is what much of the debate \nabout the addition of three formerly Soviet Warsaw Pact nations, now \nCentral European nations that have gained independence--much of the \ndebate is centered on that very issue.\n  Then, as now, the debate covered a broad spectrum of other issues, \nincluding policy, proposed missions, membership, political as well as \nmilitary aims, and U.S. military aid to Europe. The resultant treaty \nsigned in Washington, DC, on April 4, 1949, committed the parties to: \npeaceful resolution of disputes; the active promotion of stability and \nwell-being; continuous military vigilance; joint consultation; and \ndevotion to the common defense.\n  During the Senate consideration of the treaty, two major issues were \ndiscussed: The meaning of the article V commitment, that is, the mutual \nassistance portion of the treaty; and specific military aid proposed by \nthe administration to assist Europe.\n  It is interesting to note that treaty mentions no specific external \nthreat which the alliance was being formed to counter, just as this \nresolution mentions no specific external threat.\n  In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary \nof State, Dean Acheson affirmed that the treaty was not aimed at any \ncountry but was proposed to prevent aggression. ``If we want peace,'' \nhe said, ``we must be prepared to wage peace, with all of our thought, \nenergy, and courage.'' At the time, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee was careful to assert that the treaty's article V commitment \nwould not remove the constitutional power of Congress to declare war. \nThe Senate subsequently approved the Washington treaty by a vote of 87-\n8.\n  It is interesting to note, that while some say, ``All right. That was \nfine for the time being, but why expand?'' there have been three \nmembership extensions to four other nations over subsequent years--in \n1952 to Greece and Turkey, in 1955 to Germany, and in 1982 to Spain.\n  Today, after nearly 50 years of outstanding success, NATO no longer \nseems controversial in and of itself. It is widely viewed as the most \nsuccessful military alliance in history. It was successful in its goal \nof deterring aggression in Europe. And through a robust commitment to \nmilitary strength, NATO's existence also brought enhanced stability to \nEurope, enabling its members to prosper economically.\n  Today's debate centers on the addition of three former Eastern bloc \nnations to NATO and whether somehow this will dilute NATO and its \ncollective commitment to the principles outlined in the treaty. It also \ntalks about whether or not such inclusion and addition of nations will \nbe provocative to Russia and will be destabilizing.\n  There are many issues that have and need to be discussed before we \nvote on NATO and its future. But we must keep in mind that while this \ndebate over what type of missions NATO undertakes in the future is \nimportant, it is not, in my opinion, the central consideration of \nadding new members.\n  Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary were on the forefront of \nSoviet hegemony during the cold war. For almost 50 years, their people \nlived under the totalitarianism of a Communist regime. With the fall of \nthe Soviet Union, freedom came at last. They moved forward quickly to \ntransform their economies to the free-market system, to hold democratic \nelections, and establish the rule of law. There is a compelling reason, \nmoral reason I would submit, to extend NATO membership to these \ncountries. But it is more than that. Because we must remember that NATO \nis first and foremost a military alliance.\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\n  These nations are able and willing to contribute to the common \ndefense of Europe as they desire the security link of being a part of \nNATO. That is essential to our consideration-- the answer to that \nquestion, Are these nations able, are they willing, to contribute to \nthe common defense of Europe, and do they desire to be part of a 50-\nyear established security link? The 1949 European nations themselves \nmust answer this question.\n  Though an expansion of the Soviet Union played a key role in NATO's \norigins, it was the history of warfare in Europe which spurred the \nNorth Atlantic nations to action. Again, as Dean Acheson testified in \n1949, ``NATO is not to counter any particular threat but rather all \naggression. The treaty itself states its purpose as safeguarding \nfreedom, common heritage, and civilization of their people, founded on \nthe principles of democracy, individual liberty, and rule of law. NATO \nis designed and said to promote stability and well-being in the North \nAtlantic area, and a collective defense allowance to preserve peace and \nsecurity.''\n  ``The treaty itself,'' he said, ``invites any other European states \nin a position to further the principles of this treaty and contribute \nto the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to the treaty.'' \nLet me repeat that: ``The treaty itself invites any other European \nstates in a position to further the principles of this treaty and \ncontribute to the security of the North Atlantic area''--invites them \nto become part of the alliance.\n  These nations, which have been under the suppression and oppression \nof communism nearly 50 years now, are simply asking us to comply with \nthe terms of the treaty by allowing them, since they are now capable of \nbecoming part of this mutual security alliance and this stabilizing \nfuture. It is, in effect, an open-door policy to other nations of \nEurope who share the goal of defense and are willing to contribute to \nthe security environment.\n  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, for 50 years under the \ndomination of the Soviet Union, have made the long journey to freedom \nand the beginnings of prosperity. These nations, always a part of \nEurope, have been artificially separated from their historic and \ncultural roots behind an Iron Curtain that had no place in Europe yet \ndivided European nations for nearly 50 years. They now have an \nopportunity to once again become an integral part of Europe. How can we \nnow deny them the right to belong to a European security alliance? It \nseems to me a fairly strong imperative that the nations that were \npreviously divided from the rest of Europe now be invited to become a \npart of an organization dedicated to the survival of Europe.\n  Why these three countries? They each have a clear case to demonstrate \ntheir commitment to the goals of NATO. In addition, their recent \nhistory shows the strength of their new democracies and the openness \nwhich generally follows free elections, civilian oversight of the \nmilitary intelligence, rule of law, market economies--most important, \nsince NATO was never intended to be a free ride. These nations are \nwilling and able to contribute to their own self-defense. Already they \nhave begun the restructuring required to make their militaries \ncompatible with NATO's.\n  Continued commitment to this goal will be needed, obviously, over the \nnext decade or more, but for now they are moving substantially in the \nright direction. The principle of immediate changes--reducing the size \nof their armies, modernizing their forces, achieving interoperability \nas it relates to NATO command, control, and communications--is well \nunder way. Poland has already presented a 15-year plan to reduce its \nforces overhauling the officer corps structure and introducing \nprofessional noncommissioned officers. Airfields, ports, and depots are \nbeing readied to conduct operations with NATO, and they have conducted \nmany joint operations under the Partnership for Peace program and other \nprograms.\n  Poland has established a national military center for language \neducation. It spends, interestingly enough, 2.4 percent of its gross \ndomestic product on defense and intends to maintain this level or \nincrease this level of support. Interestingly enough, Mr. President, \nthat is more than half what the current NATO nations spend as a \npercentage of GDP. Belgium spends 1.7 percent; Britain, 3.1; Germany, \n2.0; the United States, 3.1; as examples of the commitment of nations \nthat spend either less than, equal to, or substantially more than \nPoland, but clearly they are in the top 50 percent.\n  The Czech Republic has begun modernizing its forces. They plan to \nincrease their defense spending by one-tenth of 1 percent of GDP a year \nfor 3 years, bringing spending to $1.2 billion for defense in 2001.\n  Hungary is committed to increase defense spending by one-tenth of 1 \npercent of GDP over 5 years, a substantial amount of money, bringing it \nfrom the current 1.4 to 1.8 percent. They have already succeeded in \nreducing the number of troops from 100,000 to 489,000 and set up a \njoint peacekeeping battalion in Romania.\n  I recently was made aware of testimony given by Assistant Secretary \nof Defense for International Security Affairs Franklin Kramer before \nthe Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Some of his testimony has \nbeen classified, some of it unclassified. I am going to quote from the \nunclassified portion of his testimony in which he concludes, ``I am \nfully confident that with the reforms and strategies currently being \nimplemented in all three countries, Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic will both be reliable allies and net producers of security to \nthe North Atlantic alliance.'' Net producers.\n\n  In analyzing their contributions, Mr. Kramer details a whole number \nof categories in which these commitments have been made. He talks about \nthe interoperability through Partnership for Peace and cites in 1997 \nalone Poland participated in 22 Partnership for Peace exercises in \nwhich the United States also took part. The highlight of these events \nwas ``Brave Eagle,'' one of the most complex exercises to date, which \nPoland hosted. Poland also participated in hundreds of bilateral and \nmultilateral exercises, seminars, and other activities with other \npartners and NATO allies, all of which have contributed to increase \ntheir interoperability. The Poles have emphasized military training and \ntactical exercises in their Partnership for Peace participation.\n  I met with members of the Defense Establishment and the Intelligence \nEstablishment recently in my office. Much of what was presented was \nclassified. I can confidently speak to the fact that very significant \nactivity has taken place within these three nations. Poland, in \nparticular, has very significant contributions to make to the NATO \nalliance on an immediate basis, and Hungary and the Czech Republic also \nhave significant contributions to make. Hungary has participated in 17 \nmultilateral Partnership for Peace exercises just in the last year. The \nCzechs have participated in 18 of those exercises.\n  In addition to that, all three countries have participated in the \nPartnership for Peace planning and review process in which NATO has \nestablished 41 specific interoperability objectives. These include C3/\nSAR, ground refuelings of aircraft, commonality of airfield procedures, \nuse of NATO communications procedures and terminology, aircraft IFF \nsystems, logistic support, interoperability of communications equipment \nand of air navigation aids. Poland committed to obtain all 41 of these \ninteroperabilities by 1999, Hungary pledged to reach 38, and the Czech \nRepublic promised to meet 31--a very significant commitment.\n  A number of other areas were analyzed, including military reforms and \nmodernization. Each of these nations has ambitious plans in place to \nbring about reforms in command, control, communications, air defense, \ntraffic control, logistics, infrastructure, personnel reform, reduction \nin forces, increase in quality of training. I could detail those, but \nthose were provided and I think they are significant.\n  Their core capabilities and increase operability plans for \npersonnel, for training and NATO doctrine, and for interoperability \nhave all been significant.\n\n  Mr. President, there is good reason to believe that the three \ncountries that we are discussing, in terms of inclusion in NATO, have \nalready made substantial progress and have committed to further \nsubstantial progress in the necessary areas of bringing together the \nfit that will make their inclusion in NATO significant.\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me examine some of the issues that have been \nraised in opposition to adding new members to NATO.\n  Several academicians and former diplomats have raised the specter of \nthe United States and its NATO allies bogged down in some internal or \nethnic dispute involving one or more of the new members. In doing so, \nthey ignore the experience of 50 years in which NATO members, some of \nwhom have experienced their own civil unrest, and some of whom have \nexperienced conflicts with their own NATO partners, have ignored the \nfact these relations have improved their respective democratic \ninstitutions, and that they have grown steadily more stable and more \nproductive. NATO, rather than fostering instability, has provided a \nforum for the resolution of conflicts among its members. Turkey and \nGreece are probably the prime example. The prospect of NATO membership \nhas hastened the resolution of disputes between Hungary and Romania and \nthe Czech Republic and Germany. There are numerous examples of \nreconciliations and resolutions of conflict that have taken place just \nin the anticipation of becoming part of NATO.\n  A second objection has been directed toward the NATO directive to \ncollectively and individually develop and maintain the capacity to \nresist an armed attack; that is, that the costs connected with \nadmitting new members are uncertain and could be substantially more \nthan NATO's estimate of $1.5 billion over 10 years as the U.S. share. \nDetractors using this argument tend to follow it in virtually the same \nbreath with the statement that the principal threat has gone away. On \nthe one hand, they say the threat has gone away, and they are saying, \ntherefore, we don't need to be concerned about future security \narrangements; and on the other hand, they say they are concerned about \nthe potential of future conflict, and, therefore, that will drive the \ncosts up.\n  Well, let's accept the premise for a moment that there is no specific \nthreat. The NATO common costs of accepting these new members is \ndependent upon that threat--if the threat is substantial, then the \ncosts will likely be substantial as well. In contrast, a reduced threat \nwill almost certainly mean a minimal expenditure. Current plans call \nfor the latter. Prospective members are expected to obtain compatible \ncommand and control systems, maintain air defense and ground forces \nappropriate to their nation's security needs, and maintain one squadron \nof modern tactical aircraft. In addition, they are to provide \nsufficient facilities infrastructure to support the rapid deployment of \nNATO forces into their respective nations in the event of a crisis. \nObviously, if a substantive threat should arise, then the number and \nmix of required forces could increase, and maybe substantially. But \njust as clear is that we would want to meet those increased \nrequirements to counter the increased threat, and we would want to be \nahead of the game by having built the communications and air defense \ninfrastructures during a time of relative peace and stability.\n  Having said that, the anticipation is that the threat will be \ndecreased, that more stability will result and, therefore, lower costs.\n\n  I am also troubled by those who raise the specter of the article V \ncommitment. We have all heard this said in many different ways, most \nunfortunately as, ``Who wants to die for Poland?'' ``Who wants to die \nfor Hungary or the Czech Republic?'' This is particularly offensive \nwhen you consider Hitler's and Stalin's largely unopposed subjugation \nof Central Europe--including Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary--\nparticularly Czechoslovakia--in the early days of World War II. The \nfact is that I have no doubt of the resolve of America and her NATO \nallies to take appropriate steps if any NATO member is under attack; \nnor do I doubt the serious and earnest intent of the three nations \nseeking to join us in NATO to do the same.\n  As for the supposed difficulty in obtaining consensus, it is hard to \nsee that this could be the case. How can U.S. leadership be sufficient \nto acquire consensus on vital issues when the members total 16 but not \nsufficient when the members total 19? From my perspective, the \ndifficulty will vary according to the circumstance, not the absolute \nnumber of members. I think an agreement that gives one nation--who is \nnot a member of NATO--the opportunity to bully and threaten NATO \nmembers in NATO headquarters ought to be of far greater concern.\n  Finally, there is the consideration of others' attitudes about NATO \nexpansion and the potential influence upon other matters of importance \nto the United States. As many of my colleagues are aware, many well-\nregarded scholars and celebrities have raised concerns over Russia's \nreaction to expansion. They insist that Russia's good will is \nimperative and should come before other considerations, particularly \nthe expansion of NATO membership. An oft-cited example is the Russian \nDuma's failure to ratify START II, allegedly because of NATO expansion. \nFrankly, the Duma has been dragging its feet on START II for 3 years, \nnot because of the NATO expansion question, but primarily due to the \ncost of implementing the treaty rather than NATO itself. The same \nargument, used in relation to the Chemical Weapons Convention, was put \nto rest when the Duma moved forward and ratified it, after individuals \nsaid, ``If we ratify this treaty, the Russians will walk away.'' That \ndoes not seem to support a clear connection between the decision on \nNATO expansion and START II ratification.\n  Let's be frank, Mr. President, Russia is going to pursue activities \nthat benefit her national interest as she perceives them, just as the \nUnited States pursues those interests that benefit our national \ninterest as we perceive them, and this treaty is not going to change \nthat fact.\n  Fifty years ago a similar debate was taking place as it relates to \nRussia and the creation of NATO. Stalin blockaded Berlin both to \nexpress displeasure at an attempt to roll back the Marshall Plan and \nrelated initiatives, as well as to convince the United States that its \nrole in Europe was ill-advised. The United States and its allies held \nto their position and signed the Washington treaty in April of 1949. \nOne month later, the Soviet Union lifted the blockade. We must do what \nwe think is right, independent of what the debate is in the Russian \nDuma. That is not to say that we are uninterested in Russia and what \nRussian leaders think and its citizens think. Quite the contrary. It is \nessential that we remain engaged with Russia--politically, \neconomically, and in relation to security concerns. We must work to \nachieve our mutual interests but continue to support the transformation \nof this nation to a strong and healthy democratic system. Our \nrelationship with Russia, however, does not mean ignoring the desires \nof Central and Eastern European nations simply because we find some \nRussian resistance. NATO is a defensive alliance, not an offensive \nalliance. We must state that. That is its history. Russia knows that. \nWe know that. NATO knows that. This has been reaffirmed--this \nfundamental aspect of the treaty. Russia has nothing to fear from NATO \nas it currently exists, nor from NATO with its new members. We must \ncontinue to reassure them, to work with them and bring them fully into \nthe West's orbit. It is important that both the United States and \nRussia realize that both can benefit from this new relationship.\n\n  NATO remains in America's strategic interests as long as Europe \nremains in our interest. Likewise, the addition of new members to this \ntreaty is also in our interest. When we expand membership to like-\nminded nations, we extend the security of Europe and the stabilizing \ninfluence of the alliance itself. We may not have any one single threat \nat this time, but the world remains an insecure and unstable place. The \ncontinuity of an expanded NATO will assure that this successful \nmilitary alliance will continue to play a stabilizing role in Europe \nand help ensure our preparedness to take on future threats. I believe \nthat the American people are deserving of a temperate and deliberate \ndebate on the merits of the accession of the Czech Republic, Hungary, \nand Poland. This has been a worthwhile discussion, a necessary debate, \none of the critical functions of the U.S. Senate.\n\n  As many of you now know, I have supported these countries' accession \nto NATO, not out of an interest of righting wrongs but in recognition \nof their geopolitical importance and their\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\nprogress as democratic states determined to join with other NATO \nmembers in preserving the peace that NATO has won in Europe. This \ndebate, this vote, will affirm the importance of these nations to \nNATO's continued mission.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to a successful vote and to a formal \naccession in Washington next spring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3756-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, today marks the first anniversary of the \nentry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans the \ndevelopment, production, stockpiling, and use of poison gas. The \nachievement of that Convention and of U.S. ratification were signal \naccomplishments of the Bush and Clinton Administrations.\n  I am pleased to report that, after a year in force, the Chemical \nWeapons Convention has begun to pay significant dividends for our \nnational security. Those dividends would be even greater if both Houses \nof Congress would pass legislation to implement the Convention, so that \nthe United States could come into compliance with it.\n  When the United States finally ratified the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, just days before it entered into force, we joined roughly \n90 other states. In the days and months that followed, several \nimportant countries followed our lead. Among the 107 countries that now \nhave joined the Convention are Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and \nIran. Over 60 more nations have signed the Convention, and some of \nthose are in the final stages of ratification.\n  I want to emphasize those five particular countries that have \nratified the Chemical Weapons Convention since we did. Many opponents \nof ratification said that Russia and China would never join, that we \nwould be limiting our own options while other major powers refrained \nfrom the obligation to do without chemical weapons. Both Russia and \nChina have joined, however, and China has admitted--for the first \ntime--that it has had a chemical weapons program.\n  India and Pakistan have also ratified the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, and that is something of a triumph. South Asia is probably \nthe area where the risk of nuclear war is highest today. Both countries \nare generally assessed as nuclear-capable. Pakistan recently tested a \nmissile that could target nearly any site in India, and India is \ntalking about reviving a missile that could strike all of Pakistan. Yet \nboth those countries ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, and \nIndia admitted--again, for the first time--to having a chemical weapons \nprogram.\n  Before the Convention entered into force, the United States and \nRussia were the only two admitted chemical weapons possessors. To date, \nhowever, six more countries--including South Korea, as well as China \nand India--have complied with the Convention's requirements to declare \ntheir chemical weapons and existing or former chemical weapons \nfacilities.\n  The chemical weapons that India has declared will be destroyed. The \nchemical weapons facilities that China, South Korea and other countries \nhave declared will be destroyed, unless the Council of States Parties \napproves conversion of those facilities under stringent safeguards. \nThese are achievements that we could not guarantee a year and four days \nago, when Senate consent to ratification was debated and approved. But \nwe have them today, and I hope there will be more such admissions, \ndeclarations, and destruction of chemical weapons and chemical weapons \nfacilities in the years to come.\n  In the past year, the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for \nthe Prevention of Chemical Warfare (the international inspectorate for \nthe Convention) has conducted nearly 200 inspections. Roughly three-\nfourths of those inspections--including 25 in Russia--have been at \nchemical weapons production, storage, and destruction facilities.\n  About a third of the inspections have been in the United States--with \nno problems in protecting sensitive U.S. information. The United States \nis the only country currently destroying its chemical weapons, and the \nTechnical Secretariat must monitor these facilities continually during \ndestruction operations. As other countries begin to destroy their \nchemical weapons stocks, their inspection numbers will increase \naccordingly.\n  Few among the treaty's critics or proponents expected this much \nprogress so soon. There is still a long way to go. But in just one \nyear, the Convention has clearly begun to prove its utility as a tool \nto reduce the threat of chemical weapons.\n  What remains to be done? One crucial step is for the United States to \ncome into compliance with the Convention. We have yet to enact \nimplementing legislation pursuant to the Convention. Until we do so, \nour country will remain a violator of the Convention.\n  Why is that? The Convention requires us to make violations of it a \ncrime; we have yet to do that. The Convention also requires \ndeclarations regarding certain chemical production. We have submitted \nthat declaration only regarding government facilities, because we lack \nlegislation to require commercial reporting and to protect the \nconfidential information in those reports from disclosure through the \nFreedom of Information Act. Finally, we still need a regime to govern \ninternational inspections of private U.S. facilities.\n  Aside from the dishonor that we bring upon ourselves by failing to \ncomply with a treaty that we have ratified, why should we care? We \nshould care because our failure to enact implementing legislation harms \nthe national security. It makes it difficult to encourage compliance by \nother countries, or to request a challenge inspection if another \ncountry's declarations omit a suspected chemical weapons facility.\n  In addition, other countries are using our delay to draw attention \naway from their own misdeeds. Last month, a Russian general was \ninterviewed by Izvestiya. The general made an utterly specious claim \nthat the Sverdlovsk anthrax disaster was due to natural causes--a claim \nthat even Russian officials have long since abandoned--and he even \nrecycled the old lie that the United States invented AIDS. But how did \nthe article end? Why, with a recital of the U.S. failure to enact \nimplementing legislation! That's truly outrageous, but that will \ncontinue until we come into compliance.\n  The fault does not lie with this body, Mr. President. The Senate \npassed S. 610 on May 23 of last year. It then languished in the House \nfor six months, before being attached to an unrelated measure. One way \nor another, we must enact this legislation.\n  The implementing legislation is not perfect. I noted last year that \nit harms U.S. interests if we bar the analysis of U.S. samples outside \nthis country or give the President the right to invoke a national \nsecurity exemption from inspections. The immediate need, however, is to \nenact a bill and bring our country into compliance with this important \nand useful Convention.\n  We have come far with the Chemical Weapons Convention. It is already \nproving its worth. But there is still this overdue work to accomplish--\nnot for the sake of others, but to further our own national security. \nWe can do it, and we should do it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3782-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3782-S3783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nmake permanent the demonstration program that allows for direct billing \nof medicare, medicaid, and other third party payors, and to expand the \neligibility under such program to other tribes and tribal \norganizations; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n the alaska native and american indian direct reimbursement act of 1998\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself and \nMajority Leader Lott, Senator Baucus, and Senator Campbell, to \nintroduce legislation which would permanently authorize and expand the \nMedicare and Medicaid direct collections demonstration program under \nsection 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  This act will end much of the redtape and bureaucracy for IHS \nfacilities involved with Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, and will \nmean more Medicaid and Medicare dollars to Native health facilities to \nuse for improving health care.\n  Our bill will allow Native hospitals to collect Medicare and Medicaid \nfunds directly from the Health Care Financing Administration instead of \nhaving to go through the maze of regulations mandated by HIS.\n  This bill is an expansion of a current demonstration project that \nincludes Bristol Bay Health Corporation of Dillingham, Alaska; the \nSoutheast Alaska Regional Health Corporation of Sitka, Alaska; the \nMississippi Choctaw Health Center of Philadelphia, Mississippi; and the \nChoctaw Tribe of Durant, Oklahoma. All of the participants in the \ndemonstration program--as well as the Department of Health and Human \nService and the Indian Health Services--report that the program is a \ngreat success. In fact, the program has:\n  Dramatically increased collections for Medicare and Medicaid \nservices, which in turn has provided badly-needed revenues for Indian \nand Alaska Native health care; significantly reduced the turn-around \ntime between billing and the receipt of payment for Medicare and \nMedicaid services; and increased the administrative efficiency of the \nparticipating facilities by empowering them to track their own Medicare \nand Medicaid billings and collections.\n  In 1996, when the demonstration program was about to expire, Congress \nextended it through FY 1998. This extension has allowed the \nparticipants to continue their direct billing and collection efforts \nand has provided Congress with additional time to consider whether to \npermanently authorize the program.\n  Because the demonstration program is again set to expire at the end \nof FY 98, it is time to recognize the benefits of the demonstration \nprogram by enacting legislation that would permanently authorize it and \nexpand it to other eligible tribal participants.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\n  S. 2003. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to allow \nworkers who attain age 65 after 1981 and before 1992 to choose either \nlump sum payments over four years totalling $5,000 or an improved \nbenefit computation formula under a new 10-year rule governing the \ntransition to the changes in benefit computation rules enacted in the \nSocial Security Amendments of 1977, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                       notch fairness act of 1998\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould correct a problem which plagues a special group of older \nAmericans. I am speaking on behalf of those affected by the Social \nSecurity notch.\n  For my colleagues who may not be aware, the Social Security notch \ncauses 11 million Americans born between the years 1917-1926 to receive \nless in Social Security benefits than Americans born outside the notch \nyears due to changes made in the 1977 Social Security benefit formula.\n  I have felt compelled over the years to speak out about this issue \nand the injustice it imposes on millions of Americans. The notch issue \nhas been debated and debated, studied and studied, yet to date, no \nsolution to it has been found. Because of this, many older Americans \nborn during this period must scrimp to afford the most basic of \nnecessities.\n  Mr. President, I am the first to acknowledge that with any projected \nbudget surplus we must save Social Security. In many ways, my \nlegislation does just this. It restores confidence to the many notch \nvictims around the country and will show them that we in Congress will \naccept responsibility for any error that was made. We should not ask \nthem to accept less as a result of our mistake. While we must save \nSocial Security for the future, we have an obligation to those, who \nthrough no fault of their own, receive less than those that were \nfortunate enough to be born just days before or after the notch period.\n  I believe we owe a debt to notch babies. Like any American family, we \nmust first pay the bills before we invest in the future. With a surplus \nprojected for this fiscal year, we have the resources to make good on \nour debt to notch babies. We should come forward and honor our \ncommitment.\n  Mr. President, the ``notch'' situation had its origins in 1972, when \nCongress decided to create automatic cost-of-living adjustments to help \nSocial Security benefits keep pace with inflation. Previously, each \nadjustment had to await legislation, causing beneficiaries' monthly \npayments to lag behind inflation. When Congress took this action, it \nwas acting under the best of intentions.\n  Unfortunately, this new benefit adjustment method was flawed. To \nfunction properly, it required that the economy behave in much the same \nfashion that it had in the 1950s and 1960s, with annual wage increases \noutpacing prices, and inflation remaining relatively low. As we all \nknow, that did not happen. The rapid inflation and high unemployment of \nthe 1970s generated increases in benefits. In an effort to end this \nproblem, in 1977 Congress revised the way that benefits were computed. \nIn making its revisions, Congress decided that it was not proper to \nreduce benefits for persons already receiving them; it did, however, \ndecide that benefits for all future retirees should be reduced. As a \nresult, those born after January 1, 1917 would, by design, receive \nbenefits that were, in many cases, far less. In an attempt to ease the \ntransition to the new, lower benefit levels, Congress designed a \nspecial ``transitional computation method'' for use by beneficiaries \nborn between 1917 and 1921.\n\n  Mr. President, we have an obligation to convey to our constituents \nthat Social Security is a fair system. In town hall meetings back home \nin Nevada, I have a hard time trying to tell that to a notch victim. \nThey feel slighted by their government and if I were in their situation \nI would too. Through no fault of their own, they receive less, \nsometimes as much as $200 less, than their neighbors.\n  The legislation I am offering today is my proposal to right the \nwrong. I propose using any projected budget surplus to pay the lump sum \nbenefit to notch babies. While we have a surplus, let's fix the notch \nproblem once and for all and restore the confidence of the ten million \nnotch babies across this land.\n  Government has an obligation to be fair. I don't think we have been \nin the case of notch babies. My support of notch babies is \nlongstanding. I introduced the only notch amendment in April 1991 that \never passed in Congress as part of the fiscal year 1992 Budget \nResolution. Unfortunately, it did not become the law of the land as it \nwas dropped in Conference with the House of Representatives. I have \ncosponsored numerous pieces of legislation over the years to address \nthis issue. With this legislation, my effort continues.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that these measures have not seen \nthe light of day. Many who have written to me think Congress is waiting \nfor notch babies to die rather than honor this debt. I must tell you it \nconcerns me when our constituents have this perception of their elected \nrepresentatives. Unfortunately, the truth is that today a number of \nnotch babies will die. We will not have to worry about those notch \nbabies, or honor our debt to them. This is the wrong approach.\n  Each day a grave injustice is perpetrated when these people pass \naway. We have to do something to make sure Americans believe that \nSocial Security is a fair system. Passage of my legislation provides us \nthat chance. I invite members to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  I acknowledge that the battle for notch reform suffered a major \nsetback when on December 31, 1994, the Commission on the Social \nSecurity ``Notch'' issue released its final report. It concluded that \nthe ``benefits paid to those in the `Notch' years are equitable, and no \nremedial legislation is in order.'' The National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare strongly disagreed with the Committee's \nmethodology and conclusions. Although they have stopped advocating for \nthis issue due to the political and fiscal climate, their disagreement \nwith the outcome is nonetheless significant.\n\n  The Commission's report also stated ``in retrospect'' Congress \n``Probably should have'' limited the benefits of those who were \ngrandfathered, but that it is too late now to do so given their \nadvanced age. Since we did not do the right thing then, I propose that \nwe do the right thing now. Let's show we have the courage to correct a \nmistake when we have made one. The Commission report provided political \ncover for those who were opposed to notch reform legislation. I have \nlong opposed ``political'' solutions to problems such as this.\n  My legislation is intended to make good on what this government \nshould have done long ago. I propose that workers who attain the age of \n65 after 1981 and before 1992 be allowed to choose either lump sum \npayment over four years totaling $5,000 or an improved benefit \ncomputation formula under a new 10-year rule governing the transition \nto the changes in benefit computation rules enacted in the Social \nSecurity Amendments of 1977.\n  As of December 1996, there were 11,637,390 recipients born between \n1917 and 1926 who were receiving Social Security retirement benefits. \nBy providing each with a $5,000 lump sum payment or an improved benefit \ncomputation formula, maximum costs would be $60 billion spread over \nfour years or $15 billion annually.\n  There are some who would say there are ``bigger fish to fry'' such as \nSocial Security solvency and Medicare's long term solvency. While I am \nin full agreement that these are very important issues that I intend to \nwork on, we should include in our discussion concerning uses of any \nbudget surplus, to repair the damage that has been done as a result of \nnotch. Living on a fixed income is not easy. Many notch babies have \ndifficulty making ends meet. This one time lump sum payment would \nprovide much needed financial support for some of this nation's most \nneedy citizens.\n  Mr. President, it is time to return these dollars to the hands of \nthose who earned them. It is time to show our support for notch reform. \nAll of our offices have staff to help us answer the mail. We tell our \nconstituents what bills have been offered and that we will lend our \nsupport if their issue comes to a vote.\n  Well, here is our change. I am introducing this legislation because \nactions speak louder than words. The ``Notch\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\nFairness Act of 1998'' that I am introducing on behalf of notch victims \ntoday, is intended to put my words into action. I ask all my colleagues \nto join me in support of this important and long overdue legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 2005. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to ensure that certain \nFederal power customers are provided protection by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  TVA CUSTOMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today \nto introduce a bill that is long overdue. Known as the TVA Customer \nProtection Act, this legislation will implement a number of consumer \nreforms to make TVA accountable to ratepayers and better prepare TVA to \ncompete in a restructured electricity market.\n\n  The bill I am introducing provides Tennessee Valley ratepayers a \nnumber of consumer protections against unchecked and unjustified \nincreases in their power rates. This bill will put an end to TVA's \nability to compete unfairly with its regional distributors. This bill \nwill prohibit TVA from sticking ratepayers with the bill for TVA's \ninternational forays that have no relevance to TVA's responsibility to \nprovide low cost power to the Tennessee Valley. Finally, this bill also \ncodifies an agreement between TVA and several industry associations to \nlimit TVA's authority as a government entity to compete with small \nbusinesses in non-electric services.\n  Mr. President, TVA is a federal corporation that was first formed in \n1933, to tame the Tennessee River, our nation's fifth largest river, \nand to bring economic development to this once poverty stricken region. \nOver the years as the Valley has developed, TVA has evolved in their \nrole as a river steward to become the largest power producer in the \nnation. Today, TVA provides power to all of Tennessee and to parts of \nsix other states covering over 80,000 square miles and serving eight \nmillion consumers. The bulk of TVA's power sales are made through \nmunicipal and cooperative distributors, which in turn are responsible \nfor delivering that power to every home, office and farm in the Valley. \nTVA has exclusive power contracts with its distributors and the three \nmember TVA board sets the retail rates offered by distributors. TVA \nalso has the authority to compete directly with distributors to make \nretail sales to large industrial customers.\n  Mr. President, over the past 65 years, TVA has accumulated an \nenormous debt of nearly $28 billion, despite being a monopoly power \nprovider. TVA is also carrying $6.3 billion in deferred assets that \nwill eventually force electricity rates higher in the future. By \ndeferring these charges, TVA's financing costs will continue to mount. \nI have real concerns about how this debt load will affect rates as well \nas the overall economic health of the region.\n  In 1997, GAO found that TVA paid over 35 percent of its power revenue \nto servicing its debt. In other words, TVA pays an astronomical 35 \ncents of every $1 earned to interest. Compare that to a public utility \nwhich paid a mere 7 percent in finance costs. In a 1994 study, GAO \nfound that 69 percent of TVA's total debt is tied to the nuclear \nfacilities, yet they generated only 14 percent of TVA's total power \nproduction in 1994. This study concluded that TVA's financial condition \n``threatens its long-term viability and places the federal government \nat risk.''\n  Only through years of unaccountability and fiscal irresponsibility \ncould a power company have ever reached this level of debt despite the \nfact that TVA is a monopoly provider of electricity. Therefore, I have \ncome to the conclusion that TVA needs to be made more accountable for \ntheir actions. Not more accountable to Congress or the President, but \nthe people they were charged to serve--the TVA customers.\n  Mr. President, it is my desire to provide TVA customers with a clear \npicture of TVA's financial situation including TVA's rates, charges and \ncosts. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is authorized \nunder the Federal Power Act with regulating electric utilities.\n  FERC provides regulatory oversight to over 200 utilities for \nwholesale and transmission power rates to ensure that their electric \nrates and charges are ``just and reasonable and not unduly \ndiscriminatory or preferential.'' At present, TVA is entirely exempt \nfrom these necessary regulations allowing it to operate as a self-\nregulating monopoly, with no such mandate for openness fairness or \noversight.\n  Requiring TVA to comply with FERC regulations will serve two \npurposes. First, it will allow customers to accurately evaluate TVA's \nwholesale and transmission pricing and terms to ensure the rates \ncharged are ``just and reasonable'' and to provide customers with a \nforum for challenging future rate increases just as every other \nregulated utility does.\n  Second, this information will provide FERC with a better \nunderstanding of the stranded costs TVA has accumulated. Understanding \nthe full scope of these costs will be critical in an open transmission \nand wholesale market. It will also have a significant impact in \ndetermining how competitive TVA will be in the future.\n  Last year, former FERC Chair Elizabeth Moler testified before the \nSenate Energy Committee regarding nationwide open access in the \ntransmission and wholesale markets. She stated that, ``like Swiss \ncheese, nationwide open access has some holes. Federal legislation is \nnecessary to fill in these holes.'' It was her belief that TVA's large \ntransmission system must be included within FERC's open access program.\n  Recently, I read an article written by Carlos Smith, the General \nCounsel to TVPPA, an association which represents TVA distributors. Mr. \nSmith made the case that investor-owned utilities should be regulated, \n``because only in this way can the captive ratepayers learn the \nunderlying basis for the retail utility rates and require justification \nfor the charges made for services.''\n\n  Mr. President, I wholeheartedly concur with Mr. Smith's conclusion \nthat ratepayers, including the distributors Mr. Smith represents, \nshould know what their rates are based on and have a justification for \nsuch rates. Further, ratepayers should be able to challenge, through \nFERC, any rate increase they find unreasonable.\n  Mr. President, let me point out one very important provision in this \nlegislation. I have included a provision that makes it explicitly clear \nthat nothing in this bill would change the law applying to TVA \ndistributors. Unlike TVA, distributors are directly accountable to the \ncustomers they serve. Cooperatives, for example, are operated by a \nboard elected by the customers to represent their own member interests. \nI don't believe we need to change this policy, except to make TVA more \naccountable to the people they serve.\n  Mr. President, I expect TVA to complain that this legislation somehow \ntreats them unfairly. They will attempt to blame me for unfairly \nburdening them with new accountability standards and claim that a rate \nincrease will be a direct result.\n  Mr. President, I don't believe Valley residents will be fooled by \nTVA's rhetoric when they recall TVA's track record. It's hard to argue \nthat the TVA Board has kept ratepayers' interests foremost in mind as \nthey ran up $28 billion in debt, while serving a captive customer base. \nIt's hard to argue it was in the ratepayers' interest to try to hide \nmillion dollar bonuses to a select cadre of high level staff. It is \nhard to argue that it was in the ratepayers' interest to zero out all \nfederal appropriations, which could add millions to TVA's annual \noperating costs.\n  Mr. President, I have carefully compared the rates of regulated \nutilities in Kentucky against TVA's rates to determine if applying \nthese regulations would drive rates higher. Much to my surprise, I have \nfound that not only are regulated utilities rates very competitive, but \nlower than rates offered by TVA. This confirms my assumption that the \nunderlying financial health of TVA--and its $28 billion debt--has a far \ngreater impact on its electric rates than any other factor.\n  Mr. President, since 1988, wholesale power rates of regulated \nutilities in Kentucky have steadily fallen, while TVA has maintained \nthe same level, until last year when TVA raised rates by 7 percent. It \nis appearent to me that due to TVA's past financial mismanagement, \nthousands of Kentucky resident are not able to take advantage\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nof the declining rates. Mr. President, I ask that this chart be printed \nin the record at this point.\n  Mr. President, in addition to applying FERC regulation to TVA I have \nincluded a number of other important customer reforms. As I mentioned \nearlier, this bill prohibits TVA from continuing to subsidize their \nforeign endeavors at ratepayers expense. Quarter million dollar \nconferences in China and other points on the globe are not consistent \nwith either TVA's deficit reduction goals or its mission to be a low \ncost power provider to the valley.\n  Another provision that I have included is a measure proposed by the \nTVA distributors. Section Five in the bill protects distributors from \nunfair competition by ending TVA's ability to directly serve large \nindustrial customers. In the past, TVA has been able to directly serve \nsome of the valley's largest industrial customers. Through this \nloophole, TVA is able to use it considerable market power to unfairly \ncompete with distributors. This provision also facilitates the \ntransition from TVA to FERC regulation. To protect the sanctity of the \nexisting contracts, FERC is directed to accept the terms and conditions \nof those contracts without initial review.\n  Section Seven of this bill will increase TVA's level of \naccountability by applying all federal antitrust laws and penalties. I \nhave included this provision in response to heavy-handed tactics used \nby TVA to punish the City of Bristol, Virginia for signing a contract \nwith another energy provider. Last year, Bristol Virginia Utilities \nBoard signed an agreement with Cinergy Corporation to provide its \nwholesale power, which yielded a savings of $70 million for Bristol \nafter fulfilling the terms of the contract with TVA. What Bristol \ndidn't expect was the backlash from TVA and effort to punish Bristol \nfor leaving the TVA family.\n  In testimony before the Senate Energy Committee, the Chairman of the \nBristol Utility Board, David Fletcher, outlined the anti-competitive \npractices employed by TVA to undermine Bristol's new contract. TVA \napplied scare tactics by predicting unreliable electricity services as \na discouragement to leaving. TVA also sought to recover tens of \nmillions invested by TVA to provide power to Bristol, despite the fact \nthat Bristol had fulfilled the terms of their contract. Finally, TVA \nattempted to steal Bristol's industrial customers by offering direct-\nserve power contracts at 2 percent below any rate offered by Bristol. I \nfind these predatory practices to be entirely unacceptable, especially \nfor an entity of the federal government. It is my belief that since \nTVA's activities were performed in a commercial endeavor, they should \nbe held to the same standards as any other corporation under the \nantitrust laws.\n  Recently, I was informed that TVA willing to subject themselves to \nthe federal antitrust laws, so long as they weren't subject to any \npenalties.\n  Mr. President, I have some advice for TVA. If you can't pay the fine, \ndon't do the crime.\n  My bill's final provision regards TVA's ability to branch out into \nother businesses beyond power generation and transmission. TVA's has \nattempted to diversify into equipment leasing as well as engineering \nand other contracting services in direct competition with other valley \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. President, I hope these reforms will offer TVA customers--both \ndistributors and individuals alike--the means to make TVA more \naccountable. I am very concerned, however, that these reforms may be \ntoo late to avert a gradual increase in power rates within the TVA \nregion. Last year, for the first time in 10 years, TVA raised rates on \nhouseholds and business by over 7 percent in order to prepare for a \nmore open electricity market. This can be contrasted with a 15 percent \ndecline in rates over the past ten years in Kentucky--outside the TVA \nfence.\n  I remain hopeful that with these reforms, TVA's Board will be more \naccountable to ratepayers and will help ensure that the economic \npotential of the Tennessee Valley, which was mortgaged by years of \nfiscal unaccountability, will not be diminished.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2005\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Treasury to abate the accrual of \ninterest on income tax underpayments by taxpayers located in \nPresidentially declared disaster areas if the Secretary extends the \ntime for filing returns and payment of tax for such taxpayers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 The Disaster Victim Tax Extension Act\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould permanently exempt the interest payments owed by disaster victims \nto the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Each year, our country is hit by a variety of natural disasters such \nas hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, and ice storms, all \ncausing extreme hardship for hundreds of thousands of Americans.\n  This year, 15 States have already been hit by deadly disasters.\n  Starting on March 7, severe storms and flooding struck the State of \nAlabama, damaging nearly 1,200 homes, and the city of Elba in Coffee \nCounty was evacuated as a result of a levee failure. Three deaths were \nattributed to the floods and one person was reported missing.\n  On February 9, 27 California counties were wracked by severe storms.\n  During the period of January 28 through February 6, a series of \nsevere winter storms hit communities in Sussex County of Delaware.\n  Also in February, three southern Florida counties were victimized by \ntornadoes and other violent weather.\n  In February, six counties in Georgia were struck by tornadoes. On \nMarch 20, amid flood recovery efforts, tornadoes and windstorms tore \nthrough northeast Georgia, adding to the overall devastation. Tornadoes \nagain touched down in west Georgia, metro Atlanta, and southeast \nGeorgia on April 9.\n  In February, Atlantic and Cape May counties in southern New Jersey \nwere hit by the coastal storm that lashed the area.\n  On April 16, six Tennessee counties were ravaged by deadly tornadoes \nand other violent weather.\n  And, Mr. President, on March 29, seven counties in my own State of \nMinnesota were hit by the deadly tornadoes, damaging thousands of homes \nand businesses along a 62-mile path carved through the communities of \nSt. Peter, Comfrey, and Le Center. The storms claimed two lives.\n  The estimated total dollar value of insured losses caused by the \nsouth-central Minnesota tornadoes has reached $175 million, exceeding \ninsured losses incurred in my state during the floods of one year ago.\n  The list goes on and on. But my point is: deadly natural disasters \noccur every year. Lives are lost, homes are demolished, property is \ndestroyed, businesses are ruined, and crops are wiped out. The \nsurvivors of these disasters need our help to get their feet back on \nthe ground.\n  Federal disaster assistance has been effective. In fact, almost all \nof the major disaster sites have been subsequently designated as \nPresidentially declared disaster areas and are eligible to receive \nfederal disaster assistance.\n  However, there is one hurdle Congress still must remove. Residents in \nPresidentially declared disaster areas can often get an extension to \nfile their income tax returns.\n  However, interest owed cannot be exempted by the IRS. That requires \nCongressional action.\n  In other words, we give them time, an extension to file their taxes, \nbut at the same time we are saying, because you cannot because of \ncircumstances beyond your control file, we are going to charge you \ninterest on it. That is adding insult to injury.\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\n  So many States, like Minnesota, immediately have granted exemptions \nfor interest payments on State taxes when disaster areas are declared.\n  Although Congress has granted such Federal waivers in the past, they \nmust be done legislatively each time a disaster occurs, and appropriate \nvehicles are not always available. This creates one more uncertainty \nfor victims of disaster.\n  The legislation I am here to introduce today along with Senators \nCoverdell, Frist, McCain, Hutchinson, and Smith of Oregon, the bill \ncalled the Disaster Victim Tax Extension Act, would once and for all \nremove this barrier and it would give residents of Presidentially \ndeclared disaster areas an interest payment exemption on any Federal \ntaxes owed.\n  By the way, Mr. President, our legislation would be effective \nretroactively to tax year 1997.\n  Mr. President, this may seem like a small matter, but for disaster \nsurvivors, every dollar counts. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (by request):\n  S. 2006.

Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill, ``To amend \n     the Act establishing the Keweenaw National Historical Park, \n     and for other purposes.''\n       We recommend the bill be introduced, referred to the \n     appropriate committee for consideration, and enacted.\n       This bill will facilitate the appointment of the Keweenaw \n     National Historical Park Advisory Commission for this \n     Michigan park. The existing statute raises constitutional \n     concerns by directing the Secretary of the Interior to \n     appoint to the Commission persons nominated by state and \n     local officials. The Department of Justice has opined that \n     this procedure does not satisfy the requirements imposed by \n     the Appointments Clause (U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 2) \n     for appointments of federal officers. Accordingly, former \n     President Bush signed the existing law on the express \n     understanding that the commission would serve only in an \n     advisory capacity and would not exercise executive authority. \n     The proposed amendments will eliminate the need for this \n     limiting construction of the commission's duties.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Donald Barry,\n\n                                    Acting Assistant Secretary for\n                                      Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n       Enclosures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 2007. A bill to amend the false claims provisions of chapter 37 of \ntitle 31, United States Code; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  the health care claims guidance act\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health Care \nClaims Guidance Act. I am pleased to have the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), join with me as an original co-\nsponsor of the bill. This measure addresses a very serious concern: the \ngovernment's misuse of the False Claims Act and the need to distinguish \nMedicare fraud from unavoidable billing errors.\n  Health care fraud has no place in health care practice. Health care \nfraud costs taxpayers many millions of dollars that should be spent on \npatient care. In addition, government agencies must be able to use all \nof the tools at their disposal to prosecute aggressively those who \nwillfully engage in fraudulent practices.\n  It is equally important, however, that government resources be used \nto go after genuine wrongdoers, rather than health care providers who \nmay have overbilled the government for Medicare services through \ninnocent clerical errors or interpretive mistakes.\n  Recently, the Department of Justice has embarked on a program to \nutilize the False Claims Act to prosecute provider billing errors. \nUntil 1994, government agencies, hospitals, and physicians acted \ntogether, cooperating in most instances, to make sure all parties were \ntreated fairly in Medicare billing disputes. Sometimes providers were \nunderpaid, sometimes they were overpaid. Either way, they and the \ngovernment would review and settle claims at the end of each quarter or \neach year. But, the government has abandoned this practice with doctors \nand hospitals and has begun a campaign to coerce and extract money \nimproperly from the providers.\n  In the State of Mississippi, and across the Nation, health car \nproviders have received ``demand'' letters from U.S. Attorneys' \noffices, many not even from their own State, asserting that the doctors \nand hospitals may be guilty of fraudulent billing. These letters \nthreaten the imposition of treble damages plus fines of $5,000 to \n$10,000 per claim unless a quick settlement is reached, often within \nfourteen days of the letter. In some cases, the demand letters have \nbeen sent based on alleged overbilling of minuscule amounts.\n  Providers should certainly do all they can to minimize errors, and \nwhen discrepancies are discovered, the correct amounts should be paid \nto the Government with interest.\n  But, with the filing of large numbers of claims each year, and the \nvolume of Government rules, regulations, and directives--some of which \nare conflicting--that providers must follow, it is impossible to be \nerror-free. Hospitals and health systems submit nearly 200,000 Medicare \nclaims a day. To ensure the accuracy of those claims, they must comply \nwith the 1,800 pages of law, 1,300 pages of regulations interpreting \nthe law and thousands of additional pages of instructions. In addition, \nthey are required to work with 41 intermediaries--mostly insurance \ncompanies--that have their own procedures that hospitals must follow as \npart of the billing process. The same level of law, procedures, and \ninstructions also apply to physicians.\n  The current practice of the Department of Justice, using the False \nClaims Act, assumes that hospitals, health systems, and doctors are \nguilty of intentionally filing erroneous claims when errors are made. \nThis, in my view, is simply not right.\n  The Health Care Claims Guidance Act we are introducing would amend \nthe False Claims Act to distinguish between fraud and mere mistakes. It \nwould apply only to claims under federally funded health care programs, \nand would have no effect on other False Claims Act prosecutions.\n  The legislation does not change the criminal portions of the False \nClaims Act. Neither does it change the qui tam, or ``whistle blower'' \nprovisions of the law. And it in no way would impede the Department of \nJustice or any other Government agency from zeroing in on true fraud \nand prosecuting those who commit fraud. No other Federal laws would be \naffected, including changes made by Congress in 1996 in the Health\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act. The changes would apply \nonly to health care claims for Federally funded programs such as \nMedicare and CHAMPUS. This legislation would not prevent the Government \nfrom receiving any money that is rightfully due. In all cases, \noverpayments would be reimbursed with interest.\n\n  What this legislation does is to distinguish Medicare billing fraud \nfrom honest billing mistakes. The bill does these four things:\n  It imposes a ``de minimis'' standard. Under the standard, as defined \nby the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Medicare \noverpayments to providers of less than a specified percentage would \nresult in penalties of no more than the amount of the claim plus \ninterest.\n  It establishes a ``safe harbor'' for health care providers that \nsubmit a claim based on advice given by fiscal intermediaries and \ncarriers. Such hospitals would be subject to fines limited to actual \ndamages and interest, not treble damages plus $5,000 to $10,000 per \nclaim.\n  It raises the burden of proof required under the act from a \n``preponderance of the evidence'' standard to a ``clear and convincing \nevidence'' standard.\n  And lastly, it establishes a ``safe harbor'' for health care \nproviders that have adopted effective, good-faith compliance plans in \nwhich they are, if found to be in violation of the False Claims Act, \nsubject only to actual damages plus interest, rather than treble \ndamages plus $5,000 to $10,000 per claim.\n  Mr. President, although Congress 2 years ago gave Federal agencies \nadditional tools to go after health care fraud--such as expanded \nauthority under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct--the Department of Justice has nonetheless decided that the use of \nthe False Claims Act guarantees ``easy money.''\n  The Health Care Claims Guidance Act stops this abuse of the law and \nprovides a clear and simple way of distinguishing between those claims \nthat are fraudulent and those claims that result from human error.

Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague \nSenator Cochran in introducing legislation that helps define the rules \nof the game for health care providers and allows investigators to focus \non ferreting out and prosecuting real fraud in Federal health programs.\n  The Health Care Claims Guidance Act of 1998 that we introduce today \nis made necessary by conflicting, extremely complex regulations \ncovering Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPS and other Federally funded \nprograms. Ironically, most of these exist as a result of Congressional \nefforts to reduce fraud and abuse--to establish a system for billing \nand claims processing that assures these programs are paying reasonable \ncosts for medically necessary services actually provided to eligible \nindividuals. Not achieving our goal of ending fraud, we just stack on \nmore rules that require honest providers to take more and more time \nfrom patient care to do paperwork while the crooks ignore us or accept \nas a challenge getting around the rules. There is no end in sight. This \nis a classic example of the road to hell being paved with good \nintentions. We have created a nightmare, and we have a responsibility \nto begin straightening out some of the confusion so honest health care \nproviders can take care of patients and we can concentrate on \nprosecuting those who willfully violate the law.\n  It is absolutely imperative that we accept nothing less than zero \ntolerance for real fraud and that the Government use all the tools at \nits disposal to prosecute willful violations of the law. It is equally \nimperative that we play fair with our partners who provide the health \ncare we pay for with Federal\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nfunds. When a participating hospital receives directions from its \nfiscal intermediary, the hospital should know it can follow those \ndirections without fear of being accused of fraud. Using the False \nClaims Act, the Justice Department is notifying hospitals that they are \nunder investigation for alleged billing fraud, offering minimal time to \nrespond or face prosecution. Hospitals are capitulating to these \ndemands even when they know no fraud has been committed simply because \nthey cannot afford to pay the accountants and lawyers to take on the \nDepartment of Justice. Others believe diverting these funds from \npatient care would be an irresponsible waste of tax dollars and not in \nthe best interests of Medicare beneficiaries. I certainly agree.\n  Respected physicians in my State, some personal friends of forty \nyears, have received letters recently from the ``Medicare Fraud Unit'' \ndemanding that they pay up immediately or face prosecution. They are \nconfused and annoyed about the complexity of Medicare rules and coding, \nbut they are outraged that they are being accused of fraud with no \nbasis whatsoever. I submit, Mr. President, that they deserve to be \nenraged. And it doesn't get any better once they enter negotiations and \nare virtually unable to practice medicine because of the auditors \nconsume most of the work day and office space. Then they wait for \nmonths to see if the ax will fall.\n  The Health Care Claims Guidance Act of 1998 would take a small but \nimportant step in the right direction. It would amend the False Claims \nAct to create special rules for claims in all Federally funded health \ncare programs. No criminal provisions are amended. The bill's \nprovisions apply only to health care claims limited to civil actions.\n  First, no action can be brought if the provider has relied on and \ncorrectly applied information supplied by a Federal agency or an agent \nthereof. Second, no action may be brought unless the amount of damages \nis material. Third, it establishes a safe harbor for hospitals with an \neffective compliance plan under the General Hospital Compliance \nGuidelines. And, fourth, it raises the burden of proof from a \n``preponderance of the evidence'' to a ``clear and convincing \nevidence'' standard.\n  Mr. President, let me make it clear once again, this bill in no way \nlimits the authority of the Government to recoup or otherwise recover \ndamages with respect to claims under any other provisions of law and \ndoes not apply to criminal provisions. It allows us to begin restoring \nthe partnership between the Federal Government and those who provide \nhealth care under Federal programs and encourages the Government to use \nits resources to prosecute those who violate that partnership. I urge \nmy colleagues to assist us in its early passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n        Frist, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2008. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprohibit the use of random audits, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n       the internal revenue service random audit prohibition act\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Internal \nRevenue Service Random Audit Prohibition Act. I wanted to take this \nopportunity to alert my colleagues of the Senate that the IRS has \nidentified a new enemy: innocent taxpayers.\n  Over the past several years, all of us have seen news accounts of \nregular, average citizens who have become the targets of grueling IRS \naudits. These individuals were neither wealthy nor powerful; in fact, \nthey were most often ordinary, law-abiding taxpayers who earned a \nmodest wage, ran a small business, or operated a family farm. Some \nstruggled just to make ends meet, and many were understandably confused \nabout what they had committed to justify the scrutiny of the IRS.\n  The truth is they committed no wrong. They were simply unfortunate \nvictims of an IRS practice called ``random audits,'' where the IRS \nsimply picks people out of a hat in the hope it can uncover some \nwrongdoing.\n  A recent report produced by the General Accounting Office (GAO) at my \nrequest confirms that the IRS has been targeting thousands of poor \ntaxpayers and small businesses for random audits. In fact, almost 95 \npercent of all random audits of individual taxpayers performed between \n1994 and 1996 were conducted on taxpayers who earned less than $25,000 \neach year.\n  Last Fall, hearings held by the Senate Finance Committee brought the \nIRS's abuse of taxpayers to the attention of the entire Nation. One \nwitness, Jennifer Long, who is a current field agent with the IRS, \nremarked, ``As of late, we seem to be auditing only the poor people. \nThe current IRS Management does not believe anyone in this country can \npossibly live on less than $20,000 per year, insisting anyone below \nthat level must be cheating by understating their true income.'' The \nIRS' belief that low-income families are more likely to cheat than \nothers services as a disturbing sign of how far it has strayed from the \nprinciples of American justice.\n  The GAO report also indicates that the IRS has been specifically \ntargeting my home state of Georgia for random audits. Nearly twice as \nmany random audits took place in Georgia between 1994 and 1996 than in \nall the New England states combined and Georgians are three-times more \nlikely to be randomly audited than their California counterparts. \nFurthermore, the GAO warns that we can expect that number of rise \ndramatically in Georgia over the next several years because the IRS \nbelieves small businesses in Georgia are more likely than other so-\ncalled ``subpopulations'' to engage in tax fraud. I do not understand \nwhy the IRS believes that Georgia small business are more likely to \ncheat than their counterparts elsewhere in the Nation. I still have not \nreceived an adequate reply from the IRS regarding any of these \ndevelopments.\n  Most of us understand the need to ensure tax code compliance through \nreasonable mechanisms. Where there is some indication that wrongdoing \nhas occurred, an audit may be appropriate. But Americans will not \naccept the IRS's assertion that enforcement requires them to go after \ninnocent, low-income taxpayers by using random audits that make no \ndistinction between the guilty and the innocent. Honest citizens \ndeserve better.\n  The legislation I introduce today, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, would remove random audits as a tool available to the IRS \nin its examination process. Victims of random audits would be entitled \nto damages of $5,000 after filing civil action, and the cost of \nlitigation would also be recoverable. In addition, my proposal would \nrequire the IRS to identify the basis for audit in any notice to the \naffected taxpayer of such an examination. Finally, the effective date \nfor these changes are set to the date of introduction. This puts the \nIRS on notice that Congress is deadly serious about the need to end \nrandom audits.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my effort to stop the IRS from \ntargeting innocent taxpayers. With passage of the IRS Random Audit \nProhibition Act, honest, hardworking taxpayers can be assured they will \nbe protected from unwarranted audits. They deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3784-2", "month": "04",

Res. 92\n\n         \n       Whereas the decennial census of population is the only \n     source of accurate, reliable, and comparable information on \n     the demographic, social, and economic characteristics of the \n     people of the United States and the communities in which they \n     live, for all geographic levels, including rural areas and \n     census tracts;\n       Whereas the Bureau of the Census, in response to a mandate \n     from Congress to reduce the reporting burden on the residents \n     of the United States, has proposed to include on the long-\n     form census questionnaire only those subjects that have \n     specific Federal legislative justification;\n       Whereas the demographic and socioeconomic data collected in \n     the decennial census helps policymakers assess population \n     changes, housing conditions, ancestry, and other patterns of \n     mobility and achievement for different regions and \n     governmental jurisdictions, as well as for different \n     population subgroups;\n       Whereas independent analysis by a panel convened by the \n     National Academy of Sciences determined that there are \n     essential public needs for information gathered by the long \n     form and that the extra cost of the census long form, once \n     the census has been designed to collect limited data for \n     every resident, is relatively low;\n       Whereas the National Academy of Sciences has concluded that \n     the long form does not significantly affect the overall mail \n     response rate to the census;\n       Whereas independent analyses of the decennial census have \n     found that the long form does not increase the undercount in \n     the census or the differential undercount of racial,\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\n     ethnic, and low-income populations to any significant extent;\n       Whereas administering a traditional long form at a later \n     point in time, instead of as part of the 2000 decennial \n     census of population, would substantially increase the cost \n     of collecting the data, place the quality of the data at \n     risk, and jeopardize the availability of reliable and timely \n     data for rural and small geographic areas;\n       Whereas the General Accounting Office has found that over \n     $170,000,000,000 in Federal program funds are distributed \n     each year to State and local governments on the basis of data \n     collected in the census, including data available only from \n     the long form; and\n       Whereas the collection of demographic, socioeconomic, \n     housing, and transportation data on the long form in the 2000 \n     decennial census of population is supported by Federal, \n     State, and local government officials and agencies, service \n     providers, researchers, and other social scientists who help \n     chart the direction of the United States, private sector \n     decisionmakers, and many other census stakeholders, as well \n     as by a panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences at \n     the direction of Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Commerce \n     should ensure that--\n       (1) the 2000 decennial census of population include the \n     administration of a long-form census questionnaire;\n       (2) the content of the long-form census questionnaire \n     include, at a minimum, the subjects sent to Congress by the \n     Bureau of the Census on March 31, 1997, in accordance with \n     section 141(f)(1) of title 13, United States Code; and\n       (3) a sufficient number of households received the long-\n     form census questionnaire to ensure the availability of \n     reliable data for small geographic areas, including rural \n     communities.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSMISSION TO THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     concurrent resolution to the Secretary of Commerce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3792-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 219--AUTHORIZING PRINTING OF THE MINUTES OF THE \n           SENATE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONFERENCES\n\n  Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, on May 2nd, twenty outstanding \nstudents from Central Falls High School in Rhode Island will visit \nWashington to compete in the national finals of the ``We The People . . \n. The Citizen And The Constitution'' program. In fact, this is the \nsecond time that the Central Falls High School team has won the \nstatewide competition!\n  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with it, the ``We The \nPeople . . . The Citizen And The Constitution'' program is among the \nmost extensive educational programs in the country focusing on \ncitizenship. The program was developed specifically to ensure that \nyoung people understand the history and philosophy of the Constitution \nand the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a \ncongressional hearing in which students are given the opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend \npositions on historical and contemporary constitutional issues.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We The People . \n. . The Citizen And The Constitution'' program provides an excellent \nopportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the \nsignificance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history. It \nis heartwarming to see young Rhode Islanders taking such an active and \nparticipatory interest in public affairs.\n  I am very proud of Rodolfo Alvarez, Paula Arango, Viviana Blandon, \nLiana Breton, Angela Cano, Elizabeth\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nCarmona, Jessica Carmona, Nicole Duguay, Arabella Garzon, Jennifer \nKelley, Suzanne Krupka, Kathleen Lopes, Gina Matuszek, Nicole Mercado, \nRichard Oliveira, Patricia Pina, Shelly Rua, Amanda Ryfa, Giovann \nRestrepo, Melisa Sylvestre, and Melissa Weber for making it to the \nnational finals. I applaud this terrific group of young men and women \nfor their hard work and perseverance. Also, Mr, President, I want to \ncongratulate Bert Brousseau, a fine teacher who deserves so much credit \nfor guiding the Central Falls High School team to the national finals.\n  On Tuesday, April 7th I was pleased to visit the Central Falls \nwinners. I couldn't resist giving them a spontaneous oral quiz. I am \nhappy to report that they responded to my questions superbly! \nCongratulations to Mr. Brousseau and his students for what they have \nalready achieved, and best of luck in the final competition. These \nstudents, with the guidance of Mr. Brousseau, have learned what our \nnation is all about and what countless men and women have fought and \ndied to protect. No matter what the outcome of the contest is, they \nhave each earned the greatest prize of all: Knowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3795-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nST. ANTHONY'S PARISH CELEBRATES THE BEGINNING OF ITS SEVENTY-FIFTH YEAR \n                    IN SERVICE TO GOD AND COMMUNITY\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on a hill in the western section of \nmy hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, stands St. Anthony's Roman \nCatholic Church, a beautiful and imposing masterpiece of architecture \nand a testimonial to the power of faith that dominates the skyline. \nFounded in 1924, St. Anthony's Parish has been a major force in the \nreligious, social, and cultural life in Wilmington for four \ngenerations. In addition to the magnificent church, the parish has \nbuilt St. Anthony's Grade School, an elementary school, and Padua \nAcademy, a fine high school for young women. In addition, there is \nFournier Hall, a center for the social and recreational needs of the \ncommunity; The Antonian--an apartment complex built to ensure that the \nneighborhood's senior citizens have access to quality, affordable \nhousing; and the Father Roberto Balducelli Community Center, which \nprovides day care for the community's children and daily activities for \ntheir grandparents and great-grandparents. And every June, St. \nAnthony's Festival draws tens of thousands of Delawareans and people \nfrom across the country for a week of good food, good fun, and a \ncelebration of God's blessings. For three-quarters of a century, the \ngood people of St. Anthony's Parish--both clergy and parishioners--have \nlooked to the needs of the entire community, and joined together to \nmeet those needs. The entire Greater Wilmington area has benefitted \nfrom their efforts. They truly have earned a special place in our lives \nand the life of our city.\n  As St. Anthony's Parish begins the year-long celebration of its \nseventy-fifth year, they have chosen to kick off that celebration \nThursday evening, April 30, with a dinner and Mass of Thanksgiving, in \nwhich they will honor three of the pillars of the parish, three \nindividuals who have labored long and hard over many years to build St. \nAnthony's into the vital part of community life that it has become; \nFather Mario Bugliosi, Brother Michael Rosenello, and Father Roberto \nBalducelli.\n  Father Mario came to Wilmington for the first time in 1954, as a \nteacher at Salesianum High School, a premier Catholic high school. \nAfter spending five years at Salesianum and a year at a high school in \nPhiladelphia, Father Mario returned to Wilmington in 1960 as an \nAssociate Pastor at St. Anthony's and, except for a two-year hiatus in \nhis native Italy, has been doing the Lord's work among us ever since. \nHis kind, gentle manner and complete decency--always there with a \nsupportive word for everyone--has made him the parish's chief \n``Confessor''--the man you go to in times of crisis (spiritual or \notherwise), at times when you are in need of advice and counsel, and at \ntimes when you simply need someone to listen. He personifies the notion \nthat ``to minister'' need not refer only to great and glorious words \nfrom the pulpit, but to a quiet moment over a cup of coffee, a shared \nwalk along the street, or to a visit to the home of someone in \nspiritual need.\n  Brother Mike--there are folks in the parish who refer to him as ``Mr. \nPadua'' for his yeoman like work at the school--also first came to St. \nAnthony's in 1954 as a Pastoral Assistant and the Director of Youth \nMinistry. After a short absence in the 1960's, he returned to the \nparish in 1966 as the Director of Parish Maintenance, where he has \noverseen virtually every aspect of life at the school, starting with \nthe construction of the new school building beginning in 1967. He \ndeveloped the girls' athletic programs at the school and coached \nbasketball himself for many years. He has organized and directed many \nof St. Anthony's most successful social events over the years and \ndecorated the church for all of its major feasts and celebrations. And \nperhaps most importantly to the students at Padua, he has overseen the \noperations of the school's cafeteria, ensuring that lunch time is both \ndelicious and nutritious as well as a time for catching up with \nfriends. He is one of those fellows who is always there when the parish \nor the parishioners need a fresh idea, an organizer, or a pair of hands \nused to hard work.\n\n  For fifty-two years, first as a teacher and Associate Pastor, then \nfor twenty-nine years as pastor, and for the past ten years as the \nparish's ``Senior Statesman'', Father Roberto Balducelli--``Father \nRobert'' to everyone in Wilmington--has been the man who makes things \nhappen. He is responsible for the building of St. Anthony's Grammar \nSchool, the Parish House and Rectory, the Padua Academy, and the \nAntonian. He was the founder of the community center which now bears \nhis name, and initiated the St. Anthony's festival, which has become \none of the premier social events for families of all faiths in the \nWilmington area. He is a living legend, known and respected by \nDelawareans who have never set foot in his church but who share his \nlove for our city and its people, and yet for all of his success in \nworking with the leaders of Delaware industry, commerce, and \ngovernment, he has never left the working-class community to which he \ncame from Italy a half-century ago. Twenty years ago, he was chosen by \nDelaware's largest newspaper, The News Journal as one of ten \noutstanding Delawareans--and he has been building upon that legacy for \ntwo decades since. Since his ``retirement'' in 1988, he has continued \nhis efforts to develop recreational facilities for young people \nbringing youngsters from the city out into the country to enjoy the \noutdoors and share in the spirituality and enjoyment of God's natural \ncreations. Those efforts would tax the energy of a dozen people half \nhis age, but for Father Robert, it is simply a continuation of his \ntireless energy on behalf of his flock. He is truly one of Delaware's \nliving treasures.\n  These three individuals, plus the thousands of parishioners and staff \nwho have worked so hard with them over the years, epitomize the old \nidea that a church is a vital part of the community, not just on \nSundays, but every day in many ways to everyone in the community. Their \nspirit is the spirit that has sustained St. Anthony's parish for \nseventy-five years, and hopefully will sustain the parish and its \nparishioners for many years to come.\n  I am honored to have the opportunity to salute that spirit and \ncommend St. Anthony's Parish as they embark upon their seventy-fifth \nyear doing God's work in Wilmington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3796-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3796-S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         POISON CONTROL CENTERS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. \n1862, the ``Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act.'' I \nbelieve this legislation is crucial to our effort to protect Americans, \nand American children in particular, from the tragic effects of \naccidental poisoning, and I commend my colleague, Senator DeWine, for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, more than 2 million times a year, poison control \ncenters in the United States receive a report of a poisoning. On \naverage that's almost 5,500 every day, over 225 every hour, and about 4 \ncalls each and every minute. More than 90 percent of these poisonings \nhappen in homes in Michigan and around the country, and over\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\nhalf of the poisoning victims are children under the age of 6.\n  The conveniences most of us take for granted can be dangerous for our \nchildren. The household cleaner we use to keep our counters and floors \nclean, the fertilizer that keeps our lawns green, the products we use \nto keep our yards and homes free of vermin, all can bring tragedy if \nthey fall into the hands of an innocent child.\n  People in my own state Michigan are lucky to have a regional poison \ncontrol center conveniently located in Grand Rapids. There clearly is a \nneed for this office, which handles approximately 50,000 calls a year \nand has taken over 800,000 calls since opening its doors in 1977. Like \nother poison control centers, the one in Grand Rapids deals mostly with \naccidents involving children under age 6.\n  As the parents of three children, all of them under age 6, my wife \nJane and I have become deeply disturbed about these sky-high poisoning \nstatistics. Because of this concern, we have gotten involved in an \neffort to strengthen existing and future poison control centers and to \nset up a 1-800 toll-free hotline. We also want to help establish a \nnational media campaign to make people aware of the availability of \npoison control resources in their communities.\n  That is why I am proud to be cosponsoring the ``Poison Control Center \nEnhancement and Awareness Act.'' This legislation would: establish a \ntoll-free number to make sure that all Americans have access to poison \ncontrol services; implement a nationwide media campaign to educate the \npublic and health care providers about poison prevention and to \nadvertise the new, nationwide toll-free number; and establish a grant \nprogram to help certified poison control centers prevent and provide \ntreatment recommendations for poisonings. The total amount of grant \nfunds available will be $25 million each year from 1999 to 2001. These \nfunds can be used to supplement other Federal, State, local or private \nfunds.\n  Mr. President, too many of our children stumble across dangerous \nchemicals right in their own homes. Too many of them suffer often \ntragic consequences when they unknowingly ingest these poisons. I \nbelieve we should do everything we can to see to it that our children \ndo not suffer in this way. At very small cost, the ``Poison Control \nCenter Enhancement and Awareness Act'' will provide increased access to \npoison control centers and help people who are trying to prevent and \ntreat poisoning.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3796-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DAIRY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. \n1982, the Dairy Reform Act of 1998, introduced by my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Rod Grams. The Federal Dairy Program was developed \nin the 1930's, when the Upper Midwest was seen as the primary reserve \nfor additional supplies of milk. The idea was to encourage the \ndevelopment of local supplies of fluid milk in areas of the country \nthat had not produced enough to meet local needs. Six decades ago, the \npoor condition of the American transportation infrastructure and the \nlack of portable refrigeration technology prevented Upper Midwest \nproducers from shipping fresh fluid milk to other parts of the country. \nTherefore, the only way to ensure consumers a fresh local supply of \nfluid milk was to provide dairy farmers in those distant regions with a \nboost in milk price large enough to encourage local production--that \nhigher price referred to as the Class I differential. Mr. President, \nthe system worked well--too well. Wisconsin is no longer this country's \nlargest milk producer. This program has outlived its necessity and is \nnow working only to shortchange the Upper Midwest, and in particular, \nWisconsin dairy farmers.\n  The Dairy Reform Act of 1998 is very simple. It establishes that the \nminimum Class I price differential will be the same, $1.80/\nhundredweight, for each marketing order. As many of you know, the price \nfor fluid milk increases at a rate of approximately 21 cents per 100 \nmiles from Eau Claire, WI. Fluid milk prices, as a result, are nearly \n$3 higher in Florida than in Wisconsin, more than $2 higher in New \nEngland, and more than $1 higher in Texas. This bill ensures that the \nClass I differentials will no longer vary according to an arbitrary \ngeographic measure--like the distance from Eau Claire Wisconsin. No \nlonger will the system penalize producers in the Upper Midwest with an \narchaic program that outlived its purpose years ago. This legislation \nidentifies one of the most unfair and unjustly punitive provisions in \nthe current system, and corrects it. There is no substantive, equitable \njustification to support non-uniform Class I differentials in present \nday policy.\n  USDA's Federal Milk Marketing Order reform proposal is currently \nbeing considered. It is long past the time to set aside regional \nbickering and address the problems in both options presented under the \nproposed rule. The Dairy Reform Act of 1998 will not adversely affect \nthe modest reform of Option 1B as offered by Secretary Glickman. It \nwill take Option 1B a step further and lead the dairy industry into a \nmore market oriented program. Also producers will still be able to \nreceive payment for transportation costs and over-order premiums. This \nmeasure would finally bring fairness to an unfair system. With this \nbill we will send a clear message to USDA and to Congress that Upper-\nMidwest dairy farmers will never stop fighting this patently unfair \nfederal milk marketing order system. After over 60 years of struggling \nunder this burden of inequality, Wisconsin's dairy industry deserves \nmore; it deserves a fair price.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/29/senate-section/article/S3797-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT T. STAFFORD ON HIS WORK FOR THE VERMONT RED CROSS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nretired U.S. Senator Bob T. Stafford. The Central Vermont-New Hampshire \nValley Chapter of the American Red Cross is honoring Bob with its most \nprestigious award at a dinner to be held at the Capitol Plaza Hotel in \nMontpelier, Vermont on May 7, 1998. He will receive the Chapter's \nVolunteer of the Year Award, in recognition for his six years of \nservice on the Board of Directors and his sterling leadership of the \nits capital campaign, ``Building for the 21st Century.''\n  Bob was elected to the Board of Directors in 1992, and has served on \na number of committees, including financial development and the \nexecutive committees, as well as chair of the capital campaign \ncommittee. He led the last committee by identifying and acquiring major \nlead gift pledges for the $1 million campaign, initiated in 1997.\n  Before joining the Red Cross Chapter's Board, he provided leadership \nfor several significant disaster fund-raising campaigns, including the \neffort to raise funds to support recovery operations during the 1992 \nflood that ravaged downtown Montpelier. He was also honorary chair of \nseveral special events to raise funds to support the operating expenses \nof the Chapter.\n  In addition to these honors, the Chapter is hosting the dinner as a \ncelebration and recognition of the longtime service of the state of \nVermont.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of House Joint Resolution 102, \nwhich is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H. J. Res. 102) expressing the sense of \n     the Congress on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the \n     founding of the modern State of Israel and reaffirming the \n     bonds of friendship and cooperation between the U.S. and \n     Israel.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to recount a little history--a \nhistory I'm sure many are familiar with. One hundred years ago last \nAugust, the first World Zionist Congress convened in the Swiss city of \nBasel. Although the gathering attracted little attention at the time, \nwhat transpired then would forever change the course of Jewish history, \nand indeed world history.\n  What later came to be known as the Basel Program stated quite simply \nthat the aim of Zionism was ``To create for the Jewish people a home in \nPalestine secured by public law.''\n  With that simple proposition, the delegates at the first Congress \nformally set into motion the Jewish national liberation movement. It \nwould mean the fulfillment of a spiritual yearning that had remained \nunrealized for over two millennia.\n  At the conclusion of the conference, Theodor Herzl recorded a \nprescient entry in his diary:\n\n       In Basel, I founded the Jewish state. If I were to say this \n     aloud I would meet with laughter; but in another five years, \n     and certainly in another fifty years, everyone will be \n     convinced of this.\n\n  From the distance of a hundred years, I can say we are convinced.\n  Of course, it took fifty years of sacrifice--and a world shamed by \nthe Holocaust--before Herzl's dream of a Jewish homeland became a \nreality. But it happened, and tomorrow we celebrate fifty years of \nIsraeli independence.\n  In that short span of time, Israel has become the beacon of hope for \nJews the world over. It has successfully absorbed wave after wave of \nimmigrants from every corner of the globe. It has built a thriving \neconomy larger than the economies of all its immediate neighbors \ncombined. It is the sole democracy in a region where dictatorships and \nmonarchies are the norm. It excels in science, technology, and culture \nfar out of proportion to its small population.\n  In short, the Jewish people have, after long tribulation, taken their \nrightful place among nations. And Israel has become a symbol to all of \nus.\n  The very fact that Israel exists means that Jews will never again be \nat someone else's mercy. They are masters of their destiny. Israel is \nthe tangible expression of the solemn vow we made after the Holocaust--\n``Never Again.''\n  Never again will Jews be powerless. Never again will they have to \nrely upon the mercy and goodwill of an overlord. Never again will they \nhave to watch helplessly as nearly half of their people is \nexterminated. Put simply, Israel symbolizes the restoration of Jewish \nindependence and dignity.\n  Nearly a quarter century ago as a junior Senator on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, in my first official trip overseas, I made a \nformative journey to Israel. It was just after the Yom Kippur war--a \nwar that vividly brought home Israel's vulnerability as well as the \nabsolute necessity of an intimate U.S.-Israel relationship.\n  The lessons I learned on that journey have remained with me ever \nsince. In the past twenty-five years, I have worked with six different \nIsraeli Prime Ministers and six different American Presidents. I have \nbeen twice in the majority party in the Senate and I am now in the \nminority for the second time.\n  But through it all, the United States relationship with Israel has \nremained a constant feature. It transcends individual leaders and \npolitical parties. It is not subject to the vagaries of international \nevents. The bond between Israel and the United States is unbreakable.\n  This strategic and moral partnership between Israel and the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\nhas made possible the peace agreements between Israel and three former \nadversaries.\n  As Israel's enemies have seen that they cannot drive a wedge between \nour two countries, so they have come to recognize slowly but surely \nthat Israel is here to stay.\n  I know that I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that the \nAmerican commitment to Israel over the next 50 years will be just as \nreliable as it has been in Israel's first 50 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with Senator \nLott in sponsoring this resolution honoring the 50th anniversary of \nIsrael's founding.\n  I had the privilege of speaking last week at the U.S. Holocaust \nMemorial Founders Reunion in Washington. In my remarks, I quoted from \none of the sages of the Torah, who told us more than 200 years ago that \nGod could have created plants that would grow into loaves of bread. \nInstead, He created wheat for us to grow and mill and transform into \nbread.\n  Why?\n  Because He wanted us to be able to take part in the miracle of \ncreation.\n  And, just as the founders of the Holocaust Museum can take pride in \ntheir contribution to the creation of that memorial, so too can \nIsraelis take great pride in their contributions to the creation of the \nmodern State of Israel.\n  In my remarks to the Holocaust Museum founders, I also cited Elie \nWiesel's view that: ``Survivors are understood by survivors only. They \nspeak in code. All outsiders could do was come close to the gates.''\n  That is what the Holocaust Memorial Museum allows us to do: to come \nclose to the gates; to see; to grieve; and, finally, to learn, so that \nwe can pass the knowledge on, from generation to generation, about what \ncan happen when intolerance and hatred are allowed to spread unchecked.\n  One of the greatest benefits of the Holocaust Museum is that it helps \nits millions of visitors understand why there must be an Israel. The \nHolocaust Museum is evidence of the fact that out of the unspeakable \nhorror of the Holocaust has come the miracle of the creation of the \nState of Israel to provide a homeland for Jews around the world. Out of \nthis tragedy has come the modern-day State of Israel, the 20th century \nversion of the 3,000-year old historic Kingdom of Israel.\n  We are introducing this resolution today to celebrate and commemorate \nthe 50th anniversary of Israel's founding and to offer the Senate's \ncongratulations on reaching this important landmark.\n  Mr. President, fifty years is not considered long relative to the \nlifespan of an England, a China or an India. In the case of Israel, \nhowever, it is an eternity when we factor in the obstacles it has faced \nduring these fifty years.\n  Throughout its existence, Israel has faced an array of enemies \ndedicated to its destruction. It has been forced to fight six wars, \nbattle against countless terrorist acts, survive economically in the \nface of widespread economic boycotts, and make its way in the world \ndespite international criticism against it.\n  This resolution commemorates not only Israel's ability to survive \nthese odds, but also its ability to thrive and prosper in the face of \nthese constraints and to maintain its adherence to democracy and the \nrule of law. Israel today is a dynamic, vibrant society committed to \nthe same values and principles as the United States.\n  Another important reason we are offering this resolution is to \nreiterate the strength of the partnership between the U.S. and Israel--\na partnership based on shared values, interests and goals. Israel is a \ntrusted ally and an important strategic partner.\n  I would like to make the resolution's four resolved clauses part of \nmy statement offering my best wishes to Israel on this important \noccasion.\n  The measure resolves that the United States recognizes the historic \nsignificance of the fiftieth anniversary of the re-establishment of the \nsovereign and independent modern State of Israel.\n  It commends the people of Israel for their remarkable achievements in \nbuilding a new state and a pluralistic democratic society in the Middle \nEast in the face of terrorism, hostility and belligerence by many of \nher neighbors.\n  It reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation which have \nexisted between the United States and Israel for the past half-century \nand which have been significant for both countries.\n  And it extends the warmest congratulations and best wishes to the \nState of Israel and her people for a peaceful and prosperous and \nsuccessful future.\n  Mr. President, I urge all Senators to join me in sending our \ncongratulations to Israel on this noteworthy day.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my congratulations \non the upcoming 50th Anniversary of the founding of the state of \nIsrael. Throughout Israel and the United States, people will gather \ntogether to commemorate this anniversary, to reflect upon the \naccomplishments of the Israeli people, and to look forward to the new \nmillennium.\n  Not unlike the founding of our own nation, a small group of leaders \ngathered in the Tel Aviv Museum at 4:00 on May 14, 1948 to realize a \ndream by formally declaring the creation of the state of Israel. Few \nAmericans may be aware that within 11 minutes of that declaration, \nPresident Harry Truman had taken the necessary steps to offer formal \ndiplomatic recognition to this new nation, making the United States the \nfirst nation to recognize Israel as a sovereign state. From that point, \nthe United States and Israel cemented a friendship based on our common \nbonds: from cultural and religious ties to a mutual belief in the power \nof democracy to the assurance of a peaceful, prosperous future.\n  Each time I have visited Israel, I have been impressed with the hope \nfor the future expressed by her people. This hope exists despite the \nchallenges Israel has faced from the moment of its creation. In many \nways, I believe these challenges have helped the Israeli people create \na society that serves as an example to all nations.\n  It is a society based on democracy. In a region where the seeds of \ndemocracy have not fully taken root, Israel has a vibrant democracy \nwith strong public participation. It is a prosperous society. Despite a \nwide variety of economic challenges, Israel's economy has grown to the \npoint where per capita income rivals that of most Western nations. \nFinally, it is a society based on opportunity. Like our own country, \nIsrael is a nation of immigrants. It is a nation that has gathered \npeople from around the world with the promise of political and \nreligious freedom.\n  Today, Israel continues to face challenges as it prepares to move \ninto the 21st Century. As the people of Israel seek to achieve economic \nindependence, ensure their security, and create a lasting peace with \ntheir neighbors, they do so with the assurance of the continued strong \nrelationship with the United States.\n  Mr. President, the words Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion delivered in \nhis address to a new nation still ring true today:\n\n       Whatever we have achieved is the result of the efforts of \n     earlier generations no less than our own. It is also the \n     result of unwavering fidelity to our precious heritage, the \n     heritage of a small nation that has suffered much, but at the \n     same time has won for itself a special place in the history \n     of mankind because of its spirit, faith, and vision.\n\n  Mr. President, again, I offer my congratulations to the people of \nIsrael on this 50th Anniversary. We share with them the bond of \ndemocracy and the hope of a peaceful and prosperous future.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be considered as read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution (H.J.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the resolution of \nratification for NATO enlargement.\n  In my view, there are four questions that must be answered in the \naffirmative in order to support NATO expansion.\n  No. 1, are the risks to relations with Russia and arms control \nacceptable?\n  No. 2, are we sure what NATO expansion will cost and who will pay for \nit?\n  No. 3, has a compelling argument been made as to why expansion is \nnecessary?\n  No. 4, are we certain that enlargement will not have perverse \nconsequences, fostering instability in Eastern Europe and perpetuating \nthe danger from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal?\n  I am convinced, after thorough review, that the answers to these \nquestions are all no.\n  I start with the observation of Mr. George Kennan, perhaps the \nforemost observer of U.S.-Russian relations. Mr. Kennan, who was, after \nall, the architect of the containment policy that proved so effective, \nsaid in a Newsday editorial on March 15 that, ``Expanding NATO would be \nthe most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-world war \nera.''\n  Mr. President and colleagues, let me repeat. George Kennan, the \narchitect of containment, said as recently as March 15 that, \n``Expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in \nthe entire post-world war era.''\n  That is a pretty serious statement by someone who has great \ncredibility based on his record. He is not alone in that assessment. \nFormer Senator Nunn, who enjoyed enormous respect on both sides of the \naisle in this Chamber, has discussed a dangerous contradiction at the \ncenter of the argument for expansion, saying that while enlargement is \nintended to protect former Soviet satellites, nothing else is as likely \nto remilitarize Russia and endanger those very countries as NATO \nenlargement.\n  Senator Nunn is not alone. We are hearing from leaders in Russia \ntheir warnings to us not to proceed. I recently met--with a group of \nSenators and Members of the House of Representatives--with Alexi \nArbatov, who is deputy chairman of the Duma's defense committee. He \ntold us, ``If you proceed with NATO enlargement, you are handing a \npowerful issue to the radicals in Russia. You are energizing the \nextreme nationalists in Russia, and you are weakening the forces for \ndemocracy.''\n  Mr. President, we should not lightly dismiss the warnings of \ncommitted democrats in Russia like Alexi Arbatov and others who have \ngiven us similar warnings. I think it says a great deal that the \nprimary architects of American strategy during the cold war, George \nKennan and Paul Nitze, have cautioned the Senate against ratification \nand NATO expansion.\n  Nearly 50 years ago, as successive heads of the State Department's \npolicy planning staff during the Truman Administration, Kennan and \nNitze understood that containment of the Soviet Union was critically \nimportant to the free world. Today, they have told us that NATO \nexpansion is a mistake.\n  I believe the stakes are very high. Remilitarization in Russia is a \nserious threat. Avoiding this outcome should be our priority, not \nenlarging NATO.\n  The first casualty of our expansion of NATO may very well be progress \non arms control. I know that many of my colleagues do not like to be in \na position where it seems the Senate's decisions about foreign policy \nare dependent on reaction in Russia. It smacks of blackmail. The \nproblem with this thinking is that it assumes that something we need is \nbeing held hostage.\n  As I have discussed, there simply is no compelling argument for why \nwe must expand NATO. Therefore, to risk relations with Russia and arms \ncontrol are not acceptable. The Duma's expeditious ratification of \nSTART II should be our priority. In pursuing our national interest we \nare in no way giving in to Russian blackmail.\n  I might add it is not just a question of START II ratification, but \nit is also clearly in our national interest to make a priority of \nreducing the threat from the tactical nuclear weapons that are in the \nRussian arsenal.\n  By rejecting NATO enlargement, we would simply be choosing not to \nembark on a dangerous and unjustified course of enlarging NATO and \nwould avoid making a terrible mistake in the course of U.S.-Russian \nrelations.\n  The second point I think needs to be made is that NATO enlargement \nbrings unknown costs. The case for enlargement becomes increasingly \nsuspect when we look at questions related to the costs and who will \nbear them.\n  I direct the attention of my colleagues to a chart on the various \nestimates that have been issued with respect to the cost of NATO \nenlargement. The Congressional Budget Office issued an estimate of $21 \nbillion to $125 billion. The Rand Corporation said the\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\ncost would be $10 billion to $110 billion. The first Clinton \nadministration estimate was $27 billion to $35 billion. NATO itself has \nput a price tag of $1.5 billion on expansion. And the second Clinton \nadministration estimate was $1.5 billion.\n  You talk about a wide-ranging estimate. We have anywhere from $1.5 \nbillion to $125 billion. I do not know where the truth lies. I am a \nmember of the Budget Committee, as is the distinguished occupant of the \nChair. I think it is fair to say that none of us has a truly credible \nestimate with respect to the cost of NATO enlargement.\n  This takes me to another key question. Who is going to pay this tab? \nI think all of us know these estimates are probably far off the mark. \nThey probably understate in a very serious way the potential costs of \nNATO enlargement.\n  The third main point that must be made with regard to NATO \nenlargement is that no compelling argument for expansion has been made. \nWhat is the military threat that we are encountering? After all, NATO \nis a military alliance. What threat are we defending against by \nexpanding NATO? I see no immediate Russian threat to the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary, or Poland.\n  We must remember that article V of the North Atlantic Charter states \nclearly that an attack on any one member nation is to be considered an \nattack on all. The test for extension of such a guarantee ought to be \nsimple and clear. We must be convinced that the safety of the American \npeople is directly tied to the security of the country in question, and \ntherefore we must defend that country as we would our own. That must be \nthe test.\n  Clearly, Western Europe's freedom from Soviet domination was central \nto the survival of our country and of the free world. Article V \ndeterred Moscow by sending an unmistakable message that a Soviet move \nagainst Bonn, West Germany, would have been resisted as would an attack \non Bismarck, North Dakota. But nearly 10 years after the fall of the \nBerlin Wall, the Russian army weakened and  greatly reduced, and \nwarning times dramatically expanded, I fail to understand why it is \nimmediately imperative that we provide that same guarantee to Budapest, \nHungary.\n\n  Mr. President, what is our national interest? That is the question \nbefore this body. I believe the overarching priority is to further \nreduce nuclear weapons that are in the Russian arsenal. And the \nquestion before the Senate is whether NATO enlargement will slow down \nthe progress towards arms control or will speed it up.\n  I don't think there is any question that there exists in expanding \nNATO a clear risk to this true priority. The overwhelming likelihood is \nthat the U.S. vital interest, which is in reducing the threat from the \nRussian nuclear arsenal, will be harmed. Expanding NATO is not in our \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, concern about possible instability in Eastern Europe \ndoes not justify expansion of NATO. NATO is not the only vehicle for \nstability in Europe. Other options that deserve review include \nexpansion of the European Union, or reworking the Partnership for Peace \nor the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Expansion \nof a military alliance is not our only option. In fact, it appears to \nthis Senator that it is the worst option. I think the New York Times \nput it very well when it stated in a recent editorial: ``There is \nsimply no compelling security justification for NATO enlargement.''\n  Fourth point: NATO expansion may have perverse consequences, \nincreasing instability in Eastern Europe and perpetuating the danger \nfrom Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal. The impact of expansion on \nEastern Europe and proliferation are perhaps the least studied of all \naspects of this issue. But these are some of the most important \nconcerns. After all, stability in Eastern Europe and the safety of our \ncountry is why we are debating NATO enlargement on the Senate floor \ntonight.\n  I am very concerned that NATO enlargement could actually increase the \ndanger in Eastern Europe. As former Senator Nunn has indicated, \nexpansion could create the very danger from Russia that it is intended \nto prevent. Expanding NATO to foster stability could have the perverse \nresult of increasing the danger to the former Soviet satellites that we \ndecide not to include. By not including some countries while welcoming \nothers, Russia might well conclude that some countries in Eastern \nEurope are less important to us than others, and therefore easier to \nintimidate. Let us not draw new lines in Eastern Europe without serious \nthought about their consequences.\n  NATO expansion may additionally drive remilitarization and arms \nbuildups. We are asking Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to \nsignificantly increase their defense budgets.  How can we expect their \nneighbors to respond? How can we expect Russia to respond? Just as the \nRussian extreme nationalists are predicting, it would appear that NATO \nexpansion would have the effect of tipping the conventional balance in \nEurope even further against Russia.\n\n  This is what the Russian forces for democracy are warning us against. \nThey are saying: ``Don't you understand that if you proceed with NATO \nenlargement, those who are the most radical elements in Russia, those \nwho are the extreme nationalists, will seize on this and they will look \nto the capability of this expanded military alliance and they will say \nthe capability of NATO is to put tanks on our border?''\n  We will answer, in the United States: ``But NATO is not an offensive \nmilitary alliance; it is defensive in nature.''\n  And those who are the extreme nationalists and the radicals in Russia \nwill respond: ``NATO says it is a defensive alliance, but why are they \nputting tanks on our border? We don't know what the long-term \nintentions of NATO are,'' they will argue, ``but we do know NATO's \ncapability--and that capability is to put tanks on our border.''\n  How will that be used politically in Russia? How will that be used in \na post-Yeltsin era? Will it strengthen the hardliners and those who \nargue for remilitarization? Or will it strengthen the forces for \ndemocracy and a market economy? I do not think it takes any great \nanalysis to figure out the result in Russia or how it will be used \npolitically. Those in Russia who argue for democracy, who argue for \narms control and arms reductions, who argue for a market economy, they \nare warning us that we are weakening them, and that we are \nstrengthening the forces for remilitarization.\n  Mr. President, I also believe NATO enlargement could perpetuate the \ndanger from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal. According to General \nHabiger, the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, Russia has 7,000 to \n12,000 tactical nuclear weapons. That bears repeating: Russia has 7,000 \nto 12,000 tactical nuclear weapons. The United States today has \napproximately 1,600. What is going to happen with Russia's tactical \nnuclear stockpile if NATO expansion goes forward? What will Russia's \ndecisionmaking be about their huge advantage in tactical nuclear \nweapons?\n  I am concerned that NATO expansion will hurt the prospect of an \nagreement on tactical nuclear arms because it will increase Russia's \nreliance on those very weapons. Russia already sees itself \nconventionally outmatched by NATO. It has abandoned its nuclear policy \nof no first use. NATO enlargement will simply increase their \ninsecurity, making them less willing to part with their tactical \nnuclear weapons. This will mean it will be harder to reduce the threat \nof theft, sale, or unauthorized use of these weapons.\n  I will be addressing this issue with an amendment. But first, let me \nconclude on the question of NATO enlargement.\n  Mr. President, NATO expansion fails on the four tests that I outlined \nat the outset of my remarks, leading me to the following conclusions. \nFirst, the risks to relations with Russia and arms control are \nunacceptable. Second, we are not certain what NATO expansion will cost \nor who will pay for it. Third, there is no compelling argument for why \nexpanding NATO is necessary, especially when there are other \nalternatives. And, fourth, there is ample reason to conclude that \nenlargement will have perverse consequences, increasing instability in \nEastern Europe and perpetuating the danger from the Russian tactical \nnuclear arsenal.\n  Fortunately, it is not too late. Columnist Jim Hoagland in a column \nin the Washington Post last month said: ``The Senate needs an extended \ndebate, not an immediate vote.''\n  Jim Hoagland has it right. We do need an extended debate. There \nshould\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\nnot be a rush to judgment. There are serious questions that should be \nanswered.\n  The Senate, in my judgment, should not give in to the Cold War \nargument about American credibility being on the line. How many times \nhave we seen that argument called up in this Chamber? When the \narguments are weak on behalf of a decision that is already moving \nforward, we have colleagues who rush to the floor and say, ``Oh, it \nmight not be such a good idea, but America's credibility is on the \nline. Our President has made this commitment, and therefore we must go \nalong to maintain American credibility.''\n\n  I remember that argument being made in the Vietnam era. It wasn't a \ngood argument then, and it is not a good argument now.\n  The better course, rather than moving to expand NATO, is to tell the \nadministration we should, first, investigate alternatives to NATO \nenlargement, such as expansion of the European Union. Second, we should \nhave a new round of hearings when the results of the studies that are \nrequired by this resolution are available. That, after all, was the \nrecommendation of former Senators Sam Nunn and Howard Baker. And third, \nwe ought to pursue arms control as our top priority.\n  As Professor Michael Mandelbaum of Johns Hopkins University has \nadvised us: NATO expansion is at best a distraction from, and at worst \na hindrance to, making progress on these issues.\n  Mr. President, I believe we ought to take Professor Mandelbaum's \nsound advice. Before we rush headlong into expanding NATO, we ought to \nthink carefully about what is truly in our country's interests.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2320\n\n    (Purpose: To encourage progress on reducing the threat posed by \n                Russia's non-strategic nuclear arsenal)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on a related matter, I would like to at \nthis point lay down my amendment, as provided for in the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  Mr. President, as I have considered NATO enlargement, it seems to me \nto be clear we need to put the Senate on record during the NATO debate \nsupporting cooperative efforts with the Russians to reduce the threat \nfrom Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal.\n  At the outset, allow me to emphasize that recent years have seen \nimportant progress on arms control. Reduced tensions with Moscow have \nallowed important treaties to be negotiated that have made the world a \nfar safer place. One of the great successes has been the Intermediate-\nrange Nuclear Forces Treaty. That agreement has eliminated an entire \nclass of nuclear weapons, including the Pershing missiles that this \nbody debated so intensely. The Conventional Forces in Europe treaty has \nmarkedly reduced tanks and artillery and armored vehicles in Europe. \nTwo START accords have been negotiated, deeply cutting strategic \nnuclear forces.\n  Unfortunately, there have been no arms control treaties on tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, this chart demonstrates the record on arms control. On \nconventional forces, the red bar shows eastern forces, which during the \nCold War were part of the Warsaw Pact. The blue bar shows NATO forces. \nWe can see on conventional forces sharp reductions in the treaty \nlimited equipment of both the old Warsaw Pact and NATO. The same is \ntrue under the START accords--dramatic reductions on both sides in \nstrategic systems.\n  But on tactical forces there has been no treaty. We don't know with \nany precision what has happened in the former Soviet Union. We don't \nknow what their inventory is.\n  In 1991 the United States had more than 3,500 tactical weapons in \nEurope. The U.S.S.R. is estimated to have had around 15,000. In 1991, \nPresidents Bush and Gorbachev unilaterally pledged to withdraw most \ntactical nuclear weapons from Europe and begin dismantlement.\n  Since that time, this country has withdrawn all but around 400 \ntactical nuclear weapons from Europe, and dismantled all but about \n1,600 of our tactical nuclear weapons in total.\n  The story on the Russian side has been very different. With the \ncollapse of the Soviet empire and a 70 percent reduction in military \nspending, weapon dismantlement has slowed to a crawl. All former Soviet \ntactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn to Russia and placed in \nstorage, but today we don't know how many of those weapons Russia has.\n  The excellent Nunn-Lugar Program has helped the Russians round up and \naccount for many of these weapons. The fact is, however, we don't know \nhow many they retain.\n  That arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons is clearly a threat. Because \nthere is not any arms control regime covering tactical nuclear weapons, \nwe are not allowed to inspect, to assess the security of those tactical \nwarheads, and determine their number.\n  Let's go to the second chart to highlight this point.\n  In 1991, it is estimated that the U.S.S.R. had 15,000 tactical \nnuclear weapons--15,000. We had in the range of 3,500 deployed in \nEurope. Today, we have just over 400 in Europe. But the Russians \nretain, according to the head of the U.S. Strategic Command, General \nHabiger, 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear weapons. And yet, arms \ncontrol agreements do not cover this category of weapons.\n  On strategic systems, we have come down on both sides, and have come \ndown sharply. The same is true with regard to conventional forces in \nEurope. But regarding tactical nuclear weapons, there is an enormous \ndisparity. Russia has in the range of 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear \nweapons. We are down in the range of 400 tactical warheads in Europe, \nand approximately 1,600 in all.\n  The lack of a treaty means we have no guarantee that Russia's numbers \nwill come down. The 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear warheads inside \nRussia present the greatest threat of theft or sale of nuclear warheads \nin the world today. These constitute the greatest so-called ``loose \nnuke'' threat. We have reason to believe that the danger with those \ntactical warheads is greater than with strategic warheads because \ntactical weapons are not subject to the START accords. They are largely \nin storage, not deployed on missiles, bombers, and submarines where \nthey are likely to be better protected.\n  A recent story in the Jerusalem Post indicated that Iran may have \nbeen able to purchase up to four former Soviet nuclear warheads earlier \nthis decade. This report highlights an important danger. Terrorist use \nof one of these weapons would be devastating. A nuclear blast would \nmake the Oklahoma City fertilizer bomb look like a firecracker. Today, \nmany tactical nuclear warheads have yields that dwarf the device that \ndestroyed Hiroshima in 1945.\n  Mr. President, this chart tells us something about terrorist use of a \ntactical nuclear warhead. It tells us how devastating it would be. The \nfertilizer bomb detonated in Oklahoma City two years ago had a \ndestructive yield in the range of two one-thousandths of a kiloton. The \nso-called ``fat man'' atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, 13 \nkilotons. Smaller tactical weapons of today can be in the range of 10 \nkilotons. Some tactical nuclear weapons have been reported to be as \nsmall as a suitcase. Some larger tactical nuclear weapons can have a \nyield of more than 300 kilotons. And remember--Russia has 7,000 to \n12,000 tactical nuclear warheads, devices that are not included in any \narms control regime. We don't have an accounting. We don't have the \naccountability that comes with a formal inspection regime.\n  The threat from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal is where we ought \nto be directing our attention. This is what ought to be our top \npriority. We endanger progress by moving to enlarge NATO at this time.\n  The other threat is one that has been highlighted by the United \nStates Strategic Command. Strategic warhead levels would likely decline \nto around 2,250 under a START III accord. An 8-to-1 Russian advantage \nin tactical warheads becomes a major strategic concern in this \nenvironment. Let me direct the Senate's attention to this chart.\n  The strategic breakout danger has been referenced by some of our top \nmilitary leaders. The United States, under a START III accord, would \nlikely have 2,250 deployed strategic nuclear warheads. Russia would \npresumably have the same number. But look what happens on the tactical \nside. With tactical nuclear weapons, our arsenal would stand at around \n1,500. Russia could still be at 7,000 to 12,000 tactical\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\nwarheads, an enormous disparity. And that leads to a concern about \nstrategic instability.\n\n  This is especially true in light of the fact that the distinction \nbetween tactical and strategic weapons has been disappearing. During \nthe early years of the Cold War, large nuclear weapons with yields in \nthe tens of megatons were needed. At that time, our ICBMs and other \ndelivery systems were inaccurate enough that a massive bomb was needed \nto destroy a target. But as the accuracy of missiles increased, many \nlarge multimegaton bombs were replaced with strategic weapons with much \nsmaller yields. Today, for example, the warheads on the MX--or \nPeacekeeper--have a yield of 350 kilotons.\n  As the next chart notes, this is in the range of many tactical \nnuclear weapons today.\n  During the cold war, many strategic weapons were in the range of 500 \nkilotons to 10 megatons. Today, tactical weapons can range from 10 \nkilotons to around 400 kilotons or more. Many of today's strategic \nweapons are in the range of 300 kilotons to 1 megaton.\n  So the difference in yield between strategic systems and tactical \nnuclear systems has been altered dramatically over time. There is much \nless of a distinction between the yield of strategic warheads and \ntactical warheads than in the past.\n  The implication is clear and disturbing. The 7,000 to 12,000 tactical \nwarheads that General Habiger has said the Russians could have are \ntaking on a strategic relevance. I think my colleagues would agree that \na massive Russian superiority could be destabilizing.\n  My amendment would send a clear signal of Senate support for progress \non reducing the threat from Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal. It \nsupports the recommendation of General Habiger, the general charged \nwith America's nuclear security, that future arms control initiatives \nshould include tactical warheads.\n  Let's listen to America's nuclear commander. He says: ``The Russians \nhave anywhere from 7,000 to more than 12,000 of these nonstrategic \nnuclear weapons, and we need to bring them into the equation.'' This \nfrom General Eugene Habiger, Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command.\n  My amendment is simple and deserves the support of every Senator. Its \npurpose is to put the Senate on record in the context of the NATO \ndebate as being concerned about the danger of ``loose nukes.'' The \nstrategic implications of Russia's arsenal are also critically \nimportant. We should continue to work cooperatively with the Russians \nto reduce this threat. I believe the dangers in this area require an \nincreased emphasis if we are to be serious about arms control.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Bingaman, the ranking member on \nthe Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, in \noffering this amendment.\n  Briefly, my amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that it would \nbe advisable for future nuclear arms control agreements with the \nRussian Federation to address tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.\n  And second, the administration should work with the Russian \nFederation to increase transparency, exchange data, increase warhead \nsecurity and facilitate weapons dismantlement.\n  My amendment contains a simple but important certification. Prior to \ndeposit of the instruments of ratification, the administration shall \ncertify to the Senate that, one, with regard to tactical nuclear \nweapons it is the policy of the United States to work with the Russian \nFederation to increase transparency, exchange data, increase warhead \nsecurity and facilitate weapons dismantlement; and that two, \ndiscussions toward this end are underway with the Russian Federation.\n  The administration should be able to meet this certification with \nlittle difficulty based on current staff level discussions. \nNevertheless, this provision puts the Senate on record and the \nadministration on notice that the Senate is interested and concerned.\n  Finally, my amendment requires a report within 180 days after deposit \nof the instruments of ratification on the status of the Russian \ntactical nuclear arsenal, the threats associated with it, and plans to \ncontinue to work cooperatively with the Russian Federation on \nincreasing transparency, exchanging data, increasing warhead security \nand facilitating weapons dismantlement.\n  These, Mr. President, ought to be our clear goals.\n  I also believe this amendment is timely and we need this statement \nnow.\n  As Senator Moynihan has discussed, Russian officials have said that \nin the face of an expanding NATO and dwindling Russian conventional \nforces, they will have to place greater reliance on nuclear weapons. \nThat is a valid concern. Rushing to enlarge NATO could reduce Russia's \nwillingness to cooperate on tactical nuclear arms. NATO expansion could \nperpetuate the risk of sale or theft of a ``loose nuke'' and Russia's \nmassive lead over the United States in tactical warheads.\n  Even if the Senate approves NATO enlargement, we need to keep our eye \non the ball. That ball is arms control. My amendment sends a clear and \ncompelling signal to Moscow that we want to continue to work with them \nto reduce the threat in this area.\n  Mr. President, I believe there is nothing in this amendment that is a \nhazard to NATO enlargement. Although I personally oppose enlargement, I \nbelieve it would be a serious mistake for the Senate not to pass this \namendment. I believe it should be approved.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the staff for their \npatience. I thank my colleagues for this opportunity, and I hope they \nwill support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Mr. Bingaman, proposes an executive amendment numbered 2320.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in section 3 of the resolution, \n     insert the following:\n       (  ) Non-Strategic Nuclear Weapons--\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds that\n       (i) the United States Strategic Command has estimated that \n     the Russian Federation has between 7,000 and 12,000 non-\n     strategic nuclear warheads, weapons that--unlike strategic \n     systems--are not covered by any arms control accord;\n       (ii) the thousands of tactical nuclear warheads inside \n     Russia present the greatest threat of sale or theft of a \n     nuclear weapon in the world today;\n       (iii) with the number of deployed strategic warheads in the \n     Russian and United States arsenals likely to be reduced to \n     around 2,250 warheads under a START III accord, Russia's vast \n     superiority in tactical nuclear warheads becomes a strategic \n     concern;\n       (iv) the Commander in Chief of the United States Strategic \n     Command has stated that future nuclear arms control \n     agreements should address tactical nuclear weapons;\n       (v) statements from Russian officials that NATO enlargement \n     would force Russia to rely more heavily on its nuclear \n     arsenal have caused concern that NATO expansion could be an \n     impediment to progress on tactical nuclear arms control; and,\n       (vi) the danger of theft or sale of a tactical nuclear \n     warhead, and the destabilizing strategic implications of \n     Russia's enormous lead in tactical nuclear weapons creates an \n     urgent need for progress on increasing the security of \n     Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal and working toward \n     conclusion of a US-Russian agreement on tactical nuclear arms \n     in Europe.\n       (B) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that\n       (i) it would be advisable for future nuclear arms control \n     agreements with the Russian Federation to address non-\n     strategic nuclear weapons in Europe; and,\n       (ii) the Administration should work with the Russian \n     Federation to increase transparency, exchange data, increase \n     warhead security, and facilitate weapon dismantlement.\n       (C) Certification.--Prior to the deposit of the instruments \n     of ratification, the Administration shall certify to the \n     Senate that with regard to non-strategic nuclear weapons\n       (i) it is the policy of the United States to work with the \n     Russian Federation to increase transparency, exchange data, \n     increase warhead security, and facilitate weapon \n     dismantlement; and,\n       (ii) that discussions toward these ends have been initiated \n     with the Russian Federation.\n       (D) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the deposit of \n     the instruments of ratification, the President shall submit a \n     report to the Senate on the Russian Federation's nonstrategic \n     nuclear arsenal. This report shall include\n       (i) current data and estimates regarding the current \n     numbers, types, yields, and locations of Russia's \n     nonstrategic nuclear weapons;\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\n       (ii) an assessment of the extent of the current threat of \n     theft, sale, or unauthorized use of such warheads;\n       (iii) a plan to work with the Russian Federation to \n     increase transparency, exchange data, increase warhead \n     security, and facilitate weapon dismantlement; and,\n       (iv) an assessment of the strategic implications of the \n     Russian Federation's non-strategic arsenal.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.
