Mr. President, we will have a period for morning business \ntoday. Following that, the Senate will turn to the consideration of any \nlegislative or Executive Calendar items cleared for action. We are \nhopeful that some bills can be cleared by unanimous consent. I believe \nthat last night we were able to move around some 20 nominations, plus \nmilitary nominations, plus at least two or three bills. The Work Force \nDevelopment Conference Report was one of those. I am glad we were able \nto move it quickly by unanimous consent. It is almost a shame to do it \njust in wrap-up because that is such a monumental achievement. We have \nbeen working on that legislation now for at least 3 years. We have had \ndifficulty getting it through each body and through conference. But I \nbelieve the conferees did a fine job.\n  I commend Senators Jeffords, DeWine, and all the Senators on both \nsides of the aisle that were involved in that. That consolidation of \njobs training programs will allow us to get better use of the money we \nhave, and a better program for workplace development is an important \ncog in our effort to improve our overall education opportunities, which \nshould include job training.\n  As we continue to move toward more and more people going off of \nwelfare and into meaningful jobs, it means we have to continue to work \nand improve elementary and secondary education, higher education, as \nwell as vocational education and job training. I believe that \nconference report will do that. I wanted to point out once again this \nmorning what did occur last night. We will continue to try to move \nother agreed-to bills and conference reports of that nature. We do \nexpect that we will move a number of nominations throughout the day. We \nmay even have to wait a little while to get those agreements worked out \nor to see if there are others that may be coming out that could be \ncleared today.\n  When the Senate returns from the August break, there will be two \nback-to-back rollcall votes at a time to be determined by the two \nleaders. Obviously, as we announced last night, there will be no \nrecorded votes today. I know all the Senators already knew that, but I \njust wanted to confirm it\n\n[[Page S9522]]\n\nagain. As it stands now, we will have two votes when we return, either \non August 31, or the 1st of September. The first one will be on the \nadoption of the Texas low-level waste conference report. There will be \n4 hours of debate on that, equally divided, and then a vote. Then we \nwill have a vote on the conference report to accompany the military \nconstruction appropriations bill, which will be broadly supported, \nprobably 99-0 or 100-0. As is usually the case, if we don't vote on an \nappropriations bill when it goes through the Senate the first time, we \ndo usually want to have a vote on the final conference report.\n  Again, I thank all our colleagues for their cooperation over the last \ncouple of weeks. I think we made some really good progress. We have \ncleared eight appropriations bills, and the ninth, Treasury-Postal \nService is probably within 30 minutes or an hour of completion. I hope \nwe will be able to do that the first week we are back.\n  We do expect to take up other appropriations bills when we return. I \ndon't know the exact order now, but we have the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, the Interior appropriations bill, the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill, and the Labor-HHS, Education \nappropriations bill. We expect, also, to take up the bankruptcy \nlegislation that came out of the Judiciary Committee. And we do have \nthe trade package from the Finance Committee. I will need to talk with \nall interested Senators about exactly when and how to schedule that.\n  I wish all my colleagues a very restful and productive August break. \nWe will look forward to seeing our colleagues then.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9521-7", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 2393\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I want to talk this morning about something \ncalled the Rumsfeld Report.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the Rumsfeld Commission \nReport in the news media here in Washington. But around the country I \nhave noted there is less coverage of it.\n  I want to talk a little bit about it today, because I think that the \nRumsfeld Commission Report issued to the Congress about 2 weeks ago is \nprobably the most important report that this Congress has received and \nthat it is one of the most important events of the last 2 years with \nrespect to the obligations of the Congress and the administration to \nensure the national security of the United States. Of course, when all \nis said and done, our first responsibility is to the defense of the \nAmerican people.\n  By way of background, in the 1996 defense authorization bill we \nensured that there was an amendment that required the establishment of \nthe National Missile System by the year 2003.\n  During the debate on that amendment, however--this was on December 1, \n1995--Senators Carl Levin and Dale Bumpers received a letter from \nJoanne Isham of the CIA's Congressional Relations Office. That letter \nclaimed that the language in the DOD bill relating to the threat posed \nby ballistic missiles--I am quoting now--``. . . [overstates] what we \ncurrently believe to be the future threat'' of missile attack on the \nUnited States.''\n  This is a letter from the CIA directly to Members of the Senate in \nopposition to an amendment that is pending on the floor.\n  The letter also said, again quoting, it was ``extremely unlikely'' \nthat nations would sell ICBMs and that the United States would be able \nto detect a home-grown ICBM program ``many years in advance,'' again \nquoting the letter.\n  The statements in that CIA letter were based entirely on a new \nNational Intelligence Estimate--an NIE. The title is ``NIE 95-19.'' It \nwas entitled ``Emerging Missile Threat to North America During the Next \n15 Years.'' It was released in its classified form in November 1995.\n  But the key judgment of that NIE is, quoting: ``. . .[no] country, \nother than the major declared nuclear powers, will develop or otherwise \nacquire a ballistic missile in the next 15 years that will threaten the \ncontiguous 48 States or Canada.''\n  President Clinton vetoed H.R. 1530, the defense authorization bill \nfor fiscal year 1996, on December 28, 1995, in part because the \nNational Missile Defense System called for pursuant to our amendment, \nin his words, addresses ``. . . [a] long-range threat that our \nIntelligence Community does not foresee in the coming decade.''--end of \nquote of the President.\n  In reaction, Mr. President, many Members of the Congress rejected the \nconclusions of that NIE as incorrect. Some of us on the Intelligence \nCommittee believed that the information that we possessed suggested \nthat the conclusions were inaccurate. Our concerns, frankly, centered \non flawed assumptions underlying the key judgment of the NIE. The \nunclassified assumptions are--there are several. Let me tell you what \nthey are:\n  First, concentrating on indigenous development of ICBMs adequately \naddresses the foreign missile threat to the United States.\n  What that means is, we can focus just on what these countries are \nable to build all by themselves and that that is going to be adequate \nin telling us what the threat posed by these countries will be in the \nfuture.\n  Second, foreign assistance will not enable countries to significantly \naccelerate ICBM development.\n  In other words, we are not going to look at what other countries \nmight sell or give to these powers that we are concerned about, again \nrelying on the notion that whatever they do they are going to do all by \nthemselves without any help from the outside.\n  In other words, third, that no country will sell ICBMs to a country \nof concern.\n  Fourth, that no countries, other than the declared nuclear powers \nwith the requisite technical ability or economic resources, will \ndevelop ICBMs from a space launch vehicle.\n  In other words, they are not going to use the rockets that are used \nto launch satellites for military purposes to convert those missiles or \nrockets for military purposes.\n  Another assumption: A flight test program of 5 years is essential to \nthe development of an ICBM.\n  Of course, when the United States and the old Soviet Union did \nresearch on a new missile, it would take 5 years for us to test it to \nmake sure it worked properly, because it was always a new concept.\n\n[[Page S9523]]\n\n  So the CIA assumed in this NIE that it would take 5 years to develop \na new missile.\n  Seventh, that development of short- and medium-range missiles will \nnot enable countries to significantly accelerate ICBM development.\n  In other words, when they develop a shorter-range missile, that will \nhave nothing whatsoever to do with their capability to develop more \nrobust systems.\n  Finally, the possibility of an unauthorized or accidental launch from \nexisting nuclear arsenals has not changed significantly over the last \ndecade.\n  In my view, and in the view of many, these underlying assumptions \nignored plain facts: Foreign assistance is increasingly commonplace and \nwill accelerate indigenous missile programs. Other countries have sold, \nand almost certainly will continue to sell, weapons of mass destruction \nwith ballistic missile components. The MTCR, which is the regime that \nis supposed to prevent this proliferation of weapons, has already been \nviolated and is no doubt going to be violated again. And, finally, a \nflight test program does not have to follow the model of the United \nStates or Soviet flight test program.\n  So the conclusion that flowed from the faulty assumptions of the CIA \nNational Intelligence Estimate had the effect of allowing unwarranted \npolitical conclusions to be reached and preached.\n  Let me reiterate that.\n  Because of the CIA's letter to Senators at the time that we were \ndebating the national missile defense amendment, policy was affected. \nThe President vetoed that bill based in part on the conclusions of the \nCIA's National Intelligence Estimate, which was based upon flawed \nassumptions, which turned out to be inaccurate.\n  There were several reactions as a result of the President's action.\n  The General Accounting Office and two former CDIs--Directors of \nCentral Intelligence--Jim Woolsey and Bob Gates, each offered opinions \nabout the NIE 95-19.\n  The GAO prepared a report in September of 1996, and it concluded that \nthe level of certainty regarding the 15-year threat which was stated in \nthe NIE was, quoting, ``overstated.''\n  Former Director of the CIA Jim Woolsey validated this GAO assessment \nduring a September 24, 1996, Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing. In his formal statement, Mr. Woolsey suggested the 1995 NIE \nasked the wrong question.\n  He said the following:\n\n       If you are assessing indigenous capabilities with the \n     currently-hostile countries to develop ICBMs of standard \n     design that can hit the lower 48 states, the NIE's answer \n     that we may have 15 years of comfort may well be a plausible \n     answer. But each of these qualifications is an important \n     caveat and severely restricts one's ability to generalize \n     legitimately, or to make national policy, based on such a \n     limited document.\n\n  Among the things that former DCI Bob Gates said about the NIE was \nthat it was ``politically naive.''\n  Despite these concerns, the administration and opponents of missile \ndefense were unwilling to hear views contrary to the conclusions of the \nNIE. Frankly, this is still the case. In May, when the Senate attempted \nto invoke cloture on the American Missile Protection Act, Senate bill \n1873, offered by Senators Cochran and Inouye, the administration based \nits opposition to the bill on that previous NIE, National Intelligence \nEstimate 95-19.\n  Here is the quotation from the administration's opposition:\n\n       The bill seeks to make it U.S. policy ``to deploy as soon \n     as technologically possible an effective National Missile \n     Defense system capable of defending the territory of the \n     United States against limited ballistic missile attack \n     (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).''\n\n  That is true.\n  In her letter stating the administration's position in opposition to \nSenate bill 1873, the Defense Department's general counsel stated, and \nI quote:\n\n       The Intelligence Community has concluded that a long-range \n     ballistic missile threat to the United States from a rogue \n     nation, other than perhaps North Korea, is unlikely to emerge \n     before 2010... Additionally, the Intelligence Community \n     concluded that the only rogue nation missile in development \n     that could strike the United States is the North Korean Taepo \n     Dong 2, which could strike portions of Alaska or the far-\n     western Hawaiian Islands.\n\n  That is the end of the quotation from the Department of Defense \ngeneral counsel.\n  So the administration was still basing its opposition to missile \ndefense on this National Intelligence Estimate of 1995.\n  In the wake of the debate over that poorly crafted report, Congress \nasked for a second opinion. It appointed a bipartisan commission of \nformer senior government officials and members of academia led by \nformer Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, hence the name ``The Rumsfeld \nCommission Report.''\n  This bipartisan Commission was asked to examine the current and \npotential missile threat to all 50 States and to assess the capability \nof the U.S. intelligence community to warn policymakers of changes in \nthis threat.\n  The Commission unanimously concluded three things: No. 1, the missile \nthreat to the United States is real and growing; No. 2, the threat is \ngreater than previously assessed; and, No. 3, we may have little or no \nwarning of new threats.\n  Let me go back and review each of those.\n\n       1. The missile threat to the United States is real and \n     growing.\n       ``Concerted efforts by a number of overtly or potential \n     hostile nations to acquire ballistic missiles with biological \n     or nuclear payloads pose a growing threat to the United \n     States, its deployed forces, its friends and allies. These \n     newer, developing threats in North Korea, Iran and Iraq are \n     in addition to those still posed by the existing missile \n     arsenals of Russia and China, nations with which we are not \n     now in conflict but which remain in uncertain transitions.''\n       2. The threat is greater than previously assessed.\n       ``The threat to the United States posed by these emerging \n     capabilities is broader, more mature and evolving more \n     rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by \n     the Intelligence Community,'' and a rogue nation could \n     acquire the capability to strike the United States with a \n     ballistic missile in as little as five years.\n       3. We may have little or no warning of new threats.\n       ``The Intelligence Community's ability to provide timely \n     and accurate assessments of ballistic missile threats to the \n     United States is eroding.''\n       ``The warning times the United States can expect of new, \n     threatening ballistic missile deployments are being \n     reduced,'' and under some plausible scenarios, ``the United \n     States might well have little or no warning before \n     operational deployment [of a long-range missile.]''\n\n  Now, Mr. President, why are the Rumsfeld Commission conclusions so \ndifferent?\n  First of all, the Commission answered a slightly different question \nthan our intelligence agencies did in the 1995 NIE, by examining the \nmissile threat to all 50 States. The intelligence community has \nacknowledged that Alaska and Hawaii could be threatened much sooner \nthan 15 years from now, but for some reason did not include that in its \n1995 estimate.\n  Second, the Commission has access to the entire amount of information \nin the intelligence community--frankly, a broader and more highly \nclassified set of information than most of the analysts in the \ncompartmentalized intelligence world. Obviously, much information is \ncompartmentalized to prevent its unauthorized distribution and release, \nbut that also inhibits to some extent the ability of analysts to \nappreciate all aspects of the potential threat.\n  Third, the Rumsfeld Commission recognized that missile development \nprograms in Third World countries no longer follow the patterns of \nUnited States and Soviet programs. They might, for example, succeed in \ntesting a missile one time, conclude that they have got it right \nbecause, after all, they are using a weapon that has been sold to them \nessentially by another country and then deploy it based upon one test, \nwhereas the United States and the Soviet Union, as I said before, might \nwell have had to engage in years of testing to ensure that a new \nproduct would work.\n  Fourth, the Commission also understood that foreign assistance and \ntechnology transfers are increasingly commonplace. Without getting into \nthe classified information in the Rumsfeld report, it is very clear \nthat countries with which we are concerned have acquired a great deal \nof technology and in some cases components and perhaps even whole \nmissile systems from other countries eager to earn the cash from the \nsale of those components or that\n\n[[Page S9524]]\n\nequipment or technology. And so these nations did not have to do what \nthe intelligence community thought they had to do, and that was to \ndevelop it indigenously, from the ground up, with only what the nation \ncould produce. They have been very successful in acquiring technology \nfrom other countries which has naturally shortened the lead time for \nthem to develop and deploy their own systems.\n  Finally, and very importantly, the Rumsfeld Commission realized that \nforeign nations are aggressively pursuing denial and deception \nprograms, thus reducing our insight into the status of their missile \nprograms. In effect, what the Rumsfeld Commission concluded is this: \nThat while the CIA in its estimate provided to us based its \nconclusions, in effect, on only what it could prove it knew, which, of \ncourse, is very little in the intelligence world, the Rumsfeld \nCommission examined what we knew and then asked questions about what \nthe implications were about what we knew.\n  Would it be possible, even though we have no evidence that a country \nhas done certain things, that it could do so as a result of what we \nknew? And if our assumptions with respect to its intentions are \ncorrect, would it not be plausible to assume that they would try to do \nthat; and if they tried to do it, might they succeed?\n  So questions like that were asked in ways that were not based upon \nhard evidence in all cases but plausibilities and possibilities, and, \nas a result of asking those questions, some very troubling conclusions \nwere reached which in many cases were verified by certain confirming \nevidence. And that is why we now understand that the nations with which \nwe are most concerned have much more robust systems, both with respect \nto the missiles for delivery of weapons and the weapons on top of the \nmissiles, than we had ever thought before.\n  Second, these programs can be deployed with little or no warning. And \nthird, and probably the key lesson to come out of this, we have to \nappreciate the fact that we will be surprised by surprises, but we \nshould not be. We should not be surprised by surprises, because most of \nwhat these countries are doing we don't know, and we won't know until \nthe weapon is used or it is finally tested and we realize that they \nhave developed it or we find information in some other way that \nconfirms a program that we previously did not know existed.\n  So instead of being surprised at surprises, the Rumsfeld Commission \nreport says we need to get into a new mode of thinking to understand \nthat we should not be surprised by surprises, and that we should base \nour policy on that understanding.\n  That is my concluding point, Mr. President. The Congress and the \nPresident, in setting national policy, in developing our missile \ndefenses, in appropriating the funds to support those programs, should \napproach this with the understanding that we will have little or no \nadvanced warning, that there is much that we don't know but that we are \nlikely to be facing threats. Therefore, my conclusion is we have got to \nget on with the development of our missile defenses. That represents my \nthree concluding points. No. 1, we have got to get on with the job of \ndeveloping and deploying both theater missile defenses and a National \nMissile Defense System, and we can begin by voting for cloture and for \nthe Cochran-Inouye bill when we return from the recess.\n  Second, we must improve our intelligence capabilities and resources.\n  And third, we must avoid arms control measures and diplomatic actions \nthat impede our ability to defend ourselves and damage our intelligence \nsources and methods.\n  We have a lot of work to do. Those of us on the Intelligence \nCommittee have committed ourselves, based upon the briefing of the \nRumsfeld report, to begin working on the intelligence aspects of this \nproblem, and those who are on the Armed Services Committee and the \nAppropriations Committees will also have to work toward correction of \nthe problems of the past to assure that our missile defense programs \ncan proceed with the speed that is required to meet these emerging \nthreats.\n  I conclude by thanking the members of this bipartisan Rumsfeld \nCommission and suggest to all of my colleagues that they become \nfamiliar with the contents of its report because it should certainly \nguide us in our policy deliberations with respect to the security of \nthe United States from a missile threat in future years.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to take a couple of minutes to \ntalk about global warming and about where we are in the process of \ngetting information from the administration about the Kyoto Treaty.\n  Last year, when we were doing appropriations, the Senate unanimously \nadopted an amendment to the Foreign Operations spending bill. That \namendment directed the White House to describe exactly the amounts and \nlocations of all its planned expenditures for domestic and \ninternational climate change activities for 1997, 1998, and thereafter. \nThe President signed that bill.\n  What I hoped to get was a list, by agency, with their expected costs \nand objectives. I thought the Office of Management and Budget would be \nable to easily locate the pots of money involved in something as \ncritical to the administration as global warming. But the President's \nresponse was a 2-page letter describing the Climate Change Technology \nInitiative and the Global Change Research Program. I have gotten more \ninformation out of any issue of the newspaper. No numbers were included \nin the global change research section. No numbers were included showing \nthe money the Department of State has spent negotiating climate change \nor supporting the U.N.'s scientific bodies. No numbers were included \ntelling us how much ``indirect programs'' would cost.\n  The administration's letter was an unacceptable response to our \nrequest, and it took a year to get it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                                   March 10, 1998.\n     To the Congress of the United States:\n       In accordance with section 580 of the Foreign Operations, \n     Export Financing, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1998, I herewith provide an account of all Federal agency \n     climate change programs and activities.\n       These activities include both domestic and international \n     programs and activities directly related to climate change.\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n       In response to Section 580 of Public Law 105-118, ``Foreign \n     Operations, Export Financing, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act of FY 1998,'' the following is a summary \n     of Federal agency programs most directly related to global \n     climate change.\n\n\n                           domestic programs\n\n       The Climate Change Technology Initiative is a five-year \n     research and technology program to reduce the Nation's \n     emissions of greenhouse gases. Led by the Energy Department \n     (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the \n     initiative also includes activities of the National Institute \n     of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Departments of \n     Agriculture (USDA) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD). \n     The initiative includes a combined $2.7 billion increase over \n     five years for these agencies for research and development on \n     energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon-reduction \n     technologies. The initiative also includes $3.6 billion in \n     tax incentives over five years to stimulate the adoption of \n     more efficient technologies in buildings, industrial \n     processes, vehicles, and power generation.\n       The Global Change Research Program, led by the National \n     Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, builds understanding of climate change and \n     variability, atmospheric chemistry, and ecosystems. The \n     scientific results from the program help in the development \n     of climate change policies, and the development of new \n     observing systems will enable better monitoring of future \n     climate changes and their impacts. For example, the Tropical \n     Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite launched during 1997 \n     will provide previously unavailable, detailed, and accurate \n     rainfall measurements, filling a significant gap in our \n     understanding of the Earth system. In 1998 and 1999, the \n     program will launch more satellites and increase its focus on \n     investigating regional climate changes and assessing the \n     vulnerability of the U.S. to climate variability and change.\n       A more complete description of these programs can be found \n     in Chapter 6 (``Promoting Research'') of the President's FY \n     1999 Budget.\n\n\n                         international programs\n\n       Last June, the President announced a $1 billion, five-year \n     commitment to address climate change in developing countries. \n     This\n\n[[Page S9525]]\n\n     initiative includes at least $750 million ($150 million per \n     year) for the U.S. Agency for International Development \n     (USAID) to support climate change-related activities in \n     developing countries, particularly programs in energy \n     efficiency, forestry, and agriculture. USAID will also use up \n     to $250 million of its new credit authority to provide \n     partial loan guarantees for projects in developing countries \n     that address climate change.\n       The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is the world's \n     leading institution for protecting the global environment and \n     avoiding economic disruption from climate change, extinction \n     of valuable species, and collapse of the oceans' fish \n     population. The $300 million proposed for 1999 includes $193 \n     million for U.S. contributions previously due and $107 \n     million for the initial contribution to the GEF's second \n     four-year replenishment (1999 to 2002). Approximately 38 \n     percent of the total U.S. annual contribution to the GEF \n     supports climate change-related projects in developing \n     countries.\n       The State Department supports the work of the UN framework \n     Convention on Climate Change Secretariat and the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)--the single, \n     most authoritative, international scientific and technical \n     assessment body with respect to climate change. Many nations \n     rely on the IPCC for information and assessment advice on \n     climate change.\n\n\n                      indirectly related programs\n\n       Several Federal agencies conduct programs that are \n     indirectly related to global climate change. For example, the \n     Department of Defense conducts research to improve energy \n     efficiency of military aircraft as a means of improving \n     defense capability. The Department of Transportation conducts \n     research that can lead to improved vehicular traffic flow and \n     reduced fuel consumption. By promoting energy efficiency, \n     these programs can also help reduce the Nation's emissions of \n     greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, since the primary focus of \n     these programs is not on climate change, the Administration \n     does not consider them to be ``climate change programs and \n     activities,'' as stipulated in Section 580 of the Foreign \n     Operations bill.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Since that time, other Members of Congress have been trying \ndiligently to track down these budget numbers. I have tried to get \nquestions answered. I have followed up on administration statements. It \nhas not been easy. The House Government Reform Committee has been \nforced to issue three subpoenas and has threatened a fourth. In \nresponse to those, the administration has made some documents \navailable, but some are still waiting for White House Counsel approval.\n  I, too, have encountered obstacles in trying to see those cost \nnumbers. Earlier this year, Janet Yellen, Chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, testified twice in the House that Kyoto would cost \nAmerican families only $90 per year--only $90 per year. Estimates from \nindependent economic consulting firms, however, show vastly different \nnumbers. These estimates put costs as high as $2,100 per household per \nyear. Most people that I know think that $90 a year would be a lot of \nadditional tax; $2,100 would be unconscionable. That is a $2,000 \ndifference per year on what it will cost to solve the problem the \nadministration says we have.\n  The obvious question is, Why are they so far apart? Why are the White \nHouse numbers so low? The Department of Energy places the cost of \nreducing 1 ton of carbon emissions at $130 to $150, to cut to 1990 \nlevels. The White House uses $171 per ton, to go 7 percent below 1990. \nIf you add it up, the cost is over $100 billion per year, not adjusted \nfor inflation. Factor in inflation and divide by households. The fact \nis, that $90 per family is not realistic.\n  When Ms. Yellen was asked how they came up with the $90, her answer \nwas that the assumptions and models were a national security secret.\n  I asked for a copy of those documents. I was told that they were a \nnational security secret. I pointed out that when you get elected to \nthis body, you get a top secret clearance. You are supposed to be able \nto view all documents necessary to your work. I offered that, if they \nwere so busy that they couldn't deliver those numbers to the Capitol, \nthat I would be happy to go down to the White House and look at those \nnumbers. After some weeks, they did say they might send a few numbers \nup.\n  I asked the Counsel of Economic Advisers nominee, Rebecca Blank, if \nshe could get me a copy. I held up the nomination until they could \nproduce them. I got a series of runs and explanations, but certain \ncritical parts were missing. In fact, what I got is a table of contents \nwith formulas, and no explanation.\n  I was also curious to know what part of these documents had been so \nsecret. They were delivered by an intern from the White House to my \noffice, not given to me personally, not stamped ``confidential.'' There \nwas no stamp on them whatsoever to designate how important these were \nto national security. So I had to suspect that I had not gotten the \ndocuments that we had been talking about.\n  I asked about it. I got an interesting response. I would like to \nshare part of that with my colleagues.\n\n       The White House Counsel's Office is concerned that public \n     disclosure of these materials would set an unfortunate \n     precedent that could chill the free flow of internal \n     discussions essential to effective decision making. Counsel \n     believes that such disclosure is not necessary for purposes \n     of Congressional oversight.\n\n  In other words, we don't deserve the information. We should not be a \npart of that. We don't need to know. And letting us know would damage \nthe Executive's ability to make decisions.\n  We are the policy body of the United States. Only with FDR did the \nPresident start traveling all over the country, and all over the world, \ntrying to set legislation. That has gone on, on an ever-increasing \nbasis, since that time. It is our job to pass the laws. The laws set \nthe policy. The White House is the management branch of this \nGovernment. And they say that our information would interfere in their \ndecisionmaking, it would have a chilling effect.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter from the Executive \nOffice of the President be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic \n           Advisers,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Enzi: I understand that you would like me to \n     elaborate on the views I expressed during my testimony before \n     Congress regarding public disclosure of the documents that \n     were relied on in preparation of my testimony on the economic \n     implications of the Kyoto Protocol. It is also my \n     understanding that you are specifically interested in the \n     reasons why public disclosure of these documents would not be \n     useful to U.S. interests in ongoing international \n     negotiations.\n       The economic materials relied on in the preparation of my \n     testimony reflect internal deliberations of the Executive \n     Branch, and in particular, of the President's economic \n     advisers. Nonetheless, we provided these documents to you and \n     several House Committees, expressly on the basis that they \n     not be made public. We did so in an effort to accommodate the \n     legitimate oversight needs of Congress while preserving the \n     President's interest in the confidentiality of Executive \n     Branch deliberations. The White House Counsel's Office is \n     concerned that public disclosure of these materials would set \n     an unfortunate precedent that could chill the free flow of \n     internal discussions essential to effective Executive \n     decision making. Counsel believes that such disclosure is not \n     necessary for purposes of Congressional oversight.\n       In addition, disclosure of some of these documents would \n     not be helpful to the position of the United States in \n     ongoing international negotiations. The documents reveal \n     Administration assessments of the costs of options that are \n     the topic of ongoing negotiations in international fora. We \n     prefer that other countries participating in those \n     negotiations not have access to such materials.\n       I appreciate your consideration of our views on this \n     matter. Please let me know if you have any other questions or \n     need additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Janet L. Yellen.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I do disagree with that. I think the public does have a \nright to know. What is the point in hiding the information? What is the \nWhite House afraid that people might find out? I have a hunch it is all \nabout jobs. The study conducted by DRI-McGraw-Hill estimated Kyoto \ncould cost us 1.5 million jobs. Charles River Associates puts that \nfigure as high as 3.1 million jobs by 2010.\n  Even the Argonne National Laboratory pointed to job losses in a study \non the impact of higher energy prices on energy-intensive industries. \nArgonne concluded that 200,000 American chemical workers could lose \ntheir jobs. All of the American aluminum plants could close, putting \nanother 20,000 workers out of work. Cement companies would move another \n6,000 jobs overseas. And nearly 100,000 United States steelworkers \nwould be out of work.\n  Americans have a right to know what is going on. They have a right to \nknow if it is going to cost them their job.\n\n[[Page S9526]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for a few additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, even if the Office of White House Counsel \ndoesn't think so, they should have a chance to see who is playing with \ntheir livelihoods.\n  In spite of the White House position, the Secretary of Interior had \nthe nerve to call energy companies ``un-American in their attempts to \nmislead the American public.'' Remember, they are the only ones \ndisclosing figures. They are the only ones from whom you can get the \nmodel, all of the math, and an explanation. They are the ones sharing \ndata.\n  The Secretary of Interior had the nerve to call them ``un-American in \ntheir attempts to mislead the American people.'' He further asserted \nthat they were engaged in ``a conspiracy to distort the facts.'' They \nare the only ones sharing facts.\n  I will repeat that. They were called ``un-American in their attempts \nto mislead the American people.'' There are a lot of people working in \ncoal and oil fields in my State, over 20,000 of them. Mr. President, \n20,000 people is 6 percent of all the people working in Wyoming. More \nimportant, it is over 10 percent of the private sector employees.\n  These are the people who work for energy companies. These are the \npeople Mr. Babbitt claims are ``un-American.'' I think they are worried \nabout their jobs. They are worried about laying off their employees. \nThey are worried about their own families and all the other families \nwho survive in our towns because of energy production. As an industry, \nthese people are worried about a treaty that can force them to lay off \nover a million Americans. It could force industry to lay off half of \ntheir employees in Wyoming.\n  On the other hand, the Executive Office of the President finds that, \n``public disclosure would set an unfortunate precedent'' and that it \n``is not necessary for purposes of Congressional oversight.'' I ask \njust who is misleading the American people?\n  There is something else I want to bring to the attention of this \nbody. In spite of the fact that the President has firmly stated that \nthis treaty will not be implemented before ratification, right now the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has undertaken an effort to manipulate \nthe Clean Air Act to enact it. I think we deserve to know what other \nbranches of Government are currently working behind the scenes, behind \nour back, to make changes through Executive orders or rules and \nregulations that put a treaty into place that this body would not \nratify. If it were brought here today, it would not be ratified. It \nviolates everything in the resolution that we adopted, sending signals \nto the people who went to Kyoto to negotiate on behalf of the United \nStates.\n\n  There has been no public input. I think the administration does not \nwant public input on climate change. I know they don't want to look at \nthe science, but I think they also don't want public input. If they \nwanted input, this letter from the Executive Office wouldn't say what \nit does. If the White House wanted the public to know all the details \nabout the treaty, they would send it to the Senate and America, and \nthey would let us debate it. They would tell the American people what \nthey are planning to do.\n  My only experience in the executive branch was as mayor of a boom \ntown. But I can tell you, when I was trying to pass the smallest bond \nissue or when I was working on negotiations on industrial siting, \nfiguring out what the companies that were coming to our counties would \nhave to do to participate in the growth of our town so we could have \norderly growth, if I would not have shared on a regular basis more \ninformation, more detail, more explanation for those little things than \nwhat the President is doing with us on this big thing, I would not have \nbeen able to do any of them, and I should not have been able to do any \nof them.\n  It is the duty of the executive branch to inform the people who make \nthe decisions legislatively, to provide them with all of the \ninformation that can possibly be provided and not just to send out a \ngroup of numbers with no explanation, a bunch of abbreviations with no \nexplanation. We don't need a table of contents. We don't need a bunch \nof math. We need answers. We need to know the formulas, and we need to \nbe able to have people who understand those numbers take a look at \nthem.\n  This is not national security. This is a need for the American public \nto know, and the American public in this case probably ought to start \nwith the U.S. Senate. We do have the kind of authority that we should \nbe able to get the numbers, and if the President wants cooperation from \nus, he will provide those numbers. We can take them the way he wants. \nWe can take them in secret, but I hope they will share them with us and \nwith the American public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9524-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9526-S9527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SACAJAWEA ON THE DOLLAR COIN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the selection of an image of Sacajawea for the new one dollar coin. \nThe Dollar Coin Design Advisory Committee recently recommended to the \nTreasury Secretary that the new dollar coin bear a design inspired by \nSacajawea. On July 29th, the Treasury Secretary announced that he was \naccepting the Committee's recommendation. I am pleased that the \ncommittee and the Treasury Secretary have recognized the important role \nof Sacajawea in the history of our Nation.\n  I do believe that it is important, however, that the coin explicitly \nhonor and bear a likeness of Sacajawea. The actual language of the \ncommittee's recommendation is that the coin should bear a design of \n``Liberty represented by a Native American woman, inspired by Sacajawea \nand other Native American women.'' This language is a bit vague, but it \ndoes make it clear that Sacajawea is their symbolic choice. I strongly \nurge the Treasury Secretary to approve a final design that is based on \na historically accepted image of Sacajawea. There are several images \nthat could be used, and I will be happy to share them with the \nSecretary.\n  Mr. President, I am distressed to learn that a bill has been \nintroduced in Congress that would overturn the recommendation and \nsubsequent acceptance of the depiction of Sacajawea on the new one \ndollar coin. As we know, Congress specifically refrained from mandating \na design for the coin when we passed the authorizing legislation. This \nwas to ensure that political pressures would not affect the decision-\nmaking process. Instead, the Treasury Secretary appointed the Dollar \nCoin Design Advisory Committee, which was specifically charged with \ncoming up with a design for the coin, subject to some general \nguidelines from the Secretary. The selection process of the advisory \ncommittee emphasized citizen participation. After a thorough and open \ndebate, the committee voted 6-1 to recommend Sacajawea for the dollar \ncoin. Unfortunately, that whole process could be undermined by the bill \nthat has been introduced. We are beyond debating the merits of \nSacajawea or the Statue of Liberty. Arguments against her image \nobviously were not persuasive. I see no reason for Congress to attempt \nto impose its will and reverse a decision that was made by an unbiased \npanel based on extensive input from the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, I sent a letter to the Treasury Secretary earlier this \nmonth requesting that he accept the committee's recommendation of \nSacajawea for the new one dollar coin. In that letter, I outlined some \nof the reasons that I think she would be a great choice for the coin. I \nwould like to briefly discuss these reasons right now.\n  As most Americans know, Sacajawea was an integral part of the Lewis \nand Clark expedition, the story of which is an incredible tale of \nadventure, determination, cooperation, and persistence. When Lewis and \nClark set out for the West, they had no idea what they might find in \nthe coming months or how long they would be gone. Anyone who has \ntraveled through the West has to be in awe of what the Lewis and Clark \nexpedition was able to accomplish. It is remarkable that Sacajawea was \njust a teenager with an infant when she endured the rigors of this trip \ninto uncharted territory.\n  The importance of Sacajawea to the Lewis and Clark expedition can not \nbe understated. Her knowledge of the land and its resources helped the \nexpedition survive the rugged terrain of the West.\n\n[[Page S9527]]\n\nHer diplomatic and translation skills helped Lewis and Clark establish \npeaceful relations with the American Indians they met along the way, \nwhose assistance was also vital to the expedition. Her bravery saved \nthe expedition's valuable supplies, including the journals that would \nbe used to record the trip, after a boat nearly capsized. Lewis and \nClark's appreciation of her skills and resourcefulness led them to \ngrant her a vote on the operation of the expedition that was equal to \nthe other members of the group. In a very real sense, this is the first \nrecorded instance of a woman being allowed to vote in America. I am \nproud to note that Wyoming, which typifies the landscape of their \njourney, also recognized the important role of women in overcoming the \nchallenges of the West and was the first state to grant women the right \nto vote.\n  I believe that the selection of Sacajawea to be represented on the \ndollar coin would not only celebrate her valuable contribution to the \nLewis and Clark expedition, it would also celebrate the contributions \nof all American Indians during the expedition. In addition, it would \nhonor all the American Indians of our nation; it would celebrate the \ngreatest terrestrial exploration ever undertaken in U.S. history; and, \nit would commemorate the turning of our country's hearts and minds from \nEurope and the East--to the West and our future.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Treasury Department to continue the process \nof selecting an image of Sacajawea for the dollar coin. I also urge the \nTreasury Department to specifically designate and honor Sacajawea as \nthe person on the coin. And finally I encourage my colleagues to oppose \nany measure that would undermine the placement of Sacajawea on the \ndollar coin.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for the \nnext 20 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I believe that the President of the United States has \nvery broad discretion to nominate whomever he chooses, and I believe \nthe U.S. Senate should give him due deference when he sends us his \nchoice for a Federal judgeship.\n  Having said that, however, I believe the Senate has a constitutional \nduty, and it is prescribed in the Constitution, to offer its advice and \nconsent on judicial nominations. Each Senator has his or her own \ncriteria for offering this advice and consent. However, since these \nnominations are lifetime appointments, all of us must take our advice \nand consent responsibility very seriously, and rightfully so.\n  Earlier this year, when the Senate Judiciary Committee considered the \nnomination of another nominee to be a judge for the ninth circuit, in \nthis case William Fletcher, I expressed my concerns about how far the \nninth circuit has moved away from the mainstream of judicial thought \nand how far it consistently--consistently--strays from Supreme Court \nprecedent.\n  At that time, considering that nomination to the ninth circuit, I \nalso stated that when the Judiciary Committee considers nominees for \nthe ninth circuit, I feel compelled to apply a higher standard of \nscrutiny than I do with regard to other circuits.\n  I have come to this conclusion after an examination of the recent \ntrend of decisions that have been coming out of this ninth circuit. \nSimply put, I am concerned that the ninth circuit does not follow \nSupreme Court precedent, and its rulings are simply not in the \nmainstream. The statistics tell the sad story.\n  In 1997, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed 27 out of 28 \nninth circuit decisions that were appealed and granted cert. That is a \n96-percent reversal rate.\n  In 1996, 10 of 12 decisions for that same circuit were reversed, or \n83 percent. If you go back to 1995, 14 of 17 decisions were reversed, \nor an 82-percent reversal rate.\n  In other words, what we are seeing from 1995 to the present is an \nescalating trend of judicial confrontation between the ninth circuit \nand the U.S. Supreme Court. Let's keep in mind that the Supreme Court \nonly has time to review a small number of ninth circuit decisions. This \nleaves the ninth circuit, in reality, as the court of last resort for \nthe 45 million Americans who reside within that circuit. In the vast, \nvast majority of cases, what the ninth circuit says is the final word.\n  To preserve the integrity of the judicial system for so many people, \nI believe we need to take a more careful look; I believe this Senate \nneeds to take a more careful work at who we are sending to a circuit \nthat increasingly chooses to disregard precedent and ultimately just \nplain gets it wrong so much of the time.\n  Consistent with our constitutional duties, the U.S. Senate has to \ntake responsibility for correcting this disturbing reversal rate of the \nninth circuit. That is why I will only support those nominees to the \nninth circuit who possess the qualifications and have shown in their \nbackground that they have the ability and the inclination to move the \ncircuit back towards that mainstream.\n  Mr. President, as the statistics reveal, the ninth circuit's reversal \nrate is an escalating problem. It is not getting better, it is getting \nworse. So today, this Senator is drawing the line. I am providing \nnotice to my colleagues that this is the last ninth circuit nominee \nthat I will allow to move by voice vote on this floor.\n  Further, until the ninth circuit starts to follow precedent and \nproduce mainstream decisions, I will continue to hold every ninth \ncircuit nominee to a higher standard to help ensure that the 45 million \npeople who live in the ninth circuit receive justice that is consistent \nwith the rest of the Nation, justice that is predictable, justice that \nis not arbitrary, nor dependent on the few times the Supreme Court \nactually reviews and ultimately reverses an erroneous ninth circuit \ndecision.\n  Mr. President, all this leads me back to this nominee for the ninth \ncircuit, the nominee that we will later today be considering, Judge Kim \nWardlaw. There is simply, in my opinion, no evidence that this nominee \nwill help to move the ninth circuit closer to the mainstream. And it is \nlargely for that reason that I rise today to oppose this nomination.\n  On November 9, 1995, the Judiciary Committee approved Kim Wardlaw's \nnomination to be U.S. district judge by unanimous consent. Further, the \nfull Senate did the same thing on December 22, 1995. Today, we are now \nconsidering her nomination for elevation to the ninth circuit.\n  Mr. President, during Judge Wardlaw's nomination hearing last June, I \nasked her to explain or describe the significant cases in which the \nWomen's Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the WLALA, filed amicus \nbriefs during the time Judge Wardlaw served as president of this \norganization from 1993 to 1994 and the role she played during that time \nin the selection of these cases. That was my question.\n  Judge Wardlaw responded that when she was president there was a \n``separate Amicus Briefs Committee that would take requests for writing \nbriefs.'' She described one case she remembered from that year in which \nthe WLALA filed an amicus brief. Our dialogue in the committee then \ncontinued as follows. I asked her to ``tell me again--you had this \ncommittee. Did you sit on the committee?'' She responded, ``No, I did \nnot.'' Then I asked her, ``Did the president sit on the committee?'' \nShe responded, ``No.''\n  In written followup questions that I sent to her, I stated--and I \nquote--``In further reviewing the questionnaire to the Judiciary \nCommittee, I noticed\n\n[[Page S9528]]\n\nthat you responded you were Amicus Briefs Committee chair (1997-98).'' \nI then rephrased the question I asked her at the hearing. In her \nwritten response, Judge Wardlaw apologized, ``if my response to your \nquestion at the hearing was narrower in any way than the scope of your \nintended question''--she then explained she thought my question and \n``ensuing colloquy'' only referred to the years 1993 and 1994 that she \nwas president of the Women's Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, and \nnot to the year she served as the Amicus Briefs cochair from September \n1977 to 1988.\n  Mr. President, I believe her written response was sincere. I do, \nhowever, think that she could have been more forthcoming in this \nresponse. I believe she could have been more forthcoming in her \nresponse during the hearing in order to clarify that she had, in fact, \nserved as one of the chairs of the Amicus Briefs Committee during \nanother point of her entire membership of the WLALA, which by the way, \nbegan in 1983.\n  Mr. President, further, in Judge Wardlaw's 1995 responses to the \nJudiciary Committee's questionnaire for her nomination to be U.S. \ndistrict court judge, she noted she was a member of the California \nLeadership Council for the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, \nCalifornia Leadership Council. However, she omitted this information \nfrom her 1998 questionnaire.\n  When recently asked orally to explain this omission, she noted that \nthe NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund's California Leadership \nCouncil ``was not an organization''--it ``was not an organization.'' So \nshe said that she should not have even noted her affiliation with the \norganization in her original district court nomination questionnaire.\n  Mr. President, I think, again, this, in my view at least, reflects a \nreluctance to be totally forthcoming with the committee. It is required \nof a nominee to include all information that is requested in the \ncommittee's questionnaire. And it is up to each committee member to \nweigh the importance, then, of the nominee's responses. Let me make it \nclear, Mr. President, people can make mistakes on questionnaires. I \nbelieve, however, the evidence shows--the totality of the evidence \nshows she has not been as forthcoming to this committee as, frankly, we \nshould expect.\n  This nominee has a 12-year affiliation--12-year affiliation--with the \nWomen's Lawyers Association of Los Angeles. She has not only been a \nmember, but has served as an officer. She has served as Amicus Briefs \nCommittee chair and as vice president. She was elected as president of \nthe organization, and served as chair of the Nominations Committee, \nwhich selects the officers of the organization.\n  During the time she served in a leadership capacity, this \norganization filed amicus briefs in the Supreme Court in cases such as \nWilliam Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the case of Rust v. \nSullivan, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.\n  I only cite these cases as further examples of her position as a \nleader of an organization that, in fact, took public stands on issues \nthat were contrary to what the Supreme Court ultimately decided. For \nme, this serves as evidence that Judge Wardlaw would not help move the \ncircuit more to the mainstream. This is not simply a matter of this \nnominee being a mere member of an organization that took these \npositions. Rather, this is a matter of her being a recognized leader of \nthis organization who states, however, that she was not aware of the \nlegal positions taken by this organization.\n  In response to Senator Thurmond's written questions, Judge Wardlaw \nstated that ``Once a position was voted upon . . . it was the position \nof the organization as a whole, not necessarily the view of any \nindividual member.'' That may be, Mr. President, but she did not offer \nto the Judiciary Committee any details on the role she may or may not \nhave played in the development of these positions.\n  Judge Wardlaw also stated that she ``would not have publicly opposed \na position taken by the organization.'' I believe anyone who \nvoluntarily holds numerous leadership positions in an organization--\nleadership positions ranging from president to secretary to chair of \nvarious committees--I believe that person adopts, helps shape, or at \nthe very least condones the positions taken by that organization.\n  After all, our committee asked all nominees if they belong to any \norganization that discriminates on the basis of race, sex or religion; \nand if so, we ask what the nominee has done to try to change these \npolicies. These are not exactly comparable, but the point simply is, \nwhen we ask the questions about membership, we asked it for a reason. \nIt does not mean we hold someone accountable for everything, every \nposition that a committee or organization took that they belong to. No. \nWe weigh the totality of the circumstances, and we try to be fair. But \nthe evidence is overwhelming of her leadership positions.\n  Frankly, quite candidly, this is not the first nominee who has come \nbefore our committee who has been involved with amicus briefs, who has \nbeen in an organization that files these briefs, who has held a \nleadership position, and who then says, ``Oh, no, really, I didn't have \nanything to do with the formulation of those briefs or the decision \nabout filing them.'' That is a troubling position. And it is a position \nthat we keep hearing from nominee after nominee.\n  Let me put future nominees on notice that, at least for this U.S. \nSenator, that type of response is not acceptable.\n  Mr. President, considering all of these factors, I oppose this \nnomination. I recognize the reality that this nominee would have been \napproved if a vote had been taken on the floor. One of the things we \nlearn to do in this business, Mr. President, is to count. And I can \ncount. Therefore, I do not want to put my colleagues, as we begin to \nleave for the August recess, through the necessity of a rollcall which \nwould slow this process down or inconvenience them. But I felt I had to \ncome to the floor this morning and state my position.\n  Mr. President, before we consider future ninth circuit nominees, I \nurge my colleagues to take a close look at the evidence--evidence that \nshows that we have a judicial circuit that each year moves farther and \nfarther from the mainstream and more and more in a confrontational role \nwith the U.S. Supreme Court and with Supreme Court precedents.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I intend in the future to seek \nrollcall votes on all nominees for the ninth circuit. Until we reverse \nthis disturbing trend, I believe the Senate needs to be on the record \nas either part of the problem or part of the solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9527-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9528-S9530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                POSTAL EMPLOYEES SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, this bill that was just passed by the Senate \nwill dramatically improve workplace safety and health for more than \n800,000 U.S. Postal Service employees. Senate bill 2112, the Postal \nEmployees Safety Enhancement Act, will bring the Postal Service under \nthe full jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration. It is my firm belief that government must play by its \nown rules, that all Federal agencies must comply with the 1970 \noccupational safety and health statute. They are not required to pay \npenalties issued to them by OSHA. They will be under this bill. The \nlack of any enforcement tool renders compliance requirements for the \nsubsector ineffective, at best.\n  My first look at this occurred when I noticed that Yellowstone \nNational Park had been cited for over 600 violations. Ninety of them \nwere serious. One of them was failure to report a death.\n  It occurred to me, though, that they may not be the worst violators, \nso I checked on the Federal Government and found that the agency that \nwe needed to start with was the U.S. Postal Service.\n  What is most troubling about the Postal Service's safety record is \nits annual workers' compensation payments. From 1992 to 1997, the \nPostal Service paid an average of $505 million in workers' compensation \ncosts, placing them once again at the top of the Federal Government's \nlist. Moreover, the Postal Service's annual contribution to workers' \ncompensation amounts to almost one-third of the Federal Government's \n$1.8 billion price tag.\n  In 1970, Congress passed the Postal Reorganization Act, eliminating \nthe old Postal Department status as a Cabinet office. Twelve years \nlater, the Postal Service became fiscally self-sufficient and is to be \ncongratulated on that.\n  After carefully listening to the perspectives of the Post Office and \nthe unions representing its employees, I have concluded that the Postal \nEmployees Safety Enhancement Act is necessary legislation. S. 2112 \naddresses specialized problems in a specialized business by permitting \nOSHA to fully regulate the Postal Service the way it does private \nbusinesses. In addition, the bill would prevent the Postal Service from \nclosing or consolidating rural post offices or services simply because \nit is required to comply with OSHA. Service to all areas in the Nation, \nrural or urban, was made a part of the Postal Service's mission by the \n1970 Postal Reorganization Act. The quality of service it provides \nshould not decrease because of efforts to protect and ensure employee \nsafety and health.\n  Along this same premise, the bill would prevent the Postal Rate \nCommission from raising the price of stamps to help the Postal Service \npay for potential OSHA fines. Rather, the Postal Service should offset \nthe potential for the fines by improving the workplace conditions. That \nis what we have been trying to do on all OSHA work that we have done--\nto get more safety and health in the workplace. That would decrease the \nPostal Service annual $505 million expenditure on workers' comp claims, \nand, more importantly, it would keep those employees safe. That is why \nthe money won't have to be spent.\n  I do not believe that this incremental bill should be looked on as an \nexpansion of regulatory enforcement. For years OSHA has been inspecting \nthe Federal work sites and issuing citations to those who are not in \ncompliance. This will continue, whether this bill is signed into law or \nnot. S. 2112 would simply require the Postal Service to pay any fine \nissued by OSHA to the General Treasury, expediting abatement of safety \nand health hazard.\n  Abating occupational safety and health hazards should be a top \npriority of any employer. Now, the U.S. Postal Service recently \nannounced a $100 million program to entice kids to collect stamps. I \ndon't question the validity of such a program or the benefit it would \nhave on the Nation's kids. However, I do question whether this program \nshould be a priority while workers' compensation claims and injuries, \nillness, lost time, and fatality rates remain so high.\n  We must ensure the safety and health of all employees because they \nare the most important asset of any business. The success or failure of \nany business, including the Post Office, rests on their ability to \nprovide efficient care and service to their customers.\n  In my capacity as a Senator, I have committed much of my time to the \nadvancement of workplace safety and health by advocating commonsense, \nincremental legislation. While it is important for OSHA to retain its \nability to enforce the law and respond to employee complaints in a \ntimely fashion, the agency must also begin to broaden its preventive \ninitiatives in an effort to bring more workplaces into compliance \nbefore accidents and fatalities occur.\n  I want to extend my sincere thanks to Senator Bingaman for \ncoauthoring the Postal Employees Safety Advancement Act. I believe all \nstakeholder meetings have paid off--producing a balanced, incremental \npiece of legislation. Chairman Jeffords of the Senate Labor Committee \nand ranking member, Senator Kennedy, are to be commended for their \nsteady commitment to advancing occupational safety and health. I also \nthank their staffs for all of the time that they spent on it. I \nparticularly congratulate and express my appreciation to Chris Spear of \nmy staff, and the other people on my team in the office who have been \nhelping on a day-by-day, grind-it-out basis to work on all occupational \nsafety and health. I am thankful for all the time that everyone has \nspent discussing this important issue with me.\n  I also want to thank all of the cosponsors. This is a very bipartisan \nbill. Their support is greatly appreciated.\n  Finally, I want to thank Congressman Greenwood for authoring the \nHouse version and subcommittee chairmen Ballenger and McHugh for their \ncareful consideration in their respective subcommittees. Their work has \nhelped to make this a real team effort.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Enzi and the \nother original cosponsors of this bill, Senator Jeffords, Senator \nBingaman, and Senator Brownback, in celebrating the final passage of \nthe Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act. I especially want to \ncommend Senator Enzi\n\n[[Page S9530]]\n\nfor his leadership on this bill. His tireless devotion to the safety \nand health of the nation's workers has resulted today in passage of \nsignificant improvements for employees of the United States Postal \nService. I am pleased to have worked with him on the passage of this \nimportant legislation, which will extend coverage of the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act to employees of the United States Postal Service. \nThe bill has broad bipartisan support, and it is supported by the \nAdministration as well.\n  Few issues are more important to working families than health and \nsafety on the job. For the past 28 years, OSHA has performed a critical \nrole--protecting American workers from on-the-job injuries and \nillnesses.\n  In carrying out this mission, OSHA has made an extraordinary \ndifference in people's lives. Death rates from on-the-job accidents \nhave dropped by over 60% since 1970--much faster than before the law \nwas enacted. More than 140,000 lives have been saved.\n  Occupational illnesses and injuries have dropped by one-third since \nOSHA's enactment--to a record low rate of 7.4 per 100 workers in 1996.\n  These numbers are still unacceptably high, but they demonstrate that \nOSHA is a success by any reasonable measure.\n  Even more lives have been saved in the past two places where OSHA has \nconcentrated its efforts. Death rates have fallen by 61% in \nconstruction and 67% in manufacturing. Injury rates have dropped by \nhalf in construction, and nearly one-third in manufacturing. Clearly, \nOSHA works best where it works hardest.\n  Unfortunately, these efforts do not apply to federal agencies. The \noriginal OSHA statute required only that federal agencies provide \n``safe and healthful places and conditions of employment'' to their \nemployees. Specific OSHA safety and health rules did not apply.\n  In 1980, President Carter issued an Executive Order that solved this \nproblem in part. It directed federal agencies to comply with all OSHA \nsafety standards, and it authorized OSHA to inspect workplaces and \nissue citations for violations.\n  President Carter's action was an important step, but more needs to be \ndone. When OSHA inspects a federal workplace and finds a safety \nviolation, OSHA can direct the agency to eliminate the hazard. But OSHA \nhas no authority to seek enforcement of its order in court, and it \ncannot assess a financial penalty on the agency to obtain compliance.\n  The situation is especially serious in the Postal Service. Postal \nemployees suffer one of the highest injury rates in the federal \ngovernment. In 1996 alone, 78,761 postal employees were injured on the \njob--more than nine injuries and illnesses for every hundred workers. \nThe total injury and illness rate among Postal Service workers \nrepresents almost half of the rate for the entire federal government, \neven though less than one-third of all federal workers are employed by \nthe Postal Service. Fourteen postal employees were killed on the job in \n1996--one-sixth of the federal total. Workers' compensation charges at \nthe Postal Service are also high--$538 million in 1997.\n  This legislation will bring down these unacceptably high rates. It \npermits OSHA to issue citations for safety hazards, and back them up \nwith penalties. This credible enforcement threat will encourage the \nPostal Service to comply with the law. It will save taxpayer dollars \ncurrently spent on workers' compensation costs.\n  Most important, it will reduce the extraordinarily high rate of \ninjuries among postal employees. Ever worker deserves a safe and \nhealthy place to work, and this bill will help achieve that goal for \nthe 860,000 employees of the Postal Service. They deserve it, and I am \npleased to join my colleagues in providing it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9528-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9530-S9531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ROBERT C.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1700) to designate the headquarters of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, \n     the District of Columbia, as the ``Robert C. Weaver Federal \n     Building.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nunanimous passage of S. 1700, a bill to designate the headquarters of \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development, located at 451 Seventh \nStreet, SW, as the ``Robert C. Weaver Federal Building.'' I am proud to \noffer my tribute to a brilliant and committed public servant the late \nDr. Robert C. Weaver, advisor to three Presidents, director of the \nNAACP, and the first African-American Cabinet Secretary. He was also a \ndear friend, dating back some 40 years.\n  A native Washingtonian, Bob Weaver spent his entire life broadening \nopportunities for minorities in America and working to dismantle \nAmerica's deeply entrenched system of racial segregation. He first made \nhis mark as a member of President Roosevelt's ``Black Cabinet,'' an \ninformal advisory group promoting educational and economic \nopportunities for blacks.\n  I first met Bob in the 1950s when we worked for Governor Averell \nHarriman. He served as Deputy Commissioner of Housing for New York \nState in 1955, and later became State Rent Commissioner with full \nCabinet rank. Our friendship and collaboration would continue through \nthe Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. By 1960, Bob was serving as \nPresident of the NAACP. President Kennedy, impressed with Bob's \ninsights and advice, soon appointed him to head the Housing and Home \nFinance Agency in 1961--the highest Federal post ever occupied by an \nAfrican-American.\n  When President Johnson succeeded in elevating HHFA to Cabinet level \nstatus in 1966, he didn't need to look far for the right man to head \nthe new Department of Housing and Urban Development--Bob Weaver became \nthe nation's first African-American Cabinet Secretary. Later, he and I \nserved together on the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission.\n  Following his government service, Dr. Weaver was, among various other \nacademic pursuits, a professor at Hunter College, a member of the \nSchool of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon, a visiting \nprofessor at Columbia Teacher's College and New York University's \nSchool of Education, and the president of Baruch College in Manhattan. \nWhen I became director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and \nHarvard, he generously agreed to be a member of the Board of Directors.\n  Dr. Weaver had earned his undergraduate, master's, and doctoral \ndegrees in economics from Harvard; he wrote four books on urban \naffairs; and he was one of the original directors of the Municipal \nAssistance Corporation, which designed the plan to rescue New York City \nduring its tumultuous financial crisis in the 1970s.\n  After a long and remarkable career, Bob passed away last July at his \nhome in New York City. The nation has lost one of its innovators, one \nof its creators, one of its true leaders. For Bob led not only with his \nwords but with his deeds. I was privileged to know him as a friend. I \nthink it is a fitting tribute to name the HUD Building after this great \nman.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statement relating to the bill appear \nat this point in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The bill (S. 1700) was considered read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ROBERT C. WEAVER FEDERAL BUILDING.\n\n       In honor of the first Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development, the headquarters building of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development located at 451 Seventh Street, \n     SW., in Washington, District of Columbia, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Robert C.

The Senate is in a period of morning business \nwith a 5-minute limitation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I request unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 25 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, I do not intend to, I think \nthat I addressed the Chair ahead of the other Senator, but I wouldn't \nchallenge the Chair on that point. I know the Chair has the discretion \nto recognize whomever he hears first, but I would like to make a \nstatement.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time does the Senator need for his morning \nbusiness remarks?\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I will require 20 or 25 minutes. But I \nwill await my turn. I thank the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. No objection.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nyielding. I was in the Chair, and I had the podium put up much earlier \nthis morning, but because a colleague next to me was going to speak, he \nwanted it removed.\n  Mr. BYRD. I didn't understand the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I had requested that my podium be put up on the Senate \nfloor at 10 o'clock this morning when I was presiding so that I could \nbe in proper order to be recognized as soon as I got out of the Chair. \nI certainly didn't intend to create a problem for the Senator from West \nVirginia. I apologize for any inconvenience.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield, I have no problem. The Senator \nis not creating a problem for me. I just call attention to the rules, \nthat the Presiding Officer recognize the first person who addresses the \nChair seeking recognition. I have no quarrel with the Chair. I have \nbeen in the Chair many times, and sometimes it is a little difficult to \nreally determine which Senator spoke first. I just wanted to establish \nagain--and once in awhile we have to do this--that it is a matter of \nfollowing the rules of recognition, and that it doesn't matter what \nSenator came before or what Senator is seen standing first, or what \nSenator may have his name on a list at the desk. I do not recognize a \nlist at the desk. Never have. I try to stick to the rules. I thank the \nSenator. I know I have delayed his speech.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his comments, \nand I respect the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9530-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMENDING SENATOR KYL ON HIS SPEECH ON THE RUMSFELD REPORT\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, during the 105th Session of Congress, my \ncolleagues and I are addressing a broad range of high tech issues, \nincluding military, civilian, and commercial space issues. The industry \nsupporting high technology products and services has become extremely \nimportant to our nation, and particularly in my home state of Colorado.\n  Today I would like to take a look at the high-tech industry through \nglobal, national, state, and local perspectives, and relate the broader \nexamples to Colorado. Colorado is a microcosm of the nation when you \nlook at high-tech and the future of the industry. The prosperity, \ntrends, and needs within the Colorado community are prime examples of \nwhat the entire nation is faced with.\n  The growth-inducing power of technology at the industry level has \nbeen astonishing. In the United States, research-intensive industries, \nsuch as aerospace, chemicals, communications, computers, \npharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, semiconductors, and software-\nhave been growing approximately twice the rate of the U.S. economy as a \nwhole the past two decades. The high-tech world has also become \nextremely competitive. High-tech firms are now facing global \ncompetition, regional competition, and competition for jobs. There is \nevery reason to believe that this trend will continue for at least the \nnext decade.\n  As competition increases locally and globally, we must field an \neducated workforce that can also be competitive. America's future \neconomy depends on sustaining a competitive edge through greater \ndevelopment and knowledge. But there is growing concern that America is \nnot prepared for this new economy.\n  I would like to share some startling statistics revealing the serious \nlack of education in this country.\n  Forty percent of our 8 year-olds cannot read.\n  A Department of Education study concludes that 90 million adult \nAmericans have limited information and quantitative skills. According \nto the American Society for Training and Development's 1997 ``State of \nthe Industry Report,'' 50 percent of organizations now have to provide \nemployee training in basic skills.\n  U.S. students do not perform well in comparison with students in \nother countries. According to the Third International Mathematics and \nScience Study--a study of half a million children in 41 countries--U.S. \neighth-graders had average mathematics scores that were well below \nthose of 20 other countries. Although U.S. eighth-graders performed \nbetter in science, they were still outperformed by students in nine \nother countries.\n  We are experiencing phenomenal growth in jobs for highly skilled \ninformation technology workers, yet there are mounting reports that \nindustry is having great difficulty recruiting adequate numbers of \nworkers with the skills in demand.\n  We, as a society, need to find ways to counter these serious problems \nand work towards filling all of our employment needs.\n  Due to increasing global competitiveness, our economy is creating \nmillions of new jobs--more than 15 million new jobs since 1993. \nEmployees are in demand due to this increased competitiveness, and of \nthe 10 industries with the fastest employment growth from 1996-2006, \ncomputer and data processing services are number one on the list, \naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report of December 1997. In \nthis field alone, there were 1. 2 million jobs in the United States in \n1996. This number is projected to rise to 2.5 million jobs in 2006. \nThat represents a 108 percent increase in the next 8 years.\n  Of the 10 occupations with the fastest employment growth from 1996-\n2006, the top three occupations have some connection to the high tech \nindustry. Database administrators, computer support specialists, and \ncomputer scientists had a population of 212,000 jobs in 1996, and are \nprojected to be needed in 461,000 jobs in 2006, a 118 percent change. \nComputer engineers will see a 109 percent increase in jobs and systems \nanalysts a 103 percent increase by the year 2006.\n  This trend is representative of the high-tech employment needs of \nColorado. We are facing a problem as the need for technical bachelors' \ndegrees rises, because the number of students entering this field is \nnot increasing at a rate to meet this need. In addition, the science \nand math scores needed to pursue technical degrees at higher education \ninstitutions are not being met by more and more students every year.\n  If the trend continues as we expect it to, we will see an increasing \nlack of skilled employees to meet the industry's demand. The \nconsequences of not filling these jobs could mean several things. One \nbeing that high-tech industry in the United States will not be globally \ncompetitive. Another being\n\n[[Page S9532]]\n\nthat we will need to continually find workers from out of the country \nto fill high-tech jobs, instead of giving those jobs to Americans. \nWhatever the consequences may be, we know that they will be substantial \nif we do not fill the employment needs of the high-tech industry.\n  Colorado is seeing tremendous signs of growth in the technology \narena. As an example, the City of Colorado Springs relies on high-tech \nfor over 50% of its local economy. Complex electronics and information \ntechnology sectors support about 30% of the total local economy, and \nthere is a strong defense sector presence which is heavily reliant on \nhigh tech employers and needs. 40% of the local economy in Colorado \nSprings is tied into the defense sector. Right now Colorado has \neffectively no unemployment in the engineering field. Between this year \nand 2006, information technology, telecommunications, information \nprocessing, software development, and systems engineering will all have \nemployment needs that will more than double in the Colorado Springs \narea.\n  The proper role of the government in high-tech and space issues is an \nongoing debate. For example, Congress is considering now what access \nthe government should have to encrypted stored computer data or \nelectronic communications, and how to facilitate commercial space \nbusinesses.\n  The United States is competing with several other countries in the \nhigh tech industry. There are five countries that we know have the \nability to launch satellites, while many other countries have the \ntechnology to compete in other areas. Therefore, our workforce \ndevelopment must support the needs of our domestic industry to allow it \nto be competitive. Without growth in the United States technology \nindustries, we will be surpassed by the technology of our competitors, \nand our commercial industry will ultimately rely on foreign companies \nfor technology.\n  One of the major debates in trying to fill the technology workforce \nneeds deals with who should fill those needs when we cannot. The United \nStates has come to depend on foreign-born engineers; we have reached \nthe point where we import as many engineers as we graduate from our \nuniversities.\n  Recently, my colleagues in the U.S. Senate and I approved the \nAmerican Competitiveness Act of 1998. It raises the ceiling on the \nnumber of visas designated for high-tech workers, or H1-B visas, from \n65,000 to 95,000 in the fiscal year 1998, and then to 115,000 a year \nthrough 2002. This bill is partially in response to the ``year 2000'' \nproblem and will help high-tech industries hire enough employees to \neffectively resolve the problem. But this is a short-term solution, and \nin the year 2002, Congress will reevaluate the number of H1-B \napplicants that this country allows in to work.\n  The competitive edge that America needs depends on the knowledge \nattributes of our workforce. Due to the rapid changes in the high-tech \nfield, we must focus on educating our youth. Educating students about \nthe high-tech needs and changes our society faces will allow for \nadaptation and innovation. The industry's growth depends on the \nstudents that are entering universities with high scores in math and \nscience. Employers are desperate for students with bachelors and \nadvanced degrees in computer engineering, computer information systems, \ncomputer science, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering.\n  We need to focus on improving the educational opportunities for every \nstudent, but we could especially make improvements by targeting under-\nrepresented minorities. While a small amount of high school graduates, \n15%, have taken calculus and physics, only 6% of minority students have \ntaken those classes, which are required for a college major in math, \nengineering or science. This year, universities graduated a record \nnumber African Americans, Latinos, and American Indians with \nengineering degrees, yet they constitute only 10% of all students with \nengineering degrees, and only 2.8% of doctorates. The number of female \nminorities in this category is even smaller. Only 2.8% of college \nengineering graduates and .6% of engineering doctorates went to \nminority women.\n  The solution begins with our youngest students, kindergarten through \n12th grade. How do we more specifically improve our education system \nfrom K-12 so that children will eventually meet the standards that \nhigh-tech, and business in general, demand? It should be obvious that \nwe first need to improve math and science interest and education, \nstarting with increased teacher support. Knowledge of the subject \nmatter and the ability to actually use technology need to be taught to \nour future teachers at universities across the country. Current \nteachers need access to continuing education and high-tech resources.\n  We also must increase the number of teachers who are teaching math \nand science subjects. Projections show that there is going to be a \nsevere teacher shortage in the years 2010-2025. We are going to face \nyet another crisis in high-tech workers and leaders if we do not \nencourage more math and science graduates to become math and science \nteachers. Without more and better math and science teachers our high-\ntech teacher shortage will progressively worsen, and we will not be \nable to increase the number of students in math and science classes.\n  Industry partnerships, which are successful in many university \nsettings, can be very beneficial to younger students as well. The U.S. \nSpace Foundation, which is based in Colorado, has been especially \nsuccessful in cooperative programs with schools across the country with \ntheir support for math and science programs. Kids find it more \ninteresting and fun if real life entities are tied into the classroom, \nand the U.S. Space Foundation facilitates this for the students and \nteachers. Rotating high-tech specialists and resources in classrooms \nwill keep our teachers current and motivated. In addition, high school \nstudents are eligible for job opportunities and student internships in \nthe workplace that require scientific knowledge and will increase their \nexcitement for the field. With increased attention to our students, \nespecially in regard to math and science, we can interest students in \nthe world of technology.\n  Another outstanding example of a partnership between school and \nindustry is the Technology Student Association. The TSA is composed of \nover 150,000 elementary, middle, and high school students, in 2,000 \nschools spanning 45 states, including Colorado. It is supported by \neducators, parents, and business leaders who believe in the need for a \ntechnologically literate society. Through leadership and fun problem-\nsolving, K-12 students are shown why increased education in math and \nscience can pay off and be exciting. These partnerships are successful, \nand demonstrate one way we can start now to fill the technology \nworkforce needs of the 21st Century.\n  While it is imperative to encourage young students to be involved in \nmath and science and to expose them to high-tech occupations, I am not \nsuggesting support for school-to-work programs. School-to-work \ncentralizes unprecedented powers at the federal level and requires \nfederal standards and assessment testing which would be the basis of \nall our children's education, and this process would begin in \nkindergarten. Most importantly, school-to-work takes local elected \nofficials of the states and local school boards out of the process of \neducation. This alone could be devastating to businesses and \nspecifically to high-tech industries. Local Boards and elected \nofficials are well aware of the needs of their community in particular, \nand can adapt accordingly.\n  Government does not need to set ``standards'' for children to \ndetermine their career paths, but instead improve those standards of \nexisting education policies in order to raise test scores, and more \nspecifically science and math scores. If we do so, our children will be \ninclined to attend higher education institutions where cooperative \neducation and internship opportunities will be available to them, and \nwe will be on our way to building a workforce that can compete \nglobally.\n  As more students graduate from high school with aptitude and interest \nin math and science we must have a college education system that will \nfoster their interests and can propel them into the industry. \nColorado's universities demonstrate how well-adapted programs can be to \nthe regional industry.\n  The space industry, in particular, is a crucial part of Colorado's \neconomy,\n\n[[Page S9533]]\n\nand in turn our state is one of the nation's leaders in space \nindustries. The National Space Symposium, held annually in Colorado \nSprings, emphasizes the importance of technology in our state and \nnation. Space Command, Air Force Academy, and NASA, are some of the \nmajor presences. In addition, four space centers tied in with NASA are \nbased in Northern Colorado: the Center for Aerospace Structure, \nColorado Center for Aerospace Research, Center for Space Construction, \nand Bioserve Technologies, which produces hardware for the space \nshuttle.\n  Our universities are aware of the need for high-tech education, and \nhave focused on preparing students for this field. The University of \nColorado at Colorado Springs offers a well established Master of \nEngineering Degree in Space Operations, and the Air Force Academy \ncontinually graduating students into this field. Graduates of the \nUniversity of Colorado-Boulder, which offers the only aerospace degree \nin Northern Colorado, also support Colorado's space industry.\n  At the college level internship opportunities become significant. \nEmployers see cooperative education programs and internships as real-\nworld employment experience which lets college students become familiar \nwith an organization and its work style. High-tech industries are \nseeing a trend toward expensive training costs and high employee \nturnover. By partnering with colleges and universities, high-tech \nindustries will see a more highly trained workforce entering their \nindustry and employees who are more committed to the organization.\n  The main idea behind cooperative education and internships are that \nthey provide students the opportunity to apply theory learned in the \nclassroom to the workplace. High-tech industries now consider the use \nof partnering with a university's cooperative education and internship \nprograms as the number one recruitment tool for long-term commitments \nof regular employment.\n  For example, the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs \nrecognized this as an important investment in students' futures. In \naddition to helping their own students with internships, the University \nitself provides internships to students from other universities without \ninternship opportunities. The University has formed partnerships with \ncommunity, junior, and 4-year colleges without engineering programs.\n  In conclusion, this is a critical time; we must start today if we \nwant to solve the high-tech employment problem. The signs are \neverywhere that high-tech is booming, but high-tech employees are not. \nWe must act fast, for studies show key math and science decisions are \nmade by a student at the 5th to 7th grade level. This means that there \ncan be up to a ten-year lead-time for bachelor degree level technology \nworkers. There are four areas that I think we should focus on in order \nto help solve the problem.\n  No. 1, Clearly understand the challenge, communicate it to our \nteachers, parents and students, and consider the consequences of not \nacting on this issue immediately.\n  No. 2, Better connect education systems and industry.\n  No. 3, Find innovative ways to remove barriers to education in math \nand science, and continue improvement in higher education.\n  No. 4, Leverage government funding through greater collaboration \namong government agencies, educational institutions and the private \nindustry.\n  We need to work together in order to solve this problem. Our \nuniversities need to increase engineering and computer sciences \nscholarships, improve distance learning, and expand their internship \nand cooperative education programs to meet the needs of the high-tech \nindustry. Our government needs to upgrade training and out-source more \nwork, education, and training. Our industries must increase recruiting, \nbuild higher retention rates, and offer on-site courses. And finally, \nour public schools must increase partnerships with outside entities, \neducate our teachers about technology, and make science and math fun \nfor our students.\n  The examples I have given from my home state of Colorado demonstrate \nthat through increased internships, partnerships, teacher training, and \nK-12 student programs, communities can do something to meet the \nemployment needs of the 21st Century.\n  The United States will continue to be a global leader in the \ntechnology arena if these ideas are implemented tomorrow and we ensure \nthat our schools are producing the best, most educated workforce in the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Now, Mr. President, Senator Rod Grams and I traveled to \nFrance to develop a better understanding of policies underpinning the \nutilization of nuclear energy for about 80 percent of their \nelectricity. We visited several key French facilities, and Senator Fred \nThompson joined us after the site visit and participated in several of \nthe high-level meetings with\n\n[[Page S9534]]\n\nelected and appointed Government officials.\n  Observations from our trip provide some important perspectives for \nconsideration in the United States:\n  Nuclear energy has been implemented in France with strict attention \nto minimizing environmental consequences. Waste products are reduced at \neach step in their process.\n  The French nuclear energy system enables them to achieve world-class \nstandards for minimal environmental impact from power generation. They \nare justifiably proud of their record. Their carbon dioxide emissions \nper capita are about one-third those in the United States.\n  French reliance on a ``closed fuel cycle'' has enabled recycle and \nrecovery of the energy content of spent fuel while also dramatically \nreducing the volume and toxicity of waste products below those in the \nUnited States with our ``open fuel cycle.''\n  Transportation and interim storage of spent fuel are done carefully \nin France, with virtually no negative impacts. Interim storage is \nessential in implementing their fuel cycle.\n  At each site in France, attention to protection of the environment is \noutstanding. For example, while the United States left corrosive waste \nfrom uranium enrichment in tens of thousands of steel casks at places \nlike Paducah, Kentucky and Portsmouth, Ohio, the French have routinely \nextracted commercial products from the same waste and stored only inert \nproducts.\n  The nuclear industry in France is structured around a closed fuel \ncycle, which recycles much of their spent fuel. This requires \nreprocessing of the fuel, a step that the U.S. banned in 1977. That \ndecision by President Carter sought to avoid availability of separated \nplutonium with its proliferation concerns. The French, along with other \ncountries, were equally concerned about proliferation; but they simply \nensured careful safeguards on the plutonium and today are seeking to \nincrease their reuse of plutonium to minimize plutonium reserves. \nExcellent security and international safeguards were obvious in their \nfacilities.\n  When the French reprocess spent fuel, they reuse plutonium in mixed \noxide or MOX fuel, consisting of a mixture of plutonium and \nuranium oxides. Their reprocessing allows the plutonium and uranium to \nbe reused and dramatically reduces the toxicity and volume of their \nwaste below the U.S. open cycle. In contrast, we just plan to bury our \nspent fuel with no attempt to recycle the valuable energy content of \nthe spent fuel or reduce its volume or toxicity. The resulting waste \nvolume from 20 years of a family of four in France is about 2.5 cubic \ninches, about that of a pack of cards. And after 200 years, the \nradiotoxicity of their waste is only about 10% of the value of our \nspent fuel.\n  The French have gone to great lengths to educate their public about \nnuclear issues, and extensive environmental monitoring information is \nroutinely shared with the citizens from all the activities we saw.\n  Transportation of spent fuel is required in the French system. But \nthe French have never experienced a radioactive spill in any traffic \naccident. Simple interim storage is routinely used in France, without \nthe political debates we face in the United States over this necessary \nstep towards a credible fuel cycle.\n  A 1991 French law prescribed a 15 year period to assess options for \ndisposition of their final waste products, whereas we precluded our \noptions and focused on a permanent repository with the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1982. Under this program, they are actively studying \nfurther reductions in the toxicity of their waste. We learned that they \nwould welcome strong collaboration in this field with the U.S. The \nAccelerator Transmutation of Waste program, funded for the first time \nin the current Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, is one program \nthey singled our for enhanced cooperation.\n  The French do not justify their closed cycle with economic arguments, \ninstead they point to its sensitivity to environmental issues and the \nminimal legacy left for future generations. In fact, with uranium \nprices currently extremely low, the closed cycle may be slightly more \nexpensive than our open cycle, at least in the near term. Partly for \nthat reason, partly because of the large investment required if the \nU.S. tried to now duplicate the French system, and partly because there \nare now alternative options to achieve a closed cycle, we do not \nrecommend that the U.S. simply adopt the French closed cycle.\n  New closed cycle options should be considered driven by technological \nadvances in the decades since the French initiated their system. We \nbelieve that these new options deserve evaluation here to enable the \nU.S. to consider the benefits of a closed fuel cycle. Some of these \nnewer options would provide benefits similar to the French system, plus \nsome would avoid proliferation concerns by never separating plutonium. \nSome of the new nuclear initiatives funded for next year should explore \nthese attractive options. Almost any of these options, however, require \ninterim storage of spent fuel--our trip only adds to the strength of \ncurrent arguments for prompt implementation of this simple and \nimportant step.\n  In summary, there are important lessons from the French system for \nour use of nuclear energy. In the next session of Congress, we look \nforward to working with you to improve our system, drawing upon these \nlessons where appropriate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9533-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9534-S9536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SCHIZOPHRENIA\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know how many Senators saw an \narticle in the Washington Post today, in section B of the Washington \nPost, called ``Tears Of Blood.'' I have the article in front of me. I \nask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 31, 1998]\n\n                             Tears of Blood\n\n                          (By Megan Rosenfeld)\n\n       First there was the gruesome and heartbreaking news of \n     Russell Weston's attack on the U.S. Capitol. Then came word \n     that he is a paranoid schizophrenic, information that \n     resonated for one set of families with unsettling emotions: \n     recognition mixed with horror, and in some cases thankfulness \n     that it wasn't the faces of their sons or sisters flashing \n     across the television screen.\n       The families of schizophrenics, like those of other \n     seriously mentally ill people, suffer a particular kind of \n     torment. Years of bewildering and sometimes destructive \n     behavior usually precedes a diagnosis; years of false starts \n     or abandoned treatment often follow. Even when a mother or \n     father recognizes mental illness--as opposed to drug \n     addiction, rebelliousness or eccentricity--discovering the \n     legal barriers to involuntary commitment is yet another body \n     blow.\n       ``Parents always feel it's your responsibility to help your \n     children, but we were powerless to help him,'' says \n     Jacqueline Shannon, whose son Greg began behaving strangely \n     in his last year of college. Now 35, Greg Shannon has been \n     stabilized for more than six years with the drug clozapine--\n     although it took four hospital commitments before that \n     medication was prescribed.\n       A publication by the Canadian-based Schizophrenia Society \n     lists some of the emotions family members are likely to feel: \n     sorrow (``We feel like we've lost our child''); anxiety \n     (``We're afraid to leave him alone or hurt his feelings''); \n     fear (``Will he harm himself or others?''). They also list \n     shame, bitterness, isolation, anger and ``excessive searching \n     for possible answers.''\n       ``You want not to be blamed that your family member has \n     become deranged,'' says David Kaczynski, whose brother, Ted, \n     is notorious as the Unabomber. ``And you don't want people to \n     hate your brother or son, to form judgments that are not \n     based on compassion for the fact that this person is mentally \n     ill.'' There are so many complicated emotions, he said. ``You \n     recognize this family member you love is also an enemy.''\n       Kaczynski recalls taking some of his brother's letters to a \n     psychologist in the early 1990s--before he knew that Ted had \n     been mailing lethal bombs--and was told that his brother was \n     very ill and needed treatment. And also that there was very \n     little David could do about that.\n       For years Ted Kaczynski's primary method of communication \n     with his family was through long, irrational letters, in \n     which he blamed his parents for his loneliness and fears, and \n     even for the fact that he was three inches shorter than \n     David.\n       ``I have got to know, I have GOT TO, GOT TO, GOT TO know \n     that every last tie joining me to this stinking family has \n     been cut FOREVER and that I will never NEVER have to \n     communicate with any of you again,'' he wrote David in 1991. \n     ``I've got to do it NOW. I can't tell you how desperate I am. \n     . . . It is killing me.''\n       It was five years and hundreds of letters later that David, \n     recognizing similarities between things his brother had \n     written and the excerpts from the Unabomber manifesto \n     printed in The Washington Post and the New York Times, \n     went to the FBI, Ted Kaczynski\n\n[[Page S9535]]\n\n     had never agreed to treatment or to the idea that his \n     mental state was out of his control.\n       David Kaczynski said he and his mother were greatly \n     comforted by numerous letters they received from other \n     families of the mentally ill--including one from the mother \n     of abortion clinic assassin John Salvi. In fact, Wanda \n     Kaczynski and Ann Marie Salvi had a long telephone \n     conversation, commiserating over the mystifying madness that \n     turned their sons into killers.\n       Remembering how grateful he was to the people who wrote and \n     told him they knew he loved his brother, David has written \n     Russell Weston's parents. It is not their fault, he told \n     them; they did what they could. ``I think they have shown \n     great courage,'' he said, referring to the numerous \n     interviews the Westons have given explaining the difficulties \n     they had with Russell.\n       Shannon's son never became violent. Indeed, Kaczynski, \n     Salvi and would-be Reagan assassin John Hinckley are rare \n     explosions in a population of approximately 2 million \n     schizophrenics who, if properly treated with medication and \n     therapy, can lead peaceful if unorthodox lives.\n       Greg Shannon's problems, which became evident when he was \n     22, confounded his parents. (Schizophrenia generally surfaces \n     between the ages of 16 and 25, according to reseach. The \n     illness is characterized by hallucinations and delusions; \n     schizophrenics are unable to differentiate their warped \n     perceptions or obsessive thoughts from reality.) ``We are \n     considered educated people,'' said Shannon, a retired \n     elementary school teacher in San Angelo, Tex. ``But mental \n     illness did not occur to us. We thought it had something to \n     do with drugs or alcohol.''\n       Their son would get into irrational arguments with them, \n     stayed in his room for days on end (as did Kaczynski) and \n     seemed to perspire a lot. His college roommate called to say \n     Greg had talked about suicide. ``It was a frightening time,'' \n     his brother Brian recalls.\n       Like other families, they tried for a while to \n     ``normalize'' Greg's behavior: He was different, he was going \n     through a rough patch--let him stay in his room if he wants.\n       Because he was an adult, he could not be forced to see a \n     counselor. But they couldn't get through to him themselves. \n     Finally family members went to the county judge and began the \n     legal process of getting Greg involuntarily committed to a \n     private hospital, which involved affidavits from two doctors. \n     Then one evening the sheriff and a couple of deputies arrived \n     to take Greg Shannon away.\n       ``It was awful,'' Jackie Shannon says. At the same time, \n     there was some relief. And the process was only beginning.\n       ``The family members are hurt, bewildered and confused,'' \n     says Moe Armstrong, a paranoid schizophrenic who, with the \n     help of medication and many therapeutic programs, works to \n     help other patients in Massachusetts. Now 54, he had his \n     first breakdown during his four-year hitch in the Marine \n     Corps. His parents, he says, did not understand anything \n     about mental illness. And he no longer blames them. ``A \n     lot of us defy rationality. The way our minds work are not \n     the way people's minds work out there. . . . One day this \n     person is all right and the next anything goes.''\n       His advice: ``It requires a lot of patience. You can make \n     suggestions, but only one or two, and you have to make them \n     over and over again. Most people want to say to A,B,C,D, tie \n     your shoes, get a job and everything will be all right. They \n     say things like `take your meds,' but not `What meds are you \n     taking? What effect are they having?' '' Life for the \n     relatives of the chronic mentally ill is often filled with \n     regrets, if not guilt, and the agonized wish they had known \n     more, and sooner. ``I wonder if we had started the commitment \n     process earlier, or if they'd prescribed clozaphine earlier \n     if he would have avoided permanent damage,'' says Brian \n     Shannon, ``Maybe not.''\n       One thing all family members share: Having a mentally ill \n     child or sibling changes your life forever. In some cases, as \n     with the Shannons, it has led to volunteer work on behalf of \n     people like Greg. Jackie Shannon is now president of the \n     board of directors of the National Alliance for the Mentally \n     Ill.\n       Brian Shannon knows that someday he will be responsible for \n     his brother, and consulted a genetic counselor before having \n     a child. David Kaczynski, who works with youthful runaways in \n     a shelter in Albany, N.Y.--as he did before his brother was \n     arrested--faces a lifetime of secondhand notoriety and \n     residual pain.\n       ``I still believe in some way he does love me,'' he says.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is an article that follows on the \ntragedy that happened here in Washington when a man, 41 years of age, \nobviously suffering from a very serious disease called schizophrenia, \nwas off his medication and, because of his disease, did the kind of \nthings that have shocked our country and shocked our Capitol. The story \nis about four or five people in the United States who have family \nmembers with the same disease, schizophrenia, and have suffered the \nconsequences of their relative, son or daughter, being off the \nmedication--because there is a propensity on the part of those with \nthis ailment to not want to be on medication. Sometimes it offends them \na bit. Sometimes it causes extreme obesity. Sometimes it causes some \nmuscular jittering. But whatever the case, it is hard to keep them on \ntheir medication.\n  I believe we might turn this terrible incident into a constructive \nresponse to a very destructive event because, as this article points \nout, there is little that the parents and relatives can do in their \ncommunities to help when they begin to feel the desolation and absolute \nloneliness when a member of their family, a daughter or son who has \nthis dread disease, decides not to stay on the medication or the \nmedication needs to be changed to be effective. The loneliness is \nabsolutely incredible. As a matter of fact, in this marvelous land of \nours, it is fair to say that only in a few places is there any help at \nall for these people. I don't know how many Americans saw Russell \nWeston, Sr. and his wife when they met with the press and talked about \ntheir son, their son, the 41-year-old who burst through a door here in \nour Capitol. We all know about the events, and feel great, great \nsympathy and empathy for the family of the two fallen officers. We have \nalmost been, as a nation, in mourning since that event occurred. And \nthat is as it should be.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to say much more about this, other than \nto say that I have worked with the mentally ill in this Nation. I have \nworked hard to get more and more people to recognize that this is a \ndisease and that we ought to cover this disease with insurance just as \nwe cover heart failure. That causes some difficulty. Nonetheless, today \nI don't rise on that score. I merely rise to say: Maybe, maybe this \ngreat land of ours, and maybe this institution called the U.S. Senate, \nand maybe groups across America that are worried about this, might just \nsee if there is a way we can prevent this from happening, if we could \nprevent it from happening even a couple of hundred times. We frequently \nsee schizophrenics committing acts of murder and degradation, and we \nall know why it is happening. As a matter of fact, we can almost say \nwith certainty, I say to my friend, Senator Byrd, that if most of those \npeople were on the right medicine they would not be perpetrating these \nkinds of acts. I hope we would use this to stimulate our collective \nthinking on what we might do about it.\n  I don't have the answers. But I have talked to a few Senators. I have \ntalked, in particular, to Dr. Frist, Senator Frist from Tennessee, who \nconcurs with me that there is little help available. For, you see, in \nthe case of Mr. Weston, if they wanted him to be taken care of, they \nhad very few options. They could call the police. I think across \nAmerica it is pretty obvious, police will come by and they will say, \n``This is a medical problem. We can't help you.'' They could take him \nto a hospital. A normal hospital would say, ``We can't help you.'' They \ncould put him in an institution for a few weeks to try to get him back \non board and on the medication, but they had already done that.\n  So this Washington Post article called ``Tears of Blood; For Families \nof Schizophrenics, a Gunman's Shots Strike at Their Hearts'' is \nsomething we should all take cognizance of.\n  I hope by these remarks--and some others in this community, I \nunderstand, are interested in this--that we will find a way to start \nmeeting together in groups, trying to figure out what should an \nAmerican response be? Maybe it is a State response. Maybe it is not a \nFederal response. But we might be the ones to stimulate some real \nthinking about a responsibility. In this case, we could really be \npreventers, we could be preventers of serious, serious acts of violence \nbecause that can be prevented. It is just we do not help at the time \nthey need help. And we don't have a system set up to provide such help.\n  I thank the Senator for listening, and, in particular, for giving me \na few extra moments this morning. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I note on the floor the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, who is the assistant majority \nleader. I wonder if he has a plane to catch? I am sure he may have some \nSenate business. If he does, I will be happy to defer. I have no\n\n[[Page S9536]]\n\nparticular time problem myself. I will be glad to defer to the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is so \ncourteous, as usual. I have about a 10- or 15-minute speech, but I will \nbe happy to listen to my colleague and then I will follow my colleague \nfrom West Virginia and I thank him, again, for his courtesy.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be recognized \nimmediately after Mr. Nickles is recognized, at which time I will \nproceed with the remarks. I ask unanimous consent that at that time I \nmay consume such time as I may desire, but not to exceed 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again to my colleague, I am more than \nhappy to defer. He is so kind and gracious, as he always is. He sets an \nexample in the Senate, which I think all of us should follow and makes \nall of us proud to have the title of ``Senator.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma wish more than \n5 minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Again, I thank my colleague from West Virginia for his \ncourtesy. I doubt I will take 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9534-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9536-S9540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE ROLE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with a very \nsober, very serious discussion. That concerns the role, the \neffectiveness, and the job that the Attorney General of the United \nStates is currently doing. The Attorney General, under title 28 of the \nU.S. Code, section 515, is vested as the chief law enforcement officer \nof the country. That is a very important vesting of power. She is the \nchief law enforcement officer of the country. She has the \nresponsibility of making sure the laws are carried out, as part of the \nexecutive branch.\n  Congress, some time ago, realized that every once in a while there \nmight be a conflict of enforcing the law strictly, if there are \nallegations of impropriety with members of the executive branch, so the \nindependent counsel statute was passed. It was passed as a follow-up to \nWatergate. Can you really investigate your own boss? Can the Attorney \nGeneral investigate the President or Vice President or some other \nCabinet official because they are serving with those individuals at \ntheir pleasure? As a matter of fact, Attorney General Reno was \nappointed and confirmed by the Senate in, I believe, 1993; and then \nthere was some speculation she would be reconfirmed or reappointed by \nthe President, and subsequently she was.\n  Since that time, I think all of my colleagues, and certainly all the \ncountry, know that this administration has had a lot of legal conflicts \nand problems. One of the biggest issues was the issue of campaign \nfinance. Both the House and Senate have conducted hearings. I presently \nserve on the Governmental Affairs Committee that conducted an \ninvestigation all of last year over alleged campaign finance abuses. \nThe committee, at least amongst the majority of the committee, albeit \nmostly Republicans, said, yes, there should be an independent counsel \nappointed. We made that recommendation to the Attorney General. She has \nignored that recommendation, and regrettably so.\n  Mr. President, I might mention a few things. I said she is in charge \nof making sure the laws are enforced. I am looking at one, and I could \nspend hours going through the law and stating allegations that I think \nthis administration was in violation of, that she has not enforced, or \nto give reason for the appointment of an independent counsel so there \nwould not be this conflict of interest. I will mention a couple of \nlaws.\n  Title 18, section 607, United States Code, states in clear and \nunequivocal terms:\n\n       It should be unlawful for any person to solicit or receive \n     any contribution in a Federal building.\n\n  I could go on and mention the conflict of covered persons. Covered \npersons under this statute are the President, the Vice President. Vice \nPresident Gore has now admitted to making 52 fundraising calls from the \nWhite House. And the so-called coffees: There were 103 coffees in the \nWhite House attended by 1,241 people. They raised $26.4 million and I \nthink are in direct violation of the statute. President Clinton hosted \nan average of two coffees per week during the reelection cycle; Vice \nPresident Gore attended over 100 coffees in 22 months before the \nelection; 92 percent of the coffee attendees contributed to the DNC in \nthe 1996 election cycle.\n  I could mention the overnighters. President Clinton, in a handwritten \nnote to a memo on January 5, 1995, told his staff he is ``ready to \nstart the overnights right away'' and asked for a list of $100,000 and \n$50,000 contributors. Altogether, there were 178 guests who were listed \nas long-time friends, public officials or dignitaries, or Arkansas \nfriends, who contributed over $5 million to the DNC. Overnight DNC \ndonors paid an average of $44,000 per family to sleep in the Lincoln \nBedroom. The White House was for sale, I think in clear violation of \nthe law, Mr. President.\n  I will mention a statement that Attorney General Reno made to the \nHouse Judiciary Committee on October 15, 1997. I ask unanimous consent \nthat excerpts of Attorney General Reno's statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the excerpts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Since they began their work, I have met with them regularly \n     to hear what they have found and to ask them questions. I \n     check on their progress several times a week, discussing with \n     them what evidence they have found and how they are \n     proceeding. Most important of all, I have told them from the \n     start that they are to contact me immediately if they ever \n     believe that the evidence and the law justified triggering \n     the Independent Counsel Statute. I and Director Freeh check \n     with them regularly to insure they have adequate resources.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       As I stated then, the fact that we don't trigger a \n     preliminary investigation under the Act does not mean we are \n     not investigating a matter. We are fully prepared to trigger \n     the Independent Counsel Act and pursue any evidence that a \n     covered person committed a crime, if any should arise in the \n     course of our investigation. We continue to investigate every \n     transaction brought to our attention. We will not close the \n     investigation of a matter without Director Freeh and I \n     signing off on its closure.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, keep in mind that was last year, when the \ncampaign investigation was going, and going very strongly. She had this \nto say concerning the investigation. She was talking about the \ninvestigators:\n\n       Since they've begun their work, I have met with them \n     regularly to hear what they found and ask them questions. I \n     check on their progress several times a week discussing with \n     them what evidence they have found and how they are \n     proceeding. Most important of all, I told them from the start \n     that they are to contact me immediately if they ever believe \n     that evidence and law justify triggering the independent \n     counsel statute. I and Director Freeh check with them \n     regularly to ensure they have adequate resources.\n\n  Later in her statement:\n\n       As I stated then, the fact that we don't trigger a \n     preliminary investigation under the act does not mean we are \n     not investigating the matter. We are fully prepared to \n     trigger the Independent Counsel Act and pursue any evidence \n     that a covered person committed a crime if any should arise \n     in the course of our investigation. We continue to \n     investigate every transaction brought to our attention. We \n     will not close the investigation of a matter without Director \n     Freeh and I signing on its closure.\n\n  She made a commitment that basically the major decisions would be \nmade by the Attorney General and the FBI Director, former Federal \njudge, Mr. Freeh. I mention that because evidently Mr. Freeh made a \ndetailed report, evidently a 27-page report, to the Attorney General in \nNovember of 1997 calling for an independent counsel. I am not inserting \nthat report in the Record. I am going to read a couple of excerpts that \nSenator Thompson made before the Judiciary Committee, where Attorney \nGeneral Reno testified on July 15 of this year, where he outlined \nseveral things that were in Director Freeh's memo.\n  I will be very quick and maybe I will insert several pages of this in \nthe Record. This is Senator Thompson talking about Director Freeh's \ninvestigation. He pointed out that the FBI's\n\n[[Page S9537]]\n\ninvestigation has led them to the highest levels of the White House, \nincluding the Vice President and the President, and that the Department \nof Justice must look at the independent counsel statute. He pointed out \nthere are two sections; one is a mandatory section where the Attorney \nGeneral is required to appoint, and another one is a discretionary \nsection. The ultimate conclusion by Mr. Freeh is that the statute \nshould be triggered under both the mandatory and the discretionary \nprovisions of the statute.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire section of this dialog be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [Mr. Thompson.] On Friday, June 19th Larry Parkinson, the \n     General Counsel of the FBI, presented to Senator Glenn and \n     myself an oral summary of a 27-page legal memorandum that was \n     written in November 1997 from Louis Freeh. You might recall \n     when Mr. Freeh and General Reno were testifying before the \n     House Committee on Governmental Operations, Mr. Freeh \n     declined to present the memo he had recommending the \n     independent counsel, but he agreed to give an oral briefing \n     to the chairman and ranking member of the committee. He did \n     the same thing with regard to our committee. I think that I \n     have a fair summary of what his position was on those matters \n     and I would like to lay that on the record and have some \n     discussion about it if we have time.\n       Basically, Mr. Freeh's memo is in seven sections. In the \n     first section, he deals with the purpose of the independent \n     counsel statute and points that it was to ensure fairness and \n     impartiality in an administration's investigation of its own \n     top officials, and highlights several reasons for the \n     enactment of the statute. The top three listed were the \n     Department of Justice difficulty in investigating a high-\n     level official; secondly, the difficulty in investigating a \n     superior. And, third, even the appearance of a conflict of \n     interest is dangerous.\n       He pointed out that their investigation, the FBI's \n     investigation, had led them to the highest levels of the \n     White House, including the Vice President and the President, \n     and therefore the Department of Justice must look at the \n     independent counsel statute. He pointed out there are two \n     sections. One is a mandatory section where the Attorney \n     General is required to appoint, and another one is a \n     discretionary section.\n       The ultimate conclusion by Mr. Freeh is that the statute \n     should be triggered under both the mandatory and the \n     discretionary provisions of the statute, and then he goes in \n     some detail to state why. He points out that there are \n     unprecedented legal issues. There has been a lot of \n     discussion as to whether or not soft money contributions that \n     are totally coordinated out of the White House were legal or \n     illegal, for example.\n       The memorandum points out the legislative history. And, of \n     course, lest we forget, Director Freeh is a former Federal \n     judge as he opines on these matters. He points out the \n     congressional intent was that where there were \n     unprecedented legal issues or differences in legal opinion \n     that an independent counsel is to be sought. That was his \n     interpretation of the clear legislative history.\n       He discussed in some detail Vice President Gore's telephone \n     solicitations, the President's telephone solicitations, the \n     need for the independent counsel in both cases. And it was \n     the Director's ultimate conclusion that it should be referred \n     to appointment of an independent counsel as part of a broader \n     scheme to circumvent campaign finance law under either the \n     mandatory or the discretionary provisions of the statute. He \n     held the same conclusion with regard to the White House \n     coffees, the overnights, and the other perks.\n       He also says that with regard to soliciting contributions \n     from foreigners, nevertheless, there is an additional \n     question of whether DOJ should be resolving these issues. The \n     legislative history is such that the Department of Justice is \n     not to undertake an elaborate legal analysis when a covered \n     person is involved, a legal analysis with regard to the \n     questions of law that we mentioned before.\n       Then he refers to the discretionary provision. After having \n     decided on all counts, on all instances of matters in \n     controversy, that it called for the activation of the \n     mandatory portion of the independent counsel law, he then \n     turned to the discretionary portion of the law. And I think \n     this is an accurate quotation from the briefing that we got, \n     quote, ``It is difficult to imagine a more compelling \n     situation for appointing an independent counsel,'' as he \n     discussed the reasons that caused him to reach that \n     conclusion.\n       He said, for several reasons. He said, first, is the fact \n     that the Department of Justice investigating the President \n     and the Vice President. The independent counsel statute is \n     based on the fact that it is a conflict for the Attorney \n     General to investigate her superiors. Secondly, Director \n     Freeh said that the cumulative effect of all of the \n     fundraising-related investigations going on should activate \n     the discretionary provision of the statute.\n       Thirdly, he said the Department of Justice is investigating \n     other persons in addition to covered persons who, because of \n     the nature of their relationship with the President and the \n     Vice President, give the appearance of a conflict of \n     interest. In other words, when someone who is being \n     investigated and in one case has already been indicted who \n     was in the White House 49 times, that although that person is \n     not covered, he is a close associate of covered people. And \n     if you are trying to get information from someone you have \n     just indicted, or you are in negotiations with regard to plea \n     bargaining or immunity or any of those other instances, how \n     can you do that effectively when the answers that he may give \n     may have to do with the covered person, who is the Attorney \n     General's superior?\n       Fourth, the independent counsel statute arose from \n     Watergate and thus has a unique relationship to the campaign \n     finance laws. In other words, the Attorney General--according \n     to his reading of the legislative history of this, there is a \n     unique relationship between the independent counsel law and \n     campaign finance laws, which is, of course, what we are \n     dealing with.\n       Lastly, the section provides factual information about in \n     comparison to the Attorney General's previous discretionary \n     appointments. In other words, there are many instances where \n     the Attorney General has activated or relied upon the \n     discretionary provision of the law. He discussed Filegate, \n     discussed Whitewater, discussed Mr. Nusbaum's situation.\n       In Whitewater, the Attorney General invoked the \n     discretionary provisions because of a political conflict of \n     interest from McDougal and others who were close to the \n     President. Nusbaum was a former senior member of the White \n     House staff, although not a covered person, who also had a \n     close relationship with the President. It is consistent with \n     those precedents to treat this investigation as a \n     discretionary independent counsel matter as well.\n       The Director also points out the fact that it is the FBI \n     and the DOJ's obligation to keep the President informed on \n     national security information while investigating those same \n     issues. And, also, as he says, simply the appearance or \n     public perception of a conflict can invoke the discretionary \n     clause. It is absolutely essential for the public to have \n     confidence in its investigators and this is consistent, of \n     course, with the Attorney General's confirmation testimony.\n       Director Freeh also says that contrary to her testimony \n     before the Senate, Attorney General Reno replied to Senator \n     Hatch that she had to actual conflict instead of the \n     appearance of a conflict. Director Freeh says the 1994 \n     Congress rejected a DOJ proposal that the Attorney General \n     would have a relevant conflict of interest only with a matter \n     rather than a person as the standard for invoking the \n     statute. And he concludes the Attorney General can consider \n     appearance as well as actual conflict that might weaken \n     public confidence.\n       According to the memorandum, it makes no sense for \n     appearance to be relevant for covered persons, but not for \n     the discretionary provision, since conflict is presumed for \n     covered persons and appearance is more relevant to non-\n     covered persons.\n       Lastly, Director Freeh points out as a reason for invoking \n     the discretionary provision of the independent counsel law \n     that the Attorney General's chief investigator has concluded \n     that there is a political conflict of interest. This does not \n     change the fact that the Attorney General makes the final \n     decision, but in Director Freeh's view, it should be pursued \n     under the discretionary clause.\n       So here we have a really remarkable and unprecedented \n     situation where you have been investigating matters \n     concerning covered people at the highest levels. You have \n     been investigating matters concerning people who are not \n     covered people, but are close associates of covered people \n     who have had very extensive visitations to the White House.\n       You have, at best, a mixed interpretation of the law \n     concerning campaign finance. No one thought up until this \n     last Presidential election, for example, that a President or \n     a Presidential candidate could take public money, certify \n     that that is all he would spend, and then go get on the phone \n     and raise unprecedented amounts of soft money which he \n     coordinated out of the White House. No one thought they could \n     do that up until your interpretation, and now we are seeing, \n     in Ohio, I think both the Democratic and Republican Party are \n     in court saying there are no limitations anymore because of \n     this. Their position is even foreign money, under the \n     Attorney General's interpretation, cannot be regulated \n     because it is soft money and soft money is not regulated.\n       In addition, you have had a troubled investigation from the \n     start in which you have made changes, I think, to the \n     benefit--now, Mr. LaBella, who came in, also recommends an \n     independent counsel, and now he is leaving. Now, you have the \n     Director of the FBI, who is the chief investigator, saying \n     from his investigation we should have an independent counsel. \n     And yet we don't have that acted upon by the Attorney \n     General.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. He discussed in detail Vice President Gore's telephone \nconversations, the President's telephone solicitations, the need for \nindependent counsel in both cases.\n  It is the Director's ultimate conclusion it should be referred to an \nappointment of an independent counsel as part of a broader scheme to \ncircumvent campaign finance law under either the\n\n[[Page S9538]]\n\nmandatory or the discretionary provisions of the statute. He held the \nsame conclusion with regard to White House coffees, the overnights, and \nother perks, and that would include Air Force One.\n  He also talks about the scheme to evade the law. When the President \nagrees to take public funding of a Presidential campaign, he says: Here \nis how much money we are going to raise and spend. Clearly, the White \nHouse, and Mr. Harold Ickes and other people, tried to circumvent the \nlaw and say: We are going to raise lots and lots of money, the White \nHouse will do it, and we will basically get around these limits. \nDirector Freeh obviously thinks that should be investigated and may \nwell think it should be investigated for both parties. I am not making \nany aspersions. I am just saying that we should have an independent \ncounsel.\n  If Director Freeh has studied this as long as he has--he is the chief \ninvestigative officer of the country as head of the FBI--if it is his \nstrong conclusion, with a 27-page memo, that we should have an \nindependent counsel, then we should have an independent counsel. He \ngave that memo evidently in November of last year, and the Attorney \nGeneral has yet to appoint an independent counsel.\n  I could go on. I have already inserted most of this into the Record. \nI will skip and just make the comment that if you have the Director of \nthe FBI--I think his concluding comment, and I will quote this from \nSenator Thompson's statement:\n\n       It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for \n     appointing an independent counsel.\n\n  That is from Director Freeh. That is not a partisan Republican. That \nis from a former Federal judge who is now Director of the FBI, who made \nthat analysis after conducting a very extensive investigation. He says \nwe need an independent counsel. I think the Attorney General should \nfollow his advice.\n  Now we have, evidently, the chief investigator that the Attorney \nGeneral appointed in the Justice Department making the same \nrecommendation. Again, I haven't read his memo. Evidently, he just \nissued a memo--this is prosecutor Charles La Bella. This is according \nto news reports. I will insert this in the Record. This is July 23, \n1998--recently--written by David Johnson. It says:\n\n       Prosecutor Charles La Bella delivered a report to Reno last \n     Thursday as he prepared to return to San Diego this week to \n     take over as interim U.S. attorney. La Bella has marked his \n     department by challenging her to replace him with an outside \n     counsel.\n\n  I will read one section:\n\n       But he contends only that their fundraising activities \n     warrant outside investigation, and in the legal analysis La \n     Bella concluded that Reno misinterpreted the law, creating an \n     artificially high standard to avoid invoking the independent \n     counsel statute.\n\n  It also goes on in the article to say that, last fall, La Bella urged \nher to seek appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \nfundraising telephone calls by President Clinton and Vice President \nGore but she rejected that recommendation. In summary, La Bella \nconcluded there was sufficient information to warrant appointment based \non mandatory and discretionary provisions in the independent counsel \nstatute, meaning he found enough specific information to justify \noutside investigation of high officials. He found that the Justice \nDepartment could not objectively investigate them on his own, the \nofficial said.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 23, 1998]\n\n    Campaign Investigator Urges Reno to Name Independent Prosecutor\n\n                          (By David Johnston)\n\n       Washington.--After a 10-month inquiry, the departing chief \n     of the Justice Department's campaign finance unit has \n     concluded in a confidential report to Attorney General Janet \n     Reno that she has no alternative but to seek an independent \n     prosecutor to investigate political fund-raising abuses \n     during President Clinton's re-election campaign, government \n     officials said Wednesday.\n       The prosecutor, Charles La Bella, delivered the report to \n     Reno last Thursday as he prepared to return to San Diego this \n     week to take over as interim U.S. attorney. In effect, after \n     being chosen by Reno to revive an investigation that she had \n     been criticized for neglecting, La Bella has marked his \n     departure by challenging her to replace him with an outside \n     counsel.\n       La Bella's report does not suggest that prosecutors are \n     ready, or even close, to bringing a case against any top \n     Democrats or administration officials, but contends only that \n     their fund-raising activities warrant outside investigation. \n     And in a legal analysis, La Bella concluded that Reno had \n     misinterpreted the law creating an artificially high standard \n     to avoid invoking the independent counsel statute, officials \n     said.\n       La Bella's conclusions, coming from a seasoned federal \n     prosecutor with full access to all grand jury evidence in the \n     case, represents a serious internal fracture within the \n     Justice Department. And the report seemed certain to provide \n     Republicans with considerable leverage to intensify their \n     demands that Reno step aside and let an outside prosecutor \n     take over.\n       So far, she has refused to budge in her refusal to refer \n     the case to outside counsel, and Wednesday there was no \n     indication that Reno seemed likely to reconsider her \n     position. Last fall, La Bella had urged her to seek the \n     appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate fund-\n     raising telephone calls by Clinton and Vice President Al \n     Gore. But she rejected that recommendation.\n       Reno has said she carefully weighed the facts and the law \n     before determining that the appointment of an independent \n     prosecutor was not justified under the independent counsel \n     law. She has defiantly blocked the appointment even in the \n     face of a recommendation last fall from FBI Director Louis \n     Freeh, who urged her to seek an independent counsel.\n       Her unwillingness to seek the appointment has exasperated \n     Republicans in Congress who have accused the Justice \n     Department of a politically motivated effort to subvert the \n     independent counsel law to protect upper level Democratic \n     Party and White House officials from searching scrutiny.\n       The report follows a tempestuous hearing last week, in \n     which she faced withering questions by senators on the \n     Judiciary Committee. Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who led \n     Senate campaign finance hearings last year, confronted Reno \n     by quoting a confidential memo that Freeh sent to Reno in \n     November 1997. He quoted Freeh has concluded, ``It is \n     difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for \n     appointing an independent counsel.''\n       Justice Department officials said Wednesday that Reno and \n     Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder had received the report \n     and were reviewing it. But they would not discuss specifics. \n     La Bella would not discuss the report.\n       Labella's report has been guarded closely. He produced only \n     two copies, the officials said. He gave one copy to Reno and \n     sent another to the home of Freeh, an ally whose top agent on \n     the case, James Desarno, approved Labella's findings.\n       Tuesday, Reno assembled several of her top advisers to \n     discuss the report, but they apparently reached no \n     conclusions about how or whether to respond. She has already \n     named a successor to La Bella. He is David Vicinanzo, a \n     prosecutor from New Hampshire.\n       The report casts possible new light on La Bella's decision \n     on leaving his job as the top campaign finance prosecutor, \n     suggesting that he could be stepping down in the middle of \n     the inquiry because he believed that the case should not be \n     handled by the Justice Department but by an outside \n     prosecutor.\n       So far, the campaign finance inquiry has produced only \n     several low-level fund-raisers. But there has been no \n     indication that the inquiry was likely to move up the chain \n     of command at the Democratic National Committee or the White \n     House.\n       In his report, the officials said, La Bella concluded that \n     there was sufficient information to warrant the appointment \n     based on the mandatory and discretionary provisions of the \n     independent counsel statute, meaning that he found enough \n     specific information to justify an outside investigation of \n     high-level officials. Moreover, he found that the Justice \n     Department could not objectively investigate them on its own, \n     the officials said.\n       Still, it was not clear whether La Bella recommended \n     whether an independent prosecutor should be named to \n     investigate specific officials although he assessed the \n     activities of several senior officials, including Clinton and \n     Gore and others like Harold Ickes, a former deputy chief of \n     staff, who played an important role in supervising the \n     campaign from the White House.\n       The report also suggests that an independent prosecutor \n     should examine how the Democrats and Republicans used party \n     funds to pay a massive blitz of television ads that were \n     thinly veiled election messages for Clinton and Republican \n     nominee Bob Dole.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have the House Judiciary Committee, we \nhave the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee all saying we should have an independent counsel. That was \nall done last year. We have the head of the FBI saying we should have \nan independent counsel, and we have the special prosecutor, brought in \nby Attorney General Reno herself to head up the investigation, saying \nwe should have an independent counsel. They all came to the same \nconclusion that there was enough campaign abuse or alleged violations \nof the law that we should have\n\n[[Page S9539]]\n\nan independent counsel to avoid the conflict of interest to investigate \nthis matter further.\n  It is unanimous, with one exception--Attorney General Reno. In her \ncomments, following Mr. La Bella's remarks, since that was made public, \nshe says, ``Well, we want to discuss this with all of our attorneys. He \nwas just one attorney.'' He was the lead attorney. He was the chief \ninvestigator. And Director Freeh is not just an attorney, he happens to \nbe the Director of the FBI. And if he issued a 27-page report calling \nfor an independent counsel, I think she should adhere to it.\n  I am bothered by the fact that if we had the chief law enforcement \nofficer of the country not enforcing the law, not listening to the \nrecommendations of her chief investigator, Mr. La Bella, not following \nthe recommendations of the Director of the FBI, then I do not think she \nis enforcing the law. And that bothers me.\n  So, Mr. President, it is with some regret--I do not do this very \noften--but I think if Attorney General Reno does not appoint a special \ncounsel under the independent counsel statute to investigate campaign \nabuses by this administration, I think she should resign. I do not \nthink she is doing her job. I think she is involved in more of a \ncoverup of the President's activities or the White House's activities \nthan she is enforcing the law.\n  I hope she will change her mind. I hope she will review the memo that \nDirector Freeh and Mr. La Bella have given her and follow their advice. \nThose two individuals are not partisan Republicans. They are not the \nchairman of the Republican Judiciary Committee or the House Judiciary \nCommittee or they are not Senator Thompson or other members on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. They are appointees by this \nadministration. I give them great credibility. I hope that she will \nfollow their advice. Mr. President----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will my distinguished colleague----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am almost finished.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that three editorials be \nprinted in the Record, one of which is dated July 21, a New York Times \neditorial. The headline of it is ``Reno Flunks Law School.'' And just \nthe last line says:\n\n       Ms. Reno didn't get it. She comes not to expose political \n     corruption, but to bury it.\n\n  There is also a New York Times editorial from July 23 that says--I \nwill just read this one paragraph----\n\n       The two people in the American Government who know most \n     about this case--the lead prosecutor and the top investigator \n     --are convinced that the trail of potentially illegal money \n     leads so clearly toward the White House that Ms. Reno cannot, \n     under Federal law, be allowed to supervise the investigation \n     of her own boss. When it comes to campaign law, this is the \n     most serious moment since Watergate.\n\n  I ask consent that one additional editorial be printed in the Record. \nI will just read one paragraph. This is an editorial, dated July 27, \nfrom the Washington Times. It says:\n\n       Like Mr. Freeh, Mr. La Bella has concluded that his \n     investigation has satisfied both the provisions of the \n     independent counsel law. Both have concluded that it is a \n     conflict of interest for Ms. Reno to investigate these \n     matters. Mr. La Bella also joined Mr. Freeh in concluding \n     that Ms. Reno--for that matter, Mr. Radek--have \n     misinterpreted the statute by establishing too high of a \n     standard for the implementation of the independent counsel \n     statute. FBI agent James Desarno, who was named to the task \n     force as the highest ranking agent at the time Mr. La Bella \n     was appointed, has also concurred with the recommendation for \n     the independent counsel.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 21, 1998]\n\n                         Reno Flunks Law School\n\n       By studying the transcript of last week's Senate Judiciary \n     Committee hearing, it is possible to reconstruct one of the \n     more remarkable internal documents of the Clinton \n     administration. That is the tightly reasoned, 27-page legal \n     memorandum in which Louis Freeh, the director of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, told Attorney General Janet Reno \n     that she was failing in her duty to appoint an independent \n     counsel to investigate President Clinton's fund-raising.\n       Republicans (believe) Ms. Reno is allowing the Justice \n     Department's investigation of foreign contributions and \n     Chinese government meddling in the 1996 election to crumble.\n       That accounts for Senator Orrin Hatch's by-the-numbers tone \n     in lecturing Ms. Reno last week. ``You have conflicts of \n     interest. There may have been crimes committed,'' he said. \n     ``And that's why the independent counsel statute was passed \n     to begin with, and that is to take it out of your hands, so \n     you don't have to be accused of conflict of interest.''\n       Ms. Reno didn't get it. She comes not to expose political \n     corruption, but to bury it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 23, 1998]\n\n                          The Firestorm Cometh\n\n       Charles La Bella, who has been leading the Justice \n     Department's campaign finance investigation, has now advised \n     Attorney General Janet Reno that under both the mandatory and \n     discretionary provisions of the Independent Counsel Act she \n     must appoint an outside prosecutor to take over his inquiry. \n     The other important figure of this investigation, Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh, has already \n     recommended an independent counsel. Ms. Reno can give her \n     usual runaround about being hard-headed, but she cannot hide \n     from the meaning of this development.\n       The two people in the American Government who know most \n     about this case--the lead prosecutor and top investigator--\n     are convinced that the trail of potentially illegal money \n     leads so clearly toward the White House that Ms. Reno cannot, \n     under Federal law, be allowed to supervise the investigation \n     of her own boss. When it comes to campaign law, this is the \n     most serious moment since Watergate.\n       These are not the judgments of rebel subordinates or hot-\n     headed junior staff members. Mr. Freeh, a former Federal \n     judge, has been if anything too loyal to Ms. Reno during the \n     nine long months that she has ignored his advice. Mr. La \n     Bella was hand-picked by Ms. Reno on the basis of experience \n     and skill to run this investigation. Either she has to come \n     forward and make the impossible argument that they are \n     incompetent or bow to the law's requirements.\n       Ms. Reno may grumble about leaks of supposedly confidential \n     advice. But the fact is that the American people need to know \n     that two top law enforcement officers believe the Attorney \n     General is derelict. Moreover, Mr. Freeh and Mr. La Bella are \n     right to separate themselves from Ms. Reno, because if her \n     attempt to protect Presidential fund-raising from \n     investigation continues, it will go down as a blot against \n     Justice every bit as enduring as J. Edgar Hoover's privacy \n     abuses. Firestorm is an overused word in Congress, but if Ms. \n     Reno does not make the appointment, the Republican Senate \n     leadership ought to ignite one--today.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 27, 1998]\n\n                        Charles La Bella Speaks\n\n       When Attorney General Janet Reno beseeched federal \n     prosecutor Charles La Bella last September to come to \n     Washington to rescue her department's clueless investigation \n     of campaign-finance abuses during the 1996 election, her \n     request was clearly an act of desperation.\n       Rather than seek an independent counsel to replace her \n     department's demonstrably incompetent task force, Miss Reno \n     convinced Mr. La Bella to lend his considerable credibility \n     to the task force, which had been thoroughly politicized by \n     its leader, Lee Radek, chief of the Justice Department's \n     Public Integrity Section. By the time Mr. La Bella arrived, \n     the FBI agents assigned to the task force had been bitterly \n     complaining for months about the snail-like pace, believing \n     Mr. Radek was far more interested in controlling the \n     investigation than advancing it. Mr. Radek, of course, had \n     been intensely, and successfully, lobbying Miss Reno against \n     seeking an independent counsel.\n       It didn't take Mr. La Bella long to conclude that Mr. \n     Radek's arguments against naming an independent counsel \n     amounted to ``pablum.'' Last November, both he and FBI \n     Director Louis B. Freeh advised Miss Reno to seek the \n     appointment of an independent counsel to investigate charges \n     that President Clinton and Vice President Gore had made \n     illegal fund-raising calls from the White House. In a \n     confidential 27-page legal memo to the attorney general, Mr. \n     Freeh concluded, ``It is difficult to imagine a more \n     compelling situation for the appointment of an independent \n     counsel,'' arguing that the investigation had satisfied both \n     the discretionary and the mandatory options governing such an \n     appointment. Siding yet again with Mr. Radek, Miss Reno \n     rejected the advice of Messrs. Freeh and La Bella last fall.\n       Mr. La Bella is now returning to San Diego, where he will \n     become interim U.S. attorney, an appointment he received from \n     Miss Reno. On July 16, he filed his final report, and it was \n     revealed late last week that Mr. La Bella once again strongly \n     recommended that Miss Reno seek an independent counsel. Like \n     Mr. Freeh, Mr. La Bella has concluded that his investigation \n     has satisfied both the provisions of the independent-counsel \n     law. Both have concluded that it is a conflict of interest \n     for Miss Reno to investigate these matters. Mr. La Bella also \n     joined Mr. Freeh in concluding that Miss Reno and, for that \n     matter, Mr. Radek, have misinterpreted the statute by \n     establishing too high a standard for the implementation of \n     the independent-counsel statute. FBI agent James Desarno, who \n     was named to the task force as the highest-ranking agent at \n     the same time Mr. La Bella was appointed, has also concurred \n     with the recommendation for an independent counsel.\n       Given that Mr. La Bella was Miss Reno's hand-picked \n     prosecutor to lead her department's faltering investigation, \n     his views\n\n[[Page S9540]]\n\n     ought to carry great weight, as, of course, should those of \n     FBI Director Freeh. But Miss Reno has already displayed her \n     trademark obstinacy and has failed to act in the 11 days she \n     has had the benefit of Mr. La Bella's latest recommendation.\n       The Justice Department frequently reminds us that Miss Reno \n     has sought more independent counsels than any previous \n     attorney general. But it's worth recalling that she \n     steadfastly refused to name an independent counsel to \n     investigate Whitewater until after President Clinton \n     instructed her to do so. And Kenneth Starr was appointed by a \n     special three-judge panel, which rejected Miss Reno's \n     recommendation that a more pliable, less independent \n     prosecutor be reappointed.\n       By seeking independent counsels to investigate matters far \n     less important than the massive campaign corruption that \n     subverted the democratic process, Miss Reno has conveniently \n     built a defense against having to seek an appointment that \n     actually threatens the president. It's a brilliant tactic, \n     but she cannot be allowed to get away with it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that his time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chair. I now believe I have inserted in the \nRecord all the subsequent statements that I have, including Attorney \nGeneral Reno's statement before the Judiciary Committee, or at least \nexcerpts of that.\n  I thank my friend and colleague. I also thank my colleague from West \nVirginia for his patience and courtesy, that he always extends. I \nappreciate that.\n  To my colleague from Pennsylvania, my time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. For a question--I know the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia is waiting. I will be just a moment or two.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be happy to wait.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate that very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My question, I say to Senator Nickles, relates to the \nconsequences of a resignation. I commend you for the statement which \nyou have just made. I have joined others in the call for an independent \ncounsel. And, in fact, when questioning Attorney General Reno on July \n15 of this year--2 weeks ago on Wednesday--I asked her about specific \ncases and had an extensive chart which showed the justification for an \nindependent counsel.\n  Then, because of the limitation of time, I mentioned only two cases, \none where a memorandum had come from the Democratic National Committee \nto the White House identifying five people who were identified as being \ngood for $100,000 each. The President initialed it. The Democratic \nNational Committee called for a coffee. It was held in the Oval Office. \nWithin a few days thereafter, four of the five contributed $100,000--\nspecific and credible evidence. And the Attorney General responded she \nwould get back to me, which I said surprised me because it was a well-\nknown matter.\n  The second matter that I called to her attention--of only two because \nof the limitation of time--involved John Huang, where the photograph \nappeared and Carl Jackson, formerly of the NSC, National Security \nStaff, commented that Huang, in the presence of the President in the \nWhite House had said ``Elections are expensive, and we expect people to \ncontribute.'' I have pressed for a mandamus act which I will not \ndiscuss now. I have on prior occasions.\n  The question that I have for my distinguished colleague from \nOklahoma--and I thank my colleague from West Virginia--is, What will be \naccomplished with a resignation? Is there any expectation that the \nPresident will appoint somebody who will be tougher on the campaign \nirregularities in which he is so deeply involved, at least by \nallegation? Wouldn't the better course be to move on the legal front, \nrecognizing that it is a very tough case, candidly, an uphill fight--a \nlong shot, in common parlance--contrasted with the resignation where we \nare going to have a lengthy delay before a nomination is made--\nconfirmation hearings--familiarity would be a matter of months--before \na substitute attorney general would be in a position to respond to this \nissue about appointment of an independent counsel?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the question by my friend and colleague. As \nI stated in my statement, one, I hope--I prefaced, I said if she does \nnot appoint, if she does not appoint an independent counsel, then I \nthink she should resign. And it is my hope that she will follow the \nwisdom of Director Freeh and Mr. La Bella, follow their advice and \nappoint an independent counsel. I hope she will enforce the law.\n  As my colleague from Pennsylvania is aware, I think the law is very \nclear. The one you mentioned with the coffees, the statute says: It \nshall be unlawful for any person to solicit or receive any contribution \nin a Federal building. The statute is pretty clear. It just has not \nbeen enforced.\n  I appreciate your statement. I think if she resigned--whoever is \nacting--before any person would be confirmed by the Senate, we would \ntry to have a very clear understanding that the law would be enforced.\n  I would also mention--you mentioned John Huang. John Huang was in the \nWhite House 164 times. That is a lot of visits for a person who was \nprimarily a fundraiser. I think clearly the law was abused; campaign \nabuses were very flagrant. And the law should be enforced.\n  Hopefully, the Attorney General will take heed of the advice that the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, the House Judiciary Committee, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the investigative committee in the \nHouse, and as well as the FBI Director and her chief prosecutor, Mr. La \nBella, have given, and follow that advice with the appointment of an \nindependent counsel. I think it would help relieve her of a lot of \ncriticism. And I think it would be the right thing to do. I think it \nwould be enforcing the laws as the law is written.\n  Mr. President, I again thank my colleague from West Virginia for his \ncourtesy and also for his patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized for 25 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9536-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9540-S9541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MILITARY RELATIONSHIPS: NEW MARCHING ORDERS FROM THE PENTAGON\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week, I took the Senate floor to call \nattention to reports that the Secretary of Defense was prepared to \noffer a proposal that would ease the penalties for adultery in the \nmilitary. The report set off alarm bells in my own mind because moral \nresponsibility in the military cannot be compromised without \nundermining the core values of the services --values such as honor, \nintegrity, and loyalty.\n  As a result of my remarks, Secretary Cohen called me at home on \nSunday--I believe it was Sunday--to assure me that he had no intention \nof watering down the Defense Department's policies concerning adultery \nand fraternization. In fact, he said, the new rules he was considering \nwould strengthen those policies.\n  I appreciate the seriousness with which Secretary Cohen views this \nmatter, and I applaud his efforts to come to grips with policies that \nhave precipitated uneven treatment of military personnel and have \nresulted in morale-damaging charges of double standards.\n  The proposed new Pentagon policies were announced earlier this week, \nand I commend Secretary Cohen for upholding the military code of \njustice and resisting pressure to reduce the penalties for adultery. I \nwish I could have confidence that the new policies are sufficient and \nwill fulfill Secretary Cohen's intent of ensuring even-handed treatment \nof adultery in the military. Unfortunately, I fear that the new \npolicies fall short of the mark in that respect. Moreover, I fear that \nthese new guidelines send conflicting signals to commanders in the \nfield: Yes, on the one hand, adultery is still a crime in the military; \nbut no, on the other hand, it will not be criminally prosecuted unless \nit is so flagrant that it disrupts or discredits the military.\n  I fear that some could read into these guidelines a message to the \ntroops that lying and cheating are okay as long as you don't get \ncaught. I do not for a moment believe that that is the message the \nDefense Department intends to communicate.\n  The stated intent of the new policies is to standardize good order \nand discipline policies among the Services, and to clarify guidance on \nthe offense of adultery under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In \nthe case of fraternization, the new guidelines seem clear cut--they \nwill impose a military-wide\n\n[[Page S9541]]\n\nban on fraternization, bringing the Army into line with the \nfraternization policies currently enforced by the Navy, Air Force, and \nyes, the good old Marine Corps.\n  The impact of the guidelines as they apply to the handling of \nadultery cases in the military is where the message gets muddled. The \nnew guidelines, according to the Pentagon, do not change the Uniform \nMilitary Code of Justice. They do not lower the standards of conduct \ndemanded of America's military forces. They do not preclude a court \nmartial or dishonorable discharge for adultery. That's what the \nguidelines don't do. What they do accomplish, in my opinion, is much \nharder to quantify.\n  Under these guidelines, adultery would remain a crime in the \nmilitary, but it would only be criminally prosecuted if it brought \ndiscredit to the military or disrupted the good order and discipline of \nthe armed services. That caveat, while currently an element of proof of \nthe offense of adultery under the Uniform Military Code of Justice, is \ngiven added weight and emphasis under the new guidelines.\n  Now, I have been accused, from time to time, of being old-fashioned, \nstrait-laced, and of wearing 19th century clothes and a stickler for \nthe rules and a stickler for propriety. I plead guilty on all counts, \nother than the 19th century business with respect to my clothing, but I \ndo not believe that one has to be old-fashioned to recognize that \nadultery is a dishonorable act that intrinsically brings discredit to \nthe offending party and, in the case of the military, to the uniform \nthat he or she wears. I do not believe that honor and integrity \nanywhere, especially in the military, have ever gone out of fashion. \nAnd I do not believe that one has to be strait-laced to recognize that \nlying, cheating, and deceiving--all elements of adultery--intrinsically \nsubvert good order and discipline.\n  Yet it seems to me that these guidelines shift the emphasis of \nadultery in the military from the crime to the consequences. Rather \nthan clarifying the offense of adultery, it seems to me that these \nguidelines confuse the issue. What constitutes ``discredit to the armed \nforces'' if not a crime--and adultery is a crime in the military? What \nconstitutes the disruption of ``good order and discipline'' if not \nlying, cheating, and deceiving in the commission of a crime?\n  Honor, integrity, and decency are universal values and principles. \nThey are absolute. They do not fade with the passing of time or cease \nto matter behind closed doors. When a person takes an oath before God \nand country, as the military do, that oath is taken without \nqualification or reservation. It is not limited by time or place or who \nknows about it.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Secretary Cohen is dedicated to \nmaintaining the high standards of the United States military. I know \nthat he has put a great deal of time, thought, and effort into \nrestoring consistency to the application of the military code of \nconduct. I commend him for his efforts, and I urge him to continue \nworking on this extremely important and sensitive aspect of military \nservice.\n  The men and women who serve in the United States military are \nremarkable individuals. They willingly endure the hardships that \nmilitary life imposes on them and their families. They willingly \nsacrifice personal freedoms for the good of the nation. They willingly \ntake an oath to preserve, protect, and defend this great nation, with \ntheir lives if necessary.\n  For the life of me, I cannot square that level of total commitment \nwith official guidelines whose recommended remedies for the crime of \nadultery include ``counseling'' or ``an adverse fitness report.''\n  I cannot square the core values of the United States military with a \nguidance regarding adultery that appears to encourage commanding \nofficers to overlook the crime of adultery if it is ``remote in time.''\n  Mr. President, how remote is remote? What kind of clarity does that \nguidance impart? Is last month remote enough in time to avoid a \ncriminal prosecution for adultery? How about last week--is that enough?\n  Last month? Last year? Would this ``clarification'' have salvaged Air \nForce General Joseph Ralston's nomination to be Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff? Would this guideline let Army Major General David Hale \noff the hook for abruptly retiring while he was under investigation for \nalleged sexual misconduct?\n  Is discretion what we are really talking about here? Do these \nguidelines send a signal to our troops that the crime of adultery is \nnot really that bad as long as you are discrete and don't disrupt your \nunit? Are we giving a whole new meaning to the sentiment, ``The better \npart of valor is discretion''?\n  I do not for a moment believe that this is Secretary Cohen's intent. \nI do not for a moment believe that our Nation's military leadership \nwishes to erode the standards of conduct for the military. But I do \nexpress a warning that these guidelines, well-intentioned though they \nmay be, will not solve any problems. These guidelines will not erase \nthe perception that the military applies a double standard to senior \nofficers and enlisted personnel. And most important, these guidelines \nwill not strengthen the necessary trust and cohesiveness that help to \nmake America's military forces the finest in the world--we think.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a picture of a gentleman, \nWalter Samuelson. Walter Samuelson was 60 years old when he died \nFebruary 1, 1992, as a consequence of a heart attack from complications \nhe suffered in February of that year. Because of the weather in King \nCove, AK, Samuelson waited 3 days after his heart attack before he \ncould be removed out of King Cove to a hospital in Anchorage. By that \ntime, his heart had been so severely damaged he eventually had to have \na heart transplant. The Samuelson family believes that had Walter been \nable to get out of the village of King Cove a little earlier, he would \nnot have had the major complications that led to his heart transplant.\n  Mr. Samuelson was born and raised in King Cove, AK. He served in the \nmilitary in the Korean war. He was a fisherman all his life, fishing \nwith his father and brothers while growing up. And after serving in the \nmilitary, he moved to Sitka and married. He and his wife, Freda, had \nfour boys. During the summer, he would fly his plane 1,000 miles back \nto King Cove where his boat was and where he could continue his \nlivelihood, fishing for salmon. He later moved back to King Cove to \nlive and later remarried. He and his second wife, Tanna, had two more \nchildren.\n  Mr. Samuelson was a dedicated patron of the school in King Cove and \ndevoted much of his time and effort there, so much so that he was \nhonored in the dedication of the school's yearbook to him as ``a great \nfriend of King Cove schools,'' an honor which he certainly cherished.\n  He is survived by his wife Tanna and children: Carl, Walter, Jr., \nCharles, John, Axel, and Tanna. His surviving brothers and sisters are: \nAnna Poe, Marion Walker, Thelma Hutton, Christine Christiansen, and \nAlex, Eugene, John, Frank, and Eric Samuelson.\n  Mr. Samuelson required a heart transplant and died because there is \nno road between King Cove and Cold Bay.\n  We wonder how many more people have to die before we do something \nabout it. Eleven residents have perished in aircraft accidents being \nmedevaced out of King Cove a short distance to Cold Bay, where there is \na year-round crosswind runway, as opposed to the gravel strip in the \nvillage of King Cove, where sometimes the windsock is blowing at \nopposite ends of the runway in opposite directions because of the \nsevere turbulence in what is classified as one of the three worst \nweather areas identified in the world.\n\n  The point is the people of King Cove have an alternative, and that is \na short, 7-mile road connection which would necessitate a gravel road \nof 7 miles on the edge of a wilderness area. The people of King Cove \nare willing to\n\n[[Page S9542]]\n\ngive approximately 700 acres of their land to enlarge the wilderness \nfor access through 7 miles of wilderness. This is being objected to by \nthe Department of Interior and by many of the environmental community.\n  I hope, as we return from our recess, we can reflect on the human \nmerits, so we do not have to address additional obituaries of people \nwho died because of their inability to get medical care and have simple \naccess that every American enjoys with the exception of people in the \nvillage of King Cove, AK.\n  Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to wish you a very \npleasant recess, and the other officials who are here in the Senate \nChamber.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I would like to advise my colleagues \nthat today, as Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nI submitted to both the Democratic and Republican members of that \ncommittee, a chairman's mark specifically on the issue of self-\ndetermination for Puerto Rico. It is certainly a responsibility of my \ncommittee to provide and address the eventual disposition of the status \nof the American citizens in Puerto Rico, and the purpose of the draft \nis to provide them with an opportunity to express their dispositions on \nfuture political aspirations of the choice among commonwealth, \nindependence, or statehood.\n  Also, I advise my colleagues, this is the centennial anniversary of \nPuerto Rico under U.S. sovereignty--100 years that Puerto Rico has been \nunder the U.S. flag. The people of Puerto Rico, as U.S. citizens, have \nbeen in a process of transcending to something that would focus in on \ncertainty. There is a growing effort to try to bring some finality to \nthe disposition of the status of Puerto Rican Americans because they do \nnot participate as other U.S. citizens in the election of \nrepresentation in the House and Senate. As a consequence, many of them \nare looking towards a definitive alternative.\n  We have had hearings. We have listened to individuals from all sides \nof the debate. We have reviewed all testimony. We have had input from \nthree political parties, certainly, as well as the Governor. I have \ndirected the chairman's mark in the hopes that it will provide a brief, \naccurate and neutral definition of the status of the options. The mark \nis drafted to advance the process of self-determination for our fellow \ncitizens of Puerto Rico. It is strictly advisory in its legislation. It \ndoes not mandate introduction of future legislation. It does not \nrequire any fast track.\n  I grew up living in a territory--my State of Alaska. We had taxation \nwithout representation. Many people in the State of Alaska, filing \ntheir income tax returns, used to write in red, ``filed in protest.'' \nIt made them feel a little better. It didn't do any good. But the point \nis these people living in Puerto Rico are entitled to certainty, and it \nis an obligation of the Congress to address a final resolution.\n  I think our committee has a moral and constitutional responsibility \nto address the situation in Puerto Rico, but we don't want to get \ninvolved in the politics of Puerto Rico. That is not our business. I \nknow the Governor intends to call a plebiscite this December. He may or \nmay not choose to use the definitions that we provide him. Whether or \nnot the Senate acts is another story. We have a short time left, but in \nmy view this is an ongoing effort of the committee, a systematic \nprogression. The definitions we have come up with and the structure in \nthe previous bills, either the House bill or the Senate bill, have not \nbeen as neutral as we would have liked and would have involved, I \nthink, more activity in local politics. We have attempted to be more \nobjective.\n  It is my hope the measure that eventually comes out of our committee \nwill provide the Governor language that is accurate and neutral. The \ndraft chairman's mark clarifies citizenship under each option. That was \nvery important, in our conversations with all groups. The \nclassification and clarification of citizenship was very important. \nUnder commonwealth, citizenship provided by statute will continue to do \nso. Under separate sovereignty, citizenship would end. Under Statehood, \ncitizenship is, of course, provided under the Constitution, so there is \nno question about that.\n  Finally, I want to make it clear so long as Puerto Rico remains under \nU.S. sovereignty its residents, of course, will be U.S. citizens. If \nPuerto Rico wants separate sovereignty then, of course, U.S. \ncitizenship would end.\n  I provided members of the Energy Committee a copy of this mark for \ntheir review over the recess. After receiving members' comments, \nmembers of the committee, again, will discuss this matter in September.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, the oath of office taken by the \nPresident of the United States is majestic and simple; as a matter of \nfact, it is eloquent. The President simply swears that he will \nfaithfully execute the office, the highest office of the land, and that \nhe will preserve, protect and defend the United States Constitution.\n  In its enumeration of his duties, the Constitution of the United \nStates directs that the President ``take care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed.'' So the President is directed by the Constitution \nto ``take care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' The core values \nof American self-government are concentrated in the Presidency.\n  Do we expect the President of the United States to be a patriot? Of \ncourse. Not only do we expect that from the structure of our \ngovernment, we have grown to expect it because that has been \nestablished as a precedent by President after President after \nPresident.\n  Do we expect the President to love freedom? To serve the people \nrather than to serve himself? To act with respect for the rule of law? \nTo uphold the idea in America that there are no kings, that the highest \nrank in this culture is the rank of citizen? To put the institution of \nthe Presidency above his own personal interests? I think it is fair to \nsay that all of us would respond to those inquiries with a resounding \n``Yes.'' We do expect that. We have high expectations.\n  Do we expect the President to be truthful? Yes. To keep his solemn \noath of office? Yes. Certainly. These are qualities--the love of \ncountry, the commitment to public service, the obedience and supremacy \nof the law--that we expect in the behavior of the President. He or she \nis to be a national model for honesty, integrity, and respect for the \nlaw.\n  It has been shocking to me that defenders of President Clinton have \nbegun to suggest, however, that such is not the case, that our \naspirations are without foundation, that somehow we are dreaming an \nimpossible dream to think that the President would be a model. Indeed, \nwe are told he is not even responsible for telling us the truth. Some \nof his defenders have begun to suggest that lying under oath can be \nacceptable conduct in a President or that the President is generally \nabove the law and that the President would not need to honor, for \ninstance, a lawful subpoena to a grand jury--the idea that somehow the \nPresident's power is so substantial that the President would not have \nto respond in the event that he were called.\n  Jack Quinn, former White House counsel and a friend of many in this \nChamber, argues in the pages of the Wall Street Journal that the \nPresident simply is not the subject of law in the same way as other \ncitizens in an article entitled ``Clinton Can Avoid the\n\n[[Page S9543]]\n\nStarr Chamber.'' He argues that the President does not have to comply \nwith a grand jury subpoena.\n  As new evidence comes to light, all the President's men work to keep \nAmerica in the dark. And I believe that is wrong. I believe the concept \nof self-government carries with it an implicit need of citizens to know \nwhat is happening in government, what the circumstances are, what the \nconditions are. And certainly if a person is called upon by a part of \nour Government to provide truthful testimony, the failure to do so is a \nvery serious offense.\n  I believe that perjury is unacceptable conduct and that it is an \nimpeachable offense. How can it be otherwise? It is not possible to--\nand I am quoting the Constitution--``take care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed'' while deliberately slighting the law against \nperjury. It is that simple.\n  I, for one, am fascinated by the prevailing conventional wisdom that \nPresidential perjury would be harmless error, while suborning perjury \nor obstructing justice would be much worse and an impeachable offense.\n  The suggestion is shocking--that somehow it is OK for the President \nto lie but it would not be OK for him to tell someone else to lie, that \nthe act itself would be OK and permissible, but telling someone else to \ndo it would be an infraction. That is an utterly false dichotomy.\n  Since when is it worse to try to get someone else to lie than to tell \na lie yourself? Is it worse to try to convince someone else to steal \nthan to steal yourself? Is it worse to convince someone else to cheat \non their taxes than to cheat on your own taxes?\n  Being under oath and lying under oath or convincing someone else to \ntell a lie under oath is criminal in either case and irreconcilable \nwith the President's constitutional oath to take care that the laws of \nthe land be respected, honored, and enforced.\n  Terrible events appear to be engulfing the Clinton Presidency. The \ninvestigation of the President raises fundamental questions about the \nstandards we should expect from a Chief Executive of the United States. \nIf the House of Representatives begins an impeachment inquiry, the \nmomentous machinery of the Constitution will raise the issue of \nPresidential conduct and misconduct to their highest levels.\n  Because the prospect of Presidential impeachment seldom troubles this \nblessed Nation--and we can be grateful for that--there are fundamental \nquestions about the President's standing under the law that have never \nbeen answered definitively.\n  If we had impeachment processes going on every month, month by month, \nyear by year, in virtually every Presidency, we would have a great body \nof law that told us exactly how things are to be done in this \nsituation. That is how the rules of behavior in the legal system are \ndeveloped, through precedent and experience. But we really do not have \nmajor impeachment experience.\n  As a matter of fact, there has been one President who has undergone \nthat kind of inquiry in the Senate, and that was well over 100 years \nago. Moreover, in more recent times, when this body has considered \nimpeachments for a variety of other, lesser officials, we have not \nconducted full-scale impeachment proceedings. So there are lots of \nissues that surround the potential of illegal activity by a President \nthat have not been answered; some probably have not even been asked.\n  It is time to clarify these issues, I believe, before the House \naddresses the momentous decision of whether to open a formal inquiry. I \nthink the questions need to be answered, and I believe that we can \nbegin this important discussion about the President's obligations to \ncomply with the normal criminal process.\n\n  I think we can begin to develop an understanding of how this should \nbe conducted by holding hearings over the recess in the Constitution \nSubcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe we can invite \nscholars in to answer questions about whether the President is subject \nto prosecution; whether, indeed, the President is responsible for \nappearing before a grand jury in response to a subpoena; what level of \nconduct the President must compare to; what standard can he be measured \nby; in the absence of measuring up, are there things that can, should, \nor ought to be done?\n  I might point out that very shortly we will be called to reevaluate \nthe independent counsel statute which provides a basis for individuals \nbeing investigated when the normal investigatory process would be \nreplete with conflicts of interest.\n  I noted with interest that the assistant majority leader was on the \nfloor here in the Senate Chamber earlier today talking about the fact \nthat the Attorney General has been implored by the Director of the FBI \nto appoint an independent counsel to look into, investigate, and \nprosecute possible violations of the criminal laws regarding political \ncontributions. Not only has she been asked to do that by the Director \nof the FBI, she has been asked to do that by the person she appointed \nin the Justice Department to look into the matter. His recommendation \nto her is, according to the reports is, that she ought to appoint an \nindependent counsel, yet she has refused. I noted that the assistant \nmajority leader indicated that her refusal and her continued refusal \nwould become the basis for her resignation, in his view.\n  I think all of these serious questions about the accountability of \nhigh-ranking executive branch officials beg resolution and they demand \ndiscussion. It is important that we resolve them and begin to have a \nfull awareness of these potentials as we move toward the responsibility \nof reauthorizing or otherwise adjusting or dealing with the concept of \nthe independent counsel's office in the independent counsel statute.\n  Perhaps there is a single open question that is more demanding than \nany other of the open questions, and is certainly more relevant now, it \nappears, more than at any other time in history: whether a sitting \nPresident is subject to the regular compulsory criminal process.\n  I think, as I indicated, former White House counsel Quinn's article \nin the Wall Street Journal says no. When we mean regular criminal \nprocess, we have to say up to and including prosecution. So the \nquestion becomes, Can a sitting President be prosecuted if he violates \nthe law, or is the sitting President above the law? Or is the only \nremedy to remove him from office through the impeachment process, and \nthen would he be liable for prosecution or is he liable for prosecution \nif the Congress decides to sit on its hands?\n  You can imagine a situation in which a President was favored by a \ngroup of individuals in the Congress who simply didn't want to get \ninvolved or were allies of the President politically who said, ``No, \nthere are a sufficient number of us to stop an impeachment procedure, \nso we won't allow it to happen.'' If the President were to persist in \ncriminal behavior, it seems to me, there is a question in that setting \nabout whether there is any remedy. Would a President be subject to \nprosecution if the House turned its back on obvious--obvious--criminal \ninfractions, simply saying, ``We don't want any part of an impeachment \nproceeding?''\n  There is a pretty high level of political discussion now that says, \neven in the President's opposition party, that says the Republicans \nmight not want this President to leave office to give his Vice \nPresident a jump-start on the next election. That is something that I \ndon't buy. I don't believe in that. I believe that if there has been a \nserious infraction that merits impeachment, the inquiry must take \nplace. Even if it is on the last day and the last 20 seconds of the \nPresidential term--Americans ought to do what is right. But there is a \nlot of discussion in the culture now that even an opposition party \nmight not want to remove a particular official. So if there isn't any \nother remedy, does that mean that a person is free to violate the law? \nI think these are important questions.\n  The question, then, is whether a sitting President is subject to the \nregular compulsory criminal process--up to and including prosecution--\nor whether impeachment is the only avenue available for addressing \nPresidential wrongdoing?\n  It is a serious question. It is a question that has been commented on \nby a number of individuals hypothetically in the past. In commenting on \nthe options available to address Presidential crimes, many people seem \nto proceed on the assumption that the impeachment process is the \nexclusive avenue\n\n[[Page S9544]]\n\nfor addressing Presidential misconduct. Judge Bork reached this \nconclusion many years ago when the Justice Department considered the \noptions for prosecuting Vice President Agnew. But Judge Bork's view is \nhardly the unanimous view of legal scholars.\n  For example, Professor Gary McDowell has argued that the independent \ncounsel does have the capacity to indict a sitting President. In the \nWall Street Journal of March 9, 1998, Professor McDowell, who is a \ndirector of the Institute of the United States Studies at the \nUniversity of London, says yes, in a rather well-written piece, yes, \nyou can indict the President. Jack Quinn says, ``Clinton can avoid the \nStarr Chamber,'' basically saying you can't.\n  Perhaps the most well-known constitutional scholar in America with \nwhom I sometimes agree and with whom I often disagree is Professor \nLarry Tribe. Now, Lawrence Tribe, in his ``American Constitutional \nLaw'' text, admits that the question must be regarded as an open one, \nsaying that, with respect to whether or not you can proceed against a \nPresident in a criminal proceeding, ``the question must be regarded as \nan open one, but the burden should be on those who insist that a \nPresident is immune from criminal trial prior to impeachment and \nremoval from office.''\n  Interesting. That is one of the most noted constitutional legal \nscholars in the United States saying that while he thinks the question \nis an open one, that those who want to say that there is immunity here \nhave the real burden of making the case.\n  This is a constitutional question of the highest order. The answer \nprovides insights into whether the President is subject to the criminal \nlaws applicable to the citizenry of America. The answer also informs \nwhether a popular President--or a President whose party has a secure \ncongressional majority or a President whose value to other individuals \nin office would make them reluctant to involve themselves in \nimpeachment proceedings--could ever be held accountable for violations \nof the law.\n  Perhaps early in a term a President is alleged to have done \nsomething, does the statute of limitations run, and if it runs before \nthe term is over and the Congress decides to turn its head, does that \nmean there is absolutely no requirement that the President adhere to \nthe law, respond to the law, be involved and uphold the law in the same \nway as other citizens are?\n  I think these questions are very serious questions, and they are \nquestions that demand resolution. I think an inquiry is important to \nbegin the process of resolving these questions.\n  There are also important subsidiary questions about whether the \nPresident is subject to a criminal process that should be examined. On \nAugust 17, the Nation will witness the spectacle of a sitting President \nproviding grand jury testimony.\n  He is going to do it pursuant to a negotiated agreement. The \nPresident will appear, but he is going to be available for questions \nfor a single day and will have the benefit of legal counsel. By doing \nso, by agreeing, he has deferred a legal resolution of these issues. I \nam, frankly, happy that the President has decided, at least in this \nmeasure, to make himself available. This negotiated agreement for the \nPresident to appear for a single day has deferred a confrontation over \nthe ultimate constitutional question of whether a sitting President \nmust comply with a grand jury subpoena. But this question may not go \naway.\n  In the event that a single day proves insufficient, for example, to \nresolve all the questions that Judge Starr has for the President, this \nunresolved question could resurface.\n  The importance of this question also goes beyond the context of this \nparticular dispute over alleged Presidential perjury, or a series of \nother alleged Presidential acts relating to perjury and obstruction of \njustice. I have here an opinion piece by one of President Clinton's \nformer White House counsels, Jack Quinn--to which I have referred \nalready--in which Mr. Quinn argues that the President is not obligated \nto comply with the ordinary criminal process and is free to ignore a \ngrand jury subpoena--to simply say: I don't participate in enforcing \nthe law. If I have information about a crime that might have been \ncommitted, or evidence about it, I don't have to do that, I am the \nPresident.\n  That is a sweeping proposition, and I think it is one that the \nCongress should examine, particularly as we move toward the possible \nreauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act. I plan to bring in a \nnumber of constitutional scholars to address these critical issues and \nthese yet unanswered questions.\n  Frankly, I do not mean to prejudge these issues. However, they are \ntoo important to leave unexamined. The answers to these questions may \nwell inform the progress of Judge Starr's investigation and shape the \ndifficult question of what the House should do if a report from Judge \nStarr does not arrive until the eve of adjournment.\n  The events of the past 6 months have raised many novel questions \nabout the scope of the powers and privileges of the President. These \nare important questions and they are not easy to resolve. And in our \nsystem of separated powers, the answers to these questions also \ndetermine the scope and the power of Congress, and they will also \ndetermine, in some measure, the scope and the power of protection \noffered to the people. The answers will determine whether the people \ndeserve to be protected by virtue of prosecuting those who offend the \nlaw even if Congress chooses not to be involved in proceedings which it \nhad the opportunity to pursue, like impeachment. Congress cannot be a \nmere bystander in these debates. Congress has an important \nresponsibility to use its investigatory functions to shed light on \nthese important and unresolved questions. It is time for Congress to \nstop looking at the polls and to start looking at the Constitution.\n  I hope these hearings will provide important insights into the extent \nto which the President must comply with criminal process. I believe \nevery other American has the responsibility to comply, and it is a \nserious question to determine whether or not the President has the \nresponsibility of being a citizen, as well as being the President. So I \nlook forward to sharing this discussion with other members of the \nConstitution Subcommittee and to chairing these hearings to help \nclarify these issues at a time when we need this clarity, either in \nreformulating our view on the independent counsel statute, or as it \nrelates to events that are unfolding at the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue. I believe that a discussion of these issues will advance our \ncapacity to understand the appropriate balance that is necessary for \nthe maintenance of freedom and the responsibilities that come with the \nprivileges that we enjoy as free people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the sense-of-\nthe-Senate on providing humanitarian relief to the Sudan, I believe it \nis important that we focus on the tragedy that is unfolding before our \neyes. The people of southern Sudan are starving. Khartoum is using the \ndenial of food as a weapon in its war against the rebels in the south--\nand we are letting the government of Sudan get away with this odious \npractice by allowing Khartoum to have a veto over aid deliveries.\n  Sudan has been torn by a devastating civil war between the Muslim \nnorth and the predominantly Christian and animist south for most of \nhistory since independence. The current phase of the war started in \n1983 when the then-President embarked on an Islamization program. \nRecurring famine is just one of the tragic outcomes of Khartoum's \nbrutal method of warfare where women, children, and livestock are taken \nas prizes of war. It has also resulted in institutionalized slavery, \nmore than 4 million internally displaced people, and more than 1.5 \nmillion casualties in the past 14 years.\n  Our State Department lists Sudan as a terrorist state. We have \nsanctions on Sudan which prohibit American investment. But we respect \nthe right of the\n\n[[Page S9545]]\n\nNational Islamic Front regime in Khartoum to veto the delivery of \nhumanitarian relief to the south. That just doesn't make sense.\n  Most of the aid flowing to southern Sudan is through non-governmental \norganizations (NGOs) participating in a United Nations relief program, \nOperation Lifeline Sudan (OLS). While traveling through east Africa in \nDecember, I had the opportunity to visit the OLS Southern Sector \nheadquarters and see firsthand the efforts of the NGOs. These NGOs are \non the ground, along with UNICEF, mounting a heroic effort to \ndistribute aid to these starving people. And I know that many of them \nshare my frustration with the UN's political agreement with the \ngovernment of Sudan which allows Khartoum to have the final say in the \ndistribution of aid to the south. This has resulted in the starvation \nof citizens and soldiers alike when Khartoum decides it is advantageous \nto halt the delivering of aid.\n  For the past few years, Khartoum has restricted flights during the \nplanting season so that aid organizations cannot deliver the seeds and \ntools necessary to help the people of southern Sudan feed themselves. \nThis year Khartoum went a step further. Khartoum didn't just restrict \nflights. It banned relief flights in the Bahr el Ghazal region. It \nshould be no surprise that another poor harvest is predicted in the \nFall. According to the UN World Food Program, 2.6 million people in \nSouthern Sudan are in imminent peril of starvation. Quite frankly, \nuntil we can find a way to deliver seeds and tools to southern Sudan \nduring planting season, I see this cycle of famine continuing \nindefinitely. This is a warfare tactic of cowards.\n  The flight ban wasn't the only problem that OLS had in delivering aid \neffectively. When the flight ban was lifted and aid could once again be \nprovided, OLS faced another barrier put in its way by Khartoum. OLS was \nforced to wait for Khartoum's permission to add four Ilyushin cargo \nplanes to the handful of C-130s that deliver relief supplies to \nsouthern Sudan. Any agreement by the United Nations which permits \nKhartoum a veto over the number of relief planes as well as when and \nwhere they can fly is fatally flawed. The President should aggressively \nseek to change the terms of this agreement which restricts the ability \nof Operation Lifeline Sudan to distribute aid effectively to southern \nSudan.\n  As chairman of the International Operations subcommittee, I have to \nsay I hold little hope that the United Nations will take any \nsignificant steps in this direction. That leaves, of course, the option \nof unilateral action by the United States to bypass Khartoum's veto. \nCurrently, U.S. AID funnels aid to Sudan almost exclusively through \nOLS-affiliated groups. That must change if we are to have any chance to \neffectively combat the use of starvation as a tactic of war. The United \nStates government shouldn't just cooperate with these non-OLS groups \nwhen Khartoum institutes restrictions on the delivery of aid--as we did \nduring the Bahr El Ghazal flight ban. The United States should actively \nassist and develop relief distribution networks outside of Operation \nLifeline Sudan's umbrella which are not subject to the whims of \nKhartoum. If we don't, yet another planting season will pass without \nseeds being sown, and hundreds of thousands of more people will starve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9544-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9545-S9547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SOLUTIONS TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY CRISIS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, during the past few weeks, I have made a \nseries of remarks on the Senate floor concerning Social Security. I \ndiscussed the history of Social Security, the program's looming crisis, \nthe old-age insurance reform efforts taken by other nations, and the \nfinancial gender and race gaps created by the current Social Security \nsystem.\n  Today, I will sum up the major points I have made so far and then \nmove on to speak about possible solutions to Social Security's \nproblems, and the principles of reform we must uphold as we move \nforward.\n  The concept of ``social security'' originated in Europe in the 1880s. \nIt was devised supposedly to correct the problems created by laissez \nfaire capitalism, to avoid a Marxist-led revolution. Social Security \nwas not an American experience. In fact, a very small group of \nintellectuals promoted and designed the Social Security program in this \ncountry. Congress hastily passed the Social Security Act less than \nseven months following its introduction in 1935. The public never got \nthe chance to participate in the debate.\n  At the time, many Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle \nraised serious questions about the program. Unfortunately, many of \ntheir prophecies have become reality today. Senator Bennett Clark, a \nDemocrat from Missouri, recognized the non-competitive nature of Social \nSecurity and offered an amendment to allow companies with private \npensions to opt out of the public program. Workers would be given the \nfreedom to choose either the federal Social Security program or a \nprivate pension plan offered by their employers.\n  The Clark amendment received popular support in the Senate, but was \ndropped from the conference report with the promise it would be \nreconsidered immediately the following year. It was not--that promise \nwas broken, the first of many broken promises that plague us today.\n  In the 60 years following its creation, despite continued questions \nand criticism, the Social Security system has grown dramatically in \nsize and scope. As more beneficiaries and more programs are added, \nCongress has raised the payroll tax 51 times.\n  In 1964, Ronald Reagan was among the first to suggest investing \nSocial Security funds in the market. But no one took his advice \nseriously.\n  Then, in 1977 and 1983, Social Security ran into major crises, and \nCongress had no choice but to pass Social Security rescue packages that \nsignificantly increased taxes. Washington promised that Social Security \nwould remain solvent for another 75 years. Today, another Social \nSecurity crisis is imminent. Unlike the previous two crises, however, \nthe coming crisis will have a profound and devastating impact on our \nnational economy, our society, and our culture.\n  The Social Security program's $20 trillion--that is a large number--\n$20 trillion--in unfunded liabilities have created an economic time \nbomb that threatens to shatter our economy. Beginning in 2008, 74 \nmillion baby-boomers will become eligible for retirement and the system \nwill begin to collapse.\n  The problem begins with the fact that the current Social Security \nsystem is a ``pay-as-you-go'' entitlement program. The money a worker \npays in today is used to support today's retirees--there are no \nindividual accounts waiting for future retirees to dip into. This was \nnot a problem in 1941, when there were 100 workers to support every \nbeneficiary. It is a tremendous problem in 1998, when only two workers \nsupport each beneficiary.\n  These factors all lead to the conclusion that the Social Security \nTrust Fund will go broke by 2032 if we continue on our present course. \nIf the economy takes a turn for the worse, or if the demographic \nassumptions are too optimistic, the Trust Fund could go bankrupt even \nearlier. Without real reform, the Congressional Budget Office and the \nGeneral Accounting Office estimate the debt held by the public will \nconsume up to 200 percent of our national income within the next 40-50 \nyears.\n  A national debt at this level would shatter our economy--and shatter \nour children's hopes of obtaining the American dream.\n  Mr. President, retirement security programs worldwide, not just here \nin the United States, will face a serious challenge in the 21st Century \ndue to a massive demographic shift that is now underway. The World Bank \nrecently warned that, across the globe, ``old-age systems are in \nserious financial trouble and are not sustainable in their present \nform.''\n  While Congress has yet to focus on this problem, many other countries \nhave moved far ahead of us in taking steps to reform their old-age \nretirement systems. Some of these international efforts are extremely \nsuccessful. Chile and Great Britain are excellent examples.\n  Back in the late 1970s, after Chile realized that its publicly \nfinanced, pay-as-you-go retirement system would go broke, it replaced \nit with a system of\n\n[[Page S9546]]\n\npersonalized Pension Savings Accounts. Nearly two decades later, \npensions in Chile are between 50 to 100 percent higher than they were \nunder the old government system. Real wages have increased, personal \nsavings rates have nearly tripled, and the economy has grown at a rate \nnearly double what it had prior to the change.\n  When facing bankruptcy in the early 1980s, the United Kingdom \nreformed its system to allow individuals to choose the option of a new, \nself-financing private pension plan. The success of the English system \nhas been overwhelming. Today, nearly 73 percent of the workforce \nparticipates in private plans, with a total pool worth more than $1 \ntrillion. The United Kingdom will pay off its national debt by 2030, \nabout the same time experts estimate our Social Security Trust Fund \nwill go bankrupt.\n  Mr. President, we can learn a great deal from our global neighbors. \nAs we pursue reform, we must also address the issue of why the current \nSocial Security system puts women and minorities at a greater financial \nrisk and disadvantage than other retirees face today. For women and \nminorities, average income remains low. This means they have less money \navailable to save for their retirements. Therefore, a growing number of \nwomen and minorities are becoming increasingly dependent upon their \nSocial Security checks. Today, the average female retiree earns \napproximately $621 per month, compared to her male counterpart at $810 \nper month. But marriage alone does not always improve a woman's \nsituation. In fact, 64 percent of all elderly women living in poverty \nare widows. This is because when a spouse dies, the widow's benefits \nare reduced by up to one-half.\n\n  Race also continues to be an important factor in determining the \nlevel of retirement security for some Americans. As Social Security \napproaches bankruptcy and the rate of return diminishes, Hispanic and \nAfrican-Americans will be forced to bear a disproportionate share of \nthe financial burden.\n  In an economic model prepared by the Heritage Foundation, a \nhypothetical Hispanic community of 50,000 lost $12.8 billion in 1997 \ndollars over what it could have earned had they invested their Social \nSecurity funds in a conservative portfolio. The findings within the \nAfrican-American community are similarly troubling. Like single \nHispanic males, single African-American males have a lower life \nexpectancy and are especially disadvantaged by the current Social \nSecurity system. A low-income, African-American male born after 1959 \ncan expect to receive less than 88 cents back on every dollar he \ncontributes to the Social Security trust fund.\n  Mr. President, Congress and the public itself have begun to focus on \nthe inequities of the current system, with an eye toward the rapidly \napproaching crisis. To date, a number of Social Security reform \nproposals have been introduced by Members of Congress of both parties, \nby think tanks, and by individuals in the private sector. This is very \nencouraging. It appears to me there are wrong and right approaches to \nreforming the Social Security system. The wrong approaches are to \ntinker with the current system by either increasing the payroll tax or \nreducing benefits, or letting the government invest Social Security \nTrust Funds for the American people. Mr. President, let me take a few \nmoments to discuss why.\n  There are two points to consider in whether the federal government \nitself should invest the Social Security Trust Funds in the equity \nmarkets. The positive aspect of this approach, in my view, is that the \nauthors of this proposal have admitted the insolvency of Social \nSecurity and have recognized the power of the markets to generate a \nbetter rate of return, and therefore improved benefits for retirees. \nThe negative side is that direct federal involvement in the markets has \nthe potential to do great harm.\n  In the last week's Humphrey-Hawkins hearing, I asked Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan whether we should allow the government to \ninvest the Social Security Trust Funds in the markets, and if this is \nright direction to go. Here are his exact words:\n\n       No, I think it is very dangerous. . . I do not know of any \n     way that you can essentially insulate government decision-\n     makers from having access to what will amount to very large \n     investments in American private industry. . . I am fearful \n     that we are taking on a position here, at least in \n     conjecture, that has very far-reaching, potential dangers for \n     a free American economy and a free American society. It is a \n     wholly different phenomenon of having private investment in \n     the market, where individuals own the stock and vote the \n     claims on management, (from) having government (doing so).\n\n       I know there are those who believe it can be insulated from \n     the political process, they go a long way to try to do that. \n     I have been around long enough to realize that that is just \n     not credible and not possible. Somewhere along the line, that \n     breach will be broken.\n\n  Perhaps no one in the country is more knowledgeable about the \nAmerican economy than Chairman Greenspan. He was among the first to \nraise the issue of Social Security's unfunded liabilities and warned \nCongress a few years ago about the consequences if we fail to fix \nSocial Security. Chairman Greenspan has been consistent in his \nposition. But last week was the first time he spoke so clearly, \nforcefully, and persuasively against the idea of letting the government \ninvest the Social Security Trust Funds. Mr. President, we should never \nventure out onto what Chairman Greenspan called ``a slippery slope of \nextraordinary magnitude.\n  We hear some argue that Social Security is not in crisis, it is not \nbroken, and all we need to do is make a few ``minor adjustments,'' such \nas raising the payroll tax by 2.2 percent. History has already proved \nthat this approach will not work.\n  If we were to adopt this plan, the tax hike would cost roughly $75 \nbillion in fiscal year 1998, which is the equivalent of a 10 percent \nincrease in everyone's personal income taxes. Such an increase would \nnot only represent an impossible hardship for America's already \novertaxed, hard-working families, but it would not fix Social Security \neither.\n  This 2.2 percent figure is based only on what is called actuarial \nbalance, not operating balance. This calculation itself is problematic \nbecause actuarial balance counts accumulated surpluses, which are \nnothing but IOUs that can only be redeemed by raising taxes or \nborrowing from the public. Even if Congress adopted the 2.2 percent \nsolution, Social Security would still face large and steadily growing \ndeficits starting in 2020.\n  When I asked Chairman Greenspan about this proposal, he told me that \nincreasing taxes will not create the savings, the investment, nor the \nproduction of real assets required for retirees, because: First, it is \nthe same failed remedy we have turned to repeatedly, and second, it \ndoes not change a pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded one. The right \napproach, according to Chairman Greenspan, is to allow private \nretirement accounts which he believes will ``far more readily move \ntoward full funding'' of the system. He believes a fully funded system \nwill provide the savings and investment, and thus increased \nproductivity, needed for retirement security. I fully agree with him.\n  You don't have to go far to find empirical evidence supporting this \napproach. Employees of Galveston County, Texas opted out of Social \nSecurity in 1981 to set up a private retirement plan. Let me offer some \ncomparisons. Under Social Security, the death benefit is only $253 \nwhile under the Galveston plan, the average death benefit is $75,000 \nand the maximum benefit can reach $150,000. Disability benefits under \nSocial Security are $1,280 per month, compared with $2,749 for \nGalveston employees. The maximum Social Security retirement benefit is \n$1,280 per month, while the average retirement benefit for Galveston \nemployees is $4,790 per month.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious which plan is superior.\n  Those who argue passionately for preserving Social Security's status \nquo insist that personal retirement accounts are too risky and too \nexpensive to operate. This is not true. Any investment involves risk, \nbut in my view, Social Security is even riskier than other long-term \nmarket investments. Social Security has already had two crises in the \nlast two decades. The coming crisis will wipe out a worker's entire \nlifetime of Social Security investments. With today's well regulated \nand matured markets, risk can be managed to the minimum for long-term \ninvestment. In addition, workers do not necessarily have to invest in \nstocks. In fact, they can invest in low-risk bonds,\n\n[[Page S9547]]\n\nand even Treasury bills, and still do better than Social Security.\n\n  Actual fees and administrative costs for existing investments in the \nmarkets are generally well below 1 percent. With much higher yields, a \nmarket-based system still results in much better benefits than are \nrealized under Social Security.\n  Supporters of the status quo also argue that a personalized \nretirement security system will hurt lower-income workers. Again, this \nis untrue. Under the Galveston plan, a 25-year-old worker, making \n$20,000 a year and retiring at age 65, will receive $2,740 in \nretirement benefits per month. That's more than three times greater \nthan Social Security's $800 per month benefit.\n  A personalized retirement system is the best retirement system for \ntoday's and tomorrow's American workers because, not only will it make \nSocial Security solvent, it will produce maximum retirement benefits \nand a sustainable economy. In fact, I believe this is the only solution \nto the Social Security crisis. We should move in this direction as soon \nas possible, and we should allow workers to use as much of their \npayroll tax as possible to set up their personal retirement accounts. \nThere are existing proposals to allow workers to set aside two, three, \nor four percent of the payroll tax for their personal retirement \naccounts. These are all well-analyzed proposals, and each has its own \nmerits. We should take a close look at them.\n  However, if a personalized retirement system will generate the best \noutcome, why do not we allow workers to put all their payroll taxes \ninto the new system? That would allow workers to accumulate more \nsavings, enjoy higher returns, generate additional benefits for their \nretirement in a shorter time, and pass the savings on to their \nchildren. By so doing, we can shift to a fully funded retirement system \nmuch more quickly. This will have an enormous, positive impact on our \nsavings and investment, and our economy--while providing the retirement \nsecurity we have pledged to deliver. I soon will offer legislation to \nachieve this goal.\n  Clearly we have no choice but to pursue real reform of Social \nSecurity. What remain are the difficult questions of how we should \nproceed, which principles should guide us, and which options offer \nAmericans the best opportunities for retirement security.\n  In my view, the primary principle in reforming Social Security is to \nprotect current and future beneficiaries who choose to stay within the \ntraditional Social Security system. The government must guarantee their \nbenefits. Any change that reduces their benefits, or adversely affects \nthose Americans, is not acceptable. Let me repeat: it is not acceptable \nif any reform results in a reduction of benefits, or harms in any way \nthose Americans who are depending--or who want to depend--upon Social \nSecurity.\n  I emphasize this principle not so much because we want to gain the \nsupport of seniors--although their support is essential to the success \nof our efforts--nor to neutralize their opposition to Social Security \nreform, but because of the sacred covenant the federal government has \nentered into with the American people to provide their retirement \nbenefits. It is our contractual duty to honor that commitment. It would \nbe wrong to let current or future beneficiaries bear the burden of the \ngovernment's mistakes in creating a poorly-designed program and failing \nto foresee demographic changes.\n  The second principle we must uphold is to give the American people \nfreedom of choice in pursuing retirement security. The purpose of \nSocial Security is to provide a basic level of benefits for everyone in \ncase of misfortune. So if social insurance is a safety net to catch \nthose who fall, it does not make sense to penalize those who are quite \nable to stand on their own two feet. Freedom is the cornerstone on \nwhich this nation is built--taking away freedom will lower the standard \nof living we enjoy today. Allowing workers to control their own funds \nand resources for retirement will strengthen our constitutional \ndemocracy and put individuals in charge of their own savings.\n  The third principle is to preserve a safety net for unlucky or \ndisadvantaged Americans, so that no covered person is forced to live in \npoverty. Today's Social Security program has 44 million beneficiaries: \nwe must ensure that the safety net will continue to be there for them. \nBut we must also separate the retirement function from the welfare \nfunction and make them transparent, so that we can better manage and \nimprove old-age retirement programs and welfare programs.\n  The fourth principle is that reform should provide better or improved \nretirement security for American workers than is currently available. \nWe can do that by enabling them to build personal retirement savings, \nimprove the rate of return on their savings, increase capital \nownership, and pass their savings on to their children.\n  More and more people are relying on Social Security as their only \nsource of retirement income. As that number grows, however, the rate of \nreturn for Social Security contributions is diminishing.\n  And so it is becoming ever more difficult to juggle the increased \ndependency on Social Security with the expectations for a decent \nretirement. Any reform of the current system must meet this challenge \nand provide better benefits for every American, regardless of their \nincome, than are available under the current system.\n  The fifth principle should be to replace the current pay-as-you-go \nsystem with a fully funded program. The fundamental flaw of the Social \nSecurity system is the PAYGO finance mechanism, which has been very \nvulnerable to changing demographics, and hardly remains actuarially \nbalanced.\n  It has created enormous financial burdens for our children and \ngrandchildren. Moving to a fully funded system will not only reduce \ninequality among generations, it will also greatly increase our \nnation's savings and investment rates, and therefore prosperity.\n  The sixth principle is that any reform of the current system should \nnot increase the tax burden of the American people. The taxpayers are \nalready paying an historic 40 percent in federal, state and local taxes \nout of every paycheck they earn.\n  Although Congress has increased payroll taxes more than 51 times in \nthe past 63 years, Social Security still faces a crisis. Hiking taxes \nyet again to fix Social Security would be unfair and unjust to working \nAmericans, and would only pave the way for additional, future tax \nincreases.\n  We must neither increase taxes to tinker with the current system, nor \nto finance a transition from a PAYGO system to one that is prefunded. \nInstead, we should look for a more innovative and more appropriate way \nto finance reform, such as reducing government spending and selling \ngovernment assets, to achieve the goal.\n  Although the degree to which the various reform proposals being \ndiscussed meet the core principles I have outlined varies greatly, the \nfact that we are openly debating this subject at all is heartening.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the looming Social Security crisis is \nreal. The threat to our economy is devastating. The best solution to \navoiding this imminent crisis is to move from Social Security's PAYGO-\nbased system to a personalized retirement program that is fully funded \nand offers each American the security they seek--and deserve--in their \nretirement years.\n  Congress has the power to create this brighter future for all. \nCongress has the responsibility to act before the coming danger is \nirreversible. All Congress needs now is courage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and commend the \nMembers and staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee for \ntheir tireless work towards producing a targeted RCRA reform bill this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, what the Committee has undertaken is no easy task. \nAlthough the bill we are crafting only deals with a narrow part of the \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act, the drafting process has been a \ndifficult and long road. RCRA is the most complex and technical \nenvironmental statute in existence, and to fix a piece of it,\n\n[[Page S9548]]\n\none must understand the whole. The Committee has spend many months \neducating themselves--and this determined effort is paying off.\n  The majority and minority committee staff have been exchanging \nlanguage and ideas in intense negotiations over the last several weeks. \nThey are not debating principles, Mr. President, they are getting down \nto brass tacks. They are refining the language so that it reflects a \nconsensus position on the issues. After all, we all agree--the \nAdministration, the EPA, Republicans, Democrats and stakeholders--that \nRCRA needs to be fixed. The challenge now is putting the agreed-upon \nremediation waste reforms into legislative language.\n  Mr. President, Congressional Republicans and Democrats are working \nwith the Administration and the agencies as a team. Our team is closer \nthan ever to producing a bill that is fiscally and environmentally \nresponsible. Our team is on the brink on introducing a bill that will \nbe embraced by Congress and the Administration. Our team is within \nstriking distance of a win for everyone.\n  The biggest winners, Mr. President, will be those affected by our \nbill. Industry, the states and the environmental community support our \nefforts towards reform because they know our goal is to speed up site \ncleanup and reduce agency bureaucracy.\n  When setting out to craft a targeted RCRA remediation waste bill in \n1996, this same team focused on three primary goals. Today, my goals \nand that of the team are still the same.\n  First, I want to make RCRA work. I want it to work faster. I want it \nto work more cheaply. A RCRA reform bill is worthless if it does not \nclear these basic hurdles.\n  Second, I want to remove regulations that are counterproductive to \ncleanup and streamline decision-making. This will give EPA the \nflexibility it needs to get the job done. Current law keeps the EPA \nfrom removing some of the largest obstacles to clean-up, and the only \nway to fix the problem is by fixing current law.\n  Third, I want to give the states more authority over the management \nof these cleanup programs. States not only have the ability to do the \njob right, they have the resources and talent. These officials know how \nbest to deal with the communities and counties impacted by the site and \nits cleanup.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are on the way to a final product that \nkeeps faith with these goals.\n  I must take a moment now to commend the good work being done by the \nHouse Commerce Committee. Certainly the Senate could not have come so \nfar so fast were it not for the efforts in the House. Our colleagues on \nthe other side of the Capital have done a remarkable job, through \nstakeholder meetings and dialogs, to educate us all as to the potential \nimplications of our actions. I know Senators Chafee, Smith, Baucas, and \nLautenberg join me in commending the efforts of Chairmen Bliley and \nOxley and their staff on this issue.\n  Mr. President, environmental cleanup programs only work if sites are \ntruly being cleaned up. With over 5,000 RCRA sites nationwide, our work \nis cut out for us. I look forward to returning to the Senate floor in \nSeptember to join my Senate colleagues in introducing our RCRA \nremediation waste reform legislation--a first step towards an effective \nand responsible RCRA program. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9547-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JEROLD KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I join several of our colleagues in \ncosponsoring a bipartisan bill which will strengthen the manufactured \nhousing industry. This legislation will benefit the fastest growing \nsegment of the housing industry, while establishing a balanced process \nfor the development, revision, and interpretation of Federal \nconstruction and safety standards. This legislation also focuses on the \nconsumer.\n  In addition to announcing my cosponsorship, I want to pay tribute to \nJerold Kennedy, a native Mississippian, entrepreneur, a business owner, \nand advocate for manufactured housing. Jerold championed reforms of the \nregulations controlling this segment of the marketplace. He worked for \nmany years to advance legislation that would modernize the National \nManufactured Housing Construction and Safety Act of 1974. Today, I \nhonor Jerold's efforts. S.2145 reflects those efforts, and Mr. Kennedy \nwould be proud of S.2145.\n  This segment of the industry, to which Jerold dedicated his life, \nplays a vital role in making affordable, unsubsidized housing available \nfor a wide range of Americans. First time home buyers, single parents, \nand senior citizens are just a few groups who greatly benefit from \nmanufactured housing. This industry is responsible for one out of every \nthree single-family homes sold last year. One-third! For less than \n$40,000, millions of Americans can realize their dream of owning a \nhome. This is an appealing alternative compared to the 5.3 million \nAmericans who pay more than 50 percent of their income in rent.\n  In order for this industry to sustain such phenomenal growth and make \naffordable housing available, it is necessary to update the laws which \nregulate this industry. The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act (MHIA) \nwill do just that, creating a process for keeping construction \nstandards current, and enforcing the federal authority on those \nstandards. S.2145 will be the first step in fixing the inadequacies \nwhich confront the manufactured housing industry today.\n  This bill will also create a private consensus committee made up of \nall interested parties. They will submit recommendations to the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Recommendations which \nwill serve as a valuable tool in revising the Federal Manufactured Home \nConstruction and Safety Standards in a timely manner. Additionally, \nthis legislation will authorize HUD to use industry labeling fees to \npay for any additional staff needed to do the new work. This user fee \nmechanism will remove a need for additional federal funding.\n  This legislation pays tribute to Jerold Kennedy, who passed on before \nS.2145 was introduced. I want Mrs. Kennedy, and their three children, \nto know that Jerold's legacy lives within this bill. Jerold Kennedy \nfounded Belmont Homes, Inc., and dedicated 28 years of his life to the \nmanufactured housing industry. Congress owes a great deal to Jerold \nKennedy. His common sense approach to update the standards which \nregulate the industry are the foundation of S.2145. I hope this \nCongress can make his dream a reality. This legislation pays tribute to \na man of integrity. His honesty, trustworthiness, and professionalism \nhelped both the profession of which he was a part and the efforts to \nreform its public policy.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will address the recognized and \nacknowledged problems in HUD's manufactured housing program. S.2145 \nwill provide real-world, viable solutions enabling the manufactured \nhome industry to prosper, while providing consumers with even more \nbenefits and protection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9548-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9548-S9549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PASSING OF BUCK MICKEL\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who \nwas a friend, a leading businessman, and one of the most public \nspirited South Carolinians I have ever had the honor to know, Buck \nMickel, who passed away last week.\n  Buck is best known and remembered for his leadership of the Fluor \nCorporation, one of the leading construction companies in the world. \nBuck began his career with Daniel Construction Company, which would \nlater merge with Fluor, in 1948 and he very quickly began his climb up \nthe corporate ladder. By the beginning of 1965, he was elected \nPresident and General Manager, and in 1974, he was elected as Chairman \nof the Board, a position he retained until he retired in 1987.\n  Not surprisingly, a businessman who possessed the talents Buck did \nwas respected and admired throughout the corporate community. As a \nresult, he was asked to participate in many different ventures. He held \nmore than twenty directorships and served on numerous boards. He was \nrecognized with honors that included being named the 1983 ``Businessman \nof the Year'' by the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, and being \ninducted into the South Carolina Business Hall of Fame.\n  In his role as a corporate executive, Buck certainly helped to make \nsignificant contributions to South Carolina\n\n[[Page S9549]]\n\nby creating jobs and generating revenues for the Palmetto State, but \nhis efforts to benefit our home state went far beyond what he was able \nto accomplish as a businessman. Buck was a tireless and enthusiastic \nadvocate for education, and served as a life trustee of both my alma \nmater Clemson University, and of Converse College, as well as on the \nboards of the Georgia Institute of Technology, Furman University, \nPresbyterian College, and Wofford College. Furthermore, he was a member \nof the Advisory Boards of the South Carolina Foundation of Independent \nColleges, the University of South Carolina Business School, and the \nNational Advisory Council. His efforts to promote higher education in \nSouth Carolina not only earned him the respect and admiration of \ncitizens, educators, and government officials, but helped to create a \nbetter education system in the Palmetto State.\n  Buck's sense of service certainly must have been instilled in him at \na very young age as he served in the United States Merchant Marine \nduring World War II, and then in the Army during the Korean War. This \ndesire to contribute continued throughout his life and manifested \nitself in many ways, including his commitment to education, and through \nhis philanthropic actions, both as a private citizen and as the \nChairman of the Daniel/Mickel Foundation.\n  On a more personal note, Buck was a devoted friend and supporter who \nwas always ready to help me however he could. He served as an officer \non several of my re-election campaigns and played an important role in \nhelping to get the Strom Thurmond Institute built at Clemson \nUniversity.\n  Mr. President, it is never easy to summarize the accomplishments of a \nman such as Buck Mickel who has given so much of himself and achieved \nso much. That he passed at such a young age only compounds the sadness \nall who knew him feel at his death, but we all take consolation in the \nfact that he leaves behind an enviable record of successes as a \nbusinessman and of helping others. My condolences go out to his widow, \nMinor Herndon Mickel; their children Minor Shaw, Buck, and Charles; as \nwell as their five grandchildren. They can be proud of the work their \nhusband, father, and grand-father did, as well as the reputation he \nleaves behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9548-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MAJOR PRESTON JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, even those who possess essentially no \nknowledge of military affairs or military history understand the \nsignificance of the green beret worn by those who serve in the United \nStates Army Special Forces, as well as what that headgear indicates \nabout the soldier wearing it.\n  Established in the early days of the cold war, the Green Berets were \nintended to be a versatile, unconventional force that could do \neverything from serve as instructors and advisors to carryout both \nhumanitarian and direct action missions. Over the past almost fifty \nyears, those who have served in the Special Forces have established a \nwell deserved and well respected reputation for bravery, dedication to \nduty, and patriotism. There is ample reason that so many people, not \nonly in the United States but throughout the world, know just how \nspecial an individual the man who wears the Green Beret is. Today, I \nrise to pay tribute to one of those men. Major Preston Johnson, who has \nleft his assignment at the Special Operations Command Office of \nLegislative Affairs to attend the Marine Corps Command and General \nStaff College.\n  Major Johnson began his military career the tough way, by enlisting \nin the United States Army following his 1985 graduation from Rice \nUniversity. His ability and leadership skills were obviously apparent \nfrom his early days in the Army as a recruit going through basic \ntraining, as he was selected to attend Officer Candidate School. A \nlittle more than one year after graduating from basic training, Preston \nJohnson pinned on the gold bar of a Second Lieutenant and the crossed \nrifles brass of the Infantry and began what has been a career dedicated \nto not only the Army, but to special operations.\n  Over the past thirteen years Preston Johnson has accumulated a resume \nof impeccable credentials in Army special operations. He began his \ncareer as an Infantryman in the 3rd Ranger Battalion, in Fort Benning, \nGeorgia, and continued it after OCS as both a Rifle Platoon Leader and \nLong Range Reconnaissance Platoon leader in Fort Lewis, Washington \nwhere he served with the 2nd Battalion/47th Infantry and the 1st \nSquadron/9th US Cavalry. The Rangers are well known for their \ntoughness, expertise in small unit tactics, and for an impressive \nrecord in battle. Certainly, the lessons Preston Johnson learned when \nhe wore the black beret of the Regiment served him well not only as an \nInfantryman in the deep woods of Fort Lewis, but when he volunteered \nfor Special Forces training in 1990 and in the years he has served in \nthe Green Berets as well.\n  Over the past eight-years Preston Johnson has held a number of \nassignments in the Special Forces that have led him around the world \nand have included serving as: Detachment Commander of Special Forces \nOperational Detachment A-363 in the 3rd Special Forces Group \n(Airborne); Company Commander of the Special Forces Selection and \nAssessment Company; Aide-de-Camp to Major General William Garrison, the \nCommanding General of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and \nSchool; and as the Battalion Operations Officer of the 2nd Battalion, \n1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne). Additionally, he has \nearned recognitions that reflect that Major Johnson is truly a member \nof one of the nation's most elite military forces.\n  Of course, many of us know him from his last assignment with the \nSpecial Operations Command Office of Legislative Affairs, where he has \nworked hard, especially with members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, to assist us with our efforts to create a military force \ncapable of meeting the security challenges of the post-Cold War era. If \nwe are going to protect the citizens, borders, and interests of our \nnation, we must be prepared to counter possible threats that include \nnuclear, biological and chemical warfare; ethnic warfare; intranational \nwarefare; and, regional conflicts. Furthermore, we must build strong \nbilateral ties with the militaries of other nations, and there is no \nquestion that we will have to rely increasingly upon those who serve in \nspecial operations units to meet these goals. The skills and unique \ncapabilities the special operations community possess will be \ninvaluable in ensuring that the United States enjoys peace and \nstability into the 21st Century.\n  On almost every continent around the world, members of the United \nStates Special Operations Command are carrying out missions that help \nto protect American security and vital national interests. They operate \nin a world that requires that they rarely acknowledge their purpose, \nand they almost never receive credit for a job well done. Recognition, \nhowever, is not what motivates these ``quiet professionals'', and we \nare indeed fortunate to have such selfless individuals who are willing \nto serve our nation and make the sacrifices they do. Major Johnson is \nan excellent example of the caliber of individual who volunteers for a \ncareer in special operations. He has represented the Special Operations \nCommand well on Capitol Hill and I have every confidence that he will \ncontinue to distinguish himself in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9549-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9549-S9550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, a few hundred miles south of here, \nstands Fort Bragg, a sprawling military installation that is the home \nof the 82nd Airborne Division, and where thousands of paratroopers are \nready to go anywhere in the world, ``stand in the door'', and jump into \nharm's way in order to protect the national security and vital \ninterests of the United States. Today, I am pleased to remind my \ncolleagues that August 16, 1998 has been designated ``National Airborne \nDay'' as a way to honor all those who have worn the winged parachute \nbadge on their uniform.\n  Though the concept of using airborne troops in warfare is only a \nlittle more than fifty years old, the versatility and effectiveness of \nthese forces is above question. In particular, ``America's Guard of \nHonor'', the 82nd Airborne Division, has established an especially \nproud record over the past five decades.\n\n[[Page S9550]]\n\n  During World War II, the paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division \nparticipated in the campaigns of Anzio, Normandy--where I landed with \nthe 325th Glider Infantry Regiment--, and the Battle of the Bulge. In \nthe years that have passed since the surrender of the Axis powers, the \n82nd Airborne Division has been involved in almost every major military \noperation undertaken by the United States. Among other places, \nparatroopers have deployed to the Dominican Republic; Vietnam; Grenada; \nPanama; and Southwest Asia in order to protect the security, interests, \nand citizens of the United States. In each and every instance, those \nwho wear the ``Double AA'' patch on their shoulder have distinguished \nthemselves as brave soldiers, determined warriors, and great Americans.\n  Mr. President, we are indeed fortunate to have the 82nd Airborne \nDivision as an integral part of the United States Army. That the \nparatroopers of the 82nd are ready to deploy anywhere in the world with \njust a few hours notice is testament to the bravery, professionalism, \nand patriotism of these soldiers. I think it is only fitting that we \nhonor all those who have ever served in the 82nd Airborne Division, or \nwho have ever worn the parachutist badge, by remembering them on August \n16, ``National Airborne Day''. This is a small, but worthy, way to \nrecognize the contributions that the Airborne Soldiers of our Army have \nmade to keeping the United States free and safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9549-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN HONOR OF KENTUCKY STATE POLICE 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr President. In 1948, back in my home state of Kentucky, \nGovernor Earle C. Clements made the Commonwealth the 38th state to \nenact a State Police Act. Kentucky was changing rapidly, and Governor \nClements saw a need for a statewide police force to support the local \nauthorities. With this measure, Kentucky kicked off fifty proud years \nof state police enforcement.\n  For each twist and turn through the last half century, the Kentucky \nState Police have responded by continuing to push themselves to provide \nthe best service they can to protect Kentuckians. The police motto is \n``To Serve and Protect,'' but the Kentucky State Police have another \nslogan as well--``A Proud Past . . . A Prouder Tomorrow.'' That says it \nall about this group of men and women so committed to Kentucky.\n  The first decade of the agency brought the very first pay raise to \nstate police officers. Their pay went from $130 to $150 a month. In the \nFifties, the state police took to the air with the first aircraft \npurchase while they still patrolled the highways in ``incognito \nsquads,'' as they called them, checking for speeders and overweight \ntrucks.\n  The Sixties put the officers in gray cars just like their gray \nuniforms, creating an instantly recognizable presence in person and on \nthe roadways. The Kentucky State Police responded to a need they \nperceived statewide by creating Trooper Island, a cost-free summer camp \nfor underprivileged boys on a former Army Corps of Engineers island in \nDale Hollow Lake. To this day, boys and girls who otherwise would be \nunable to attend a camp come for a wonderful week of fun dedicated to \nthe development of their self-images.\n  The Seventies brought massive upheaval to the entire country, and \nKentucky was no different. A drug enforcement unit became necessary for \nthe agency, and the first female trooper was hired. A computerized \nnetwork was set up linking state and local law enforcement to crime \ninformation.\n  In the Eighties, the Kentucky State Police coordinated with the \nKentucky National Guard to begin a full scale marijuana eradication \neffort. In response to a national movement, a toll-free hotline for \nreporting drunken drivers was established. And this decade brought \nvideo cameras installed in patrol cars, a centralized laboratory with \nstate-of-the-art equipment, and the 911 phone system in local \ncommunities was linked to the statewide network. Today there are \nsixteen field posts distributed throughout the state, 1,000 officers, \nand comprehensive law enforcement resources. The Kentucky State Police \nhave responded to each and every change, continually making themselves \nto be the best force they could be.\n  In light of recent events at the Capitol, I am more aware than ever \nof the ways police put themselves on the line to protect our safety \neach and every day. It takes a special calling and an extraordinary \ncommitment to choose police work as your life's work. They have chosen \nto get up every day and protect us. They do it even though we often \ntake them for granted, even though the work can be thankless, even \nthough they could lose their life. I am so appreciative of those men \nand women who serve this country in such a noble way, and today I want \nto honor the men and women of the Kentucky State Police who have served \nKentucky in their own noble way for fifty years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9550-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9550-S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SURFACE TRANPORTATION BOARD AND THE CONRAIL ACQUISITION DECISION\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Surface \nTransportation Board (Board) for its recent actions approving the \napplication of CSX and Norfolk Southern to acquire Conrail. As the \nBoard's 424-page written decision of July 23, 1998, explains in great \ndetail, this merger transaction as approved will bring railroad \ncompetition into the East like no merger has ever done before, and it \nwill provide the opportunity for economic growth and more jobs both on \nand off the rail system throughout the Northeast and the South, \nincluding my state of South Carolina. I appreciate the way in which the \nBoard acted in this proceeding in the public interest, promoting more \ncompetition while preserving the strength of the transaction as \nproposed.\n  The Board is the independent economic regulatory agency that oversees \nthe nation's rail transportation industry. Under the leadership of \nLinda Morgan, the Board's Chairman, who was with us on the Commerce \nCommittee for many years, the Board, with its staff of 135, puts out \nmore work than much larger agencies, issuing well-reasoned, thoughtful, \nand balanced decisions in tough, contentious cases. In particular I \nwould like to commend the efforts of Linda Morgan, the Chairman of the \nSurface Transportation Board. Prior to assuming the Chairmanship, Linda \nworked for the Senate Commerce Committee. Her tireless efforts were \nintegral in completing difficult work in a relatively small time frame. \nWhen we eliminated the Interstate Commerce Commission, I think that we \nunderestimated the degree of work and the complexity of issues that \ncontinue to be brought before the Board, and in hindsight I believe \nthat we cut personnel too deeply. The Board has recently issued \ndecisions dealing with the rail service emergency in the West; several \ndifficult rail rate cases; matters involving Amtrak; and proceedings \ninitiated at the request of Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison to \nreview the status of access and competition in the railroad industry. \nIn each of these matters, it has taken on hard issues and has resolved \nthem fairly and competently.\n  The CSX/Norfolk Southern/Conrail proceeding is the most recent \nexample of the Board's ability to address difficult issues with broad \nramifications and reach a result under the law that promotes the public \ninterest by best addressing the needs of all concerned. In that case, \nthe Board was presented with a merger proposal that was inherently \nprocompetitive. The railroads themselves brought to the Board a \ntransaction that overall would create two strong, balanced competitors \nin the East with the ability to provide improved and more competitive \nrail service opportunities throughout the Northeast and the South. The \ntransaction contemplates substantial investment in railroad \ninfrastructure, which we desperately need to accommodate the Nation's \nexpanding economy, and it is expected that, over time, the merger \nshould produce over $1 billion annually in quantifiable public benefits \nand numerous other benefits.\n  Although the overall competitive and other benefits of the merger \nproposal, which were reflected in several negotiated settlements, were \nwell recognized, various interests wanted the Board to impose \nconditions to address environmental and safety issues or to\n\n[[Page S9551]]\n\nmodify the competitive balance reflected in the original proposal. It \nwas in addressing these requests that the Board represented the public \nthe best. The Board encouraged CSX and Norfolk Southern to work further \nwith the various rail users and other interested parties and see if \nthey could resolve the remaining issues themselves. As a result of this \nprocess, many settlements were reached, which undoubtedly produced \nresolutions better than the Government could have directed from \nWashington, D.C. Where settlements could not be reached, however, the \nBoard acted responsibly and fairly. After two long days of oral \nargument, it issued a decision that smartly balanced the competing \ninterests and imposed various conditions to mitigate environmental \nimpacts; to preserve and improve the competitive posture of affected \nshippers and regions without upsetting the integrity of the \nprocompetitive merger transaction that the railroads originally \npresented; to promote balanced regional economic development by \nassuring that smaller railroads that provide essential services will be \nviable and will continue to be able to compete; to recognize the \nlegitimate interests of rail employees; and to promote a safe and \nsmooth transition to a more competitive and efficient rail system in \nthe East.\n  The Board's action on this merger application will preserve and \npromote competition throughout the Nation; will ensure an improved \ntransportation network that will connect the North and the South in \nhistoric ways; and will provide that, overall, shippers will be better \noff after the merger than they were before, and that none will have \nfewer service options than they had before. I congratulate the Board on \nits action in this matter, and on its other significant work since its \ncreation in 1996.\n  On Wednesday, July 29, the Commerce Committee overwhelmingly approved \na one-year reauthorization of the Board, which I joined Chairman McCain \nin sponsoring. I want to reemphasize here today my commitment to seeing \nthat the Board will be in business for a long time and will be given \nthe resources that it needs to continue its vital work.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \ncommenting opinion by Chairman Morgan, included in the Board's decision \nin the Conrail matter, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Commenting Opinion by Chairman Linda J. Morgan\n\n       Our job in assessing rail mergers is to balance a variety \n     of factors and issue a decision that advances the public \n     interest. The decision we are issuing today, which approves \n     with conditions the Conrail merger application, will advance \n     the public interest in many important ways. The application \n     promotes competition, and our decision applies the authority \n     of the Board to enhance competition even further.\n       The Strength of the Merger Application. The merger \n     application we are approving today, as enhanced by the many \n     conditions we are imposing, will result in a procompetitive \n     restructuring of railroad service throughout much of the \n     Eastern United States. When the hard work is done, and this \n     complex transaction is fully consummated, both CSX and NS \n     will provide vigorous, balanced, and sustainable competition, \n     each over approximately 20,000 miles of rail line in the \n     East.\n       Most notably, CSX and NS are prepared to aggressively \n     compete with each other in many important markets where \n     Conrail now faces limited or no competition from other major \n     railroads. Shippers will benefit from new head-to-head rail \n     competition within shared assets areas and joint access \n     areas. And this merger will enhance competition for many \n     localities outside of these areas as well. In Buffalo, for \n     example, while not every shipper will have direct service by \n     two carriers, the transaction will create a two-carrier \n     presence that will benefit shippers; and CSX's activities in \n     the New York City area will face more competitive discipline \n     than Conrail's do now, from the nearby presence of the New \n     Jersey shared assets area. Finally, this transaction will \n     enable both CSX and NS to compete more effectively with motor \n     carrier service, which is a dominant mode of freight \n     transportation throughout the East.\n       In short, shippers throughout the East will have more \n     transportation options than they have had in decades. And \n     they will have more competitive service, at reasonable rates, \n     than they have ever had before.\n       Additionally, the transaction, when it is fully in place, \n     will have a broad positive economic effect. It will produce \n     an impressive $1 billion annually in quantifiable public \n     benefits and numerous other benefits. The capital that will \n     be invested in expanded rail infrastructure will benefit all \n     shippers, not just those that are served by the applicants, \n     and it will create new jobs both on and off of the rail \n     system. The support of more than 2,200 shippers from a broad \n     spectrum of commodity groups, 350 public officials, 80 \n     railroads, many state and local government interests \n     throughout the East, and various rail labor employees attests \n     to the overall strength of the proposal.\n       This merger will promote competitive balance throughout an \n     entire region of the country. And it will create a strong \n     rail network in the East that can handle the transportation \n     needs of an expanding economy and advance important economic \n     growth and development in the region. These benefits clearly \n     and significantly advance the public interest.\n       Preservation of the Fundamental Integrity of the \n     Transaction. Our decision, while imposing important \n     additional procompetitive conditions, recognizes the \n     operational and competitive integrity of the proposal and the \n     importance of preserving and promoting privately negotiated \n     agreements. Government should not be in the business of \n     fundamentally restructuring private-sector initiatives that \n     are inherently sound, and the conditions that we are imposing \n     add value, but not in a way that undermines the transaction \n     itself. They reflect a respect for the carefully crafted \n     structural soundness of the merger proposal, including its \n     shared assets and joint access areas, and for the numerous \n     settlement agreements that we encouraged and that the \n     applicants and the other parties have worked hard to reach--\n     agreements like the National Industrial Transportation League \n     (NITL) settlement, the United Transportation Union (UTU) and \n     Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers settlements, the \n     Cleveland area environmental settlements, and so many more. \n     These private-sector agreements have clearly added value to \n     the transaction that was initially proposed, from a \n     competitive perspective and in other ways, and the parties \n     are to be commended for furthering the public interest in \n     this way. There is a strong public interest in encouraging \n     private parties to negotiate procompetitive transactions such \n     as this one, and government action that discourages such \n     private-sector initiative is not in the public interest.\n       The Procompetitive Use of the Board's Authority. While our \n     decision preserves the strength and integrity of the \n     proposal, it also applies the Board's authority fully and \n     reasonably to further promote competition to the benefit of \n     many geographic regions. The additional conditions, which go \n     beyond the already regionally procompetitive effect of the \n     original transaction and the further procompetitive effect of \n     the many settlements, enhance the railroad alternatives for \n     areas in New York State and New England that had lost carrier \n     options through the creation of Conrail.\n       Our decision also applies the Board's authority to further \n     enhance the positions of many users. Our decision imposes the \n     NITL settlement and expands in a logical way the \n     procompetitive aspects of that settlement. By giving shippers \n     the opportunity to exercise any antiassignment clauses or \n     other similar provisions in their existing contracts after 6 \n     months following the division of Conrail's assets, our \n     decision preserves the operational integrity of the \n     transaction, but still gives those shippers, including many \n     chemical, coal, and intermodal shippers, the opportunity to \n     use the contract terms they have bargained for to take \n     advantage of their new competitive options sooner rather than \n     later. By preserving the settlements of many railroads and \n     shippers such as coal and utility shippers, while imposing \n     conditions to assist others such as aggregates shippers, and \n     smaller railroads that provide important services, our \n     decision ensures that, overall, shippers will be better off \n     after the merger than they were before, and that none will \n     have less service than they had before.\n       In this regard, our decision recognizes the important role \n     of smaller railroads in providing essential and competitive \n     services in various regions affected by this transaction. By \n     assuring that smaller railroads that provide essential \n     services in such areas as the Ohio region and New England \n     will remain viable and will continue to be able to compete, \n     the conditions promote important competitive options and \n     further regional economic development.\n       Operational and Implementation Success. Our decision, with \n     its significant operational reporting and monitoring, \n     recognizes the operational challenges that the transaction \n     presents. Its monitoring elements will provide the Board with \n     the tools to further a smooth implementation of the merger in \n     a way that utilizes the Conrail Transaction Council and the \n     Labor Task Forces and does not unduly burden the parties. And \n     it appropriately focuses on specific areas of concern, such \n     as the shared assets areas and the Chicago gateway. Having \n     been given the personal commitment of the Chief Executive \n     Officers of both applicant railroads to make the merger work, \n     I am confident that this merger will be implemented smoothly \n     and will result in overall service improvements in relatively \n     short order. The conditions we are imposing, however, will \n     make sure that we are on top of the situation in case it does \n     not.\n       Protection of the Environment. Our decision appropriately \n     protects the environment. The transaction has many \n     environmental benefits, including the anticipated removal\n\n[[Page S9552]]\n\n     of over 1 million truck trips a year from our Nation's \n     highways. At the same time, the proposal raised environmental \n     concerns. In response, for the first time ever in a merger, \n     the Board issued a full environmental impact statement. We \n     also have encouraged the railroads and local communities to \n     meet and attempt to address issues privately, and several \n     have been able to successfully resolve their concerns. In \n     Cleveland, for example, a key traffic center for this merger, \n     the parties, after months of discussion, have reached \n     mutually acceptable agreements that preserve the operational \n     integrity of the transaction while addressing important \n     community life concerns. I am pleased that we are able to \n     give effect to win-win settlements such as this one, and \n     others in the area surrounding Cleveland and in so many other \n     places. At the same time, for the communities that could not \n     reach agreement with the carriers, our decision does provide \n     necessary and appropriate conditions pertaining to grade-\n     crossing safety, hazardous materials, traffic delay and \n     noise, among others. And, with the recommended mitigation \n     that the applicants have agreed to carry out, the transaction \n     will not have, and cannot be viewed as having, a \n     disproportionately high and adverse impact on minority and \n     low-income areas.\n       The Promotion of Safety. Our decision clearly promotes \n     safety. More than half of the environmental conditions \n     involve safety. For the first time ever in a merger, the \n     applicants were required to submit safety integration plans. \n     And, as part of the merger implementation oversight, the \n     implementation of these plans will be carefully monitored \n     through a memorandum of understanding between the Board and \n     the Department of Transportation, which clearly represents a \n     cooperative governmental initiative in the public interest.\n       Recognition of Employee Interests. As previously discussed, \n     the proposal before us will mean more jobs overall in the \n     long run. And, by adopting the UTU proposal in mandating the \n     creation of Labor Task Forces to focus on issues such as \n     safety and operations, our decision will help promote safety \n     and quality of life for employees. Also, our decision \n     provides the protections of New York Dock, and it reaffirms \n     the negotiation and arbitration process as the proper way to \n     resolve important issues relating to employee rights. Thus, \n     the Board has made clear in its decision, as requested by \n     rail labor, that the Board's approval of the application does \n     not indicate approval or disapproval of any of the involved \n     CBA overrides that the applicants have argued are necessary.\n       Overall Benefits. The package we are approving should \n     clearly promote the public interest. The original \n     transaction, with its subsequently negotiated agreements, and \n     with the conditions we are imposing, will provide many \n     benefits to many people. The extensive oversight and \n     monitoring will help us to ensure that these benefits will \n     materialize, and the private mechanisms in place for \n     oversight will provide a vehicle by which the important and \n     constructive private-sector dialogue, initiated prior to the \n     Board's decision today among the applicants, other railroads, \n     shippers, employees, and affected communities, can continue.\n       Our decision promotes private-sector initiatives that are \n     in the public interest and represents good, common sense \n     government. It provides a resolution that is best for the \n     national interest at large, and for the East in particular. \n     Approval of this merger as conditioned is an historic moment \n     for the Board, for transportation, and for the Nation as a \n     whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9550-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NICKEL SOLUTION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to \nrecognize the 15-year anniversary of a unique partnership between labor \nand management in the glass container manufacturing industry. This \nhighly successful program in the glass container industry is called the \n``Industry Union Glass Container Promotion Program'' or Nickel \nSolution. This effort is a fine example of workers and employers \njoining together during a time of change and transition in America's \noldest industry. Since the 1700s, the men and women who make glass \ncontainers have demonstrated a steadfast commitment to produce the best \nin glass packaging. The Nickel Solution is one shining example of that \ndedication.\n  The State of Pennsylvania is home to six glass container \nmanufacturing plants--more than any other state except California. \nThese facilities mean good paying jobs for approximately 3,000 \nPennsylvanians and are major employers in Brockway, Clarion, \nConnellsville, Crenshaw, Glenshaw and Port Allegany, Pennsylvania.\n  The Nickel Solution was based originally on voluntary contributions \nof a nickel per hour of pay from glass container industry employees to \nsupport a national fund to promote glass packaging and safeguard jobs. \nIn turn, employers matched the contributions, setting the stage for \njoint cooperation and promotion.\n  Through glass plant public relations committees, staffed by employee \nvolunteers, the glass container industry's interests are well monitored \nand protected. Employees educate communities about glass recycling, \nconduct ``buy in glass'' promotions, and act as the front line for \nlocal, regional, and state advocacy. The Nickel Solution has enabled \nboth labor and management to accomplish their goals of relative \nstability and secure employment for thousands of people in some 60 \nplants in 24 states throughout the country.\n  The Nickel Solution is simple and works, proving its value time and \nagain. The Nickel Solution has enabled the glass container industry to \nmarch forward to a brighter future.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Department of Labor has recognized this \nprogram as a ``model for the 21st century.'' In addition, Labor \nSecretary Herman has recognized this anniversary in the form of a \nletter congratulating the men and women of the U.S. glass container \nindustry. I ask unanimous consent that the Secretary's letter be \nprinted in the Record and I salute the great success of the Nickel \nSolution and the workers and management of the glass container \nindustry.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Secretary of Labor,\n\n                                          Washington, May 4, 1998.\n     Mr. James Rankin,\n     International President, Glass, Molders, Pottery and Allied \n         Workers International Union, Media, PA.\n       Dear Mr. Rankin: On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of \n     the Industry-Union Container Promotion Program, I want to \n     compliment the men and women of the North American glass \n     container industry for their continued dedication to the well \n     being of America's oldest industry. I also want to compliment \n     the unique labor-management partnership for its tradition of \n     cooperation, environmental stewardship and job preservation.\n       The Industry Union Glass Container Promotion Program--or \n     Nickel Solution--is a fine example of workers and employers \n     joining together to strengthen an important U.S. industry \n     during a time of transition and transformation. Working \n     together, you have made sure that the glass container \n     industry will continue to thrive well into the 21st century.\n       Congratulations and best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n     Alexis M.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to recognize \nthe Air Force Office of Special Investigations on its 50th anniversary, \nAugust 1, 1998.\n  The Office of Special Investigation was created in 1948 at the \nsuggestion of the 80th Congress. Then Secretary of the Air Force Stuart \nSymington consolidated and centralized the investigative services of \nthe United States Air Force to create an organization that would \nconduct independent and objective criminal investigations. Since 1948, \nthe Office of Special Investigations has evolved into an organization \nthat not only conducts criminal and fraud investigations, but \ninvestigates and thwarts terrorism and espionage, pursues military \nfugitives, and maintains the security of the Air Force's computer \nsystems. The Office of Special Investigations has truly adapted to \nfulfill the needs of the United States Air Force in the 21st Century.\n  At present, 2,000 men and women serve in the Office of Special \nInvestigations. In more than 150 offices across the United States and \nin a dozen offices overseas, these men and women perform the \ninvestigative work of the United States Air Force wherever and whenever \nthey are needed. I am proud to be among the 11,000 alumni of the Office \nof Special Investigations. I served as a lieutenant in the OSI from \n1951 through 1953 and was assigned to the Pennsylvania, West Virginia, \nand Delaware District. My experience allowed me to serve my country, \nhone my investigative skills, and better prepare me for a career in the \nlaw and in government.\n  It gives me great pleasure, Mr. President, to stand before you and \nsalute the Office of Special Investigations on the occasion of its 50th \nanniversary. Its legacy of service, integrity, and excellence continues \ntoday. A better motto\n\n[[Page S9553]]\n\ncould not have been chosen to commemorate OSI's 50th anniversary: \n``Preserving Our Legacy, Protecting our Future.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9552-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO DETECTIVE JOHN GIBSON, OFFICER JACOB CHESTNUT, AND THE \n                      UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

I rise to express my \nprofound sorrow over the death of Officer Chestnut and Detective John \nGibson, and to extend my sympathy to the families, friends, and fellow \nofficers of these two brave men. The tremendous outpouring of grief and \nrespect we have experienced and witnessed during the Congressional \nceremony and honors on Tuesday, and in the requiem services for \nDetective Gibson and Officer Chestnut over the past two days are \nfitting tribute to the courage and selfless sacrifice of these fallen \nheroes.\n  The deaths of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, killed in the \nline of duty as they defended all of us who are privileged to work and \nvisit the Capitol, is a testament to the fidelity and valor of these \nmen, as well as a reminder of the exceptional bravery and courage of \nthe men and women of the Capitol Police who protect the Capitol complex \nand grounds. We are fortunate to have these officers on the job, \nprotecting all of us, willing to confront the dangers and violence that \ntoo often afflict our world today, so that our Capitol can remain open \nand accessible to the public. The professionalism, pride, and good-\nnatured courtesy which these officers bring to their duties, day in and \nday out, serves our democracy by keeping the Capitol open to the people \nand safeguarding, with their lives if necessary, the freedom and \nliberty we cherish.\n  On the Capitol dome, looking across the Capital City, stands the \nStatue of Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace, an emblem of democracy \nand hope, a symbol of America's promise that every citizen has the \nfreedom and opportunity to realize their God given potential. In her \nright hand Freedom holds an olive branch, in her left, a sword, a \nreminder that the preservation of freedom and democracy often requires \nsacrifice.\n  Over the course of our history, the Capitol has witnessed stirring \noratory and the passage of landmark legislation which have inspired us, \nstrengthened our nation, restored hope, preserved our Republic, and \nmaintained our resolve. The heroic actions of Officer Chestnut and \nOfficer Gibson, who acted to preserve and protect life without regard \nto their own safety, bonds deeds to the ideals and values we celebrate \nand honor here at the heart of our democracy.

I \nhave come to know and respect Commissioner Aikens and Commissioner \nMcGarry first as a member of the Committee and now in my capacity as \nChairman, and I can honestly report that these two individuals have \nserved this agency, and their country, well.\n  Commissioner Aikens is a native of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. She \nwas appointed to her first term by President Ford and has served 23 \nyears at the Commission. Mrs. Aikens is an ardent believer in the First \nAmendment and its importance in interpreting federal election law. Her \nqualities of fairness and impartiality will be missed by her colleagues \nin the election law community.\n  Commissioner McGarry is a native of Massachusetts. He was appointed \nto this first term by President Carter. During his 20-year tenure at \nthe FEC, he worked tirelessly for full public disclosure and uniform \nenforcement of campaign finance laws. Mr. McGarry believes that agency \ndeliberations and decisions should take into consideration not only \nfundamental First Amendment interests, but also the government's \ninterests in ensuring elections free from real or apparent corruption.\n  Mr. President, I salute Commissioners Aikens and McGarry for their \nservice to our nation and wish them the best of luck as they begin a \nnew chapter in their lives.\n  Mr. FORD. I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague and Chairman, Senator Warner. I, too, would \nlike to express my appreciation to Commissioners Aikens and McGarry for \ntheir many years of service at the Federal Election Commission. I have \nenjoyed working with them and especially admired their commitment to \nthe fair and impartial enforcement of election law. To both of them and \ntheir families I extend my sincere congratulations and best wishes for \nmany happy, healthy, and fulfilling future years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9553-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9553-S9554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. ERNEST A. YOUNG\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Ernest A. Young \non the occasion of his retirement from the Department of the Army. \nThroughout his 40 years of Federal Service, culminating in his current \nposition as Deputy to the Commanding General, U.S. Army Aviation and \nMissile Command, Mr. Young has distinguished himself time and time \nagain as an individual of the utmost integrity, capability, and \nforesight.\n  Mr. Young began his career as an Army civilian employee in 1958, as a \ntechnical program specialist. He held managerial positions for various \nmissile programs, including the very successful HAWK missile. Twenty-\nthree years later, in September 1981, he was appointed to the Senior \nExecutive Service where he held several key command and staff positions \nwith the U.S. Army Missile Command.\n  Mr. Young continued to rise through the ranks, and in June 1993, he \nwas the first civilian to be selected as the Deputy to the Commanding \nGeneral of the U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM). In this position, Mr. \nYoung was responsible for achieving all of the command's missions. Due \nin large part to his leadership, MICOM maintained a high state of \nreadiness by adhering to procurement schedules and successfully \nexecuting weapons development programs despite the enormous challenge \nposed by shrinking annual defense budgets. Mr. Young's dedication to \nefficiency was recognized as MICOM became the first major subordinate \ncommand of the Army Materiel Command to be designated as a Reinvention \nLaboratory. Though faced with funding shortages, his skills also \nenabled him to implement several human resource initiatives that \nobviated the need for a reduction in force during his tenure as Deputy \nto the MICOM Commander.\n  Mr. Young, however, may best be remembered for his personal attention \nto the implementation of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure decision \nto consolidate the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM) with \nMICOM at Redstone Arsenal. The fact that 55 percent of ATCOM's aviation \nmanagerial workforce successfully moved to Redstone serves as a \ntestament to Mr. Young's leadership and professionalism during this \ntransition.\n  Since the formation of the Aviation and Missile Command, Mr. Young \nhas continued in his role as Deputy to the Commanding General. While \nthe AMCOM formally merged the various aspects of aviation and missile \nprogram management into a single commodity command, Mr. Young \ndiligently\n\n[[Page S9554]]\n\nworked to integrate the aviation and missile cultures. He continued to \nwork closely with the Commanding General to ensure the uninterrupted \naccomplishment of the procurement, readiness, and materiel development \nmissions and functions of the command.\n  In addition to Mr. Young's exemplary career, his frequent \nparticipation in seminars and workshops designed for senior government \nexecutives demonstrated his continual desire to better himself and \nimprove his technical and managerial capabilities. Moreover, Mr. \nYoung's involvement in such noteworthy associations as the American \nSociety of Military Comptrollers, American Institute of Physics, \nSociety of Logistics Engineers, the American Society for Public \nAdministration and Rotary Club, exemplify his steadfast commitment to \nprofessional improvement and civic duty.\n  Mr. President, for 40 years, Ernest Young has been an asset to the \nU.S. Army, Alabama, and the nation. On behalf of the United States \nSenate and a grateful nation, I thank Mr. Young for his dedicated \nservice as he closes one chapter in his life and begins another.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9553-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               MICROSOFT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate is the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. The U.S. economy is the world's greatest free \nmarket. Lately, it seems my friend and colleague from Utah, Senator \nHatch, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nwould like to use the one to squash the other.\n  As my colleagues and most Americans know, Senator Hatch has joined \nforces with the success-busters of the Antitrust Division of the \nDepartment of Justice to carve out a special place in the market for \ncompanies that cannot compete on their own merits. All of this is being \ndone at the expense of one of America's most successful and innovative \ncompanies--Microsoft.\n  Last week, the Judiciary Committee, for the third time this year, \nserved as a forum for frustrated business executives who have been \noutsmarted and out-innovated by Microsoft.\n  I have continually voiced my objections at the Senate Judiciary's \nCommittee's insistence on inserting itself into battles that should be \nfought in the free market, not in the Halls of the U.S. Senate or in \nthe Justice Department. I have asserted my opinion that U.S. antitrust \nlaws were written with the intent of protecting consumers, not inferior \ncompanies. And I have stood up against those who would like to see the \nfederal government, not the free market, decide which companies are \nsuccessful in this country and which are not.\n\n  But Senator Hatch has offered his committee as a haven for the \nunwashed masses of corporate America, sheltering the weak and wary from \nthe harsh brutality of the free market.\n  This debate has been just that, Mr. President, a debate between two \nSenators with very different opinions on a matter of importance to both \nSenators and to the nation as a whole.\n  Earlier this week, however, I learned of something that troubles me \ndeeply, both as a Senator and as an American.\n  In the July 29, issue of Investor's Business Daily Senator Hatch was \ninterviewed about his views on Microsoft. As my colleagues will recall, \none of the witnesses at last week's hearing was Rob Glaser, CEO of a \ncompany in my home state called RealNetworks, a Microsoft competitor. \nAllegations arose at the hearing, supported by an affidavit from a \nsenior Microsoft executive, that Mr. Glaser had attempted to use his \ntestimony as a negotiating tool in his ongoing battle with Microsoft.\n  According to the affidavit, Mr. Glaser, the night before he was to \ntestify before the Judiciary Committee, called a senior Microsoft \nexecutive and offered to ``negotiate all night if that's what it \ntakes'' to come to terms with Microsoft. The affidavit states that \n``Mr. Glaser said that if the negotiations he proposed . . . resulted \nin an agreement between the two companies, he would not testify the \nnext day.\n  These allegations are disturbing to me, and I had hoped, to Senator \nHatch as well.\n  But Senator Hatch, in his interview with Investor's Business Daily \nseems to support Mr. Glaser's attempt to use the Judiciary Committee as \na tool in his negotiations with Microsoft.\n  When asked about the allegations, Senator Hatch said, ``Glaser said \nhe did not (use the testimony as a negotiating weapon), but what if he \ndid? He's a guy trying to save his business. . .'' The distinguished \nSenator from Utah goes on to say of witnesses that testify before his \ncommittee, ``if they gain something by coming, all the better as far as \nI'm concerned, as long as they tell the truth.''\n  It may be incidental to this attitude, Mr. President, but important \nin the public's mind that it turns out that Microsoft Media Player 5.2 \ndid not disable RealNetworks' new G-2 player--in fact, the culprit was \na bug in the player itself--not only in Microsoft's tests, but in those \nof a number of independent experts as well. So far, Senator Hatch has \nignored this unpleasant news.\n  Our founding fathers must be turning over in their graves, Mr. \nPresident. The United States Senate was never intended to be, and \nshould never be, used as negotiating tool for companies trying to \ncompete in the free market. In fact, the United States Senate was \ndesigned, among other things, to protect that very free market. That \nshould continue to be our goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9554-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and one nomination which was referred to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9554-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT CONCERNING THE ARAB LEAGUE BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 154\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the request contained in section 540 of Public Law \n105-118, Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act, 1998, I submit to you the attached report providing \ninformation on steps taken by the United States Government to bring \nabout an end to the Arab League boycott of Israel and to expand the \nprocess of normalizing ties between Israel and the Arab League \ncountries.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to provide grants to strengthen State and local \nhealth care systems' response to domestic violence by building the \ncapacity of health care professionals and staff to identify, address, \nand prevent domestic violence; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                     the prescription for abuse act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the passage of the Violence Against \nWomen Act in 1994, Congress recognized domestic violence as a serious \nthreat to the health safety of women in this country. We successfully \ncreated vital programs to train the law enforcement and judicial \ncommunities to respond to domestic violence, and further supported \nimportant intervention programs. In some respects, however, we left the \njob only partially addressed. We failed to train and support the \nprofessionals that face victims of domestic violence on a daily basis: \nhealth care professionals and staff.\n  Today, I am pleased that Senator Stevens is joining me in introducing \na bill to fill that gap: ``The Prescription for Abuse Act--(Rx for \nAbuse Act).''\n  Health care professionals and staff are truly on the front lines of \ndomestic violence work. Nearly four million American women are \nphysically abused each year. While our shelters are always overwhelmed, \nnot all women seek shelter. Not all victims call the police. But \neventually, almost all victims seek medical care. Last year, the \nDepartment of Justice reported that more than one in three women who \nsought care in emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were \ninjured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend. And, \nwhile the impact on the health care system is immense, few health care \nsettings have intervened in a comprehensive way to identify, treat, and \nprevent the violence that they see on a daily basis. Of particular \ninterest reported to me by a New Mexico doctor, a significant number of \noffice or emergency room visits are not detected as domestic violence-\nrelated because physicians and staff are not trained to properly \nidentify the signs of a battered victim.\n  Domestic violence is repetitive in nature. According to 1993 data \nfrom the Bureau of Justice Statistics, one in five women victimized by \ntheir spouse or ex-spouse reported that they had been a victim of a \nseries of at least three assaults in the prior six months. \nUnfortunately, the way the system currently works, the bones are set \nand the cuts stitched, but the patients are seldom asked about their \ninjuries or referred to services that can help them stop the violence.\n  Health care providers, professionals, hospitals, emergency health \ncare staff, physical therapists, and domestic violence organizations \nneed to join forces to find ways to identify, address and document \nabuse. They need to work together to ensure the confidentiality and \nsafety of victims, and to connect victims to available services.\n  Violence against women takes a tremendous toll on our health care \nsystem. Battering is a leading cause of injury to women and each year \nmore than a million women seek medical attention because of it. Women \nwho have been battered or sexually assaulted utilize the health care \nsystem at much higher rates than non-abused women, for a variety of \nhealth problems, including repeated injuries, stress-related disorders, \ndepression, and other physical and mental illnesses. And battering \nduring pregnancy increases the risk of premature, low birth weight, or \nstillborn babies. Health care providers and staff are often the first, \nand only, professionals to see a battered woman's injuries. They are in \na unique position to identify abuse before it is reported and to \nintervene in a way that will result in a reduction in the morbidity and \nmortality caused by violence in the home. In far too many ways to \nenumerate, domestic violence is a health care issue. Training health \ncare professionals and staff to recognize, intervene, and refer victims \nto additional assistance is the purpose of this bill.\n  As we are all aware, domestic violence knows no age, educational, \neconomic, or socio-cultural barriers. It is evident in our smallest \ncommunities and our largest cities. In the sparsely-populated State of \nNew Mexico, there are 26 domestic violence shelters that served more \nthan 16,000 unduplicated clients last year. There were 11,400 non-\nresident shelter clients and 5,000 shelter residents, with 77,000 \nnights of shelter provided in one year alone. This represents a thirty-\neight percent increase over a four-year period. The New Mexico \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence and the countless professionals who \nstaff the shelters and clinics across the State know the extent and \nconsequences of the horrific problem of domestic violence on children, \nwomen, and families.\n  I am proud to say that New Mexico is on the cutting edge of a \nstrategy to begin the process of training health care professionals and \nstaff to become more involved in this critical issue. Last month, a \ncollaborative effort of the New Mexico Coalition Against Domestic \nViolence, the New Mexico Medical Society, and the New Mexico Department \nof Health, in partnership with the Family Violence Prevention Fund \nHealth Initiative, pulled together teams from 15 hospitals across the \nState to train health care providers to identify and respond to the \nneeds of domestic violence victims that they treat. Based on the \nongoing work in my State, and similar work in Alaska, Senator Stevens \nand I am introducing a bill to replicate such efforts around the \ncountry.\n  The bill establishes three and four-year demonstration grants to \nstrengthen state and local health care systems' responses to domestic \nviolence by building the capacity of health care professionals and \nstaff to identify, address, and prevent domestic violence among their \npatients. It will give these health care professionals the training, \ntools, and support they need to confidently address the violence that \naffects their patients' health. The bill authorizes ten grants up to \ntwo million dollars each for statewide teams to develop four-year \ndemonstration programs and ten grants up to $450,000 each for local \nteams to direct three-year local level demonstrations. Eligible state \napplicants are state health departments, domestic violence coalitions, \nor the state medical or health professionals' associations or \nsocieties, or other nonprofit or governmental entities that have a \nhistory of work on domestic violence.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that early intervention on the \npart of health professionals can decrease the morbidity and mortality \nthat results from violence in the home. I am pleased to join with \nSenator Stevens in introducing the ``Rx for Abuse Act,'' and I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this measure. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to require \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to establish a pilot program under which \nmilk producers and cooperatives will be permitted to enter into forward \nprice contracts with milk handlers; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  Dairy Forward Pricing Pilot Program\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which will \nhelp the dairy industry manage price volatility. The bill requires the \nSecretary of Agriculture to establish a pilot program under which milk \nproducers and cooperatives will be permitted to enter into forward \nprice contracts with milk handlers.\n\n  The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 required \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture to consolidate the federal milk \nmarketing orders by April 1999, to phase out the dairy price support \nprogram by January 1, 2000, and replace it with a recourse loan program \nfor commercial dairy processors by January 1, 2000, and authorizes \nreforms in the federal milk marketing order system. Movement toward a \nmore market-oriented dairy industry was supported on a bipartisan basis \nin the House and Senate.\n  At a July 29, 1997, Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, witnesses \ntestified that price volatility exists in the dairy industry as it does \nfor other agricultural commodities. However, in the case of the dairy \nindustry, the tools to manage price risk are less developed and the \nknowledge of how to use risk management techniques is below that of \nmost other food commodities.\n  On January 2, 1998, and again on February 25, 1998, I wrote Secretary \nof Agriculture Glickman recommend modification of federal milk \nmarketing orders to permit proprietary handlers of milk to offer dairy \nproducers forward contracts for milk. The department interprets the \napplicable statute as prohibiting the offering of forward contracts \nbecause the contracts would violate a requirement to pay producers a \nminimum price.\n  The legislation I introduce today authorizes the Secretary of \nAgriculture to conduct a three-year pilot program for forward pricing \nof milk. Under the program, milk handlers and producers could \nvoluntarily enter into fixed price contracts for specific volume of \nmilk for an agreed upon period of time. It is intended that the \nSecretary of Agriculture review the forward pricing contracts to ensure \nthat the contracts are consistent with all existing fair agricultural \ntrade practices.\n  Mr. President, it is important that dairy producers and processors be \nafforded risk management tools. I believe this legislation will assist \nin that effort and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2396\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DAIRY FORWARD PRICING PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n       The Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), \n     reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing \n     Agreement Act of 1937, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 23.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nissuance of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance public-private \npartnership activities relating to school facilities in public \nelementary and secondary schools, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               public school construction partnership act\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, teachers, students, parents, and \nschool administrators know that the United States faces a school \ninfrastructure crisis. Many of our schools are more than 50 years old \nand crumbling, and the General Accounting Office estimates that it will \ncost about $112 billion to bring them into good repair. Moreover, this \nestimate does not take into account the need for new construction. The \nU.S. Department of Education projects that some 1.9 million more \nstudents will be entering schools in the next 10 years. At current \nprices, it will cost about $73 billion to build the new schools needed \nto educate this growing student population. Mr. President, I might add \nthat my own State is gaining 60,000 new students each year. By the end \nof the decade, Florida's student enrollment will have increased 25 \npercent more than the population as a whole.\n  Education is rightfully a state and local matter, but the Federal \ngovernment can play a helpful, non-intrusive role in assisting \ncommunities overwhelmed by explosive increases in student enrollment. \nWe at the Federal level should help empower local school districts to \nfind innovative, cost effective ways to finance new schools and repair \naging ones. Let me quote Mr. Roger Cuevas, who is the superintendent of \nschools for Miami-Dade County, FL:\n\n       It is important that financing options be defined in as \n     flexible a manner as possible and especially not be limited \n     to general obligation bonds . . . Flexibility in the choice \n     of the type of eligible debt financing, as well as the \n     capacity of the program to adapt to state-by-state \n     differences are as critical to all school districts in the \n     Nation as is its funding level.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today providing new flexibility to state \nand local efforts to finance new schools and repair older ones. The \nfirst provision provides for public school construction the same \nfinancing opportunities which are currently available in a wide variety \nof other public-need areas namely, airports, seaports, mass transit \nfacilities, water and sewer facilities, solid waste, disposal \nfacilities, qualified residential rental projects, local furnishing of \nelectric energy and gas, heating and cooling facilities, qualified \nhazardous waste facilities, high-speed inter-city rail facilities and \nenvironmental enhancements, of hydroelectric generating facilities. In \nall of these 10 separate areas, the U.S. Congress has provided \nassistance in the financing through what is known as private activity \nbonds.\n  This bill adds public schools in this list. Mr. President, this \nlegislation was part of Senator Coverdell's A Plus Savings Account bill \nthat was passed by the Senate earlier this session. Unfortunately, this \nimportant provision was eliminated by a House-Senate Conference \nCommittee. Mr. President, we now have another chance to do something \nconstructive for our public schools. A recent article in the Washington \nPost reported that education is one of the American people's highest \npriorities. It should be one of our highest priorities too.\n  This legislation provides to each state the opportunity to issue tax-\nexempt private activity bonds to finance construction of public \nschools. These bonds would be administered at the state level, just as \nare the other 10 categories of private activity bonds. States \ncontaining school districts experiencing high growth would be allowed \nto issue bonds each year in an amount equal to $10 multiplied by the \npopulation of the state. For example, if a state with high-growth \nschool districts has a population of 5 million, it could issue up to \n$50 million of bonds to finance school construction. A high-growth \nschool district is one with an enrollment of at least 5,000 students \nand the enrollment has grown by at least 20 percent during the five \nyears previous to the year of bond issue. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, 286 school districts located throughout the \nNation currently meet high-growth qualifications.\n  This proposal puts decisionmaking at the local level. Each state \nwould decide how to allocate its bonding authority among its high-\ngrowth school districts. The state or local education authority would \nenter into an agreement--with the most favorable terms it could \nnegotiate--with a private corporation to build schools. The state would \nissue the bonds, but the private corporation would be responsible for \nservicing the debt on the bonds. The state or local education authority \nwould then lease back the facility. Ownership of the facility would \nrevert to the state or local education authority upon retirement of the \nbonds.\n  There are multiple benefits to permitting states and local school \ndistricts to enter into partnerships with private corporations to build \nschools. First, this mechanism can reduce construction time. For \nexample, it would take a school district issuing $4 million of general \nobligation bonds each year, using the traditional ``pay-as-you-go'' \napproach, about 11 years to finance the construction of three typical \nschools. The lease back mechanism permitted through the use of private \nactivity bonds could result in building three schools within three \nyears of issuing the bonds. Perhaps just as important, this arrangement \nwould permit the use of facilities for other worthwhile purposes when \nschool is not in session.\n  The other component to this legislation provides relief to small or \nrural school districts issuing bonds for school construction. Under \ncurrent law, issuers of school construction bonds worth less than $10 \nmillion are exempt from the arbitrage rebate rules. This bill raises \nthat exemption to $15 million, providing relief from burdensome Federal \nregulations to even more school districts.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support these modest proposals \nto provide some much needed assistance to our public schools.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2397\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on certain drug \nsubstances used as an HIV antiviral drug; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     tariff elimination legislation\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to \neliminate the tariffs on two chemicals, TIC-A and TIC-C, used in the \nproduction of protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors are critical \ncomponents of the ``cocktail'' therapy used for the treatment of the \nHIV virus that causes AIDS.\n  Protease inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment regimen for HIV \npatients. Since Food and Drug Administration approval in 1996, protease \ninhibitors have become effective treatments for HIV patients. These \ntreatments reduce the amount of virus in the blood stream of HIV \npatients to undetectable levels. The result of this treatment regimen \nis that most patients on the ``cocktail'' therapy have been able to \nresume active and productive lives.\n  Protease inhibitors are extremely sophisticated molecules and as a \nresult are very difficult to manufacture.

A bill to authorize the addition of the Paoli Battlefield \nsite in Malvern, Pennsylvania, to Valley Forge National Historical \nPark; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   paoli battlefield site legislation\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to authorize the addition of the Paoli Battlefield site in \nMalvern, Pennsylvania to Valley Forge National Historical Park. The \nPaoli Massacre was an important chapter in the British campaign to \ncapture Philadelphia in 1777. More than 50 American soldiers lost their \nlives when the British attacked and bayoneted General ``Mad'' Anthony \nWayne's forces at Paoli Battlefield. Accordingly, this land needs to be \npreserved as an important part of Pennsylvania's history and our \nnation's history.\n  Congressman Curt Weldon has introduced this legislation in the House \nof Representatives and we are working together with the local community \ntoward enactment of this bill prior to adjournment. The issue is quite \nsimple. The Paoli Battlefield is an unprotected Revolutionary War site \nthat is privately owned by the Malvern Preparatory School. The School \nintends to sell the land in order to strengthen its endowment, but \nofficials agreed to give the community a chance to purchase the land \nfor historical preservation purposes. Thus, the Paoli Battlefield will \nbecome open to residential or commercial development if $2.5 million is \nnot raised by next year to purchase the land. Our bill envisions a \ncombination of public and private financing to purchase the battlefield \nand link it to the protected lands known as Valley Forge National \nHistorical Park. Specifically, the bill authorizes a purchase price of \n$2.5 million with not less than $1 million in nonfederal funds.\n\n[[Page S9561]]\n\n  Too many important historical sites, especially Revolutionary War \nbattlefields, have already been lost to residential and commercial \ndevelopment. The citizens of Malvern, through the Paoli Battlefield \nPreservation Fund, have already raised in excess of $1 million to \nacquire the site. Thus, if the expected $2.5 million price is \nmaintained, adding the Paoli Battlefield to Valley Forge National \nHistorical Park would cost the federal government no more than $1.5 \nmillion. The bill also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to \nenter into a cooperative agreement with the Borough of Malvern, which \nhas agreed to manage the 45-acre site in perpetuity, thereby ensuring \nthat Valley Forge will not have to expend additional federal resources \nfor Park operations on the Paoli Battlefield.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has made a commitment to protecting \nbattlefield sites. I have been pleased to support these efforts as well \nas the effort to obtain funding in the FY99 Interior and Related \nAgencies Appropriations bill to conduct the Revolutionary War and War \nof 1812 Historic Preservation Study. Paoli Battlefield played an \nimportant role in the Revolutionary War, and I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort to protect an important piece of \nAmerican history. Simply put, in a $1.7 trillion federal budget, I \nbelieve that we should be able to find a maximum of $1.5 million in \nfederal funds to preserve a rich part of our history.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2402. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain lands in San Juan County, New Mexico, to San Juan College; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9557-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9561-S9596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE OLD JICARILLA ADMINISTRATIVE SITE CONVEYANCE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to direct \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to convey a ten acre parcel of land, known \nas the old Jicarilla administrative site, to San Juan College. This \nlegislation will provide long-term benefits for the people of San Juan \nCounty, New Mexico, and especially the students and faculty of San Juan \nCollege.\n  This legislation allows for transfer by the Secretary of Agriculture \nreal property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus \nadministrative site of the Carson National Forest to San Juan College. \nThe site is known as the old Jicarilla Ranger District Station, near \nthe village of Gobanador, New Mexico. The Jicarilla Station will \ncontinue to be used for public purposes, including educational and \nrecreational purposes of the college.\n  Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of \nno further use to them, since the Jicarilla District Ranger moved into \na new administrative facility in the town of Bloomfield, New Mexico. \nThe facility has had no occupants for several years, and it is my \nunderstanding that the Forest Service reported to the General Services \nAdministration that the improvements on the site were considered \nsurplus, and would be available for disposal under their administrative \nprocedures.\n  This legislation is patterned after S. 1510, approved by the Senate \nearlier this month, by which the property and improvements of a \nsimilarly abandoned Forest Service facility in New Mexico will be \ntransferred to Rio Arriba County. The administration has indicated its \nsupport for the passage of that bill, and I hope that this bill will \ngain their support, as well.\n  Mr. President, since the Forest Service has no interest in \nmaintaining Federal ownership of this land and the surplus facilities, \nand San Juan College could put this small tract to good use, this \nlegislation is a win-win situation for the federal government and \nnorthwestern New Mexico. I look the Senate's rapid consideration of \nthis legislation, and urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2402\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: The United States Forest Service has \n     indicated a willingness to turn some property over to San \n     Juan College. The property was formerly the Carson National \n     Forest Jicarilla District Visitor Center Site. It is located \n     in Gobernador and was formerly the headquarters for the \n     Forest Service for this area. The office has subsequently \n     moved into Bloomfield, and the property has had no occupants \n     for several years.\n       At the suggestion of Phil Settles, the Forest Service \n     Director, I would like to request that some legislation be \n     introduced that would allow for the transfer of the property \n     from the Forest Service to San Juan College. The College \n     would use the area for educational and recreational purposes. \n     A description of the property is attached.\n       Please let me know what additional steps must be taken in \n     order to expedite the transfer. Thank you very much.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         James C. Henderson, Ed.D.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 2403. A bill to prohibit discrimination against health care \nentities that refuse to provide, provide coverage for, pay for, or \nprovide referrals for abortions; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                 THE HEALTH CARE ENTITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation \ntoday that will offer protection from government discrimination to \nhealth care providers who have religious or moral objections to \nperforming abortions.\n  As HCFA prepares to implement the Medicare+Choice program, the need \nfor this bill has become evident. Congress created Medicare+Choice to \ngive beneficiaries more options in their health plans. The Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 (BBA) requires all health care providers who \nparticipate in the program to provide all services covered under \nMedicare Parts A and B, except hospice care. HCFA is interpreting this \nmandate to require coverage for abortion, consistent with the Hyde \nrestrictions. The problem is that many religious health care systems--\nand even some secular providers--have strong misgivings about \nperforming, providing coverage for, or paying for any elective \nabortions. Absent specific legislative clarification, these providers \nwill be shut out of the Medicare+Choice program.\n  HCFA's interpretation of the BBA has come as a surprise to many \nhealth systems wishing to participate in the Medicare+Choice program. \nThe issue of whether providers would have to cover abortion services \nwas never addressed during last summer's extensive debate. Instead, \nthis Congress focused on designing a program which would give seniors \nthe broadest possible range of health care choices, so they could\n\n[[Page S9562]]\n\nchoose a provider based on their own individual needs.\n  In 1996, Congress prohibited government discrimination against health \ncare providers who choose not to teach abortion procedures in their \ngraduate medical programs. The Senate approved this legislation as an \namendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations \nAct by a vote of 63-37. The Health Care Entity Protection Act merely \nclarifies that these protections extend to all providers who have \nreligious or moral objections to performing, providing coverage of, or \npaying for induced abortions. I would emphasise that nothing in this \nbill prevents providers from voluntarily offering abortion services; it \nsimply gives them a right to choose whether they will so do.\n  I believe that my colleagues on both sides of the abortion debate can \nsupport the Health Care Entity Protection Act. I would like to \nreiterate that this bill simply clarifies protections that already \nexist under current law. I hope the Senate will recognize the moral \ngravity of the abortion issue and forge a consensus across party and \nideological lines to protect institutions, doctors, and health systems \nwho, as a matter of conscience, cannot perform or provide for \nabortions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2404. A bill to establish designations for United States Postal \nService buildings located in Coconut Grove, Opa Locka, Carol City, and \nMiami, Florida; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                United States postal service legislation\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today together with my friends and \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Mack, to introduce legislation to name \nfive United States Post Offices in Miami-Dade County, Florida after \nfive prominent civic and community leaders. By doing so, we are joining \nthe entire Florida delegation in the United States House of \nRepresentatives in honoring these individuals of great importance to \nour state.\n  This legislation honors these five individuals service, commitment, \nand dedication to their communities. Athalie Range is a multi-faceted \nlocal community leader and humanitarian Garth Reeves, Sr. is a \npublisher, banker, and entrepreneur. William R. ``Billy'' Rolle was a \nteacher, coach, and community education leader. Essie Silva was a \nleader and proponent of business development for South Florida's \nAfrica-American community. Helen Miller was the first African-American \nfemale Mayor in Dade County, Florida.\n  While these five individuals come from different backgrounds and \nprofessions they have one similar quality: dedication to their \ncommunities. Through their service, they have made immeasurable \ncontributions to South Florida and our entire state. Mr. President, let \nme say a few words about each of these outstanding individuals:\n   Athalie Range has been a leader in South Florida for over 30 years. \nShe was the first African-American and second woman to be elected to \nthe Miami City Commission. Governor Reubin Askew appointed her the \nfirst African-American department head in the state of Florida. Ms. \nRange has also been the recipient of over 160 awards and honors. I have \nhad the pleasure of knowing and learning from Ms. Range for many years. \nHer commitment to improving the quality of life for all citizens has \nbeen constant and meaningful.\n  Garth Reeves has been committed to excellence and achievement in \nSouth Florida for over 50 years. As the owner and publisher of the \nMiami Times, he has covered many of the important news stories of the \nlast half-century. He has also been an exemplary civic leader who \nserved on the Boards of Trustees of Miami-Dade Community College, Barry \nUniversity, Bethune-Cookman College, and Florida Memorial College.\n  Essie D.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nexempt licensed funeral directors from the minimum wage and overtime \ncompensation requirements of that Act; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n                  fair labor standards act amendments\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation together with my good friend, Senator DeWine, to exempt \nlicensed funeral directors from the overtime provisions of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act.\n  Under current law, licensed funeral directors do not meet the test \nfor the ``professionals'' exemption under the Wage and Hour regulations \nof the Fair Labor Standards Act. Consequently, they are not exempt from \nminimum wage and overtime requirements. Given the nature of their \nwork--on-duty or on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a \nyear--this requirement places an economic hardship on small funeral \nhomes and the families of licensed funeral directors. With erratic and \nunpredictable work hours, most licensed funeral directors would prefer \nthe option of comp time in lieu of overtime pay in order to spend more \ntime with their families.\n  Requiring licensed funeral directors to be paid for overtime work \nforces small business owners to allocate revenues for that purpose, \nthereby inhibiting salaries and bonuses. To avoid the financial strain, \nsome even resort to using only part-time funeral directors.\n  Over the years, Congress has provided 17 exemptions to the Act. \nIncluded are such diverse exemptions as employees of amusement or \nrecreational establishments, outside salespeople, seasonal agricultural \nworkers, apprentices, employees of newspapers with a circulation of \nless than 4,000, switchboard operators of independently-owned telephone \ncompanies with fewer than 750 stations, and the more recent amendments \nrelated to criminal investigators, computer analysts, programmers, and \nsoftware engineers.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that small businesses, such as \nfuneral homes, must be given flexibility to provide their key employees \nwith the options for alternative overtime compensation in order for \nthem to survive, grow, and remain the premier source of employment in \nour communities.\n  In that regard and on behalf of your local funeral homes and their \nlicensed funeral directors, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n        Kempthorne, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2407. A bill to amend the Small Business Act and the Small \nBusiness Investment Act of 1958 to improve the programs of the Small \nBusiness Administration; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n[[Page S9563]]\n\n      small business programs restructuring and reform act of 1998\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I have been joined by Senators \nCoverdell, Domenici, Kempthorne, and Snowe to introduce ``The Small \nBusiness Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998'' to restructure \nand refine Small Business Administration programs that are designed to \nhelp small businesses succeed. In drafting this legislation, I followed \none key principle--will the change help small businesses? Many of SBA's \nprograms are dependent upon the private sector to make loans and \ninvestments or to provide services to small businesses. ``The Small \nBusiness Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998'' is intended to \nmake Federal small business programs work more effectively while \nstimulating greater interest in the private sector to support small \nbusiness owners and their employees.\n  The small business sector is the fastest growing segment of our \neconomy. Its sustained growth throughout this decade has enabled our \nNation to experience one of its greatest periods of prosperity. During \nthis time span, small businesses have been responsible for the net \nincrease of new jobs in the United States. Today, small businesses \nemploy over \\1/2\\ of all American workers. Small businesses produce 55 \npercent of our Nation's gross domestic product. Our Nation's sustained \neconomic growth would not be possible were it not for the strength of \nthe small business sector. One would hate to imagine where we would be \nwithout a robust small business community.\n  The Committee on Small Business opened the 105th Congress with a \nhearing on Homebased and Women-owned businesses. We received testimony \non the significant economic contribution being made by the 8 million \nwomen-owned businesses and on the importance of business education, \ntraining, and financial assistance to this growing segment of our \neconomy.\n  To assist the rapid growth of small businesses owned by women, \nSection 2 of ``The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act \nof 1998'' would increase the authorization level to $12 million from $8 \nmillion per year for the Women's Business Center program. This increase \nwould ensure that new Center sites will be opened without jeopardizing \nthe currently funded Centers from receiving funds for five years.\n  To verify the SBA provides the Women's Business Center program with \nthe staff and administrative support required to support a $12 million \nprogram, the bill directs the General Accounting Office to undertake a \nbaseline and follow-up study of the SBA's administration of the \nprogram. These independent audits will assist Congress in its oversight \nof SBA's supervision and administration of the program. Knowing that \nthe Administration has previously recommended a budget that would have \nshut down the program, we want to make sure it is receiving the \nappropriate level of staffing and agency resources.\n  Last year, Congress passed the ``Small Business Reauthorization Act \nof 1997,'' which increased the authorization for the Women Business \nCenter Program to $8 million from $4 million and extended the number of \nyears grantees can receive grants to five years from three years. The \ngoal was to have a Women's Business Center operating in every state and \nadditional sites in states where there is sufficient demand. Consistent \nwith our view, the Administration's budget request for Fiscal Year 1999 \nrecommended an increase in the authorization level to $9 million. \nSenators Kerry  and Cleland introduced S. 2157 which would authorize \nthe Administration's request and would go one step further by \nincreasing the authorization level to $10.5 million in FY 2000, and $12 \nmillion in FY 2001. I am encouraged to see such a strong show of \nsupport for the program--only two years after Congress killed the \nAdministration's recommendation to strike all funding for the program.\n  Section 2 of the bill includes a new provision to provide parity \nbetween Centers operating under three-year agreements with SBA when the \nReauthorization Act was enacted and those Centers awarded five-year \ngrants since that time. Section 2 amends the law to provide the same \nmatching requirement in year four for all Centers receiving SBA grants. \nUnder the 1997 Act, Centers that receive a two-year extension at the \nconclusion of a three-year grant have to raise two non-federal dollars \nfor every federal dollar awarded; under Section 2, they will have to \nraise one non-federal dollar for each federal dollar--which is the \nfourth year matching requirement for Centers receiving newly awarded \nfive year grants. The 2 non-federal dollars to one federal dollar \nmatching requirement will remain in force for the fifth year of all \nawardees.\n  Section 3 of ``The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform \nAct of 1998'' would make the SBIR Program permanent. Testimony before \nthe Committee on Small Business and the findings of the General \nAccounting Office clearly support this Congressional action. The bill \nwould also increase the set aside from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. \nBeginning in FY 2001, the program would be increased by \\1/4\\ of 1 \npercent in each of the next four fiscal years.\n  Congress established the SBIR Program in 1982 because small \nbusinesses are a principal source of innovation in the United States. \nUnder this program, Federal agencies with extramural research and \ndevelopment budgets of $100 million or more are required to set aside \nno less than 2.5 percent of that amount for small businesses. The SBIR \nProgram was last re-authorized in 1992 and will terminate in FY 2000 \nunless Congress acts first.\n  In April 1998, the General Accounting Office issued its comprehensive \nreport on the state of the SBIR Program, and in June 1998, GAO \naddressed that report in testimony before the Committee on Small \nBusiness. The unmistakable message was very clear--this is a good \nprogram that is running well. There are ten Federal agencies that \nparticipate in the program, and GAO concluded they are all adhering to \nthe program's funding requirements. Competition has been intense among \nsmall business R firms in response to solicitations from the ten \nagencies. GAO found, however, it was very rare for an agency to make an \naward when the agency received only one proposal in response to a \nsolicitation was received.\n\n  The bill would make a significant change in the program to encourage \nbetter outreach to states that receive few awards each year. GAO \nreported in FY 1996 that California received a total of 904 awards for \na total of $207 million and Massachusetts received 628 awards for a \ntotal of $148 million. On the other hand, there were a great number of \nstates receiving 11 or fewer awards. The bill would permit each of the \nten participating agencies to spend up to 2% of the SBIR set aside pool \nof funds to support an outreach program, to promote better \ncommercialization of the R awards, and to offset some administrative \nexpenses. At least one-third of these non-award funds must be spent on \noutreach in those states that receive 25 or fewer awards each year.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced S. 2173, the ``Assistive and \nUniversally Designed Technology Improvement Act,'' to encourage the \ndevelopment and production of actual products for the marketplace for \nassistive technology end-users. As part of my effort to reach that \ngoal, the ``Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of \n1998'' includes a provision encouraging all ten Federal agencies \nparticipating in the SBIR Program to solicit proposals to advance \nresearch and development in this critical area.\n  In 1958, Congress created the SBIC Program to assist small business \nowners obtain investment capital. Forty years later, small businesses \ncontinue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment capital from \nbanks and traditional investment sources. SBICs are frequently their \nonly sources of investment capital. In 1992 and 1996, the Committee on \nSmall Business worked closely with SBA to correct earlier deficiencies \nin the law in order to ensure the future of the program. Today, the \nSBIC Program is booming. Its performance since 1994 has been \nastounding.\n  Section 4 of ``The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform \nAct of 1998'' would make a relatively small change in the operation of \nthe program. This change, however, would help smaller, small businesses \nto be more attractive to investors. The bill would permit SBICs to \naccept royalty payments contingent on future performance from companies \nin which they invest as a form of equity return for their investment.\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\n  SBA already permits SBICs to receive warrants from small businesses, \nwhich give the investing SBIC the right to acquire a portion of the \nequity of the small business. By pledging royalties or warrants, the \nsmall business is able to reduce the interest that would otherwise be \npayable by the small business to the SBIC. Importantly, the royalty \nfeature provides the smaller, small business with an incentive to \nattract SBIC investments when the return may otherwise be insufficient \nto attract venture capital.\n  Section 5 of ``The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform \nAct of 1998'' would require the SBA to make permanent a pilot program \ninitiated two years ago to permit certain Certified Development \nCompanies (CDCs) to foreclose and liquidate defaulted loans that they \nhave originated under the 504 Loan Program. This is a necessary step to \nensure the 504 program remains viable.\n  Currently, SBA liquidates and forecloses almost every loan made under \nthe 504 Loan Program. SBA has been performing this task poorly. The \nAdministration's FY 1999 budget submission estimates that recoveries on \ndefaulted loans under the 504 Loan Program will decline from 34.27% in \nFY 1998 to 30.67% in FY 1999. It is important to note that all loans \nmade under the 504 loan program are fully secured by real estate. It is \ninconceivable that SBA recovers only thirty cents on the dollar on \nfully-secured real estate loans.\n  Because the 504 Program is self-funded through user fees, with no \nappropriation required by Congress, borrowers must pay higher fees to \ncompensate for the SBA's inability to recover a reasonable portion of \ndefaulted loans. As borrower fees have increased, the 504 Loan Program \nhas been priced out of the reach of certain small businesses. The 504 \nLoan Program was enacted to provide larger loans to small businesses \nfor plant acquisition, construction or expansion. Such loans create \njobs and improve the economic health of communities. Congress should \nnot allow such opportunities to be limited because the SBA has been \nunable to recover funds on defaulted loans effectively.\n  In 1996, Congress passed, at my urging, the Small Business Programs \nImprovement Act, which established a pilot program that allowed \napproximately 20 CDCs to liquidate loans that they had originated. \nReports on this pilot program indicate it has been a success--CDCs are \nobtaining higher recoveries than the SBA. This bill makes the pilot \nprogram permanent and permits CDCs that have the ability to manage loan \nliquidations to do so. This change in the law is designed to increase \nthe recoveries on defaulted loans thereby decreasing borrower fees. \nConsequently, more small businesses will have access to 504 loans, \nwhich will create more jobs and will help sustain the economic growth \nthis country has been experiencing.\n  The ``Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997'' included the \ncreation of the HUBZone Program, which raised the goal to 23% from 20% \nfor prime contracts being awarded by the Federal government to small \nbusiness. This increase was advocated by the SBA Administrator and was \nembraced by the Clinton Administration.\n  It has been brought to the attention of the Committee on Small \nBusiness that some Federal agencies may be using bookkeeping ploys to \nreduce the amount of contract dollars going into the pool of contracts \nused for calculating the older 20% small business set aside goal. By \nreducing the overall dollar volume of contracts, the value of contracts \ncounted under the older 20% set aside goal is also reduced. Now that \nCongress has increased the goal to 23%, I am concerned there may be \ngreater pressure on the agencies to ``juggle the books.''\n\n  In order for the Committee on Small Business to conduct its oversight \nof the small business contract set aside goal, Section 6 of the bill \ndirects the SBA to send a report to the Committee on Small Business \neach year highlighting any Federal agency that alters its statistical \nmethodology in tracking its efforts to meet the 23% goal. The bill also \ndirects the Administrator of SBA to notify the Committee and the SBA \nChief Counsel for Advocacy prior to approving any request from an \nagency to change how it reports its small business contracting efforts.\n  Last year, when Congress approved the ``Small Business \nReauthorization Act of 1997,'' it included a separate title to improve \nbusiness opportunities for service-disabled veterans. The Senate and \nHouse Committees on Small Business believed strongly that these \nindividuals deserve better support from the Federal agencies than they \nhave received historically. Last year's bill included a provision \nrequiring the SBA to complete a comprehensive report containing the \nfindings and recommendations of the SBA Administrator on the needs of \nsmall businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. \nAlthough this report should be received by the Congress no later than \nthe first week of September, SBA's efforts to date to complete this \nreport within the statutory deadline are disappointing.\n  Section 7 of ``The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform \nAct of 1998'' would go one step further to strengthen the mandate that \nSBA's programs be more responsive to all veteran small business owners. \nThe bill would direct that veterans receive comprehensive help at SBA. \nThe bill elevates the Office of Veterans Affairs at SBA to the Office \nof Veterans Business Development, which would be headed by an Associate \nAdministrator, who would report directly to the SBA Administrator.\n  In addition, the bill would establish an Advisory Committee on \nVeterans' Business Affairs composed of 15 members. Eight members would \nbe veterans who own small businesses, and seven members will be \nrepresentatives of national veterans service organizations. Further, \nthe bill would create the position of National Veterans' Business \nCoordinator within the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) \nProgram. This new position would work in the SBA headquarters to ensure \nthat SCORE's programs nationwide include entrepreneurial counseling and \ntraining for veterans.\n  Section 7 of the bill would make veteran small business owners \neligible to apply for small, start-up loans under SBA's Microloan \nProgram. And the SBA Office of Advocacy would be directed to evaluate \nannually efforts by Federal agencies, business and industry to help \nbusiness that are owned and controlled by veterans.\n  The ``Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998'' \nis a sound bill that will help small business owners, particularly \nthose who are struggling or in the business start-up phase to compete \nmore effectively. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2407\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Programs \n     Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTER PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) with small business concerns owned and controlled by \n     women being created at a rapid rate in the United States, \n     there is a need to increase the authorization level for the \n     women's business center program under section 29 of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656) in order to establish additional \n     women's business center sites throughout the Nation that \n     focus on entrepreneurial training programs for women; and\n       (2) increased funding for the women's business center \n     program will ensure that--\n       (A) new women's business center sites can be established to \n     reach women located in geographic areas not presently served \n     by an existing women's business center without jeopardizing \n     the full funding of existing women's business centers for the \n     term prescribed by law; and\n       (B) the Small Business Administration achieves the goal of \n     establishing at least 1 sustainable women's business center \n     in each State.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 29(k)(1) of the Small Business Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 656(k)(1)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Authorization.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out this section, $12,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1999 and each fiscal year thereafter.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall take effect on October 1, 1998.\n       (c) Terms of Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 308(b) of the Small Business \n     Reauthorization Act of 1997 (15 U.S.C. 656 note) is amended--\n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\n       (A) by striking ``(b)'' and all that follows through \n     ``paragraph (2), any organization'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Applicability.--Any organization''; and\n       (B) by striking paragraph (2).\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997.\n       (d) General Accounting Office Reporting Requirements.--\n       (1) Baseline report.--Not later than October 31, 1999, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States shall--\n       (A) conduct a review of the administration of the women's \n     business center program under section 29 of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656) by the Office of Women's \n     Business Ownership of the Small Business Administration, \n     which shall include an analysis of--\n       (i) the operation of the women's business center program by \n     the Administration;\n       (ii) the efforts of the Administration to meet the \n     legislative objectives established for the program;\n       (iii) the oversight role of the Administration of the \n     operations of women's business centers;\n       (iv) the manner in which the women's business centers \n     operate;\n       (v) the benefits provided by the women's business centers \n     to small business concerns owned and controlled by women; and\n       (vi) any other matters that the Comptroller General \n     determines to be appropriate; and\n       (B) submit to the Committees on Small Business of the \n     Senate and House of Representatives a report describing the \n     results of the review under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Followup report.--Not later than October 31, 2002, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States shall--\n       (A) conduct a review of any changes, during the period \n     beginning on the date on which the report is submitted under \n     paragraph (1)(B) and ending on the date on which the report \n     is submitted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, in the \n     administration of the women's business center program under \n     section 29 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656) by the \n     Office of Women's Business Ownership of the Small Business \n     Administration, which shall include an analysis of any \n     changes during that period in--\n       (i) the operation of the women's business center program by \n     the Administration;\n       (ii) the efforts of the Administration to meet the \n     legislative objectives established for the program;\n       (iii) the oversight role of the Administration of the \n     operations of women's business centers;\n       (iv) the manner in which the women's business centers \n     operate;\n       (v) the benefits provided by the women's business centers \n     to small business concerns owned and controlled by women; and\n       (vi) any other matters that the Comptroller General \n     determines to be appropriate; and\n       (B) submit to the Committees on Small Business of the \n     Senate and House of Representatives a report describing the \n     results of the review under subparagraph (A).\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote the adoption of children with special \nneeds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   THE ADOPTION EQUALITY ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nAdoption Equality Act of 1998, legislation that will make it easier for \nchildren with special needs to find permanent, adoptive homes. I want \nto extend my sincere thanks to Senator Rockefeller for his commitment \nto this legislation and to foster and adoptive children generally. \nSenator Rockefeller joins me as an original cosponsor, as do Senators \nDeWine, Kerrey, Bond, Levin, Landrieu, Dorgan and Moynihan.\n  Nationwide there are 500,000 children in foster care. In Rhode Island \nthere are approximately 1,600 children in foster care. On average, \nthese children will spend more than two years in out-of-home care \nbefore they are either returned home to their biological families or \nfreed for adoption.\n  The majority of the children who have been legally freed for \nadoption--95 percent--have special-needs, which in the world of child \nwelfare means that they are children who are hard to place. They may be \nolder children, they may be children in sibling groups that the state \ndoes not want to separate, they may have physical disabilities or \nmental or emotional problems, or they may belong to a minority group.\n  The federal government provides an incentive to families wishing to \nopen their homes to these children by offering some of them a monthly \nsubsidy to help defray the cost of adopting these children. It is \nexpensive to care for children, and even more expensive if the child \nhas special needs. The monthly subsidy, which is less than the monthly \npayment for the child to be in foster care, is used to defray some of \nthese additional costs.\n  What makes no sense about the current system is that the federal \ngovernment only makes these subsidies available to special-needs \nchildren who are being adopted whose biological families were poor. If \nthe child is being adopted by a low-income family, but their biological \nfamily was not low-income, that child will not receive a federal \nadoption subsidy.\n\n[[Page S9568]]\n\n  This system makes no sense to me, and that is why we are introducing \nthe Adoption Equality Act today. This measure would make all special-\nneeds children eligible for a modest federal adoption subsidy, \nregardless of the income of their biological parents. The income of the \nprospective adoptive parents would be taken into account when \ncalculating the amount of the subsidy, as it is under current law.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a simply issue of fairness to these \nchildren and the families who adopt them. We should be doing everything \nwe can to help these children find permanent homes. The Adoption \nEquality Act builds upon the critical reforms we made last year in the \nenactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act.

Mr. President, I support the introduction of \nThe Adoption Equality Act of 1998.\n  I am proud to be a co-sponsor of The Adoption Equality Act of 1998, \npart of a continuing effort to improve the lives of abused and \nneglected children in my state of West Virginia and across the nation.\n  I would like to begin by sharing my special thanks with my colleague \nand good friend, Senator Chafee, not only for his work on this \nimportant legislation, but for his ongoing commitment to bringing about \nmeaningful change for America's most vulnerable children. I also want \nto express my sincere gratitude to the other cosponsors of this bill, \nSenators DeWine, Kerrey, Bond, Levin, Landrieu, Dorgan, and Moynihan. I \nam so pleased to see that the strong and unique bipartisan coalition \nforged during the adoption debate last fall is continuing the job yet \nto be done on behalf of abused and neglected children.\n  Last fall, our bipartisan coalition introduced--and the Senate \nunanimously passed--The Adoption and Safe Families Act. That \nlegislation, signed into law on November 19, 1997, fundamentally \nshifted the focus of the American foster system by insisting for the \nfirst time that health and safety should be the paramount consideration \nwhen a State makes any decision regarding the well-being of an abused \nand neglected child. That legislation is designed to move children out \nof foster care and into adoptive homes more quickly than ever before.\n  I am also proud to report that West Virginia is launching its own \nspecial initiative to promote adoption. This June, state officials \nreported that there were 3003 children in the custody of West Virginia. \n870 of these children have adoption as the goal of their permanency \nplans, and 95% of these children have special needs. The State has \ncommitted to hiring additional specialists to provide adoption services \nand is seeking federal support to enhance these efforts. It is \nwonderful to know that West Virginia and other states are so \nenthusiastic about moving forward to promote adoptions and to help \nchildren find safe and stable homes.\n  The Adoption and Safe Families Act took into account the unique \ncircumstances of ``special needs'' children--those children who, for \nwhatever reason, are difficult to place in adoptive homes. States now \nreceive a special bonus for each special needs adoption. Most \nsignificantly, the Adoption and Safe Families Act took the first \nessential step in ensuring ongoing health coverage for all special \nneeds children who are adopted into new families.\n  While I am satisfied that The Adoption and Safe Families Act will \nstrengthen the American foster care system, I made it clear that it was \nonly the first step in many to make things significantly better for \nabused and neglected children.\n  The Adoption Equality Act is an essential second step in this ongoing \nprocess. This important legislation will promote and increase adoptions \nby making all special needs children eligible for Federal adoption \nsubsidies. This bill is designed to ``level the playing field'' by \nensuring that all loving adoptive families have the support they need \nto address the fundamental needs of the children they raise.\n  Federal adoption subsidies, already authorized under section IV-E of \nthe Social Security Act, usually take the form of monthly payments \nprovided to families who adopt special needs children. These payments \nprovide essential income support to help families finance the daily \ncosts of raising these children and to cover the expense of special \nservices. Federal adoption subsidies play a vital role in the lives of \nthousands of special needs children. Many families that I have visited \nin West Virginia and across the country have told me that without this \nessential support, they would not have been able to afford to take in \nthe children who have become such an important part of their family.\n  This bill will fix the one remaining barrier that keeps many adoptive \nfamilies from accessing precious Federal adoption subsidies. Under \ncurrent law, a special needs child is only eligible for Federal \nadoption subsidies if his biological family was poor enough to qualify \nfor welfare benefits under the now-defunct Aid to Families with \nDependent Children Program (AFDC). If his family doesn't qualify under \n1994 AFDC standards, even the hardest to place child cannot receive \nfederal adoption subsidies.\n  In other words, a special needs child's eligibility for federal \nadoption subsidies is dependent on the income of the parents that \nabused or neglected him. This is simply wrong.\n  The Adoption Equality Act will eliminate this tragic anomaly in \nFederal law by making all special needs children eligible for Federal \nadoption subsidies. This is a responsible way to make sure that willing \nadoptive families have the support that they need to take care of all \nthe needs of their new child, whether those include food and clothing, \ntherapy, tutoring, or a new addition to their home.\n  Throughout my travels as the Chair of the National Commission on \nChildren and my meetings with families in West Virginia, I have \nobserved a recurring theme. I have come to understand that in many \ncases, a family wants to adopt a child more than anything. And yet, \nthere is often a barrier that stands in its way. The lack of adequate \nfinancial resources is at the top of that list. This legislation help \nalleviate this unnecessary burden.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate a point that I made during the debate \nover the Adoption and Safe Families Act. At the heart of the ongoing \ndiscussions about what is the best policy for abused and neglected \nchildren, there have been many complex questions raised about how \nFederal taxpayer dollars should be spent and who is worthy of receiving \nthem. As we struggle with these difficult issues--which often pit \nsocial against fiscal responsibility--I keep returning to the same \nfundamental lesson I have learned from the families I have met: if we \ncannot build social policy that not only protects our children, but \ngives them the best possible chance to succeed in life, we have failed \nto do our job as a government and a society.\n  The Adoption Equality Act is designed to make sure that all abused \nand neglected children, even the most vulnerable special needs kids, \nhave this real chance for security and happiness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2409. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for business-provided student education and training; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n         Businesses Educating Students in Technology (BEST) Act\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, along \nwith my distinguished colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, to help \nalleviate a serious shortage of students graduating from our nation's \ncolleges and universities with technology-based education and skills.\n  Technology is reshaping our world at a rapid pace. Competition to \nmeet the needs, wants, and expectations of consumers has accelerated \nthe rate of technological progress to a level inconceivable even just a \nfew decades ago. Today, technology is playing an increasingly important \nrole in the lives of every American and is a key ingredient to \nsustaining America's economic growth. It is the wellspring from which \nnew businesses, high-wage jobs, and a rising quality of life will flow \nin the 21st century.\n  Today, we are fortunate that our economy is strong. We have created \nmore than 16 million new jobs since 1993. We have the lowest \nunemployment in 28 years, the smallest welfare rolls in 27 years, and \nthe lowest inflation in 32 years. If we want to build on this progress, \nwe must encourage our people to develop and use emerging technologies.\n  Technological progress is the single most important determining \nfactor in sustaining growth in our economy. It is estimated that \ntechnological innovation has accounted for as much as half\n\n[[Page S9570]]\n\nthe nation's long-term economic growth over the past 50 years and is \nexpected to account for an even higher percentage in the next 50 years.\n  And yet, there is mounting evidence that we are not doing enough to \nhelp our people make the most of technological change. Our businesses \nare practically desperate for workers with skills in computers and \nother technologically advanced systems. More than 350,000 information \ntechnology positions are currently unfilled throughout the United \nStates. The number of students graduating from colleges with computer \nscience degrees has declined dramatically. In my home state of \nConnecticut, public and private colleges combined produced only 299 \ncomputer science graduates in 1997, a 50 percent decline from 1987. We \nare not alone. Nationwide, the number of graduates with bachelor's \ndegrees in computer science dropped 43 percent between 1986 and 1994.\n  The Department of Commerce estimates that 1.3 million new jobs will \nbe created over the next decade for systems analysts, computer \nengineers and computer scientists. Yet, at a time when our nation is \nstruggling to fill these positions, our colleges are graduating fewer \nskilled information technology students.\n  At large and mid-sized companies there is one vacancy for every 10 \ninformation technology jobs, and eight out of 10 companies expect to \nhire information technology workers in the year ahead. According to the \nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, this trend will only continue through \n2006.\n  This shortage of skilled and knowledgeable workers is perhaps the \nmost significant threat to our continued economic expansion. Clearly, \nwe must do more as a country to eliminate this shortage.\n  We need to turn our attention to our work force and focus on it as a \ncritical part of our economic development. We must put more emphasis on \nhuman capital, and we need to educate more students in the diverse \nareas of technology.\n  In Connecticut, many businesses are taking initiatives to do so. They \nare establishing scholarships, donating lab equipment, planning \ncurricula, and sending employees into schools to instruct and help \nprepare students for technology-based jobs.\n  One Connecticut company, The Pfizer Corporation, recently announced \nthat it will spend $19 million to build an animal vaccine research \nlaboratory at The University of Connecticut. This partnership will not \nonly lead to advancements in gene technology and animal health, but it \nwill also promote joint research projects in which company scientists \nwill work alongside professors and students.\n  Another example in Connecticut is the support provided to the \nbiotechnology program at Middlesex Community-Technical College by The \nBristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute and the CuraGen \nCorporation. These companies have established scholarships, donated lab \nequipment, and encouraged their research scientists to give lectures to \nthe students.\n  And yet, Mr. President, businesses and academic institutions \nshouldn't have to tackle alone the challenge of helping students obtain \nthe learning and skills they need to succeed in the coming century. The \nfederal government can and should work with our technology-based \nbusinesses and places of learning to encourage innovation and education \nthat will create jobs and prosperity for our people.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce legislation today that will \nencourage businesses to work in and with educational institutions in \norder to improve technology-based learning--so that more of our \nstudents will be able to win the best jobs of the 21st century economy.\n  This bill will give a tax credit to any business that goes into a \nuniversity, college, or community-technical school and engages in \ntechnology-based educational activities which are directly related to \nthe business of that company.\n  Businesses could claim a tax credit for 40 percent of these \neducational expenses, up to a maximum of $100,000 for any one company.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that this tax credit will provide the \nincentive for more of our nation's companies to play an active role in \nthe education, training, and skill development of our nation's most \nvaluable resource--its students.\n  If businesses take advantage of this credit, not only will they have \na larger pool of skilled workers to draw from, but our nation will have \na better-educated population that possesses the knowledge to succeed in \nthe information-based economy of the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2409\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Businesses Educating \n     Students in Technology (BEST) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Technological progress is the single most important \n     determining factor in sustaining growth in the Nation's \n     economy. It is estimated that technological innovation has \n     accounted for as much as half the Nation's long-term economic \n     growth over the past 50 years and will account for an even \n     higher percentage in the next 50 years.\n       (2) The number of jobs requiring technological expertise is \n     growing rapidly. For example, it is estimated that 1,300,000 \n     new computer engineers, programmers, and systems analysts \n     will be needed over the next decade in the United States \n     economy. Yet, our Nation's computer science programs are only \n     graduating 25,000 students with bachelor's degrees yearly.\n       (3) There are more than 350,000 information technology \n     positions currently unfilled throughout the United States, \n     and the number of students graduating from colleges with \n     computer science degrees has declined dramatically.\n       (4) In order to help alleviate the shortage of graduates \n     with technology-based education and skills, businesses in a \n     number of States have formed partnerships with colleges, \n     universities, community-technical schools, and other \n     institutions of higher learning to give lectures, donate \n     equipment, plan curricula, and perform other activities \n     designed to help students acquire the skills and knowledge \n     needed to fill jobs in technology-based industries.\n       (5) Congress should encourage these partnerships by \n     providing a tax credit to businesses that enter into them. \n     Such a tax credit will help students obtain the knowledge and \n     skills they need to obtain jobs in technology-based \n     industries which are among the best paying jobs being created \n     in the economy.

A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to give States the options of providing medical assistance to \ncertain legal immigrant children and to increase allotments to \nterritories under the State Children's Health Insurance Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n       Medicaid Children's Health Improvement Amendments of 1998\n\n   Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, along with Senators \nMoynihan and D'Amato, I introduce the Medicaid Children's Health \nImprovement Amendments of 1998. This legislation, which was introduced \nin the House of Representatives last week, would attempt to correct a \nsituation currently jeopardizing the health of many of the children \nliving in our territories.\n  Last year Congress passed what was the single largest investment in \nhealth care for children since the passage of Medicaid in 1965.'' As a \nresult, the United States will invest an additional $24 billion in \nchildren's health care over the next five years. However, not all of \nour nation's poor children are celebrating this victory.\n  In the negotiations over the budget reconciliation, the initial \nproposal providing 1.5 percent of the funding to our nation's \nterritories, which represented a fair distribution, was reduced to a \nmere 0.25 percent. The children's health care program ultimately \nincluded in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provides Puerto Rico with \napproximately 0.22 percent of the overall national funding for the \nprogram and 0.03 percent for Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American \nSamoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. For Puerto Rico alone this \nwould mean less than $11 million per year for a jurisdiction with close \nto four million U.S. citizens.\n  It is absolutely outrageous that the United States would continue to \nendorse a discriminatory policy that denies equal health care to the \nchildren of its territories. If this legislation was enacted most of \nGuam's 5,000 uninsured children would finally receive the coverage that \nthey rightfully deserve. It would also approximately multiply the \nnumber of children covered in the U.S. Virgin Islands by six.\n  In addition to providing additional funding for the children's health \ninsurance program in our territories, this legislation includes a \nprovision that would grant states the option to provide health care \ncoverage to legal immigrant children who entered the United States on \nor after August 22, 1996. Welfare reform prohibits states from covering \nthese immigrant children.\n  As we know, children without health insurance do not get important \ncare for preventable diseases. Many uninsured children are hospitalized \nfor acute asthma attacks that could have been prevented, or suffer from \npermanent hearing loss from untreated ear infections. Without adequate \nhealth care, common illnesses can turn into life-long crippling \ndiseases, whereas appropriate treatment and care can help children with \ndiseases like diabetes live relatively normal lives. A lack of adequate \nmedical care will also hinder the social and educational development of \nchildren, as children who are sick and left untreated are less able to \nlearn.\n  I hope that with the help of my colleagues in Congress we will be \nable to rectify the discrimination against the children of our \nterritories and afford them the same treatment as the other children in \nthe nation. They deserve no less. Programs created to protect our \nnation's children should represent the highest and most pure ideals of \nour society.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2410\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to create employment opportunities and to promote \neconomic growth establishing a public-private partnership between the \nUnited States travel and tourism industry and every level of government \nto work to make the United States the premiere travel and tourism \ndestination in the world, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                           the visit usa act\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nstrengthen\n\n[[Page S9572]]\n\nAmerica's tourism and travel related industry--the Value In Supporting \nInternational Tourism Act of 1998 (Visit USA Act). This legislation is \na follow-on to the National Tourism Act, Public Law 104-288, enacted \ntwo years ago.\n  In the National Tourism Act, Congress created the U.S. National \nTourism Organization (USNTO) in order to re-establish the United States \nas the premiere destination for tourists throughout the world. While \ninternational travel and tourism remains the United States largest \nservice export, its third largest industry, and a major producer of \njobs and tax revenue for federal, state and local governments, our \nshare of the international tourism market is threatened unless action \nis taken now.\n  Public Law 104-288 authorized a public-private partnership, including \na broad cross-section of the U.S. travel and tourism industry, charged \nwith working with government to (1) promote and increase the U.S. share \nof the international tourism market, (2) develop and implement a \nnational travel and tourism strategy, (3) advise the President and \nCongress on how to implement this strategy and on other critical \nmatters affecting the travel and tourism industry, (4) conduct travel \nand tourism market research, and (5) promote the interests of the U.S. \ntravel and tourism industry at international trade shows. The USNTO was \nauthorized to conduct activities necessary to advance these national \ninterests.\n  The USNTO was also charged with developing a long-term financing plan \nfor the organization. On January 14, 1998, the Board of the USNTO \nfulfilled its statutory mandate by submitting a report to Congress \noutlining, among other things, a long-term marketing plan to promote \nthe United States as the premiere international travel destination. The \nBoard is firmly committed to work with Congress to secure appropriate \nfunding for an international marketing effort.\n  Private sector and state support for the promotion of the United \nStates as an international tourist destination exceeds $1 billion \nannually. This support, together with the commitment of the USNTO Board \nof Directors to use only non-governmental sources of funding for all \nUSNTO general and administrative costs, provides a substantial \ncommitment from the ``private'' side of the partnership and a \nfoundation for a successful public-private partnership.\n  The Visit USA Act establishes an international visitor assistance \ntask force. This interagency body will support the creation of a toll-\nfree telephone line to assist foreign tourists visiting the United \nStates. It will also work to improve signage at airports and other key \ntravel facilities, and facilitate distribution of multilingual travel \nand tourism materials. Each of these activities is intended to be \nconducted at minimal or zero cost to the federal government.\n  This legislation also requires the Secretary of Commerce to report to \nCongress on how federal lands are used and on how they may have \ninfluenced the tourism market, on any changes in the international \ntourist commerce, on the impact tourism has on the U.S. economy, and on \nour balance of trade.\n  The facts concerning the increasingly competitive international \ntourism justify this legislative approach. While competition for the \ninternational tourism dollar has become one among national governments, \nthe U.S. government is the only major industrialized nation that does \nnot promote its tourism market abroad. Other governments spend millions \non tourism marketing. In 1995, for example, Australia spent $88 \nmillion, the UK and Spain each spent $79 million, and France spent $73 \nmillion to promote tourism.\n  Tourism is a significant element of the U.S. economy. The industry \nthat depends on spending by foreign tourists is diverse, and includes \nrestaurants, hotels, travel agencies, shops, tour bus services, rental \ncar agencies, theaters, airlines, and theme parks. In particular, small \nbusinesses depend on revenues from international tourism.\n  I encourage all Senators to join in supporting this important effort \nto strengthen our tourism-related economy. The dividends to be realized \nas a result of this modest investment will benefit every state and \nevery congressional district.\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today Senator Burns and I are \nintroducing a bill, the Visit USA Act, which will further the \ninternational standing of the U.S. travel and tourism industry. As co-\nchairman of the United States Senate Tourism Caucus along with Senator \nBurns, I know that the tourism industry is a winner for the United \nStates. The Visit USA Act would improve U.S. international marketing \nand services to travelers in the United States by: creating a toll-free \nnumber for international travelers to call for assistance in their \nnative language; improving signs in transportation facilities; and \nauthorizing appropriations for the marketing program of the U.S. \nNational Tourism Organization (NTO).\n  Tourism is more than cameras and Bermuda shorts. Travel and tourism \nis a big business. Last year it produced a record $26 billion trade \nsurplus, and the industry continues to grow. In my state of South \nCarolina, tourism generates over $6.5 billion and is responsible for \n113,000 jobs. Over 46 million international visitors came to the United \nStates and spent over $90 billion in 1997. These visitors generated \nmore than $5 billion in Federal taxes alone. To compete with other \nnations for a larger share of international tourism over the next \ndecade, we must support an international tourism marketing effort. The \nVisit USA Act would do just that by providing for international \npromotion of the United States while making travel to this country \nsimpler and more understandable for our foreign guests.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 2413. A bill to provide for the development of a management plan \nfor the Woodland Lake Park tract in Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest \nin the State of Arizona reflecting the current use of the tract as a \npublic park; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             apache-sitgreaves national forest legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce \nlegislation, along with my colleague, Senator Jon Kyl, that will \npreserve a valuable tract of park land for future public enjoyment in \nthe Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona. \nThis proposal authorizes the U.S. Forest Service to develop a \nmanagement plan to maintain the current recreational use of 583 acres \nknown as Woodland Lake Park.\n  Mr. President, I want to laud the cooperation forged between the U.S. \nForest Service and the town of Pinetop-Lakeside. The initiative \nrequires the acting supervisor of the Apache-Sitgreaves National \nForest, under the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture, to work \nwith the town to ensure Woodland Lake Park remains open and accessible \nto the public. The parties will have 180 days to draft a management \nplan for the park.\n  Although the town of Pinetop-Lakeside seeks to one day acquire \nWoodland Lake Park, the management of this land by the Forest Service \nis crucial to preserving this resource in the interim. Federal \noversight will ensure that the estimated 50,000 residents every year \nwho take pleasure in the lake and along the beautiful wooded trails \nwill continue to do so for years to come.\n  I look forward to continued constructive collaboration between the \nForest Service and the town of Pinetop-Lakeside. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the legislation be entered into the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MANAGEMENT OF WOODLAND LAKE PARK TRACT, APACHE-\n                   SITGREAVES NATIONAL FOREST, ARIZONA, FOR \n                   RECREATIONAL PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Management Plan Required.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, acting through the supervisor of Apache-\n     Sitgreaves National Forest in the State of Arizona, shall \n     prepare a management plan for the Woodland Lake Park tract \n     that is designed to ensure that the tract is managed by the \n     Forest Service for recreational purposes consistent with the \n     use of the tract as a public park by the town of Pinetop-\n     Lakeside, Arizona. The forest supervisor shall prepare the \n     management plan in consultation with the town of Pinetop-\n     Lakeside.\n\n[[Page S9573]]\n\n       (b) Prohibition on Conveyance.--The Secretary of \n     Agriculture may not convey any right, title, or interest of \n     the United States in and to the Woodland Lake Park tract \n     unless the conveyance of the tract--\n       (1) is made to the town of Pinetop-Lakeside; or\n       (2) is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Definition.--The terms ``Woodland Lake Park tract'' and \n     ``tract'' mean the parcel of land in Apache-Sitgreaves \n     National Forest in the State of Arizona that consists of \n     approximately 583 acres and is known as the Woodland Lake \n     Park tract.\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the U.S. Forest Service owns a large \nparcel of land within the boundaries of the town of Pinetop-Lakeside \nwhich has historically been used as a park, not only by the town \nresidents, but also by the thousands of tourists who vacation in this \nbucolic area of Eastern Arizona each year. The town wants to maintain \nthis land as a park. However, the Forest Service has refused to renew \nthe town's special use permit for the largest section of this park, \npossibly paving the way for the land to be sold to private investors. \nThe bill that Senator McCain and I are introducing, and Representative \nHayworth is introducing in the House, prevents the Forest Service from \nselling the land to any entity other than the town, and requires the \nForest Service, in conjunction with the town, to develop a management \nplan ``designed to ensure that the tract is managed by the Forest \nService for recreational purposes.''\n  Mr. President, the town of Pinetop-Lakeside has been trying to find a \nway to acquire this parcel from the Forest Service for over 10 years, \nto no avail. This bill will satisfy the town's goal of preserving this \nland as a park, while being fair to the American taxpayer. However, the \nlegislation will not solve the problems of communities that seek to \nacquire Forest Service lands to preserve open space, or to fulfill \nother essential governmental functions. I intend to continue to seek a \nlong-term solution to those problems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS.\n  S. 2414. A bill to establish terms and conditions under which the \nSecretary of the Interior shall convey leaseholds in certain Properties \naround Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                   canyon ferry reservoir legislation\n\n   Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduce a companion bill \nto one recently introduced in the House by Congressman Rick Hill, of \nMontana. This is a bill that will authorize the Bureau of Reclamation \nto convey certain properties around Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana \nto leaseholders. This bill has the support of a number of \norganizations, groups and communities in the area of Canyon Ferry and \nin Montana in general.\n\n  The purpose of my bill today, is to get the ball rolling on this \nlegislation. I am aware that currently there is legislation in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee of a similar nature. But it \nappears stalled, and does not address the concerns of a number of the \ngroups and communities in the area around Canyon Ferry. The bills \nbasically address the conveyance of this land in the same way, but it \nis the disposal of the funds received that changes these two bills. So \nI come here today to propose this legislation to accelerate the process \nand get Congress involved and moving on this very issue.\n  I have made a pledge to the people in this area of Montana that I \nwill do all I can to assist them in getting something done on this bill \nthis session before we leave for the year. These people have attempted \nto work with the Bureau of Reclamation to clear up a number of issues \nwhich have come up over the past five or more years. The result of \ntheir work has been continued stalling by the Bureau of Reclamation in \nworking with the citizens. As a result then we have been forced to work \non legislation that will remove the stumbling blocks and rectify and \nclarify the situation.\n  Senator Baucus, Congressman Hill and I have worked for the past year \ndeveloping legislation to address the concerns of these people. We have \ncome ninety percent of the way and now it is necessary for us to move \nthat extra ten percent and get something done to the benefit of the \ngeneral public and the citizens of Montana.\n  Canyon Ferry is a man-made reservoir on the Missouri River in Central \nMontana right outside of our capital Helena. It is a wonderful area for \noutdoor recreation and draws people from all over the state and in many \ncases all across the nation. There are a number of people who have \nbuilt cabin sites on the lake both for the purpose of weekend living \nbut also there are a number of year around residences.\n  This legislation will work to continue to provide opportunities for \nall people to enjoy the splendor of Canyon Ferry. In addition there \nwill be ample opportunity for the surrounding communities to develop \nnew ways for the public to enjoy the lake and the various recreational \nfacilities around the lake. The citizens of Montana expect and deserve \nan opportunity to enjoy this wonderful area. The funds derived from the \nconveyance of these properties will allow for the continued \nconstruction of facilities that will allow more Montanans a chance to \nenjoy Canyon Ferry.\n  I give my pledge to the people of Montana that I will continue to \nwork this issue with the members of the Montana delegation, Senator \nBaucus and Congressman Hill to clear this bill and get something done. \nI know the majority of people in the area want to see something done, \nand this is the vehicle to do that. I look forward to working with the \nChairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to get this done \nand out as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 2415. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe tax on beer to its pre-1991 level; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         REPEALING THE BEER TAX\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I today introduce legislation pertaining \nto the federal excise tax on beer.\n  The federal excise tax on beer was doubled as part of the 1991 \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. Today, it remain as the only \n``luxury tax'' enacted as part of OBRA '91. While taxes on furs, \njewelry, and yachts were repealed through subsequent legislation, the \nfederal beer tax remains in place with continued and far reaching \nnegative effects.\n  The excise tax on beer is among the more regressive federal taxes. \nSince the 100 percent tax was levied in 1991, it has cost the industry \nas many as 50,000 jobs. Beer in particular continues to suffer under a \ndisproportionate burden of taxation. Forty-three percent of the cost of \nbeer is comprised of both state and federal taxes. This legislation \nseeks to correct this inequity and will restore the level of federal \nexcise tax to the pre-1991 tax rate.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents companion legislation to H.R. \n158, introduced by Representative Phil English. The House bill \ncurrently carries 95 cosponsors. I commend this Senate legislation to \nmy colleagues for their consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Specter, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2416. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to protect consumers in managed care plans and other health \ncoverage; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with \nSenators Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Arlen Specter and Max Baucus in \nintroducing a bipartisan managed care reform bill--the Promoting \nResponsible Managed Care Act of 1998.\n  In November 1997, a number of us formed the bipartisan, bicameral \nCongressional Task Force on Health Care Quality to better understand \nthe mounting public frustration over managed care. The task force heard \nfrom numerous consumer and provider groups, and received presentations \nfrom the sponsors of all of the major managed care reform bills now \npending in Congress. The bill we are introducing today, the Promoting \nResponsible Managed Care Act of 1998, has benefited greatly from the \nefforts of the task force, and we wish to thank all participants, on \nboth sides of the aisle, for their attentiveness and diligence.\n  This legislation was developed in accordance with the following \nprinciples:\n  Bipartisan legislation which can be enacted this year.\n\n[[Page S9574]]\n\n  Provides all Americans in privately insured health plans with basic \nfederal protections.\n  Meaningful enforcement which holds managed care plans accountable, \nand provides individuals harmed by such plans with just compensation.\n  Report cards to enable consumers to make informed health care choices \nbased on plan performance.\n  As my colleagues well know, next month the Senate is headed for a \npolarized debate on managed care reform, which may well result in \ngridlock. Each party has put forward a plan which contains features \nunacceptable to the other side--such as exposing insurers to lawsuits \nin state court in the case of the Daschle plan, and the broad expansion \nof medical savings accounts (MSAs) in the case of the Nickles plan.\n  It is for this very reason that we have put forward a bipartisan \nplan--one which blends the best features of both the Democratic and \nRepublican plans, but omits the so-called poison pills. When it comes \nto restoring public confidence in managed care and ensuring a basic \nfloor of federal patient protections, gridlock simply will not be an \nacceptable outcome.\n  We believe Congress has the responsibility to step up to the plate in \nthe remaining weeks of this session and to enact legislation which the \nPresident can sign into law to address the outstanding concerns \nAmericans have about their managed care. Indeed, despite continuing \nopposition from the insurance industry to the enactment of any reform \nlegislation, many of the managed care industry's own leaders have \nprivately expressed concern about the future of managed care if \nlegislative action is not taken soon to strengthen public confidence.\n  In our estimation, given the hardened positions of both parties, the \nonly way Congress can succeed in that endeavor this year is for a \nbipartisan centrist plan to emerge once it becomes clear that neither \nthe Daschle or Nickles plan has the requisite support to cross the \nfinish line.\n  What we would like to do now is to take a few minutes to lay out the \nkey components of our proposal. First, I will talk about the scope of \nthe bill--a topic which you will be hearing a lot about in the coming \nweeks. Then, Senator Graham will outline our patient protection \nprovisions, and Senator Lieberman will discuss the importance of arming \nconsumers with meaningful Report Card information, and a credible \nenforcement regime to ensure that managed care plans play by the rules.\n  In 1996, Congress passed significant reforms of the private health \ninsurance marketplace with respect to the issue of portability. The \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill, established a federal floor of portability \nprotections for all 161 million privately insured Americans.\n  We see no reason for narrowing the scope of the patient protections \nin this next and far more consequential area of reform. Thus, like the \nDaschle plan and the House-passed GOP bill, the Promoting Responsible \nManaged Care Act would apply to all privately insured Americans.\n  This approach preserves state prerogatives to enact more stringent \nstandards, while assuring a minimum floor of federal protections for \nall Americans in private health plans--whether those plans are \nregulated at the state or federal level. In contrast, the Senate \nRepublican plan proposes to provide a more limited range of patient \nprotections to a much narrower band of the American population--\nprimarily those 48 million enrollees in self-funded ERISA plans.\n  While it is true that individuals in these plans have fewer \nprotections than those in state-regulated plans, that alone is \ninsufficient reason for denying these basic quality improvements and \nsafeguards to all 161 million Americans in privately insured managed \ncare plans. Such a bifurcation would, in our judgment, create many \nunnecessary and inequitable circumstances for consumers, and exacerbate \nthe already unlevel playing field which exists in the health insurance \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a summary of \nthe bill, and excerpts of what organizations are saying about the \nPromoting Responsible Managed Care Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2416\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

beneficiary, or enrollee to designate a participating primary \n     care provider, and an individual who is female has not \n     designated a participating physician specializing in \n     obstetrics and gynecology as a primary care provider, the \n     plan or issuer--\n       (i) may not require authorization or a referral by the \n     individual's primary care provider or otherwise for coverage \n     of routine gynecological care (such as preventive women's \n     health examinations) and pregnancy-related services provided \n     by a participating health care professional who specializes \n     in obstetrics and gynecology to the extent such care is \n     otherwise covered, and\n       (ii) may treat the ordering of other gynecological care by \n     such a participating physician as the authorization of the \n     primary care provider with respect to such care under the \n     plan or coverage.\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\n       (B) Construction.--Nothing in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall \n     waive any requirements of coverage relating to medical \n     necessity or appropriateness with respect to coverage of \n     gynecological care so ordered.\n       (2) Specialty care.--\n       (A) Specialty care for covered services.--\n       (i) In general.--If--\n\n       (I) an individual is a participant or beneficiary under a \n     group health plan or an enrollee who is covered under health \n     insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer,\n       (II) the individual has a condition or disease of \n     sufficient seriousness and complexity to require treatment by \n     a specialist, and\n       (III) benefits for such treatment are provided under the \n     plan or coverage,\n\n     the plan or issuer shall make or provide for a referral to a \n     specialist who is available and accessible to provide the \n     treatment for such condition or disease.\n       (ii) Specialist defined.--For purposes of this paragraph, \n     the term ``specialist'' means, with respect to a condition, a \n     health care practitioner, facility, or center (such as a \n     center of excellence) that has adequate expertise through \n     appropriate training and experience (including, in the case \n     of a child, appropriate pediatric expertise) to provide high \n     quality care in treating the condition.\n       (iii) Care under referral.--A group health plan or health \n     insurance issuer may require that the care provided to an \n     individual pursuant to such referral under clause (i) be--\n\n       (I) pursuant to a treatment plan, only if the treatment \n     plan is developed by the specialist and approved by the plan \n     or issuer, in consultation with the designated primary care \n     provider or specialist and the individual (or the \n     individual's designee), and\n       (II) in accordance with applicable quality assurance and \n     utilization review standards of the plan or issuer.\n\n     Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preventing \n     such a treatment plan for an individual from requiring a \n     specialist to provide the primary care provider with regular \n     updates on the specialty care provided, as well as all \n     necessary medical information.\n       (iv) Referrals to participating providers.--A group health \n     plan or health insurance issuer is not required under clause \n     (i) to provide for a referral to a specialist that is not a \n     participating provider, unless the plan or issuer does not \n     have an appropriate specialist that is available and \n     accessible to treat the individual's condition and that is a \n     participating provider with respect to such treatment.\n       (v) Treatment of nonparticipating providers.--If a plan or \n     issuer refers an individual to a nonparticipating specialist \n     pursuant to clause (i), services provided pursuant to the \n     approved treatment plan (if any) shall be provided at no \n     additional cost to the individual beyond what the individual \n     would otherwise pay for services received by such a \n     specialist that is a participating provider.\n       (B) Specialists as primary care providers.--\n       (i) In general.--A group health plan, or a health insurance \n     issuer, in connection with the provision of health insurance \n     coverage, shall have a procedure by which an individual who \n     is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and who has an \n     ongoing special condition (as defined in clause (iii)) may \n     receive a referral to a specialist for such condition who \n     shall be responsible for and capable of providing and \n     coordinating the individual's primary and specialty care. If \n     such an individual's care would most appropriately be \n     coordinated by such a specialist, such plan or issuer shall \n     refer the individual to such specialist.\n       (ii) Treatment as primary care provider.--Such specialist \n     shall be permitted to treat the individual without a referral \n     from the individual's primary care provider and may authorize \n     such referrals, procedures, tests, and other medical services \n     as the individual's primary care provider would otherwise be \n     permitted to provide or authorize, subject to the terms of \n     the treatment plan (referred to in subparagraph (A)(iii)(I)).\n       (iii) Ongoing special condition defined.--In this \n     subparagraph, the term ``special condition'' means a \n     condition or disease that--\n\n       (I) is life-threatening, degenerative, or disabling, and\n       (II) requires specialized medical care over a prolonged \n     period of time.\n\n       (iv) Terms of referral.--The provisions of clauses (iii) \n     through (v) of subparagraph (A) apply with respect to \n     referrals under clause (i) of this subparagraph in the same \n     manner as they apply to referrals under subparagraph (A)(i).\n       (C) Standing referrals.--\n       (i) In general.--A group health plan, and a health \n     insurance issuer in connection with the provision of health \n     insurance coverage, shall have a procedure by which an \n     individual who is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and \n     who has a condition that requires ongoing care from a \n     specialist may receive a standing referral to such specialist \n     for treatment of such condition. If the plan or issuer, or if \n     the primary care provider in consultation with the medical \n     director of the plan or issuer and the specialist (if any), \n     determines that such a standing referral is appropriate, the \n     plan or issuer shall make such a referral to such a \n     specialist.\n       (ii) Terms of referral.--The provisions of clauses (iii) \n     through (v) of subparagraph (A) apply with respect to \n     referrals under clause (i) of this subparagraph in the same \n     manner as they apply to referrals under subparagraph (A)(i).\n       (c) Continuity of Care.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Termination of provider.--If a contract between a group \n     health plan, or a health insurance issuer in connection with \n     the provision of health insurance coverage, and a health care \n     provider is terminated (as defined in subparagraph (C)), or \n     benefits or coverage provided by a health care provider are \n     terminated because of a change in the terms of provider \n     participation in a group health plan, and an individual who \n     is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee in the plan or \n     coverage is undergoing a course of treatment from the \n     provider at the time of such termination, the plan or issuer \n     shall--\n       (i) notify the individual on a timely basis of such \n     termination, and\n       (ii) subject to paragraph (3), permit the individual to \n     continue or be covered with respect to the course of \n     treatment with the provider during a transitional period \n     (provided under paragraph (2)) if the plan or issuer is \n     notified orally or in writing of the facts and circumstances \n     concerning the course of treatment.\n       (B) Treatment of termination of contract with health \n     insurance issuer.--If a contract for the provision of health \n     insurance coverage between a group health plan and a health \n     insurance issuer is terminated and, as a result of such \n     termination, coverage of services of a health care provider \n     is terminated with respect to an individual, the provisions \n     of subparagraph (A) (and the succeeding provisions of this \n     section) shall apply under the group health plan in the same \n     manner as if there had been a direct contract between the \n     group health plan and the provider that had been terminated, \n     but only with respect to benefits that are covered under the \n     group health plan after the contract termination.\n       (C) Termination.--In this section, the term ``terminated'' \n     includes, with respect to a contract, the expiration or \n     nonrenewal of the contract, but does not include a \n     termination of the contract by the plan or issuer for failure \n     to meet applicable quality standards or for fraud.\n       (2) Transitional period.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) \n     through (D), the transitional period under this subsection \n     shall extend for at least 90 days from the date of the notice \n     described in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of the provider's \n     termination.\n       (B) Institutional care.--The transitional period under this \n     subsection for institutional or inpatient care from a \n     provider shall extend until the discharge or termination of \n     the period of institutionalization and also shall include \n     institutional care provided within a reasonable time of the \n     date of termination of the provider status.\n       (C) Pregnancy.--If--\n       (i) a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee has entered the \n     second trimester of pregnancy at the time of a provider's \n     termination of participation, and\n       (ii) the provider was treating the pregnancy before date of \n     the termination,\n\n     the transitional period under this subsection with respect to \n     provider's treatment of the pregnancy shall extend through \n     the provision of post-partum care directly related to the \n     delivery.\n       (D) Terminal illness.--If--\n       (i) a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee was determined \n     to be terminally ill (as determined under section \n     1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act) at the time of a \n     provider's termination of participation, and\n       (ii) the provider was treating the terminal illness before \n     the date of termination,\n     the transitional period under this subsection shall extend \n     for the remainder of the individual's life for care directly \n     related to the treatment of the terminal illness, but in no \n     case is the transitional period required to extend for longer \n     than 180 days.\n       (3) Permissible terms and conditions.--A group health plan \n     or health insurance issuer may condition coverage of \n     continued treatment by a provider under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) \n     upon the provider agreeing to the following terms and \n     conditions:\n       (A) The provider agrees to accept reimbursement from the \n     plan or issuer and individual involved (with respect to cost-\n     sharing) at the rates applicable prior to the start of the \n     transitional period as payment in full (or, in the case \n     described in paragraph (1)(B), at the rates applicable under \n     the replacement plan or issuer after the date of the \n     termination of the contract with the health insurance issuer) \n     and not to impose cost-sharing with respect to the individual \n     in an amount that would exceed the cost-sharing that could \n     have been imposed if the contract referred to in paragraph \n     (1)(A) had not been terminated.\n       (B) The provider agrees to adhere to the quality assurance \n     standards of the plan or issuer responsible for payment under \n     subparagraph (A) and to provide to such plan or issuer \n     necessary medical information related to the care provided.\n       (C) The provider agrees otherwise to adhere to such plan's \n     or issuer's policies and procedures, including procedures \n     regarding utilization review and referrals, and obtaining \n     prior authorization and providing services pursuant to a \n     treatment plan (if any) approved by the plan or issuer.\n       (4) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to require the coverage of benefits which would not \n     have been covered if the provider involved remained a \n     participating provider.\n\n[[Page S9584]]\n\n       (d) Protection Against Involuntary Disenrollment Based on \n     Certain Conditions.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), a group health \n     plan and a health insurance issuer in connection with the \n     provision of health insurance coverage may not disenroll an \n     individual under the plan or coverage because the \n     individual's behavior is considered disruptive, unruly, \n     abusive, or uncooperative to the extent that the individual's \n     continued enrollment under the coverage seriously impairs the \n     plan's or issuer's ability to furnish covered services if the \n     circumstances for the individual's behavior is directly \n     related to diminished mental capacity, severe and persistent \n     mental illness, or a serious childhood mental and emotional \n     disorder.\n       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the \n     behavior engaged in directly threatens bodily injury to any \n     person.\n       (e) General Access.--\n       (1) In general.--Each group health plan, and each health \n     insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, that \n     provides benefits, in whole or in part, through participating \n     health care providers shall have (in relation to the \n     coverage) a sufficient number, distribution, and variety of \n     qualified participating health care providers to ensure that \n     all covered health care services, including specialty \n     services, will be available and accessible in a timely manner \n     to all participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees under the \n     plan or coverage.\n       (2) Treatment of Certain Providers.--The qualified health \n     care providers under paragraph (1) may include Federally \n     qualified health centers, rural health clinics, migrant \n     health centers, high-volume, disproportionate share \n     hospitals, and other essential community providers located in \n     the service area of the plan or issuer and shall include such \n     providers if necessary to meet the standards established to \n     carry out such subsection.\n\n     SEC. 123. ACCESS TO APPROVED SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Coverage for Individuals Participating in Approved \n     Clinical Trials.--\n       (1) Coverage.--\n       (A) In general.--If a group health plan, or health \n     insurance issuer that is providing health insurance coverage, \n     provides coverage to a qualified individual (as defined in \n     paragraph (2)), the plan or issuer--\n       (i) may not deny the individual participation in the \n     clinical trial referred to in paragraph (2)(B);\n       (ii) subject to paragraph (3), may not deny (or limit or \n     impose additional conditions on) the coverage of routine \n     patient costs for items and services furnished in connection \n     with participation in the trial; and\n       (iii) may not discriminate against the individual on the \n     basis of the enrollee's participation in such trial.\n       (B) Exclusion of certain costs.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (A)(ii), routine patient costs do not include \n     the cost of the tests or measurements conducted primarily for \n     the purpose of the clinical trial involved.\n       (C) Use of in-network providers.--If one or more \n     participating providers is participating in a clinical trial, \n     nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed as preventing \n     a plan or issuer from requiring that a qualified individual \n     participate in the trial through such a participating \n     provider if the provider will accept the individual as a \n     participant in the trial.\n       (2) Qualified individual defined.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (1), the term ``qualified individual'' means an \n     individual who is a participant or beneficiary in a group \n     health plan, or who is an enrollee under health insurance \n     coverage, and who meets the following conditions:\n       (A)(i) The individual has a life-threatening or serious \n     illness for which no standard treatment is effective.\n       (ii) The individual is eligible to participate in an \n     approved clinical trial according to the trial protocol with \n     respect to treatment of such illness.\n       (iii) The individual's participation in the trial offers \n     meaningful potential for significant clinical benefit for the \n     individual.\n       (B) Either--\n       (i) the referring physician is a participating health care \n     professional and has concluded that the individual's \n     participation in such trial would be appropriate based upon \n     the individual meeting the conditions described in \n     subparagraph (A); or\n       (ii) the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee provides \n     medical and scientific information establishing that the \n     individual's participation in such trial would be appropriate \n     based upon the individual meeting the conditions described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Payment.--\n       (A) In general.--Under this subsection a group health plan \n     or health insurance issuer shall provide for payment for \n     routine patient costs described in paragraph (1)(A) but is \n     not required to pay for costs of items and services that are \n     reasonably expected (as determined by the Secretary) to be \n     paid for by the sponsors of an approved clinical trial.\n       (B) Payment rate.--In the case of covered items and \n     services provided by--\n       (i) a participating provider, the payment rate shall be at \n     the agreed upon rate, or\n       (ii) a nonparticipating provider, the payment rate shall be \n     at the rate the plan or issuer would normally pay for \n     comparable services under subparagraph (A).\n       (4) Approved clinical trial defined.--\n       (A) In general.--In this subsection, the term ``approved \n     clinical trial'' means a clinical research study or clinical \n     investigation approved and funded (which may include funding \n     through in-kind contributions) by one or more of the \n     following:\n       (i) The National Institutes of Health.\n       (ii) A cooperative group or center of the National \n     Institutes of Health.\n       (iii) Either of the following if the conditions described \n     in subparagraph (B) are met:\n\n       (I) The Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (II) The Department of Defense.\n\n       (B) Conditions for departments.--The conditions described \n     in this subparagraph, for a study or investigation conducted \n     by a Department, are that the study or investigation has been \n     reviewed and approved through a system of peer review that \n     the Secretary determines--\n       (i) to be comparable to the system of peer review of \n     studies and investigations used by the National Institutes of \n     Health, and\n       (ii) assures unbiased review of the highest scientific \n     standards by qualified individuals who have no interest in \n     the outcome of the review.\n       (5) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to limit a plan's or issuer's coverage with respect \n     to clinical trials.\n       (b) Access to Prescription Drugs.--\n       (1) In General.--If a group health plan, or health \n     insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage, \n     provides benefits with respect to prescription drugs but the \n     coverage limits such benefits to drugs included in a \n     formulary, the plan or issuer shall--\n       (A) ensure participation of participating physicians and \n     pharmacists in the development of the formulary; and\n       (B) disclose to providers and, disclose upon request under \n     section 111(c)(5) to participants, beneficiaries, and \n     enrollees, the nature of the formulary restrictions; and\n       (C) consistent with the standards for a utilization review \n     program under section 102(a), provide for exceptions from the \n     formulary limitation when a non-formulary alternative is \n     medically indicated.\n       (2) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed as requiring a group health plan (or health \n     insurance issuer in connection with health insurance \n     coverage) to provide any coverage of prescription drugs or as \n     preventing such a plan or issuer from negotiating higher \n     cost-sharing in the case a non-formulary alternative is \n     provided under paragraph (1)(C).\n\n     SEC. 124. NONDISCRIMINATION IN DELIVERY OF SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Application to Delivery of Services.--Subject to \n     subsection (b), a group health plan, and health insurance \n     issuer in relation to health insurance coverage, may not \n     discriminate against a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     in the delivery of health care services consistent with the \n     benefits covered under the plan or coverage or as required by \n     law based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, \n     religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual \n     orientation, genetic information, or source of payment.\n       (b) Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall be \n     construed as relating to the eligibility to be covered, or \n     the offering (or guaranteeing the offer) of coverage, under a \n     plan or health insurance coverage, the application of any \n     pre-existing condition exclusion consistent with applicable \n     law, or premiums charged under such plan or coverage. To the \n     extent that health care providers are permitted under State \n     and Federal law to prioritize the admission or treatment of \n     patients based on such patients' individual religious \n     affiliation, group health plans and health insurance issuers \n     may reflect those priorities in referring patients to such \n     providers.\n\n     SEC. 125.

However, \n     there is growing anxiety among many Americans that insurance \n     health plan accountants--not doctors--are determining what \n     services and treatments they receive. Congress has an \n     opportunity to enact legislation this year which will ensure \n     that patients receive the benefits and services to which they \n     are entitled, without compromising the savings and \n     coordination of care that can be achieved through managed \n     care. However, to ensure the most effective result, \n     legislation must embody the following principles:\n       It must be bipartisan and balanced.\n       It must offer all 161 million privately insured Americans--\n     not just those in self-funded ERISA plans--a floor of basic \n     federal patient protections.\n       It must establish credible federal enforcement remedies to \n     ensure that managed care plans play by the rules and that \n     individuals harmed by such entities are justly compensated.\n       It should encourage managed care plans to compete on the \n     basis of quality--not just price. ``Report card'' information \n     will provide consumers with the information they need to make \n     informed choices based on plan performance.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       ``The Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998'' \n     blends the best features of both the Democratic and \n     Republican plans.\n\n[[Page S9588]]\n\n      The legislation would restore public confidence in managed \n     care through a comprehensive set of policy changes that would \n     apply to all private health plans in the country. These \n     include strengthened federal enforcement to ensure managed \n     care plans play by the rules; compensation for individuals \n     harmed by the decisions of managed care plans; an independent \n     external system for processing complaints and appealing \n     adverse decisions; information requirements to allow \n     competition based on quality; and, a reasonable set of \n     patient protection standards to ensure patients have access \n     to appropriate medical care.\n     Scope of protection\n       Basic protections for all privately insured Americans.--All \n     private insurance plans would be required to meet basic \n     federal patient protections regardless of whether they are \n     regulated at the state or federal level. This approach \n     follows the blueprint established with the enactment of the \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, \n     which allows states to build upon a basic framework of \n     federal protections.\n     Enforcement and compensation\n       Strengthened federal enforcement to ensure managed care \n     plans play by the rules.--To ensure compliance with the \n     bill's provisions, current federal law would be strengthened \n     by giving the Secretaries of Labor and Health & Human \n     Services enhanced authorities to enjoin managed care plans \n     from denying medically necessary care and to levy fines (up \n     to $50,000 for individual cases and up to $250,000 for a \n     pattern of wrongful conduct). This provision would ensure \n     that enforcement of federal law is not dependent upon \n     individuals bringing court cases to enforce plan compliance. \n     Rather, it provides for real federal enforcement of new \n     federal protections.\n       Compensation for individuals harmed by the decisions of \n     managed care plans.--All privately insured individuals would \n     have access to federal courts for economic loss resulting \n     from injury caused by the improper denial of care by managed \n     care plans. Economic loss would be defined as any pecuniary \n     loss caused by the decision of the managed care plan, and \n     would include lost earnings or other benefits related to \n     employment, medical expenses, and business or employment \n     opportunities. Awards for economic loss would be uncapped and \n     attorneys fees could be awarded at the discretion of the \n     court.\n     Coverage determination, grievance and appeals\n       Coverage determination based on medical necessity.--When \n     making determinations whether to provide a benefit (or where \n     or how that benefit should be provided) health plans would be \n     prohibited from arbitrarily interfering with the decision of \n     the treating physician if the services are medically \n     necessary and a covered benefit. Medically necessary services \n     would be defined by the treating physician in accordance with \n     generally accepted principles of professional medical \n     practice--not as defined by the plan. Plans would be required \n     to make coverage determinations in a timely manner, and have \n     a process for making expedited determinations.\n       Internal appeals.--Patients would be assured the right to \n     appeal the following: failure to cover emergency services, \n     the denial, reduction or termination of benefits, or any \n     decision regarding the clinical necessity, appropriateness, \n     efficacy, or efficiency of health care services, procedures \n     or settings. The plan would be required to have a timely \n     internal review system, using health care professionals \n     independent of the case at hand, and procedures for \n     expediting decisions in cases in which the standard timeline \n     could seriously jeopardize the covered individual's life, \n     health, ability to regain or maintain maximum function, or \n     (in the case of a child under the age of 6) development.\n       External appeals.--Individuals would be assured access to \n     an external, independent appeals process for cases of \n     sufficient seriousness or which exceed a certain monetary \n     threshold that were not resolved to the patient's \n     satisfaction through the internal appeals process. The \n     external appeal entity would have the authority to decide \n     whether a particular plan decision is in fact externally \n     appealable, not the plan. A reasonable medical practice \n     standard would be established against which to measure plan \n     conduct, and the range of evidence that is permissible in an \n     external review would include valid studies that have been \n     carried out by entities without a conflict of interest. The \n     external appeal process would require a fair, ``de novo'' \n     determination, the plan would pay the costs of the process, \n     and any decision would be binding on the plan.\n     Consumer information\n       Comparative information.--Consumers would be given uniform \n     comparative information on quality measures in order to make \n     informed choices. Data would include: patient satisfaction, \n     delivery of health care services such as immunizations, and \n     resulting changes in beneficiary health. Variations would be \n     allowed based on plan type.\n       Plan information.--Patients would be provided with \n     information on benefits, cost-sharing, access to services, \n     grievance and appeals, etc. A grant program would be \n     authorized to provide enrollees with information about their \n     coverage options, and with grievance and appeals processes.\n       Confidentiality of enrollee records.--Plans would be \n     required to have procedures to safeguard the privacy of \n     individually identifiable information.\n       Quality assurance.--Plans would be required to establish an \n     internal quality assurance program. Accredited plans would be \n     deemed to have met this requirement, and variations would be \n     allowed based on plan type.\n     Patient protection standards\n       Emergency services.--Coverage of emergency services would \n     be based upon the ``prudent layperson'' standard, and, \n     importantly, would include reimbursement for post-\n     stabilization and maintenance care. Prior authorization of \n     services would be prohibited.\n       Enrollee choice of health professionals and providers.--\n     Patients would be assured that plans would:\n       allow women to obtain obstetrical/gynecological services \n     without a referral from a primary care provider;\n       allow plan enrollees to choose pediatricians as the primary \n     care provider for their children;\n       have a sufficient number, distribution and variety of \n     providers;\n       allow enrollees to choose any provider within the plan's \n     network, who is available to accept such individual (unless \n     the plan informs enrollee of limitations on choice);\n       provide access to specialists, pursuant to a treatment \n     plan;\n       in the case of a contract termination, allow continuation \n     of care for a set period of time for chronic and terminal \n     illnesses, pregnancies, and institutional care.\n       Access to approved services.--Plans would be required to \n     cover routine patient costs incurred through participation in \n     an approved clinical trial. In addition, they would be \n     required to use plan physicians and pharmacists in \n     development of formularies, disclose formulary restrictions, \n     and provide an exception process for non-formulary treatments \n     when medically necessary.\n       Nondiscrimination in delivery of services.--Discrimination \n     on the basis of race, religion, sex, disability and other \n     characteristics would be prohibited.\n       Prohibition of interference with certain medical \n     communications.--Plans would be prohibited from using ``gag \n     rules'' to restrict physicians from discussing health status \n     and legal treatment options with patients.\n       Provider incentive plans.--Plans would be barred from using \n     financial incentives as an inducement to physicians for \n     reducing or limiting the provision of medically necessary \n     services.\n       Provider participation.--Plans would be required to provide \n     a written description of their physician and provider \n     selection procedures. This process would include a \n     verification of a health care provider's license, and plans \n     would be barred from discriminating against providers based \n     on race, religion and other characteristics.\n       Appropriate standards of care for mastectomy patients.--\n     Plans would be required to cover the length of hospital stay \n     for a mastectomy, lumpectomy or lymph node dissection that is \n     determined by the physician to be appropriate for the patient \n     and consistent with generally accepted principles of \n     professional medical practice. Plans covering mastectomies \n     would also be required to cover breast reconstructive \n     surgery.\n                                  ____\n\n\n What Organizations Are Saying About the Promoting Responsible Managed \n                            Care Act of 1998\n\n       National Association of Children's Hospitals, Inc.: ``As \n     you have recognized, children have health and developmental \n     needs that are markedly different than the needs of the adult \n     population and require pediatric expertise to understand, \n     diagnose, and treat health problems correctly. . . .

We also \n     appreciate your inclusion of federally qualified health \n     centers (FQHCs) as providers that may be included in the \n     network.''\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Chafee, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Specter, and Senator Baucus for your \noutstanding leadership on an issue of vital importance to the country--\nprotecting patients from abuses by managed care organizations.\n  Mr. President, what looms before the Senate is ominous. If nothing \nchanges, when we return in September, we appear destined to be \nwitnesses to the Senate's version of a massive train wreck in the form \nof managed care debate.\n  The Republican train and the Democratic train are racing toward each \nother with ever-increasing speed and hostility, neither side willing to \napply the brakes and switch tracks--neither side mindful of the havoc \nthe wreck could cause.\n  If we don't switch tracks, the wreck is inevitable. And the \ncasualties will not be either political party. Instead, they will be \nthe American public, who have asked us to provide them with basic \nfederal protections.\n  My colleagues and I are simply not willing to sacrifice the \nopportunity to pass meaningful managed care reform this year for the \nopportunity to score political points.\n  Over the past few years, it has become increasingly clear that the \nAmerican people are anxious about their health security as a \nconsequence of managed care. Even managed care plans are nervous about \nthe possibility of declining enrollment due to an increasing lack of \nconsumer confidence.\n  Our bill seeks to leave the decision-making to doctors and their \npatients, and to ensure that patients get what they are paying for with \ntheir hard-earned dollars.\n  Our goal is to hold insurance companies accountable for the benefits \nand services they claim to be delivering. Patients want the right to \nsee a specialist when they need one; our bill assures that. Patients \nwant assurances they will get the medicines their doctors say they \nneed, not just what's on a plan's formulary; our bill assures that. \nPatients want to know that plans are not providing financial incentives \nto their doctors to withhold medically necessary treatment; our bill \nassures that. Parents want to know that a pediatrician is available to \nserve as their child's primary care provider; our bill assures that.\n  Women want to know that they can see their ob/gyn without first \ngetting permission from the plan's gatekeeper; our plan assures that.\n  However, having said all of that, it is vitally important to look at \nthe fine print when comparing the patient protections contained in each \nof these proposals because, as the saying goes, the Devil is in the \ndetails.\n  For example, all of the plans would require insurers to pay for \nemergency services. However, the GOP plan lacks a critical protection \nwhich was enacted into law for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997--reimbursement for post-\nstabilization care.\n  Each bill contains an external appeals process to allow patients to \nappeal denials or limitations of care to an independent entity. \nHowever, the Republican proposal would prevent any complaint for a \nservice valued at less than $1,000.00 from being referred to an \nexternal appeals body. Picture the situation where a woman is denied a \nmammogram which, had it been done, would have resulted in early \ndetection of breast cancer and you begin to understand why this \nprovision is problematic.\n  In closing while the idea of playing the blame game up to the fall \nelections might be appealing to some, we are asking our colleagues, \nthrough this legislation, to take another course of action--to pass \nmeaningful and effective patient protections for 161 million Americans \nthis year.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join Senators \nChafee, Graham, Specter, and Baucus to introduce the Promoting \nResponsible Managed Care Act of 1998. Our bill is a bipartisan effort \nthat we believe can be enacted this year.\n  Our effort is modest in authorship because we have chosen to draw \nfrom both Republican and Democratic bills, but bold in goal. We aim to \nbring protections to 161 million Americans without delay before this \nCongress adjourns. Included in those bold protections are new rights of \naccess to specialists, access to independent grievance and appeals, \nquality report cards, and compensation if a plan's actions result in \ntheir injury. Excluded are those provisions, even some with appeal, \nthat are likely to prevent any Congressional action on patients' rights \nthis year.\n  Over the last decade we have crossed over a turbulent river of change \nin health care. The raging cost escalation of the 80's and 90's \nbuffeted families and tore away an ever increasing share of their \npaycheck to pay for health insurance coverage. Some couldn't afford the \nprice, and lost their hold on health care--for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  Today, the on flowing health care costs have slowed, but left behind \npermanent changes in the health care shoreline. We have a tool that has \ndammed up health care costs--managed care. Yet, after more than a \ndecade of cost increases, we have over forty-one million uninsured \namong us that can't afford coverage. We need to be mindful of these \nuninsured and the millions close to losing their insurance whenever we \nintervene in the health care market in ways that raise costs.\n  Managed care has calmed the rise in medical costs that buffeted us so \nbadly and brought double-digit inflation under control. The average \nrate of increase of costs of medical plans\n\n[[Page S9590]]\n\ndropped 10 percent between 1991 and 1996. Without managed care, costs \nwould be higher, millions more would be uninsured, and wages and \nsalaries would be lower.\n  Today over 75 percent of Americans who receive their health coverage \nthrough their employer are in some form of managed care. Consumers no \nlonger have a family doctor--they have a gatekeeper. They don't pick a \nphysician--they (or in most cases, their employer) pick a network. A \nfamily's access to care, to drugs, to specialists all can be limited by \nthe managed care organization.\n  Now that cost increases have slowed, it is also time to focus on \nhealth care quality. Many people are nervous about the quality of their \nmanaged care plans. They are concerned that the success of managed care \nin containing costs, has come at the expense of health care quality.\n  People want to know that they can get health care for their children \nfrom pediatricians, go see a specialist if their condition warrants \nsome special attention, even go the emergency room if they feel that it \nis necessary.\n  They want to know that they aren't going to be locked out of medical \ncare by an unresponsive managed care bureaucracy, vainly calling an \nunanswered phone to get approval for necessary medical care.\n  The entry of managed care into the health care marketplace has \ncreated competition that has lowered prices, enabling better access for \nmillions to health care. But we also need to introduce competition over \nquality into this marketplace.\n  Our bill covers all 161 million Americans who are privately-insured. \nIt includes patient protection standards to protect patient's access to \nthe physician of their choice including women's access to obstetrical/\ngynecological specialists, a childs to a pediatrician, and other \npatients to specialists such as oncologists pursuant to a treatment \nplan.\n  It protects continuity of care, so that patients can continue to see \ntheir physician through an illness or pregnancy despite changes in the \nmanaged care network.\n  Plans would be prohibited from using ``gag rules'' to restrict \nphysicians communication with their patients.\n  Visits to emergency rooms would be covered based on the ``prudent \nlayperson'' standard and would include reimbursement for post \nstabilization and maintenance care.\n  Most important, we have included strong enforcement to protect these \nrights and protect the health and lives of all 161 privately insured \nAmericans.\n  We have four important enforcement rights. We give consumers the \nright to obtain performance information so they don't get trapped in a \nbad health plan in the first place, establish a new grievance and \nappeals process so that consumers have a speedy process and fair \nsetting to seek needed healthcare, give the U.S. Department of Labor \nand Health and Human Services the right to place heavy fines on health \nplans that don't protect patients, and finally, if all three fail, give \nthe patient new rights to sue for compensation in federal courts if all \nthe new protections fail and they are injured as the result of a \ndecision by their managed care plan.\n  Our first enforcement tool is to empower consumer choice based on \naccurate, comparable information with information about their health \ncare options. Millions of American healthcare consumers can get more \ninformation about the quality of a toaster oven or a candy bar than \nabout their health plan. Report cards on health care quality should be \nthe rule not the exception. Consumers who choose between plans, \nemployers who purchase them, and plans and providers who compete for \nbusiness will all drive up quality if report cards on their performance \nbecome the rule not the exception.\n  Some of the large employers in my state joined together years ago to \nhold health plans accountable. These companies stood up to say before \nthey would even offer a health plan to their employees, that plan would \nhave to agree to provide their record of performance and outcome on \ncritical services such as breast cancer screening, prenatal care, \nasthma and diabetic treatment.\n  Workers at these companies now choose the plan with the best \nperformance for them. All workers in America should have that right. It \ndrives up quality and drives down bad managed care plans.\n  We require that all health plans be held accountable by reporting how \nwell they are doing in providing the services that keep people healthy. \nWe allow the Secretary to develop requirements that will work for \ndifferent types of insurance, but get critical quality information to \nworkers and purchasers. Although Senator Nickles' bill includes \nvoluminous information requirements, nowhere does he ask for the most \ncritical information--how good a job is a health plan doing in keeping \nmembers of that plan healthy and alive.\n  Our second enforcement tool gives consumers in a health plan the \nright to appeal a denial of coverage to a independent, external panel \nof fair-minded experts under specific, quick deadlines.\n  When consumers need health care services, delays and indecision can \nbe critical. The appeals process protects patients health by getting \ndecisions made quickly and services provided before their medical \ncondition worsens. No longer will consumers and their doctors spend \nmonths or even years fighting through a morass of managed care \nbureaucrats none of whom seem accountable, and all of whom add their \nown dollop of delay to a final decision.\n  We have adopted the ``gold standard'' set by the Medicare program \nwhich guarantees an answer in 72 hours or less for urgent care, and in \nless than one month for even the most routine decisions. Consumers have \nfull rights to appeal any denial of care--both internally and to an \nexternal body for a completely independent review.\n  Third, we fix ERISA--a law that was enacted in 1974--so that it no \nlonger blunts enforcement of patient protections. Under current law \nthere are no meaningful enforcement remedies available to Americans who \nget their insurance through their employers. The U.S. Departments of \nLabor and Health and Human Services can do little to carry out their \nenforcement responsibilities. Individuals can not seek compensation \nwhen their health care plan makes a decision that injures them. A \nperson, grievously harmed by their plan, can only sue for the cost of \nthe benefit wrongly denied. For example, under current ERISA law, a \nmother on death's bed with cancer wrongly denied. For example, under \ncurrent ERISA law, a mother on death's bed with cancer because she \ndidn't get a mammogram would only be able to sue her health plan for \nthe cost of the mammogram.\n  The Democrats have chosen to address this problem by allowing \nparticipants in ERISA plans to seek redress, including uncapped \npunitive damages, in state courts, an absolute nonstarter with the \nRepublicans. The Republican plan simply extends the enforcement \nmechanism provided under current law, which is to say the cost of the \nbenefit denied, and have thrown in a small additional fine of $100 a \nday in cases where a health plan refuses to comply with the decision of \nthe external appeal entity. $100 is a cruel compensation for a family \nthat has lost a breadwinner through the botched denial of coverage of a \nmanaged care plan.\n  We believe it is vitally important for Congress to step up to the \nplate with a real federal patient rights enforcement. In order to \nensure that plans abide by the new patient protections in our bill, we \ngive new civil money penalty and injunctive relief authority to the \nSecretaries of Health and Human Services and Labor. Plans that violate \nthe law can be compelled to pay for it--up to $250,000.\n  Finally, there will be those tragic instances where our broad, new \nprotections fail. A person is injured despite their new rights and \npowers and the managed care organization is at fault. Under our plan, \npeople can take their plan to court, and sue that plan for the full \namount of any damages equal to their economic loss plus attorney's \nfees. The injured person can get back the loss of earnings or other \nbenefits related to employment, medical expense loss, replacement \nservices loss, loss due to death, burial costs, and loss of business or \nemployment opportunities, caused by the coverage determination of the \nmanaged care plan. For the injured person and their family, the dollars \nprobably can never compensate for the loss of health, but we think that \nit is critical that at least their\n\n[[Page S9591]]\n\neconomic losses by paid when a plan causes the injury.\n  That is our plan, a stronghold of patient rights protected by four \nwell-buttressed walls of individual and government enforcement. We have \ngiven patients the strongest tools at our disposal--information, appeal \nrights, agency enforcement, and access to the courts. Our proposal has \nthese strengths, but not the baggage of provisions that partisans of \neither party I fear may use to prevent congressional action. I urge the \npassage of the Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998 so that \n161 million Americans can receive its protections without \ndelay.\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators \nChafee, Graham, Lieberman, and Specter in introducing the Promoting \nResponsible Managed Care Act of 1998. This bill will provide needed \nprotections for all patients, while omitting the most polarizing \naspects of the two major managed care bills designed by Republican and \nDemocratic leaders. This bill seeks to establish a middle ground so \nthat patients can be guaranteed quality health care this year.\n  Mr. President, this legislation provides improved quality health care \nfor all 161 million Americans enrolled in private health insurance \nplans, including managed care plans. The measure will protect the \ndoctor-patient relationship, make information readily available, create \nquality standards, insure a timely appeals process, and provide \npatients with better access to care.\n  By offering report cards on health plans, patients will be given the \nopportunity to make informed choices when selecting a health plan. This \nbill will also guarantee patients access to their specialists, and \nensure that people have needed emergency treatment available wherever \nthey are. Patients will not just receive stabilization in the emergency \nroom, but will be guaranteed care afterwards as well.\n  The bipartisan bill gives women direct access to obstetrician-\ngynecologists, and children direct access to pediatricians. \nPrescription drugs which doctors deem necessary to patient care, \nwhether on provider formulary lists or not, will now be made available. \nRoutine costs associated with plan-approved clinical trials will also \nbe guaranteed. Gag clauses, which undermine the patient-doctor \nrelationship by penalizing doctors for referring patients to \nspecialists or discussing costly medical procedures, will be \nprohibited.\n  Mr. President, under the bipartisan bill, independent parties would \nbe given the authority to rule on managed care denials through an \nappeals process, guaranteeing that each patient has a chance to appeal \nHMO decisions. Enforcement laws will help guarantee these provisions. \nThis legislation will allow the Department of Health and Human Services \nand the Department of Labor to levy civil monetary penalties to managed \ncare plans which do not abide by the bill's provisions. Also, self and \nfully-insured patients will be granted access to federal courts to \nclaim compensatory damages.\n  Mr. President, in health care, quality patient care should be the \nbottom line. I believe that the bottom line is achieved by Democratic \nplan. But with a Democratic plan that is unlikely to pass in this \nRepublican-controlled Senate, and a Republican measure which would \nlikely be vetoed by the president, this proposal stands as a fresh \nstart to significant managed care reform. This bipartisan and balanced \nmeasure will ensure that quality care prevails over political \ndifferences, and I urge the Senate to pass it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS:\n  S. 2417. A bill to provide for allowable catch quota for red snapper \nin the Gulf of Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 national marine fisheries legislation\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation, which I have drafted to address a matter which is of \ngrowing concern in my state. In particular, my constituents who live \nand work in the coastal communities of Alabama have voiced serious and \nlegitimate concerns about the validity of recently issued National \nMarine Fisheries Service regulations which threaten to reduce the total \nallowable catch of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico this year. The red \nsnapper stock in the Gulf of Mexico is a very important economic asset \nfor my state and, in fact, serves as a major economic linchpin for many \nof these coastal communities. I believe that my bill presents a \nreasonable solution to ensuring the long-term viability of the snapper \nstocks while also ensuring continuity and economic stability for \nindividuals and communities who are so reliant on the income that \ncommercial and recreational snapper fishing provides. Additionally, I \nfeel that this bill could provide relief for persons in the shrimp \nindustry, who feel that they have been unduly and unfairly burdened by \nNMFS regulatory requirements. Mr. President, I would also like to \nstress that this bill would assist all Gulf Coast communities that rely \non the red snapper as an asset and I would hope that my colleagues who \nare hearing the same concerns from their constituencies will join with \nme in support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this bill in the future. \nFor the sake of brevity, however, I would simply like to highlight some \nof the features in my legislation. To begin with, it maintains a total \nallowable catch of 9,120,000 pounds for each calendar year 1998 through \n2001 which is to be allocated according to the current 51% commercial \nand 49% recreational split. The intent of this language is to provide \ncertainty to our coastal communities by establishing a total allowable \ncatch quota for this time period which cannot be lowered. The bill also \nprovides that release of this quota cannot be conditioned upon the \nperformance of bycatch reduction devices over the 1998-2001 time \nperiod. Additionally, the legislation maintains the current minimum \nsize limits, and maintains the National Marine Fisheries Service's \nrecently established 4 bag limit. My bill also requires the Secretary \nof Commerce to immediately review existing turtle excluder devices to \nsee if they can be certified as bycatch reduction devices in the hopes \nthat, if they can be so certified, shrimpers will be spared the cutting \nof an additional hole in their nets. Finally, my bill will also require \na future study of bycatch reduction efficiency to be undertaken by the \nSecretary so that snapper management techniques can be based on \naccurate, and scientifically sound, understanding of the role that \nbycatch reduction devices can play in our efforts to continue to \nstrengthen the replenishing snapper stocks. In my view, this bill adds \nclarity and stability to a situation that has been needlessly \ncomplicated over the past several years, and will allow both the \nregulators and the regulated community an opportunity to ``catch their \nbreath'' as we determine the proper steps to take in resolving this \nongoing debate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2418. A bill to establish rural opportunity communities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              RURAL OPPORTUNITIES EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Leahy, I introduce the Rural Opportunities \nEmpowerment Act of 1998--a bipartisan bill that will do a great deal to \nassist urban and rural areas develop communities in economic need.\n  The legislation will do a number of things. It builds off the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which authorized 20 rural and urban \nEmpowerment Zones, and creates new opportunities for those communities \ndesperately in need of federal assistance, but unable to access those \nfunds.\n  Our legislation will help scores of communities across the country \nseeking to improve their local economy through desperately needed \nfederal funds. Within our legislation, monies are provided for the 20 \nEmpowerment Zones authorized last year. Also, new grants are created \nfor communities that are not able or eligible to compete for the EZ \nRound II competition this fall. Additional points will be given to \nthose Enterprise Communities who have met a high standard of \nperformance and who are seeking to be designated as an Empowerment \nZone. Finally, a small amount of money will be provided to the \nSecretary to reward so-called ``Top Performers,'' and allow\n\n[[Page S9592]]\n\nthem to be able to continue their operations so additional goals of \ntheir strategic plan are met.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \nand the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Empowerment Zones and \nEnterprise Communities provide critical resources for those rural and \nurban areas in economic distress. Many of these communities intend to \napply for a Round II Empowerment Zone designation. Vermont's old North \nEnd in Burlington, for example, has met numerous milestones in their \nstrategic plan by successfully leveraging additional monies from the \nprivate sources. If Congress does not pass this legislation there will \nbe no funding. Burlington's application for an Empowerment Zone \ndesignation under Round II this fall will be useless.\n  Providing rehabilitation and tax breaks to businesses who are \ninterested in investing in a depressed area has been an impressive \nsuccess in Burlington and elsewhere and my legislation will not only \nallow Burlington to compete for Empowerment Zone status in Round II, \nbut it will also require HUD to disseminate best EC practices to other \nECs around the country who may not be performing as impressively. This \nlegislation is not only good for rural and urban communities, it is \ngood government.\n  I ask my colleagues to work with me and with Senator Leahy to ensure \nthat this legislation is passed in the short time we have left in the \n105th Congress. I will be working with the Finance Committee to ensure \nthat this Congress does not forget those communities who look toward \nthe federal government to provide incentives for the private sector to \ninvest in economically depressed areas.\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nJeffords today in introducing the Rural Opportunity Communities Act of \n1998. This bill will greatly enhance the Empowerment Zone program by \nproviding incentives to reward well performing Empowerment Zones and \nEnterprise Communities. The bill will also offer communities which face \nsignificant economic problems, but do not fit the strict definitions of \nthe Empowerment Zone program with an alternative built on the same \nlong-term, comprehensive, community-based planning.\n  In 1995 the first round of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise \nCommunities were designated. Those communities have well demonstrated \nthe potential of the program to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods and \npoverty stricken rural areas. In Burlington's Old North End, Vermont's \nonly Enterprise Community, the benefits of this program have been \ntremendous. What was once a decaying section of the city is now a vital \nneighborhood. Equally important, the ``New North End'' has become an \nintegral part of the city through the network of organizations and \ncommunity members that pulled together to develop a plan to revitalize \nthe area.\n  A new round of Empowerment Zone awards will allow additional \ncommunities to benefit from the program. This bill further enhances the \nEmpowerment Zone program by recognizing those communities which have \nmade the most progress in implementing their ten year plans and \nimproving their neighborhoods. These model Empowerment Zones and \nEnterprise Communities will be eligible to compete for special \nincentive grants so that the successful programs they have initiated \ncan continue to flourish. The success of well-performing Enterprise \nCommunities will also be recognized by giving them additional points on \ntheir applications for empowerment zone status.\n  FInally, the bill establishes a special demonstration program, the \nRural Opportunity Communities. This demonstration is designed to test \nthe Empowerment Zone model of long-term, community based planning, with \ncommunities which are facing economic problems different from those \ndefined by the Empowerment Zone program. Among other factors, the ROC \ndemonstration will recognize the very real problem of under-employment, \na significant problem in Vermont. The northeastern corner of Vermont, \nknown as the Northeast Kingdom, is regularly responsible for one of the \nhighest unemployment rates in the state. This is a very rural area \nwhere many families also hold down multiple jobs to make ends meet.\n  Last year I worked to bring together a group of economic development \norganizations and local officials to take a broader look at the \nproblems facing the region, and work to find a common approach to \naddressing those problems. Since that time this group, known as the \nNortheast Kingdom Enterprise Collaborative, has continued to grow and \nhas begun to lay the groundwork for a long-term plan for the three-\ncounty area. The ROC demonstration will offer a perfect opportunity for \nareas like the Northeast Kingdom, that are interested in pursuing this \nEmpowerment Zone model, to gain access to the resources they need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 2419.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) certain courts have found that States are preempted \n     under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 from \n     engaging in certain ratepayer protection activities critical \n     to ensuring reasonable rates for in-State ratepayers;\n       (2) those courts have found that, although States have the \n     authority initially to establish rates charged by qualifying \n     small power producers and qualifying cogenerators to local \n     electric utilities, that such States thereafter are preempted \n     by that Act from ensuring over time that rates--\n       (A) are just and reasonable to the retail electric \n     consumers of purchasing electric utilities and are in the \n     public interest; and\n       (B) do not exceed the incremental cost to such purchasing \n     electric utilities of alternative electric energy at the time \n     of delivery;\n       (3) other courts have found that States are preempted from \n     monitoring effectively the operating and efficiency \n     performance of in-State cogeneration and small power \n     production facilities for the purpose of determining whether \n     such facilities meet Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     standards for qualifying cogenerators; and\n       (4) that Act should be amended to clarify the intent of \n     Congress that States have the authority--\n       (A) to ensure that rates charged by qualifying small power \n     producers andqualifying cogenerators to purchasing electric \n     utilities--\n       (i) are just and reasonable to the electric consumers of \n     such purchasing electric utilities and in the public \n     interest; and\n       (ii) do not exceed the incremental cost to such purchasing \n     electric utilities of alternative electric energy at the time \n     of delivery; and\n       (B) to establish effective programs for monitoring the \n     operating and efficiency performance of in-State cogeneration \n     and small power production facilities for the purpose of \n     determining whether such facilities meet Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission standards for qualifying cogenerators.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF RULES.\n\n       Section 210(f)(1) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies \n     Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 824a-3(f)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(1) Beginning'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(1) By state regulatory authorities.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Beginning''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Requirements.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this section, a State regulatory authority may ensure that \n     rates charged by qualifying small power producers and \n     qualifying cogenerators--\n       ``(i) are just and reasonable to the electric consumers of \n     the purchasing electric utility and in the public interest; \n     and\n       ``(ii) do not exceed the incremental cost at the time of \n     delivery to the purchasing utility of alternative electric \n     energy and capacity.\n       ``(C) Monitoring.--A State regulatory authority may \n     establish programs for monitoring the operating and \n     efficiency performance of in-State cogeneration and small \n     power production facilities for the purpose of determining \n     whether the facilities meet standards established by the \n     Commission for qualifying facilities.\n       ``(D) Amendment of contract.--A State regulatory authority \n     may require that any\n\n[[Page S9593]]\n\n     contract entered into before the date of enactment of this \n     paragraph be amended to conform to any requirements imposed \n     under subparagraph (B).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Craig, \n        Ms. Milkulski, Mr. D'Amato, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Grassley and \n        Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2420. A bill to establish within the National Institutes of Health \nan agency to be known as the National Center for Complementary and \nAlternative Medicine; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n          center for complementary and alternative legislation\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, \ncosponsored by Senators Daschle, Hatch, Grassley, D'Amato, Wellstone, \nMikulski, Craig, and Moseley-Braun to improve and expand rigorous \nscientific review of alternative and complementary therapies. This bill \nwill elevate the NIH's Office of Alternative Medicine to Center status. \nIt would be renamed the ``National Center for Complementary and \nAlternative Medicine.''\n\n  Mr. President, the American public supports this bill. Increasingly, \nAmericans are turning to complementary and alternative medicine. \nAccording to a recent study by Harvard University researchers, fully \none third of Americans regularly use complementary and alternative \nmedicine. This same study found that in 1990, American consumers spent \nmore than $14 billion on these practices. In that year there were 425 \nmillion visits to complementary and alternative practitioners--more \nthan those to conventional primary care practitioners!\n  These practices, which range from acupuncture, to chiropractic care, \nto naturopathic, herbal and homeopathic remedies, are not simply \ncomplementary and alternative, but are integral to how millions of \nAmericans manage their health and treat their illnesses. Yet there is \nlittle scientific research being done to investigate and validate these \ntherapies.\n  We must reexamine our spending priorities. Approximately 90 million \nAmericans suffer from chronic illnesses which cost society roughly $659 \nbillion in health care expenditures, lost productivity and premature \ndeath. According to the Centers for Disease Control, we spend $28.6 \nbillion Medicare dollars on diabetes alone--a disease which can be \ntreated effectively with low-cost alternative therapies. A Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation study recently published in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (JAMA) revealed that the current health \ncare delivery system is not meeting the needs of the chronically ill in \nthe United States. The study also concluded that such trends reveal \nskyrocketing costs, increasing numbers of people in need and a \ndysfunctional system of care. Alternative medical therapies could offer \na cost-saving alternative to this trend.\n  We are in an era when we must take a closer look at ways to provide \ncost-effective, preventive health care, and as we do so, Congress must \nact to strengthen the mission of the Office of Alternative Medicine in \nfinding safe and effective treatments and preventive methods for \nchronic conditions. Patients throughout our nation are suffering \nbecause there is a lack of available information on alternative \nmedicine.\n  In 1992, after finding that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \nwas largely ignoring this increasingly important area, at my urging \nCongress passed legislation creating the Office of Alternative Medicine \n(OAM) within NIH. At that time, Congress charged OAM with assuring \nobjective, rigorous scientific review of alternative therapies. They \nwere to investigate and validate therapies so that consumers would be \nbetter informed as to what treatments work and what treatments don't.\n  It is now clear that without greater authority to initiate research \nprojects and assure unbiased and rigorous peer review, alternative \ntherapies will not be adequately reviewed. The main problem is that the \nOffice has no authority to directly provide research funding to any \nmedical professional seeking to study the safety and effectiveness of \nalternative treatments. And unlike all other major organizations within \nNIH, the OAM has no autonomy to oversee its mission and goals. Because \nthe Office must work through other Institutes to carry out research \nprojects, promising projects are blocked and considerable time and \nresources are wasted.\n  The bill we are introducing would increase the status and authority \nof the Office of Alternative Medicine by creating in its place a \nNational Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH. The \nprincipal change in authority is granting the Center the ability to \ndirectly fund research proposals and other projects. This will not only \nassure that alternative therapies receive the review they need and \ndeserve, it will improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary \nbureaucratic steps required by the current set up.\n  Our bill also addresses another shortcoming of the NIH's current \nhandling of alternative medicine research. The hallmark of rigorous \nscientific review at NIH is the peer review process. However, when it \ncomes to alternative and complementary therapies, there is no true peer \nreview. There are no complementary or alternative medicine specialists \non NIH peer review panels. That means, for example, that when a \nresearch proposal comes in on chiropractic care, it often is reviewed \nby peer review panels that include no chiropractors. Rather, these \nproposals may be reviewed by scientists who have little or no \nexperience in or knowledge about chiropractic care.\n  This has three negative results. First, these projects are not being \nreviewed by individuals with expertise in the fields contemplated by \nthe research. This reduces the scientific quality of the review \nprocess. Second, because those reviewing these proposals have no \nexpertise in this area, they may be less likely to support their \napproval. And, third, because those seeking NIH support of alternative \nmedicine research know that their proposals will not receive true peer \nreview, they may hesitate to apply, thereby reducing the number and \nquality of research proposals. Our proposal corrects this problem by \nrequiring that projects are reviewed by scientists with expertise in \nthe particular area of complementary and alternative medicine proposed \nto be studied.\n  The federal government and state-of-the-art science must begin to \ncatch up with the public's increasing demand for information and \nanswers regarding alternative and complementary health care. The time \nis now. I urge you and my colleagues to support this important bill \nthat will improve the quality of health care for Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 2421. A bill to provide for the permanent extension of income \naveraging for farmers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          permanent extension of income averaging for farmers\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am taking the floor today to introduce a \nbill which will respond to a critical problem faced by farmers. This \nproposal would amend the provision in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nthe temporarily reinstated income averaging for farmers.\n  When income averaging was eliminated as part of the Tax Reform Act of \n1986, Congress acted primarily on the assumption that fewer tax \nbrackets and dramatically lower marginal tax rates would substantially \nreduce the number of taxpayers whose fluctuating incomes could subject \nthem to higher progressive rates. Congress was also concerned that \nincome averaging, as it existed at that time, was effectively targeted \non taxpayers who actually experienced wildly fluctuating incomes.\n  Today, it is hard to imagine a group of taxpayers whose incomes \nfluctuate more wildly than farmers. There is no place where that kind \nof fluctuation is more vividly demonstrated than in my own state of \nNorth Dakota. In 1996, North Dakota farm income came in at $764 \nmillion. A year later, it was $15 million. That is a 98 percent \ndecrease, Mr. President! Fluctuations just don't come much wilder than \nthat.\n  Reflecting on the situation, I think Congress made a mistake \neliminating income averaging altogether in 1986--at least with respect \nto farmers. Fluctuating income is a fact of life in agriculture, and to \nthe extent that the Internal Revenue Code can respond to that reality, \nit should do so.\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\n  The change we made in 1997 was a good one, but it did not go far \nenough to help many farmers who desperately need it. That reinstatement \nof income averaging for farmers should have made farmers' incomes in \n1997 eligible for averaging and the reinstatement should have been \npermanent. The bill I introduce today does both.\n  This bill will provide modest, but much needed, assistance to farmers \nwho were devastated in 1997, and provide it in a way that is consistent \nwith the approach Congress took in the Taxpayer Relief Act last year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2421\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF INCOME AVERAGING FOR \n                   FARMERS.\n\n       Section 933(c) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 is \n     amended by striking ``after December 31, 1997, and before \n     January 1, 2001'' and inserting ``after December 31, 1996''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Gorton, and Mr. Nickles):\n  S. 2422. A bill to provide incentives for states to establish and \nadminister periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs for \nelementary school and secondary teachers; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n          measure to encourage results in teaching act of 1998\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato, to ensure that every \nclassroom in America is staffed with a competent, qualified and caring \nteacher. During the past several months, Congress has debated a number \nof initiatives to further this goal, including an amendment that \nSenator D'Amato and I introduced and passed as part of the Education \nSavings Accounts package. Our amendment passed with bipartisan support, \nand we are here today to pursue this legislation in light of the \nPresident's veto of the ESA bill.\n  As early as the 1890s, the United States was the world's premiere \nindustrial power, boasting a manufacturing sector roughly equal to that \nof Great Britain, Germany and France combined. While relatively new, \nthis industrial order grew at a remarkable pace, leading many to concur \nwith Teddy Roosevelt's prediction that the Twentieth Century would be \n``America's Century.''\n  As we stand at the edge of a new millennium, another economic \nrevolution in underway. But unlike the industrial revolution of one \nhundred years ago, this new revolution is defined not by large \nfactories and natural resources, but by something a little less \ntangible and a little more human. I believe the 21st Century will be \nknown as the ``Century of Knowledge,'' where ingenuity and innovation \nwill prove to be the most critical of resources. Now, if our children \nare to be prepared for the challenges ahead, educational excellence \nmust become our first order of business.\n  The President has placed education near the top of his domestic \nagenda. I am pleased that he, too, recognizes the importance of \nproviding our children with an education second to none. This is an \narea where we can easily agree. However, I am discouraged that none of \nhis proposals confronts the most basic, the most important, and the \nmost neglected aspect of public education: the quality of instruction \nin the classroom. It cannot be overstated that the best teachers \nproduce the best students. Unless the quality of teaching improves, all \nother very worthwhile reforms, from smaller classes and higher salaries \nto newer buildings and computers in the classroom--are meaningless.\n  Good teachers are the backbone to a good education. Every student in \nAmerica has a fundamental right to be taught by a skilled and well-\nprepared teacher. Teachers make all the difference in the learning \nprocess. America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, \nknowledgeable, and hardworking teachers. Studies show again and again \nthat teacher expertise is one of the most important factors in \ndetermining student achievement.\n  Nevertheless, the case for sweeping reform is not difficult to make. \nThe United States already spends more money per pupil than virtually \nany industrialized democracy in the world. Nonetheless, our children \nfrequently score near the bottom in international exams in science and \nmath. If the teacher-student relationship--which in my opinion is the \nmost basic building-block in the educational process--is defective, no \namount of resources will be able to turn bad schools into good schools. \nThrowing more money at the problem is no longer the answer. Again, real \nreforms are needed.\n  Mr. President, real education reform begins in America's classrooms. \nAny reform must include measures to ensure that teachers are qualified \nto teach the subjects they are teaching. To my dismay, I have learned \nthat all across the country, many teachers are being assigned to teach \nclasses for which they have no formal training. Consider these \nstatistics:\n  One out of five English classes were taught by teachers who did not \nhave at least a minor in English, literature, communications, speech, \njournalism, English education, or reading education.\n  One out of four mathematics classes were taught by teachers without \nat least a minor in mathematics or mathematics education.\n  Nearly 4 out of 10 life science or biology classes were taught by \nteachers without at least a minor in biology or life science.\n  More than half of physical science classes were taught by teachers \nwithout at least a minor in physics, chemistry, geology or earth \nscience.\n  More than half of history or world civilization classes were taught \nby teachers who did not have at least a minor in history.\n  Students in schools with the highest minority enrollments have less \nthan a 50% chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who holds \na license and a degree in the field he or she teaches.\n  Our schools and classrooms should be staffed with teachers who have \nthe appropriate training and background. One way to determine this \nwould be to test teachers on their knowledge of the subject areas they \nteach.\n  Teacher testing is an important first step toward upgrading the \nquality of classroom instruction. Testing would identify teachers who \nare not making the grade, and would enable principals to help weaker \nteachers improve. Much has been made about social promotion, \nwhere students are often pushed on to the next grade with his or her \npeers despite the fact that the student has not met the criteria needed \nto advance. In my opinion, teachers face social promotion too. They are \nkept on staff regardless of performance. That is wrong. States should \nmeasure the expertise of their teachers through periodic teacher \ntesting.\n\n  Common sense also dictates that we should not concentrate all our \nattention on underperforming teachers. We must also recognize that \nthere are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their \nstudents on a daily basis. Today, our public schools compensate \nteachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance \ninside the classroom. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers \nwho are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, known as the MERIT ACT--\nwhich stands for Measures to Enhance Results in Teaching--is the same \nlegislation that passed the Senate during debate on the Education \nSavings Accounts bill. It rewards states that test its teachers on \ntheir subject matter knowledge, and pays its teachers based on merit.\n  Here is how it works: we will make half of any additional funding \nover the FY 1999 level for the Eisenhower Professional Development \nProgram available to states that periodically test elementary and \nsecondary school teachers, and reward teachers based on merit and \nproven performance. There will be NO reduction in current funding to \nstates under this program based on this legislation. As funding \nincreases for this program, so will the amount each state receives. \nIncentives will and should be provided to those states that take the \ninitiative to establish teacher testing and merit pay programs.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that all current money being spent on this \nprogram is unaffected by this legislation.\n\n[[Page S9595]]\n\nOnly additional money will be used as an incentive for states to enact \nteacher testing and merit pay programs.\n  Finally, this amendment enables states to also use federal education \nmoney to establish and administer teacher testing and merit pay \nprograms. This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools \nwith the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning \nfor all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their \nenergy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it can be done \nwithout placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal \nbureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, as I pointed out earlier, the Senate has already \ndebated this innovative approach when we considered the Education \nSavings Accounts bill. I was impressed that we passed the amendment \nwith bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35, and that it was included in \nthe Conference report sent to the President for his signature. I was \ndisappointed, however, when the President vetoed that important \nlegislation on July 22, 1998, despite his own earlier involvement in \ndeveloping a teacher testing program in his home state of Arkansas \nwhile he was Governor.\n  As Governor, Bill Clinton enthusiastically supported teacher testing, \nand while Governor of South Carolina, Secretary of Education Richard \nRiley advocated a merit-pay plan. In fact, then-Governor Clinton in \n1984 said that he was more convinced than ever that competency tests \nwere needed to take inventory of teacher' basic skills. He said, \n``Teachers who don't pass the test shouldn't be in the classroom''. \nSince coming to Washington, however, neither the President nor \nSecretary Riley has tried to do for the children of America what they \nas Governors fought to do for the children of their own states. Our \nnation's children deserve better.\n  While Bill Clinton let an opportunity for true reform pass him by, I \nam encouraged by the recent action taken by the American Federation of \nTeachers. They, too, recognize that true reform begins in the classroom \nand that teacher quality must be at the heart of that reform. They \nrecently passed a resolution affirming the need for improved teacher \nquality, which also states that they will take a more active role in \nreviewing teacher performance and dismissing teachers that cannot be \nhelped. This same proposal was rejected two years ago by the \nFederation's membership. Again, I am encouraged by this change of \nheart. I am hopeful that we can work together with the AFT and any \nother organization interested in moving forward to improve teacher \nquality. While we may not agree on every approach, I would like to \ncommence an ongoing dialogue on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I must also point out how timely this legislation is \nin light of the recent reports out of the state of Massachusetts, which \ntested prospective teachers with a tenth-grade level exam. Sadly, 60 \npercent of those taking the test failed. It's unfortunate that the poor \nresults of the test overshadow the positive contributions teachers make \nday in and day out to challenge the imagination of their students. \nThat's why it's important to help teachers become the best they can be \nand to reward the outstanding teachers who are making a difference in \nthe lives of our youth. Our children deserve nothing less. That's what \nthis legislation does.\n  The President's lack of support for merit pay and teacher testing has \nonly temporarily set back the call for excellence in education. But I \nwill continue to press forward with plans to ensure that our classrooms \nare led by capable teachers, and I will continue the fight to give \ndedicated professionals who teach our children a personal stake in the \nquality of the instruction they provide. If we accomplish these \nreforms, and place the interests of students above the preservation of \nthe status quo, then the extraordinary dynamism of the American people \nwill continue, and the 21st Century will, once again, be the ``American \nCentury''.\n  I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this \nimportant initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Measures \n     to Encourage Results in Teaching Act of 1998''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All students deserve to be taught by well-educated, \n     competent, and qualified teachers.\n       (2) More than ever before, education has and will continue \n     to become the ticket not only to economic success but to \n     basic survival. Students will not succeed in meeting the \n     demands of a knowledge-based, 21st century society and \n     economy if the students do not encounter more challenging \n     work in school. For future generations to have the \n     opportunities to achieve success the future generations will \n     need to have an education and a teacher workforce second to \n     none.\n       (3) No other intervention can make the difference that a \n     knowledgeable, skillful teacher can make in the learning \n     process. At the same time, nothing can fully compensate for \n     weak teaching that, despite good intentions, can result from \n     a teacher's lack of opportunity to acquire the knowledge and \n     skill needed to help students master the curriculum.\n       (4) The Federal Government established the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower Professional Development Program in 1985 to ensure \n     that teachers and other educational staff have access to \n     sustained and high-quality professional development. This \n     ongoing development must include the ability to demonstrate \n     and judge the performance of teachers and other instructional \n     staff.\n       (5) States should evaluate their teachers on the basis of \n     demonstrated ability, including tests of subject matter \n     knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. States \n     should develop a test for their teachers and other \n     instructional staff with respect to the subjects taught by \n     the teachers and staff, and should administer the test every \n     3 to 5 years.\n       (6) Evaluating and rewarding teachers with a compensation \n     system that supports teachers who become increasingly expert \n     in a subject area, are proficient in meeting the needs of \n     students and schools, and demonstrate high levels of \n     performance measured against professional teaching standards, \n     will encourage teachers to continue to learn needed skills \n     and broaden teachers' expertise, thereby enhancing education \n     for all students.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide incentives for States to establish and \n     administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs \n     for elementary school and secondary school teachers.\n       (2) To encourage States to establish merit pay programs \n     that have a significant impact on teacher salary scales.\n       (3) To encourage programs that recognize and reward the \n     best teachers, and encourage those teachers that need to do \n     better.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT PAY.\n\n       (a) Amendments.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating part D as part E;\n       (2) by redesignating sections 2401 and 2402 as sections \n     2501 and 2502, respectively; and\n       (3) by inserting after part C the following:\n\n      ``PART D--STATE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT PAY\n\n     ``SEC. 2401.

TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT PAY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a State may use Federal education funds--\n       (1) to carry out a test of each elementary school or \n     secondary school teacher in the State with respect to the \n     subjects taught by the teacher; or\n       (2) to establish a merit pay program for the teachers.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``elementary \n     school'' and ``secondary school'' have the meanings given the \n     terms in section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801).\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Mack, to introduce the MERIT Act. The MERIT Act seeks to reward \nthose teachers who provide, day in and day out, magic in the \nclassrooms, to reward them with a salary to match their importance. We \nshould develop a methodology of rewarding those truly outstanding \nteachers and seeing to it that we keep them, retain them. Truly \noutstanding teachers are the unsung heroes of our communities. \nUnfortunately, however, great education does not take place for every \nchild in every classroom, and that is sad. But it is something we can \nstrive for and work to change.\n  The bill that Senator Mack and I introduce comes on the heels of \nreceiving some discouraging news, news from Massachusetts where a test \nof prospective teachers was given and nearly 60 percent of them failed. \nIt was a test at the eighth-grade level. I firmly believe that most New \nYork teachers are very good. But, nonetheless, I must ask the question, \nWhy not have the best? Why not reach out to them? Why not attract them?\n  The Massachusetts test was a good idea, but we should also give \nperiodic competency tests to teachers who are already in the system. \nMost teachers are very dedicated and highly competent, but some are \nnot. Some teachers who are highly skilled in one or two subject areas \nmay be forced to teach other subjects in which they lack the \ncompetence. When that happens, our children are the ones who suffer.\n  Another desperately needed reform is merit pay for outstanding \nteachers. We must reward the best teachers. In most of our Nation's \nschools there is no financial incentive for the truly outstanding \nteachers. Great teachers, who help our children achieve educational \nexcellence, should be rewarded.\n  The measure introduced today by Senator Mack and myself, the MERIT \nAct, is the same measure that passed the Senate on April 21 by a vote \nof 63 to 35. This legislation provides incentives for States to \nestablish periodic teacher assessments and merit rewards. Incentives \nare provided through the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. \nThe measure sets aside 50 percent of the funds appropriated over the \nfiscal year 1999 levels in the program, and then distributes them to \nStates that have established teacher testing and merit pay. Last year, \nfiscal year 1998, Congress appropriated $335 million for this program \nto subsidize training for teachers. That is an increase of $25 million \nfrom the year before. Should we not be able to use this program to \nensure that teachers are actually improving their teaching skills, as \nwell as substantive knowledge? Teacher testing will help accomplish \nthat goal.\n  But let me be clear. As the Eisenhower Professional Development \nProgram funding increases, so will each State and local government's \nshare, with 50 percent of the increase reserved for those States that \nput in place a mechanism by which to periodically measure the ability, \nknowledge, and skills of teachers, and implement a pay scale to reward \nthose determined and dedicated teachers. When we look at reforming our \npublic schools, one thing must always be kept foremost in our efforts, \nand that is, we must put our children first. Our children are the best \nand the brightest. They are our most precious resource.\n  So, when it comes to recruiting and retaining the best young \nprofessionals, I believe, in order to do that, we are going to have to \npay them adequately. We are going to have to reward their \naccomplishments and see to it that the truly outstanding are rewarded \nwith merit pay so we can assure our children get that opportunity. I \nhope our colleagues will join in this effort to improve America's \nschools and help prepare our children for the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n  S. 2423.

Mr. President, I introduce legislation to improve \nthe accuracy of Congressional Budget Office estimates.\n  Congress places enormous demands on the professionals working in the \nCBO. Day after day, year after year these dedicated men and women are \nasked to provide estimates and projections on which legislators rely in \ncarrying out their public responsibilities. Their hard work and \nprofessionalism are well known and they deserve our gratitude for the \nexcellent job they do.\n  However, Mr. President, CBO estimates and projections are only as \ngood as the assumptions on which they are based. No matter how \ndedicated and hard-working they are, they are limited by the tools at \ntheir disposal. And recent experience shows that those tools require \nimprovement.\n  Mr. President, there was a great deal of surprise, both in this \nChamber and across the country, when the CBO released its latest \nestimates regarding federal budget surpluses. In January of this year \nthe CBO had projected a $5 billion deficit for 1998, with surpluses of \n$127 billion for the period 1998-2003 and $655 billion for the period \n1998-2008. But in its July budget update, the CBO projected a $63 \nbillion surplus for 1998, a $583 billion surplus for the period 1998-\n2003, and a $1,611 billion surplus for the period 1998-2008.\n  Those are massive discrepancies, Mr. President, and they have a \nsignificant impact on our ability to legislate. Coming so late in the \nsession, these new estimates are not as helpful as they could have been \nin helping shape our fiscal policies. What they mean, in essence, is \nthat Congress has been determining its budgets and appropriations with \ninaccurate revenue estimates.\n  What is more, Mr. President, it does not appear that the accuracy of \nCBO projections will improve without Congressional action. Current CBO \npolicy calls for basing estimates on the assumption that federal \nrevenues will grow more slowly than Gross Domestic Product. This \ndespite the long-standing trend of revenues outpacing GDP. Thus we can \nlook forward to revenue estimates in the future that remain \nsignificantly lower than actual revenues.\n  Without accurate revenue estimates, Mr. President, we cannot properly \naddress tax reform and general fiscal policy. Indeed, without knowing \nthe level of federal revenues with a significant degree of accuracy we \ncannot properly and responsibly budget for the federal government. We \nmust establish a fair and accurate mechanism for estimating federal \nrevenue.\n  That is why I am introducing the CBO Improvement Act. This \nlegislation is based on a bill introduced in the 102nd Congress by \nRepresentatives Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and Robert Michel. It would \nprovide CBO with the expert, hands-on oversight necessary to improve \nthe accuracy of its estimates.\n  To begin with, Mr. President, this legislation would establish a \nCongressional Budget Board to provide general oversight of CBO \noperations, oversee studies and publications that may be necessary in \naddition to those CBO is required by law to produce, and provide \nguidance to the CBO Director in the formulation and implementation of \nprocedures and policies. This board would be made up of 6 members each \nfrom the Senate and the House of Representatives, half from each party.\n  In addition to its oversight function, the Board will establish an \nEconomic Advisory Council. This Council will evaluate CBO research for \nthe Board. It will be composed of 12 members, each\n\n[[Page S9597]]\n\nprominent in the fields of public finance, economics of taxation and \nmicroeconomics and macroeconomics.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, under this legislation any CBO report to \nCongress or the public that contains an estimate of the effect that \nlegislation will have on revenues or expenditures shall be accompanied \nby a written statement fully disclosing the economic, technical, and \nbehavioral assumptions that were made in producing the estimate. By \nmaking these assumptions public, we can provide an opportunity for \noutside experts, whether in business or academia, to evaluate them and \noffer suggestions for improvement.\n  By establishing this kind of oversight and accountability, Mr. \nPresident, we can ensure that in the future the CBO will base its \nrevenue estimates on assumptions that better reflect reality. No one is \nquestioning the dedication or skill of CBO employees. But we must see \nto it that they are given the appropriate tools to carry out their jobs \nin the best manner possible. Only in this way can Congress fulfill its \nduty to pass legislation in keeping with economic reality as well as \nthe best interests of the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two articles, one written \nby economist Bruce Bartlett and appearing in the July 6 Washington \nTimes, the other a Congressional advisory dated July 22 from the \nInstitute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 6, 1998]\n\n                      Revenue pitch low and inside\n\n                          (By Bruce Bartlett)\n\n       Many Republicans believe the main barrier to enactment of a \n     large tax cut this year is the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO), because it is low-balling its forecast of future \n     federal revenues. They think revenues next year will come in \n     substantially higher than CBO is predicting, allowing for a \n     significantly larger tax cut than Congress is currently \n     contemplating, without endangering the balanced budget. They \n     note that last year CBO underestimated federal revenues by \n     $72 billion and they suspect revenues may be underestimated \n     by a similar magnitude this year.\n       On June 23, CBO Director June O'Neill responded to her \n     critics in a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich. She \n     argued that everyone, not just the CBO, underestimated \n     revenues last year.\n       Mrs. O'Neill pointed out that CBO's deficit forecasts were \n     close to those made by the Office of Management and Budget \n     and private forecasters. In short, CBO did as well as \n     economic science allowed and should not be singled out for \n     blame when no one else did much better.\n       This is a strong argument. Nevertheless, CBO's estimate of \n     future revenues does seem to be unusually conservative. As \n     the figure indicates, CBO is predicting that revenues will \n     grow more slowly than gross domestic product (GDP) over the \n     next decade. Generally, because our tax system is \n     progressive, revenues grow faster than GDP. Throughout the \n     postwar period revenues grew by 0.6 percent per year more \n     than GDP. In the last 10 years, revenues grew even faster--\n     0.9 percent more than GDP. If CBO's GDP estimate is correct, \n     one would ordinarily expect between 5.2 percent and 5.5 \n     percent growth in future revenues, rather than the 4.5 \n     percent growth that is projected.\n       Mrs. O'Neill does not give a satisfactory explanation for \n     why revenues are expected to grow so much more slowly than \n     they have grown historically. Her main point seems to be that \n     there is bound to be a recession some time in the next decade \n     and that this will cause revenue growth to slow. But the \n     impact of past recessions is already incorporated into the \n     historical data on growth of actual revenues. So it seems odd \n     for the CBO in effect to predict a future recession will have \n     an impact on revenues much greater than those in the past.\n       No one is suggesting that the CBO is deliberately fudging \n     its numbers for some political purpose. However, Congress is \n     entitled to raise questions about the accuracy of the numbers \n     it must rely upon when making important decisions about \n     taxing and spending. The questions that have been raised \n     about CBO's revenue forecasts are legitimate and deserve a \n     better response than it has provided.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      IRET Congressional Advisory\n\n                        (By Michael A. Schuyler)\n\n\n             are cbo budget projections still understated?\n\n       Confronted with a torrent of tax dollars, the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) has revised its surplus projections \n     upward several times in 1998. In January, the CBO had \n     projected a $5 billion deficit for 1998 but surpluses of $127 \n     billion for 1998-2003 and $655 billion for 1998-2008. In \n     March, the CBO changed its 1998 forecast to an $8 billion \n     surplus but added only $11 billion to projected surpluses for \n     all subsequent years. In May, as tax revenues continued to \n     pour into Washington, the CBO upped its 1998 forecast to a \n     $43-$63 billion surplus, raised its 1999 forecast to a $30-\n     $40 billion surplus, but said it expected the changes for \n     years beyond then to be ``smaller amounts.'' In its July \n     budget update, the CBO projects a $63 billion surplus for \n     1998, an $80 billion surplus for 1999, a $583 billion surplus \n     for 1998-2003, and a $1,611 billion surplus for 1998-2008. \n     These are enormous numbers, but they may still be too low.\n       For several years, federal revenues have climbed \n     substantially more rapidly than nominal gross domestic \n     product (GDP). Between fiscal years 1995 and 1998, for \n     example, nominal GDP growth averaged a 5.3% annually while \n     revenue growth topped that by 3 percentage points yearly, \n     averaging 8.3% annually; for fiscal year 1998 alone, nominal \n     GDP is expected to increase 5.2% while revenues jump 8.7%. \n     The CBO's projections, however, assume that this pattern is \n     suddenly about to reverse itself. According to the CBO, \n     revenues will increase only slightly more rapidly than \n     nominal GDP in 1999, considerably more slowly than nominal \n     GDP in fiscal years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and generally \n     no faster than nominal GDP in subsequent years.\n       If the CBO had projected that revenue growth would merely \n     match nominal GDP growth, the 1998-2003 surplus would be $167 \n     billion greater than it currently projects and the 1998-2008 \n     surplus would be $570 billion greater, boosting the 11-year \n     total to more than $2.1 trillion.\n       The surpluses currently being projected indicate that \n     policymakers now have a major opportunity to reform the \n     troubled U.S. tax system in ways that would substantially \n     reduce both its inefficiencies and its complexity. If the \n     actual surpluses prove to be higher, the opportunity to make \n     positive tax changes would be even greater. Unfortunately, \n     unreasonably low CBO projections may deter policymakers from \n     acting on this opportunity.\n       Another consideration for policymakers is that, except for \n     a brief period during World War II, federal revenues have \n     never commandeered a larger share of GDP than they are now \n     (20.5%). It is only by postulating that revenues will \n     suddenly grow more slowly than GDP that the CBO can project a \n     reduction in the revenue-GDP ratio without the need for a tax \n     cut. If the historical relationship holds and taxes are not \n     reduced, the government will be setting new records every \n     year in the share of people's productive output it is taking \n     away in taxes.\n       Despite the CBO's projection, two lines of reasoning \n     suggest that, unless there is tax relief, revenues are likely \n     to continue growing faster than nominal GDP is attributable \n     to inflation, and inflation would push up taxes and nominal \n     GDP at equal rates even if the tax code were fully indexed \n     for inflation. In actuality, because many tax provisions lack \n     inflation protection (some examples are the alternative \n     minimum tax's exempt amount, the income threshold for taxing \n     social security benefits, the computation of capital gains, \n     and the corporate income tax's progressive rate schedule), \n     the government reaps an inflation dividend from taxpayers \n     (albeit a much smaller inflation dividend from taxpayers \n     (albeit a much smaller inflation dividend that before the \n     Reagan Administration introduced inflation indexing in the \n     1980s.) thus, to the extent nominal GDP increases because of \n     inflation, federal revenues would be expected to increase as \n     rapidly or more rapidly than nominal GDP.\n       In addition, nominal GDP increases because of real growth \n     in the economy. Some real growth occurs simply because \n     population is increasing. Real growth from this source tends \n     to increase federal revenues at the same rate as GDP. Real \n     growth also occurs, though, because people are becoming more \n     productive over time, resulting in rising wages and \n     incomes. Because the tax system is progressive, real \n     growth per capita pushes people into higher tax brackets, \n     which causes the government to take a larger share of \n     their incomes. (Tax indexing does not cover real wage \n     growth. In fact, even if the CPI slightly overstated \n     inflation, tax indexing does not fully offset the combined \n     effects on real tax collections of productivity-related \n     wage hikes and inflation.) Thus, the portion of real \n     growth attributable to higher population will tend to \n     raise federal revenues in line with GDP increases and the \n     portion attributable to higher productivity will tend to \n     boost revenues relative to GDP. Either way, there is no \n     explanation for revenues growing more slowly than GDP.\n       The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA-97) included some tax \n     reductions phased in over several years. Could the phased-in \n     tax cuts of TRA-97 explain why the CBO is projecting such \n     slow relative growth in federal revenues? No, even if TRA-\n     97's changes are added back to revenues, the CBO is still \n     projecting that revenues will grow more slowly than nominal \n     GDP.\n       Another possible explanation for revenues suddenly growing \n     more slowly than GDP would be a redistribution of GDP from \n     taxpayers subject to high tax rates to taxpayers subject to \n     low tax rates. Among those taxed at higher rates are \n     corporations, and the CBO does project that corporate profits \n     as a share of GDP will decline somewhat over the next five \n     years. But this does not explain the revenue slowdown. The \n     CBO's projection for revenue growth, excluding corporate \n     income\n\n[[Page S9598]]\n\n     taxes, is not quite as slow as the CBO's projected growth \n     rate for all revenues, but it still trails GDP growth for \n     several years starting in 2000 and then in later years grows \n     no more rapidly.\n       Tax collections have been running much higher than the CBO \n     had previously forecast mainly in the area of personal income \n     not subject to withholding. Due to the government's slowness \n     in analyzing tax return data, the sources of that taxable \n     income are not yet known with certainty. Two often-mentioned \n     possibilities are non-corporate business income and capital \n     gains realizations. Business income has been strong and \n     capital gains realizations have been bolstered by lower tax \n     rates and a strong stock market. If business income and \n     capital gains realizations are the sources of the robust \n     revenue growth, there is no reason to expect them to \n     evaporate, barring undesirable policy changes such as higher \n     taxes, more government regulations, or higher inflation.\n       The CBO argues, however, that because the sources of the \n     higher-than-it-expected taxable income are not yet entirely \n     clear, the income from those sources should be assumed to be \n     atypically high in 1998, and the CBO arbitrarily excludes \n     part of it in projecting future taxable income and tax \n     collections. This arbitrary exclusion is a key reason the \n     CBO projects that revenues will increase more slowly than \n     GDP for several years and then increase no more rapidly. \n     As explained, this result is peculiar because, unless \n     taxes are cut from time to time, revenues tend to increase \n     relative to GDP due to inflation and real growth.\n       The uncertainty about the source of higher-than-anticipated \n     current revenues could be resolved very quickly if the \n     Internal Revenue Service immediately analyzed a sample of \n     recently received tax returns. With literally billions of \n     dollars of tax relief perhaps hanging in the balance, such a \n     sample should be examined at once.\n       In the discussion thus far, it has been assumed that the \n     CBO's assumptions about GDP growth are accurate. In reality, \n     they may be too pessimistic--especially if pro-productivity \n     tax relief is enacted to invigorate the U.S. economy. The CBO \n     assumes that real GDP will grow less than 2.2% annually over \n     the next decade and that for most of the period the \n     unemployment rate will be more than a percentage point higher \n     than it is presently. The CBO is apparently still wedded to \n     the idea of the Phillips curve and cannot believe that \n     unemployment much under 6% can coexist for very long with low \n     inflation. If the CBO did not assume the economy would expand \n     so little in the future, its revenue projection would be much \n     higher (the size of the economy is one of the most powerful \n     determinants of tax revenues), leading to far larger \n     surpluses.\n       The strong possibility that the CBO is still \n     underestimating budget surpluses underscores the desirability \n     of tax relief. As surpluses mount, there is less and less \n     reason to endure tax inefficiencies and complexities that \n     could be corrected through well designed relief.\n       Changes that ease anti-production tax biases will tend to \n     strengthen the economy and sustain the economic expansion, \n     leading to further benefits for everyone, and recouping much \n     of the static revenue loss in the process. In contrast, if \n     tax relief is not forthcoming, the American people may be \n     condemned to paying a steadily mounting share of their \n     incomes and output to the government, weakening the economy \n     and income growth in the process. Further, while some claim \n     that Washington will use the projected surpluses to pay off \n     the federal debt, a more realistic appraisal is that \n     Washington will soon channel into increased government \n     spending whatever it does not relinquish through tax cuts, \n     notwithstanding the waste, inefficiency, and perverse \n     incentives of many government spending programs.\n     Note: Nothing here is to be construed as necessarily \n     reflecting the views of IRET or as an attempt to aid or \n     hinder the passage of any bill before the Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. \n        Coverdell):\n  S. 2425. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional tax incentives for education; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          ``The Collegiate Learning and Student Savings Act''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The \nCollegiate Learning and Student Savings Act'' a common sense piece of \nlegislation which will help more than 2.5 million students afford a \ncollege education.\n  This legislation, cosponsored by Senators Bob Graham, Mitch McConnell \nand Paul Coverdell, will allow private colleges and universities to \nestablish prepaid tuition plans and allow a family's investment in ALL \nstate or private tuition savings and prepaid plans to be tax-free.\n  Let me take a few minutes to discuss the concept of prepaid tuition \nplans and why they are critically important to America's families.\n  As a parent who has put two children through college and who has \nanother currently enrolled in college, I know first-hand that America's \nfamilies are struggling to meet the rising costs of higher education. \nIn fact, American families have already accrued more college debt in \nthe 1990s than during the previous three decades combined. The reason \nis twofold: the federal government subsidizes student debt with \ninterest rate breaks and penalizes educational savings by taxing the \ninterest earned on that savings.\n  In recent years, however, many families have tackled rising tuition \ncosts by taking advantage of pre-paid college tuition plans. These \nplans allow families to purchase tuition credits years in advance. \nThanks to innovative programs already established by 17 states, like my \nhome state of Alabama, parents can actually lock in today's tuition \nrates for tomorrow's education.\n  Congress has supported participating families by expanding the scope \nof the pre-paid tuition plans and by deferring the taxes on the \ninterest earned until the student goes off to college.\n  My legislation, modeled after the efforts of the House Ways and Means \nChairman Bill Archer and Senator Coverdell's efforts on the ``A+ \nEducation Accounts'' bill, will make earnings in state AND private \neducation pre-paid plans completely tax-free.\n  Currently, most of the interest earned by families saving for college \nis taxed twice. Families are taxed on the income they earn and then \nagain on the interest they earn through savings. On the other hand, the \nfederal government subsidizes student loans by deferring interest \npayments until graduation. It is no wonder that families are struggling \nto save for college and instead are going heavily into debt. This trend \nmust not continue.\n  In order to provide families a new alternative, ``The Collegiate \nLearning and Student Savings Act'' will provide tax-free treatment to \nall pre-paid plans for public and private colleges and universities. \nThis would place all savings plans and all schools on an equal playing \nfield.\n  This bipartisan piece of legislation would not only provide American \nfamilies with more than $1 billion dollars in much-needed tax relief \nover the next decade, but would also help control the cost of college \nfor all students. In fact, the track record of existing state pre-paid \nplans indicates that working, middle-income families, not the rich, \nbenefit the most from pre-paid plans.\n  Mr. President, It is erroneous to assume that tuition savings and \nprepaid plans benefit mainly the wealthy. In fact, the experience of \nexisting state plans indicates that working, middle-income families \nbenefit most. For example, families with an annual income of less than \n$35,000 purchased 62 percent of the prepaid tuition contracts sold by \nPennsylvania in 1996. The average monthly contribution to a family's \ncollege savings account during 1995 in Kentucky was $43.\n  Prepaid tuition plans must become law. The federal government can no \nlonger subsidize student debt with interest rate breaks and penalize \neducational savings by taxing the interest earned by families who are \ntrying to save for college. Both public and private prepaid tuition \nplans should be held equal by the federal government and must be \ncompletely tax free. If these goals are achieved, the federal \ngovernment would be providing families the help they need to meet the \ncost of college through savings rather than through debt.\n  Mr. President, American families accumulated more college debt during \nthe first five years of the 1990s than in the previous three decades \ncombined. Recognizing that this trend cannot continue, several states \nhave established tuition savings and prepaid tuition plans. Now, a \nnationwide consortium of more than 50 private schools, with more than 1 \nmillion alumni, has launched a similar plan for private institutions. \nThese plans are extremely popular with parents, students, and alumni. \nThey make it easier for families to save for college, and the prepaid \ntuition plans also take the uncertainty out of the future cost of \ncollege.\n  ``The Collegiate Learning and Student Savings Act'' eliminates the \ndouble taxation that exists on interest earned through the programs and \nends the disparity that currently exists between public and private \ncolleges.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the cosponsors of ``The \nCollegiate Learning and Student Savings Act'', Senators Graham, \nMcConnell and\n\n[[Page S9599]]\n\nCoverdell, for their assistance and dedication to this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Res. 264\n\n       Whereas every day in America, 15 children under the age of \n     19 are killed with guns;\n       Whereas in 1994, approximately 70 percent of murder victims \n     aged 15 to 17 were killed with a handgun;\n       Whereas in 1995, nearly 8 percent of high school students \n     reported having carried a gun in the past 30 days;\n       Whereas young people are our Nation's most important \n     resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in \n     helping children grow from a childhood free from fear and \n     violence into healthy adulthood;\n       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for \n     their own decisions and actions, and by positively \n     influencing the decisions and actions of others, help chart a \n     new and less violent direction for the entire Nation;\n       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation \n     will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide \n     observance involving millions of their fellow students, and \n     will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant \n     agents in a wave of positive social change; and\n       Whereas the observance of this day will give American \n     students the opportunity to make an earnest decision about \n     their future by voluntarily signing the ``Student Pledge \n     Against Gun Violence'', and sincerely promise that they will \n     never take a gun to school, will never use a gun to settle a \n     dispute, and will use their influence to prevent friends from \n     using guns to settle disputes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (1) the Senate designates October 8, 1998, \n     as ``the Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun \n     Violence''; and\n       (2) the President should be authorized and requested to \n     issue a proclamation calling upon the school children of the \n     United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I submit a resolution that passed \nthe Senate last year unanimously. My resolution, which I am introducing \ntoday with Senator Kempthorne and more than 50 original cosponsors, \nestablishes October 8 as the Day of Concern about Young People and Gun \nViolence.\n  Tragically, this resolution has special meaning for all of us after \nthe events of last Friday. While, thankfully, no children were directly \ninvolved in the slayings of Officer Jacob Chestnut and Special Agent \nJohn Gibson, certainly the officers' children and young people across \nthe nation were hurt and horrified by the violence that occurred in our \nnation's Capitol.\n  I am once again submitting this resolution because I am convinced the \nbest way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual \nchildren and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution \ngives parents, teachers, government leaders, service clubs, police \ndepartments, and others a special day to focus on the problems today of \nyoung people and gun violence. October is National Crime Prevention \nMonth--the perfect time to center our attention of the special needs of \nour kids and gun violence.\n  A Minnesota Homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed this idea for a \n``Day of Concern for Young People and Gun Violence''. Other groups, \nsuch as Mothers Against Violence in America, the National Parent \nTeacher Association, and the American Medical Association have joined \nthe effort to establish a special day in which to express our concern \nabout our children and gun violence. The proclamation of a special day \nof recognition also provided support to a national effort to encourage \nstudents to sign a pledge against gun violence. In 1997, 47,000 \nstudents in Washington State signed the pledge card, as did more than \n200,000 children in New York City, and tens of thousands more across \nthe nation.\n  The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence calls for a national \nobservance on October 8 to give students the chance to make a promise, \nin writing, that they will do their part to prevent gun violence. The \nstudents' pledge promises three things: (1) they will never carry a gun \nto school; (2) they will never resolve a dispute with a gun; and (3) \nthey will use their influence with friends to discourage them from \nresolving disputes with guns.\n  Just think of the lives we could have saved if all students had \nsigned--and lived up to-- such a pledge last year. Consider that in the \nmonths between today and the day we demonstrated our concern about \nyouth violence last year, we've had an outbreak of school violence. \nEleven students and two teachers have been killed and more than 40 \nstudents have been wounded in shootings by children. In addition, we've \nlost thousands of children in what has become the all-too-common \nviolence of drive-by shootings, drug wars, and other crime and in self-\ninflicted and unintentional shootings.\n\n  Last year, Senator Kempthorne and I led the cosponsorship drive of \nthis resolution after his 17-year-old neighbor was murdered by a 19-\nyear-old in a random act of violence in Washington state. Ann Harris' \nparents vowed to transform their grief into an opportunity to help \nteach our young people to care about each other and to stop the \nviolence. We both pledged our support.\n  We all have been heartened by statistics showing crime in America on \nthe decline. Many factors are involved, including community-based \npolicing, stiffer sentences for those convicted, youth crime prevention \nprograms, and population demographics. None of us intend to rest on our \nsuccess because we still have far, far too much crime and violence in \nthis society.\n  So, we must find the programs that work and focus our limited \nresources on those. We must get tough on violent criminals--even if \nthey are young--to protect the rest of society from their terrible \nactions. And we, each and every one of us, must make time to spend with \nour children, our neighbor's children, and the children who have no one \nelse to care about them. Only when we reach out to our most vulnerable \ncitizens--our kids--will we drop youth violence to zero.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join in this simple \neffort to focus attention on gun violence among youth by proclaiming \nOctober 8 the ``Day of Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' \nWe introduce this resolution today in the hopes of getting all 100 \nSenators to cosponsor this resolution prior to its passage, which we \nhope will occur in September. This is an easy step for us to help \nfacilitate the work that must go on in each community across America, \nas parents, teachers, friends and students try to prevent gun violence \nbefore it continues to ruin countless lives.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9600-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9601]]\nSENATE RESOLUTION 265--COMMENDING THE NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION PROGRAM \n                        ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. WARNER submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 265\n\n       Whereas in 1948, Admiral (then Captain) Hyman G.

Res. 267\n\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front regime in Khartoum, \n     Sudan, continues to wage a brutal war against its own people \n     in southern Sudan;\n       Whereas that war has already caused the death of more than \n     1,500,000 Sudanese since 1983;\n       Whereas famine conditions now threaten areas of southern \n     Sudan as a direct consequence of the concerted and sustained \n     effort by the regime in Khartoum to subdue its southern \n     regions by force and including violations of basic human \n     rights;\n       Whereas famine conditions are exacerbated by diversions of \n     humanitarian assistance by armed parties on all sides of the \n     conflict;\n       Whereas the United Nations World Food Program has now \n     targeted 2,600,000 Sudanese for famine relief aid, to be \n     distributed through an umbrella arrangement called \n     ``Operation Lifeline Sudan'';\n       Whereas the regime in Khartoum retains the ability to deny \n     the relief agencies operating in Operation Lifeline Sudan the \n     clearance to distribute food according to needs in Sudan;\n       Whereas the regime in Khartoum has used humanitarian \n     assistance as a weapon by routinely denying the requests by \n     Operation Lifeline Sudan and its members to distribute food \n     and other crucial items in needy areas of Sudan both within \n     the Khartoum regime's control and areas outside the Khartoum \n     regime's control, including the Nuba Mountains;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development provides famine relief to the people of Sudan \n     primarily through groups operating within Operation Lifeline \n     Sudan and, thus, subjects that relief to the arrangement's \n     associated constraints imposed by the regime in Khartoum;\n       Whereas several relief groups already operate successfully \n     in areas of southern Sudan where Operation Lifeline Sudan has \n     been denied access in the past, thus providing crucial \n     assistance to the distressed population;\n       Whereas it is in the interest of the people of Sudan and \n     the people of the United States, to take proactive and \n     preventative measures to avoid any future famine conditions \n     in southern Sudan;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development, when it pursues assistance programs most \n     effectively, encourages economic self-sufficiency;\n       Whereas assistance activities should serve as integral \n     elements in preventing famine conditions in southern Sudan in \n     the future;\n       Whereas the current international and media attention to \n     the starving populations in southern Sudan and to the causes \n     of the famine conditions that affect them have pushed the \n     regime in Khartoum and the rebel forces to announce a \n     tentative but temporary cease-fire to allow famine relief aid \n     to be more widely distributed;

Mr. President, in October of last year I held a \nhearing on ``HIV/AIDS: Recent Developments and Future Opportunities.'' \nA good portion of that hearing was devoted to a discussion on the blood \ncrisis of the 1980s, resulting in the HIV infection of thousands of \nAmericans who trusted that the blood or blood product with which they \nwere treated was safe. Witnesses at the hearing included John Williams, \nthe father of a child who contracted HIV from the clotting factor and \ndied at the age of 18, and Donna McCullough, a young woman who \ncontracted HIV when she received a blood transfusion after a \nmiscarriage. Although Ms. McCullough remains relatively healthy, she \nlost her only son to AIDS. Ms. McCullough did not know of her own \ninfection until her infant son was diagnosed.\n  The tragedy of the blood supply's infection has brought unbearable \npain to families all over the country. I have heard from dozens, \nperhaps hundreds of them over the past months. As Mr. Williams \ntestified, the community hit by this tragedy has found it nearly \nimpossible to make recovery through the courts because of blood shield \nlaws in most states that raise the burden of proof for product \nliability claims for blood and blood products. In addition, all States \nhave statutes of limitations that prohibit litigation if the suit was \nnot filed within a certain period of time. Other witnesses spoke of the \nstigma associated with HIV/AIDS and the hesitancy many felt to bring \nsuit and thus be public about their infection.\n  My heart goes out to the victims and families of this terrible \ntragedy. I sincerely hope that we will, in this Congress, bring some \npeace to these families with the passage of the Ricky Ray Hemophilia \nRelief Fund Act. The House passed this bill by voice vote on May 19, \n1998. Its companion in the Senate was introduced by Senators DeWine and \nGraham, and I have pledged to move that bill forward in my Committee.\n  Sadly, the Ricky Ray bill as introduced does not include all victims \nof the blood supply crisis. I feel strongly that the bill we pass in \nthe Senate must include not only hemophiliacs, but also people who \nreceived a blood transfusion or blood product in the course of medical \ntreatment for other illnesses. Transfusion-associated AIDS victims are \nsubject to the same laws that Mr. Williams mentioned. While in some \ncases individuals in this group were able to track the source of their \ninfection and bring suit against the blood bank, the vast majority were \nnot.\n  There is the perception that most transfusion cases recovered \nmillions of dollars in court, and that is simply not the case. Fewer \nthan 10%--and the most credible estimates put the number at 2%--of \ntransfusion cases made any financial recovery. Even among those \ntransfusion cases who reached settlement the majority recovered far \nless than the reputed millions, the average settlement for transfusion \ncases is more like $40,000.\n  I am introducing today an amendment to the House passed HR 1023 in \nthe nature of a substitute. While the change to include transfusion \ncases increases the cost of this bill, many have\n\n[[Page S9604]]\n\nalready noted that this bill is not about money, it's about fairness.

FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME PREVENTION AND SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and \n     Services Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading preventable cause \n     of mental retardation, and it is 100 percent preventable;\n       (2) estimates on the number of children each year vary, but \n     according to some researchers, up to 12,000 infants are born \n     in the United States with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffering \n     irreversible physical and mental damage;\n       (3) thousands more infants are born each year with Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect, also known as Alcohol Related Neurobehavioral \n     Disorder (ARND), a related and equally tragic syndrome;\n       (4) children of women who use alcohol while pregnant have a \n     significantly higher infant mortality rate (13.3 per 1000) \n     than children of those women who do not use alcohol (8.6 per \n     1000);\n       (5) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect are \n     national problems which can impact any child, family, or \n     community, but their threat to American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives is especially alarming;\n       (6) in some American Indian communities, where alcohol \n     dependency rates reach 50 percent and above, the chances of a \n     newborn suffering Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol \n     Effect are up to 30 times greater than national averages;\n       (7) in addition to the immeasurable toll on children and \n     their families, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effect pose extraordinary financial costs to the Nation, \n     including the costs of health care, education, foster care, \n     job training, and general support services for affected \n     individuals;\n       (8) the total cost to the economy of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     was approximately $2,500,000,000 in 1995, and over a \n     lifetime, health care costs for one Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     child are estimated to be at least $1,400,000;\n       (9) researchers have determined that the possibility of \n     giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect increases in proportion to the amount and \n     frequency of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman, and that \n     stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy \n     reduces the emotional, physical, and mental consequences of \n     alcohol exposure to the baby; and\n       (10) though approximately 1 out of every 5 pregnant women \n     drink alcohol during their pregnancy, we know of no safe dose \n     of alcohol during pregnancy, or of any safe time to drink \n     during pregnancy, thus, it is in the best interest of the \n     Nation for the Federal Government to take an active role in \n     encouraging all women to abstain from alcohol consumption \n     during pregnancy.\n       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     establish, within the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, a comprehensive program to help prevent Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect nationwide and to \n     provide effective intervention programs and services for \n     children, adolescents and adults already affected by these \n     conditions. Such program shall--\n       (1) coordinate, support, and conduct national, State, and \n     community-based public awareness, prevention, and education \n     programs on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect;\n       (2) coordinate, support, and conduct prevention and \n     intervention studies as well as epidemiologic research \n     concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect;\n       (3) coordinate, support and conduct research and \n     demonstration projects to develop effective developmental and \n     behavioral interventions and programs that foster effective \n     advocacy, educational and vocational training, appropriate \n     therapies, counseling, medical and mental health, and other \n     supportive services, as well as models that integrate or \n     coordinate such services, aimed at the unique challenges \n     facing individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect and their families; and\n       (4) foster coordination among all Federal, State and local \n     agencies, and promote partnerships between research \n     institutions and communities that conduct or support Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect research, programs, \n     surveillance, prevention, and interventions and otherwise \n     meet the general needs of populations already affected or at \n     risk of being impacted by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect.\n       (d) Establishment of Program.--Title III of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n    ``PART O--FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME PREVENTION AND SERVICES PROGRAM\n\n     ``SEC. 399G.

Mr. President, today, I am releasing a new U.S. \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) report entitled ``Private Health \nInsurance: Impact of Premium Increases on the Number of Covered \nIndividuals Is Uncertain'' (GAO/HEHS-98-203R). In November, 1997, the \nLewin Group published a study that estimates for every one percent \nincrease in health insurance premiums, 400,000 people would lose their \nhealth care coverage. This GAO report assesses the methodology used in \nthe Lewin Group report and evaluates the factors that could determine \nhow premium increases relate to the number of individuals with health \ninsurance coverage.\n  Over the past 14 months, the Committee on Labor and Human Resources \nhas held nine hearings on issues relating to health care quality and \ntwo hearings on ways to increase health insurance coverage. At each of \nthese hearings, the point was made that proposed health care \nlegislation could increase the cost of health care and have the \nunintended consequence of reducing the number of individuals covered by \nemployer-sponsored health care.\n  The GAO report found several problems with the original November, \n1997, Lewin Group estimate. GAO concluded that, based on a more recent \nLewin Group report, if health insurance premiums increase by 1 percent \nfor only some types of insurance (for example, HMOs), then the coverage \nloss would be less than 300,000.\n  The first concern identified by the GAO with the November, 1997, \nLewin Group report is that it was based on the effects of insurance \npremium subsidies on an employer's decision to offer insurance. The \nLewin Group concluded from its studies that a one percent decrease in \npremiums would induce employers to offer coverage to an additional \n400,000 employees. The Lewin Group then assumed that this same \nrelationship could be reversed to represent accurately the number of \nemployees who would lose coverage if premiums increased. The GAO \nanalysis concludes that a more important variable in assessing the \nimpact on health insurance coverage is not whether an employer decides \nto offer insurance coverage, but whether an employee will choose to \naccept it.\n  According to the Current Population Survey data, in 1996, about 70 \npercent of the population under the age of 65 was covered by health \ninsurance purchased through an employer or purchased privately. About \n12 percent of the population was covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the \nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services. And the \nremaining 18 percent of the population was uninsured.\n  Between 1987 and 1996, the number of workers who were offered \ninsurance by their employers rose from 72.4 percent to 75.4 percent; \nbut, at the same time, the number of workers who accepted coverage \nactually fell from 88.3 percent to 80.1 percent. There could be several \nreasons for this declining acceptance rate. In 1988, employees in small \nfirms with fewer than 200 workers paid an average of 12 percent of \ntheir premiums. However, by 1996, the employees' premium contributions \nhad risen to 33 percent. Also, during this same period, the States were \nexpanding the eligibility requirements for their Medicaid programs, and \nthe real incomes of workers declined.\n  The studies available to the Lewin Group in preparing their November, \n1997, report were primarily focused on an employer's decision to offer \ncoverage, not on the relationship between the cost of insurance and the \nnumber of individuals covered by insurance. These studies also varied \nwidely in their research questions and their findings. Some of the \nolder studies used data from 1971 and earlier.\n  The second factor identified by the GAO was the release by the Lewin \nGroup, in January, 1998, of a revised estimate of the coverage loss due \nto health care premium increases. The Lewin Group now believes that \napproximately 300,000 people could lose their employer-sponsored \ncoverage for every one percent increase in premiums. The new estimate \nis based on a new statistical analysis of the relationship between what \nemployees pay for health insurance, and the likelihood that their \nfamilies have access to employer-sponsored health insurance.\n  The Lewin Group estimates also assume equal premium increases for all \ntypes of insurance products. Since the legislation that Congress is \nconsidering will primarily affect HMO premiums, employees faced with \nhigher premiums may switch to other types of insurance rather than drop \ncoverage entirely. Based on the work of the Barents Group, the GAO \nfound that this change in plans by employees would further reduce the \nLewin Group estimate to a number less than 300,000.\n  In conclusion, the GAO report indicates that if health insurance \npremiums increase by one percent for only some types of insurance (for \nexample, HMOs), then the coverage loss predicted by the Lewin Group \nwould be less than 300,000. However, the GAO urges that this figure \nmust be used cautiously. There are still many factors that were not \nincluded in the Lewin Group estimate, such as: changes in benefits \noffered by an insurance plan; changes in real wages; and what \npercentage of a premium increase is passed on from the employer to the \nemployee.\n  Mr. President, as we consider legislation to ensure that Americans \nhave access to high-quality health care, we must also be concerned that \nnew health plan requirements do not lead to increased numbers of the \nuninsured. The GAO report, ``Private Health Insurance: Impact of \nPremium Increases on the Number of Covered Individuals Is Uncertain,'' \nwill be a valuable resource for the Congress in achieving an \nappropriate balance between these two important societal goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9606-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9606-S9607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FISCAL YEAR 1999 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee--Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye, respectively--for finishing work on this \nappropriations\n\n[[Page S9607]]\n\nbill. Every year their Subcommittee does the vitally important work of \nbalancing the multitude of priorities that make up this nation's \ndefense. Their work becomes more important every year as our nation \nleaves behind the more predictable Cold War era.\n  I am pleased that this bill contains full funding for the second New \nAttack Submarine. This highly capable and relatively inexpensive class \nof submarines will take a lead role in the defense of this nation well \ninto the 21st century. This submarine is exactly the type of military \nasset that we will rely on in the years to come. It is multi-mission \ncapable, it will make use of new technology as it develops, and it will \nbe able to remain on station at all corners of the earth.\n  This bill also provides for the helicopter needs of the Army and the \nNational Guard. Both the Blackhawk and the Comanche helicopter programs \nachieved significant increases beyond the President's request. This \nyear, strong Congressional support brought the number of Blackhawk-type \nhelicopters from the 22 requested by the Administration to 34. I hope \nthat as the Administration develops the Fiscal Year 2000 defense \nbudget, it will take into account the fact that the Army, Navy, and \nNational Guard need these helicopters sooner rather than later. We need \n36 helicopters per year to fulfill requirements expeditiously and to \ntrigger the savings that would come from a purchase of that size. The \nComanche helicopter, still in development, enjoys a similar level of \nCongressional support that is matched only by the support it enjoys at \nthe Pentagon. This bill's support for the Comanche is reassuring.\n  I am particularly pleased that two amendments that I offered to this \nbill were accepted. The first will expand the Defense Department's \nprograms aimed at monitoring and researching Lyme Disease. The disease \nis a serious problem in the Northeast and is listed by the Defense \nDepartment as a militarily significant disease for troops stationed \nwithin the United States and deployed worldwide. The sooner we confront \nthis disease with the necessary resources, the sooner the Defense \nDepartment and this nation will be able to avoid the significant losses \nfrom this terrible disease.\n  Also, I am glad that the Senate included my amendment that will \neliminate the delay in processing Army pensions. All military retirees \nare due a pension and medical benefits beginning at age 60. My \namendment will ensure that pensioners receive their payments and \nbenefits on time. Mr. Arthur Greenberg, of Hamden, Connecticut, first \nbrought this problem to my attention several weeks ago. He wrote a \nletter to me and stated that the Army had told him that he would not \nreceive his pension or medical benefits until nine months after his \n60th birthday. To my surprise, Mr. Greenberg's case was not an isolated \nincident. The Army told me that 40% of its caseload was backlogged. \nThis is absolutely unsatisfactory, and that is why I put this amendment \nforward. This amendment directs the Secretary of the Army to eliminate \nthe backlog by the end of this calendar year and to submit a report to \nCongress on the matter. I fully expect that those who put their lives \nat risk to defend this nation will soon begin to receive their pensions \nand benefits, as expected, on their 60th birthday.\n  In sum, this bill is a responsible effort to provide for the national \ndefense for Fiscal Year 1999. The New Attack Submarine, Comanche and \nBlackhawk helicopters, F-22 and F/A-18 fighters, C-17 cargo aircraft, \nand the many other assets that this bill funds are vitally important to \nprotecting our way of life and our interests throughout the world. As \nusual, the men and women in my home state of Connecticut, whether they \nserve in the military or in the defense industry, will play important \nroles with respect to this bill. Overall, I support this bill, and I am \nglad that this body has nearly unanimously agreed on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9606-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IDAHO'S 116TH--THE SNAKE RIVER BRIGADE\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my praise \nfor the men and women of the Idaho National Guard as they prepare to \ncomplete their exercise at our nation's crown jewel for desert warfare \ntraining.\n  It is, Mr. President, the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort \nIrwin, California. It is in those harsh and challenging conditions that \nour Army and National Guard personnel receive the best training of any \narmed force in the world.\n  I had the pleasure of spending this past weekend with the 116th \nCavalry Brigade of the Idaho Army National Guard as they conducted \nOperation Desert Avenger at the NTC. The 116th, also called the Snake \nRiver Brigade, is only the second National Guard brigade to train at \nNTC in eight years. And from what I saw, Mr. President, they are more \nthan holding their own.\n  Under the leadership of The Adjutant General, Major General Jack \nKane, Brigade Commander Colonel Lawrence LaFrenz, Sergeant Major Austin \nCummins and Brigade Sergeant Major Patrick Murphy, the men and women of \nthe 116th have set an example that all future National Guard units will \nbe hard-pressed to match.\n  Mr. President, the Snake River Brigade spent over two years preparing \nfor their training rotation at NTC. Not only was there the logistical \nproblems associated with getting more than 1,700 Idahoans and their \nequipment to California, but they supplemented the Idaho Guard with \nunits from 41 other states and Canada. Nearly 5,000 men and women of \nthe National Guard are taking part in Operation Desert Avenger. One can \nonly imagine the myriad of details that had to be handled to make this \nexercise a success. Think of all the planning that had to be done years \nahead of the actual training. Mr. President, under the guidance of the \nAdjutant General and his staff, I believe Idaho's 116th Brigade has \ndeveloped the model for how Guard units should prepare for this high \nintensity training.\n  Not only was the Snake River Brigade prepared, they performed above \nexpectations. While these training exercises are not a test, the \nperformance is observed and evaluated. The goal is to make the \nleadership and troops perform to the best of their ability. On the day \nI visited, the 116th beat the opposition forces. That is significant. \nActive duty Army units that come to NTC on a regular basis that don't \ndo that. Those Idahoans can now go home with their heads held high. \nTalking with the tank crews, artillery units and support teams later, \nyou can see the devotion they have and how high morale is. I'll tell \nyou, Mr. President, had there been a National Guard recruiter on the \nfield right after that battle, many of those soldiers would have \nimmediately signed up for another tour of duty.\n  All Idahoans can be proud of the citizen-soldiers of the Snake River \nBrigade, and I would like to salute them here in the United States \nSenate.\n  These men and women are on call, prepared to defend our freedom. Mr. \nPresident, we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the families of \nthese patriots, who support them at home, and to the employers, who \nallow them the time away from work to attend training like NTC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9607-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9607-S9608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE FOR WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE, HELD IN \n               WASHINGTON, D.C., ON JUNE 28-JULY 2, 1998\n\n Mr. LEAHY. The role of women in the production and development \nof the global agriculture system has historically been largely \noverlooked. Women, however, are an indispensable part of the system, \nproducing 65% of the world's food supply. They have historically held \nthe primary burden for the production, acquisition, and preparation of \nfood for their households. According to the International Food Policy \nResearch Institute, in Africa women produce up to 80% of the total food \nsupply.\n  Women contribute a great deal to the agricultural backbone upon which \nwe all rely, and yet they too often go without praise or thanks. I want \nto recognize the invaluable role that women play in feeding the world.\n  In the last few years, several important steps have been taken to \nassure that women working in agriculture around the world are given the \nrecognition they deserve. In 1994, the First International Conference \non Women in Agriculture was held in Melbourne, Australia. It was \ndesigned as a forum for women involved in agriculture to\n\n[[Page S9608]]\n\ncome together and share their experiences while learning more about \nsuccessful farming and agri-business techniques. This conference was \none of the first attempts to call attention to the specific roles women \nplay in the agricultural world.\n  The following year, the Fourth United Nations World Conference on \nWomen was held in Beijing, China. It was at this international \nconference that a decision was made to call on the world's governments \nto finally measure and value uncompensated work by women, including \nagricultural labor, in their respective country's official statistics.\n  In 1997, President Clinton proclaimed October 15 as International \nRural Women's Day. In doing so, he again brought to the world's \nattention that rural women comprise more than one-quarter of the \nworld's population and form the basis of much of the world's \nagricultural economy. These important events provide a substantial \nfoundation that we must continue to build upon.\n  The Second International Conference for Women in Agriculture, \nrecently held here in our nation's capitol, continued to capitalize \nupon the efforts of the past by focusing on the status of women and \ntheir agricultural contributions to the world. Women from all parts of \nworld, including my home state of Vermont, gathered to discuss and \nlearn about the major concerns of women in agriculture.\n  Ten Vermonters, including farmers and representatives from the \nVermont Department of Agriculture and the Vermont State Farm Bureau, \nattended the conference. Linda Aines, Beverly Bishop, Diane Bothfeld, \nNancy Bruce, Kate Duesterberg, Bunny Flint, Debra Heleba, Sandra Holt, \nMartha Izzi, Lindsey Ketchel, Daphne Makinson, Kristin Mason, and Mary \nPeabody participated in the conference and contributed to the events \nwith an extremely well-received exhibit of photographs and goods \nproduced by Vermont women, including cheese and maple syrup. These \nwomen joined with representatives from throughout the country and the \nworld to discuss agriculture issues while celebrating their roles as \nfood producers. Issues ranged from protection from banned chemicals and \nhazardous equipment to biotechnology, some of the most debated and \ncontentious agriculture issues facing our world today.\n  We need to continue to nurture the seed of promise and hope planted \nby the Women in Agriculture Conference. At the conclusion of the \nconference a caucus of women representatives, including Vermont's, \npresented a resolution declaring that the role and rights of women in \nagriculture should be respected and supported by the nations and \nsocieties they serve and that they be valued and consulted as equal \npartners in the production and trade of agricultural goods around the \nworld. We must not ignore this resolution and the movement it \nrepresents. Mr. President, I ask that the text of resolution be placed \nin the Record after my remarks.\n  Women involved in agriculture around the globe deserve our \nappreciation and respect and have gone far too long without it. \nConferences such as the one held in Washington bring attention to the \nplight of women in agriculture while aiding the communication between \nwomen in agriculture in the advanced world and women in the developing \none.\n  A great deal more work needs to be done, however, before the dreams \nand ambitions of women involved in agriculture everywhere are realized. \nI implore all the members of Congress to join me in acknowledging our \ndebts to the women of the agricultural world, celebrate their attempts \nto bring their work to the attention of the world, and help to make \ntheir ambitions and goals reality.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n    Resolution of the Second International Conference for Women in \n                              Agriculture\n\n       Whereas women are an integral and critical part of the \n     global food production system, producing 65 percent of the \n     world's food supply; and\n       Whereas a stable and reliable supply of safe and nutritious \n     food is an essential component of human health and a hallmark \n     of national prosperity, and is in the best interest of global \n     security; and\n       Whereas maintaining an ample food supply depends on an \n     agriculture that is respectful of those who work the land, \n     respectful of the environment, and sustainable over the long \n     term, be it therefore\n       Resolved, That the role and rights of women in agriculture \n     must be respected and supported by the nations and the \n     societies that they serve; that women involved in \n     agriculture, whether by choice or by need, shall be valued \n     and consulted as equal partners in the production and trade \n     of agricultural goods, and that women in agriculture shall be \n     valued and consulted as well in the best practicable methods \n     of agricultural production to sustain human health, \n     international prosperity, and the global environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9607-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9608-S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY ESTIMATES OF THE 1002 AREA\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Nation's gold repository at \nFort Knox, Kentucky is an acknowledged asset--cuddled, counted and \ncared for.\n  But the Nation has a potential ``black gold'' repository under the \nArctic Oil Reserve (AOR) that is largely ignored by the \nAdministration--denied, discounted and disputed.\n  Should someone try to tunnel under Fort Knox to borrow a few tons of \ngold from the vaults, retribution would be swift--remember \n``Goldfinger''?\n  Yet safe, environmentally sound development at the edge of ANWR at \nthe Sourdough site could potentially siphon off barrels of oil \nbelonging to the U.S. Government. Where is James Bond when we need him?\n  Certainly not in the person of Secretary of the Interior Bruce \nBabbitt, the purported watchdog of the Nation's natural resources.\n  To the contrary, Secretary Babbitt put his head in the tundra back in \n1995 and pronounced the Arctic Oil Reserve's oil possibilities to be \nvery low at about 898 million barrels.\n  In May 1998, the Secretary's own scientists at the U.S. Geological \nSurvey begged to differ. Their estimate based on three years of work by \nmore than 40 geologists and other professionals is that a mean of 7.7 \nbillion barrels of producible oil may reside in the 1002 Area of the \nAOR.\n  In the interest of looking at this amazing leap in the estimate of \nANWR's producible oil, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee last week, and invited the U.S. Geological \nSurvey to participate.\n  Three things rang clear at that hearing.\n  First, while these estimates were the highest ever and proved the \n1002 area of the AOR has the greatest potential of securing our \nNation's energy needs--they were extremely conservative.\n  For instance, these estimates were based on a minimum economic field \nsize of 512 million barrels. When in practice the minimum economic \nfield size in Alaska is much lower than that.\n  Northstar: 145 mm/bb (With a sub-sea pipeline) is deemed economic; \nBadami: 120 mm/bb is deemed economic; Liberty: 120 mm/bb is deemed \neconomic Sourdough: 100+ mm/bb (adjacent to AOR) is deemed economic.\n  The Second fact that rang clear is while these new estimates show a \nclearer picture of the Western portion of the AOR, much remains unclear \nabout the oil and gas potential of the massive structures present in \nthe Eastern portion.\n  While the USGS has slightly downgraded the potential of that specific \narea, they do not have the data that industry has from actually \ndrilling a well.\n  And I can assure you that those with knowledge of what that well \ncontained--the select few--remain very optimistic about the potential \noil and gas reserves of the Eastern portion.\n  Third, technology has increased so dramatically that we can now \nextract greater amounts of oil from wells with far less impact on the \nenvironment at a cost 30% less than 10 years ago.\n  Consider this, Mr. President. In June of 1994, Amerada Hess concluded \nthe Northstar field in Alaska was uneconomic because development would \nexceed $1.2 billion and eventually sold the field to BP.\n  Today, BP expects to begin production of that field's 145 million \nbarrels of reserves in 2000. Estimated development costs: $350 \nmillion--a 70% reduction from just 4 years ago.\n  Mr. President, all these factors point toward the logical conclusion \nthat underlying the 1.5 million-acre oil reserve in Alaska lies greater \nreserves than recently estimated, and we need to confirm them with \nbetter science.\n  Dr. Thomas J. Casadevall, acting director of the USGS, was very clear \nin\n\n[[Page S9609]]\n\nhis explanation that if the newer three dimensional (3D) seismic data \nwere available from the Arctic Oil Reserve, their high May estimates of \nproducible oil could soar even higher.\n  Casadevall explained that their new estimates, while supported by \nsound science and peer review, were still based on 2D seismic tests \ndone more than a decade ago.\n  Kenneth A. Boyd, director, division of Oil and Gas of the Alaska \nDepartment of Natural Resources, likened the advance of the new testing \nto the difference between an x-ray and a CAT-scan.\n  He said the available information from 2D seismic as opposed to 3D \nseismic is that the former produces a line of data while the latter \nproduces a cube of data. The cube can be turned and examined from all \nsides and the geologic information proves invaluable for exploration.\n  This data has revolutionized exploration and development of the North \nSlope of Alaska. Modern 3-D data provides enhanced and incredibly \naccurate imaging of potential subsurface reservoirs.\n  This in turn reduces exploration and development risk, reduces the \nnumber of drilled wells, and in turn reduces both overall costs and \nenvironmental impacts.\n  Of course the Administration is under little pressure to allow \ntesting or exploration of the Coastal Plain with gas prices at a 30-\nyear low. However, the Department of Energy's Information \nAdministration predicts, in ten years, America will be at least 64 \npercent dependent on foreign oil. It would take that same ten-year \nperiod to develop any oil production in AOR.\n  Therefore, it seems prudent to plan ahead to protect our future \nenergy security.\n  I intend to introduce legislation that would allow 3D seismic testing \non the Coastal Plain. This testing leaves no footprint. In fact, just \nlast year the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service allowed such testing to be \ndone in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, declaring such testing \nwould have ``no significant impact.''\n  It would have even less impact on the frozen tundra in ANWR. It is \nalso a possibility that the oil industry would be willing to share in \nthe cost of such testing. Let's at least find out what kind of resource \nwe are talking about.\n  It the Nation were to be crunched in an energy crisis--like the Gulf \nWar--that would require the speedup of development; that development \ncould impact the environment negatively because it would not have the \nbenefit of thoughtful planning.\n  I believe it is as criminal as stealing gold to refuse to acknowledge \nthe potential for producible oil in the Coastal Plain of the AOR. If we \ndon't know what the resource is, how can we protect it or make an \ninformed decision about its use?\n  And how can those in this Administration or the environmental \ncommunity argue it is a bad idea to seek a greater understanding of our \npublic lands?\n  If we are just guessing that the Sourdough drillers may have tapped \nan underground AOR vein then we deserve to lose the resource. It is \ntime to get rid of the guesswork and 3D testing will help to do \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9608-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALAN J. GIBBS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nan individual who dedicated his life to public service, and who died \nleaving that legacy as a model for all of us.\n  Alan Gibbs began his career in Baltimore, Maryland. After serving \nseveral years on the National Labor Relations Board he joined the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission right here in Washington, D.C. His \nwork at the EEOC was recognized by his peers when he received the \nCommission's meritorious service award. Wherever Alan served there was \nalways public acknowledgment of his contributions. New York City, \nSeattle and my home state of New Jersey were fortunate beneficiaries of \nAlan's energy, tenacity and commitment to bettering the lives of \nothers.\n  In 1977, Alan was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Army by \nPresident Carter. He was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service \nAward--an honor not many are given but few deserve as much.\n  In New Jersey, Alan served as the Commissioner of the Department of \nHuman Services. During his tenure, Alan made sure that individuals were \nnot lost in the shuffle or became faceless statistics. He was always \ncompassionate and caring. The principle that guided his tenure, and is \nhis most enduring legacy, was to give each individual the resources to \nlive a life with dignity and hope. The job was not easy, but Alan got \nit done.\n  Alan also gave of his time to teaching.

Mr. President, I rise today to add my name as a \ncosponsor to S. 2354, the ``Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Act of \n1998''.\n  This bill amends title XVIII of the Social Security Act to impose a \nmoratorium on the implementation of the Interim Payment System (IPS) \nfor home health agencies. This IPS was set up by Congress at the \nrecommendation of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) as a \ntransition to a Prospective Payment System. However, the IPS, along \nwith surety bond requirements and other regulatory implementations of \nthe Balanced Budget Act, has had a negative influence on the home \nhealth care providers and their patients, forcing many providers out of \nbusiness.\n  The IPS has hurt home health care in Tennessee. For example, in \nTennessee, the amount of funding each agency receives per patient per \nyear was based on each agency's costs for Fiscal Year 1994. This method \nof calculation has the potential to penalize agencies who acted \nresponsibly to hold down costs. One Tennessee provider, who had very \nlow 1994 costs due to aggressive cost control, is concerned that the \nIPS may force them out of business. We cannot afford to sacrifice \nquality in home health care, and we must not punish agencies that have \nalways tried to provide quality care at reasonable costs.\n  In addition, some home health providers who have a good reputation in \ntheir communities, built on years of service, did not submit a full \ncost report for Fiscal Year 1994 due to accounting methods. \nRegrettably, these agencies are now classified by HCFA as ``new \nagencies.'' If the agency is classified as a new agency, then their \nhistoric costs are disregarded in their reimbursement, and they will \nreceive a payment based on a national average. Well, Mr. President, we \nknow that the cost of care in Tennessee may be very different from the \ncost of care in another region. In fact, in Tennessee, home health \ncosts tend to be higher than the national average. This will make it \nextremely difficult for these agencies to meet the IPS budget \nconstraint.\n  Home health care provides a critical service to our nation's Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The IPS was created to address some of the problems with \ncost control in the home health industry. However, it appears that this \ninterim plan manages to create more problems than it solves. In fact, I \nbelieve it can do more harm than good. We need to impose a moratorium \non IPS and encourage implementation of a system of fair reimbursement \npayment rates that ensures all home health providers are cost-effective \nwithout sacrificing quality of care for patients. We must find a way to \nterminate those agencies that take advantage of seniors and the \nMedicare system, while ensuring continuity of high quality home health \ncare for our nation's most vulnerable populations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9609-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CURT FLOOD ACT\n\n Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nmen and women of the U.S. Customs Service as it celebrates its 209th \nanniversary today.\n  As our young nation was on the verge of economic despair and in \nsearch of revenue, the First Congress passed and President George \nWashington signed into law the Tariff Act of July 4, 1789, which \nauthorized the collection of duties on imported goods. This, the fifth \nact of the 1st Congress, established Customs and its ports of entry as \nthe collector and protector of the revenue on July 31, 1789, \nessentially creating what we now know as the U.S. Customs Service.\n  For approximately 125 years, until the passage of the Federal Income \nTax Act in 1913, Customs provided our federal government with its only \nsource of revenue. During this time, the incoming revenue from Customs \nfunded the purchases of Alaska and Florida, and the territories of \nLouisiana and Oregon. In addition, Customs collections built \nWashington, D.C., the U.S. military and naval academies, and many of \nthe nation's lighthouses from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. \nMost impressively, by 1835, Customs revenues alone reduced the national \ndebt to zero.\n  Customs offices first appeared in Minnesota around 1851, seven years \nbefore Minnesota achieved statehood. Minnesota's geographical layout as \nhead of three great navigation systems--the Red River to the North, the \nMississippi to the south, the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence River to the \neast, and 395 miles along the Canadian border to the north--was a key \nto handling the traffic of people and goods that passed through these \nports.\n  In its first year of existence, Customs collected $2 million in \nrevenue in 59 ports of entry. Today, the U.S. Customs Service has a \ntotal of 301 ports of entry which collect over $20 billion annually in \nrevenue. In addition, Customs processes over 450 million persons \nentering the United States each year. As for Minnesota, there are 14 \nports of entry throughout the entire state. These ports of entry \ncollected nearly $2 billion in revenue for the U.S. Customs Service \nduring FY 1997. Besides all the products that are processed, many \npeople enter the United States through Minnesota. An estimated 1.1 \nmillion people have entered through Minnesota's ports of entry since \nlast October alone. This number continues to grow at an increasing rate \nover previous years.\n  The U.S. Customs Service has grown from being the chief collector of \nrevenue on imports into what has become our nation's first defense \nagainst the threat of terrorism, combatting the illegal drug trade, and \nensuring that all imports and exports comply with U.S. laws and \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, I commend the U.S. Customs Service for its long \nhistory protecting the American public. But most of all, I want to pay \ntribute to the many men and women who continue to stand as symbols of \nnational pride and enforce the mission of the U.S. Customs Service: to \nensure that all goods and persons entering and exiting the United \nStates do so in accordance with all United States laws and \nregulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9610-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PURPLE HEART\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to say ``Happy \nBirthday'' to the Purple Heart. The Purple Heart is the oldest military \ndecoration in the country, and it turns 216 years old on August 7th.\n  The Purple Heart honors combat-wounded veterans who have given their \nblood for their country. It is the only medal which is earned, not \nawarded. It is earned by being wounded by an enemy during a hostile \naction toward the United States or an ally.\n  I want to thank my friend, Jim Wendt of the Purple Heart in \nMinnesota, for bringing my attention to this important occasion. The \nPurple Heart was created by George Washington on August 7, 1782, almost \n216 years ago, and the first three medals were awarded during the \nRevolutionary War.\n  On the Purple Heart's 216th birthday, I want to thank Jim and all my \nfriends at the Purple Heart for all their great work. Thank you, and \nHappy Birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9610-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DR. KARL K. WALLACE, JR.\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize and congratulate a devoted and energetic \nphysician for his tireless service to his patients, students, and \nfellow radiologists. On September 12, 1998, the American College of \nRadiology (ACR) will bestow the 1998 Gold Medal to Karl K. Wallace Jr., \nMD at their annual meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The prestigious \nGold Medal is ACR's highest award, and will honor this distinguished \ndoctor as a national leader as well as a dedicated servant for \nRadiology.\n  K.K., as he is known to those in medicine and Radiology, was a long \ntime community hospital clinician at the Virginia Beach General \nHospital. After 28 years as the director of the Virginia Beach General \nHospital Department of Radiology, Dr. Wallace made an unusual career \nmove. He undertook a ``second career'' as a professor at the University \nof Virginia Health Sciences Center, where he is currently co-director \nof thoraco-abdominal imaging and the medical director of chest \ndiagnosis.\n  Dr. Wallace's active commitment to medicine has been characteristic \never since his career began. Two years after starting his practice, he \nbecame an officer in the Virginia Beach Medical Society. One year later \nhe was elected to the House of Delegates of the Medical Society of \nVirginia where he was speaker from 1977 to 1980. His history of service \nto the American College of Radiology goes back to 1967 where he was \nelected secretary/treasurer of the Virginia Chapter. Six years later, \nhe served as its president and held a number of key leadership \npositions for the following 14 years, including speaker of the council \nand chairman of the Board of Chancellors.\n  During those 14 years, Dr. Wallace continued to lead Radiology in its \nefforts to work on national health policy such as physician payment \nreform and the Mammography Quality Standards Act. He worked with \nmembers of the U.S. Senate to develop reasonable approaches to \nlegislation in our rapidly changing health care system. He provided \nhonest, fair and meaningful input efforts. I know all of my colleagues \njoin me in congratulating my fellow Virginian, Dr. Wallace, on being \nchosen as a recipient of the Gold Medal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9610-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9610-S9611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEO B. FLAHERTY, JR.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute a good \nfriend to me and my family, and a pillar of the Connecticut legal and \npolitical community: Leo Flaherty of Vernon, Connecticut. Sadly, Mr. \nFlaherty recently died at the age of 75.\n  Leo Flaherty was Vernon's elder statesman. For years, young attorneys \nand political aspirants in town have looked to Leo Flaherty as a role \nmodel and for his advice and leadership. He was respected by all who \nknew him for his integrity as a lawyer, his instincts as a politician, \nand, in general, his strong moral character.\n  While remembered as possessing a great legal mind, Leo's intelligence \nwas not limited to any one discipline. In 1942, he left Connecticut to \nattend Georgia Tech. A year later he received an appointment to the \nUnited States Naval Academy, where he was a classmate of President \nJimmy Carter. After graduating from the Academy, he earned a degree in \nengineering from the University of Connecticut, and he worked at both \nPratt & Whitney and Hamilton Standard.\n  But despite his ventures into engineering, there was always something \ndrawing him to politics. It was in his blood. His father, Leo, Sr. \nserved as a Rockville city alderman and Democratic Town Committee \nChairman--a position that Leo, Jr. held for 10 years.\n  He held several positions in Rockville from tax collector to a member \nof the State Board of Education. In 1960, he became Rockville's mayor. \nThe most significant accomplishment of his tenure in the mayor's office \nwas managing the consolidation of Rockville with the neighboring, more \nrural town of Vernon. This was a controversial proposal, but Rockville \nhad one of the worst urban poverty rates in the state, and he saw the \nmerger of the two cities as key to Rockville's future prosperity.\n\n[[Page S9611]]\n\n  The Rockville mayor's job was eliminated upon completion of the \nmerger. So, in the end, Leo Flaherty worked himself out of a job. But \nLeo Flaherty never regretted his actions because he knew that this was \nthe right thing to do, not for him, but for his community.\n  The final political office that he ever held was chairman of \nConnecticut's members of the Electoral College, which chooses the \nPresident. True to form and his principles, his first act in this \nposition was to call for the elimination of the college. He always \nbelieved that the popular vote should prevail.\n  His tenure as an attorney lasted even longer than his political \ncareer. Leo Flaherty earned a reputation as a lawyer who would help \nanyone. Oftentimes he found himself representing some of society's \nundesirables, but he never wavered in his belief that every individual, \nrich or poor, had certain rights and was entitled to effective legal \nrepresentation. He never sought the high powered clients, and he never \nbecame a millionaire. But, as was said after his passing, Leo Flaherty \ndied a rich man because he owned his soul.\n  In a 1996 interview, Leo Flaherty said that he had no intention of \nretiring unless he had to. This prophecy was fulfilled. He worked until \nhis body would no longer allow it, as he contracted Lou Gehrig's \ndisease--a terminal degenerative nerve condition.\n  Leo Flaherty was a man whom I looked up to with the highest respect \nand admiration. He will be dearly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9610-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GERALD R. AND BETTY FORD CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today, pleased to urge \nbipartisan support for and passage of H.R. 3506, the Gerald R. and \nBetty Ford Congressional Gold Medal Act.\n  Mr. President, this bill commemorates a number of anniversaries that \nfew individuals succeed in reaching. This year is quite a milestone for \nour former thirty-eight President and First Lady. First and foremost, \nGerald Ford celebrated his 85th birthday on July 14 and Betty Ford \ncelebrated her 80th birthday on April 8.\n  This October marks another anniversary well worth mentioning--the \n50th wedding anniversary of Gerald and Betty Ford. In 1948, they were \nwed only a few weeks before Gerald Ford won his first term in the House \nof Representatives. The Fords returned to Washington every term \nthereafter until 1974. Gerald Ford served as House Minority Leader from \n1965 to 1973.\n  And finally Mr. President, this year commemorates the 25th \nanniversary of Gerald Ford becoming the first Vice President chosen \nunder the terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Less than a year later, \nhe succeeded the first President ever to resign.\n  President and First Lady Ford led our country with bravery and \ndignity during a time that he declared upon his inauguration, ``. . . \ntroubles our minds and hurts our hearts.'' Gerald Ford was faced with \nseemingly unsurmountable tasks when he took the oath of office of the \nPresidency on August 9, 1974. There were the challenges of mastering \ninflation, reviving a depressed economy, solving chronic energy \nshortages, and trying to ensure world peace.\n  For their first twenty five years in Washington, Betty Ford not only \nwas instrumental in rearing the four Ford children, she supervised the \nhome, did the cooking, undertook volunteer work, and took part in the \n``House wives'' and ``Senate wives'' for Congressional and Republican \nclubs. In addition, she was an effective campaigner for her husband. In \n1974, Mrs. Ford set aside personal need for privacy when she openly \ndiscussed her experience from radical surgery for breast cancer. She \nreassured troubled women across the country with her openness, care and \nbravery.\n  H.R. 3506, a bill authorizing the President to award Gerald R. and \nBetty Ford the congressional gold medal, passed the House by unanimous \nconsent on July 29, 1998. It is my sincere hope that the Senate act \nexpeditiously on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this honor, the highest award bestowed by the United \nStates Congress, is a fitting tribute to life-long public service and \ndedication bestowed upon the American people by the thirty-eight \nPresident and First Lady, Gerald and Betty Ford. In addition, it is a \nwonderful way for all of Congress to commemorate and congratulate the \nFords on their fifty years of commitment to one another. On behalf of \nall my colleagues, I wish them many more happy years together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9611-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9611-S9612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VIRGINIA S. BAKER\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special \ntribute to a special lady who passed away Wednesday July 30, 1998 in \nBaltimore, Maryland. Virginia S. Baker was special to me, my family and \nthe entire city of Baltimore.\n  Virginia Baker started as a volunteer playground monitor in \nBaltimore, where she brought joy and fun to the city's streets and \nneighborhoods. But more importantly, she always kept an eagle eye out \nfor the children with a broken heart or the ones from a broken home. \nWithout notice she would find a way to bring those children into her \ncircle of compassion, to let them know they always had a home at her \nrecreation center. She had the special gift of mending children's \nhearts.\n  She came to serve in the recreation departments of nine Baltimore \nMayors and always made sure children had a safe place to play. When I \nwas a City Councilwoman I became friendly with Virginia because she was \nalways hustling the City Council for more money. She took me to the \nplaygrounds and community events, got me to play hopscotch, and got me \nleapfrogging over the bureaucracy to ensure strong community programs \nfor the city of Baltimore. Virginia was also friends with my dear \nmother. My mother volunteered for me for several years when I served on \nthe Baltimore City Council. When my schedule wouldn't allow me to tour \nthe city streets, Virginia would take Pearl, her assistant, and my \nmother out to visit the senior centers and community playgrounds. They \nwould never forget to stop at Faidley's for a crabcake, Greektown for a \nfew stuffed grape leaves, or countless other diners and snack shops \nwhere Baltimoreans gathered.\n  Virginia Baker was just a special person. She had a God-given gift of \ncompassion and caring and used it selflessly. Today, I have humbly \ntried to express my personal experience with Virginia and her gift. I \nalso request the Baltimore Sun article on Virginia's life be printed in \nthe record. It really expresses Virginia's effect on Baltimore and its \ncitizens best.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 31, 1998]\n\n    City's Queen of Fun Dies at 76--Virginia Baker Ran Recreational \n                               Activities\n\n                          (By Rafael Alvarez)\n\n       Baltimore's oldest kid has died at the age of 76.\n       Virginia S. Baker--who began her career in fun and games as \n     an East Baltimore playground monitor in 1940 and hopscotched \n     her way up to City Hall in the silly-hat regime of William \n     Donald Schaefer--died yesterday at St. Joseph Medical Center \n     of complications from pneumonia.\n       ``I've made a lot of kids happy,'' she said in a 1995 \n     interview. ``That's what I get paid for.''\n       Never married, Miss Baker counted generations of Baltimore \n     youngsters as her own special brood.\n       Her secret?\n       The girl who grew up as ``Queenie'' in her father's \n     confectionary at Belnord Avenue and Monument Street--where \n     she honed her child-like playfulness and steely resolve--\n     never stopped thinking like a kid.\n       In a century that whittled an American child's idea of a \n     good time down to pushing buttons on plastic gadgets, Miss \n     Baker championed timeless fun: hog-calling contests, frog-\n     jumping races, turtle derbies, sack races, beanbag tosses, \n     peanut shucking and doll shows.\n       ``And don't forget her annual Elvis salute,'' said Sue \n     McCardell, Miss Baker's longtime assistant in the Department \n     of Recreation and Parks. ``We'll keep going with all the \n     things Virginia started.''\n       Bob Wall, a recreation programmer in Patterson Park--where \n     the rec center is named in Miss Baker's honor--first met his \n     mentor as an 11-year-old Little Leaguer in 1968.\n       ``It was a Saturday and our game was rained out and we were \n     walking past the rec center in our uniforms. I'd never been \n     inside it before,'' Mr. Wall remembered. ``This boisterous \n     lady yelled out to us: `You boys want to catch frogs for me \n     today?''\n       Of course they did. And that was Mr. Wall's initiation into \n     a world he unexpectedly found himself eulogizing yesterday \n     when the city's 58th annual doll show--launched by Miss Baker \n     at the start of her career--coincided with her death.\n       ``We had a moment of silence,'' said Mr. Wall. ``And then \n     we said the show's got to go on.''\n\n[[Page S9612]]\n\n       The Virginia Baker show started in 1921. Her father was a \n     Czech immigrant who changed the family name from Pecinka to \n     Baker. Her mother, Hattie, was a Baltimorean of \n     Czechoslovakian descent.\n       ``Daddy mixed the syrup for the sodas and milkshakes and \n     Mama cooked the chocolate for the sundaes,'' she said of the \n     family store, now a carryout restaurant and liquor store \n     protected by iron bars and bulletproof plastic. ``Boy, did \n     this neighborhood smell good!''\n       Miss Baker had a voice so quintessentially Baltimore that \n     Washington disc jockeys regularly put her on the radio just \n     to let the nation's power brokers believe everything they'd \n     ever heard about this city.\n       On the sidewalks of her beloved hometown, young Virginia \n     learned the tricks she would turn into a career.\n       ``We played every game you can imagine out here,'' she said \n     during a 1995 visit to the old store that was her home from \n     infancy until her father died in 1954.\n       Miss Baker rode scooters, shot marbles, made kites out of \n     newspapers and sticks, played tag, spun tops, and made yo-yos \n     sing and puppets dance. She collected matchbook covers and \n     wagered hundreds of them at a time in card games of pitch, \n     poker and pinochle down at Sprock's Garage on Lakewood \n     Avenue.\n       And when she got black eyes from roughhousing--Queenie was \n     a bruiser, she freely admitted--the local butcher put beef on \n     them to keep down the swelling.\n       As a youngster, Miss Baker became a volunteer at the old \n     Patterson Park recreation center. After graduating from \n     Eastern High School in 1940, she made play her work, soon \n     becoming director of recreation for the park.\n       From that time, she served nine Baltimore mayors, from \n     Howard W. Jackson to Kurt L. Schmoke. She became best known \n     during the 15-year tenure of Mr. Schaefer, who installed her \n     at City Hall as perhaps the only civil servant in America in \n     charge of an office called Adventures in Fun.\n       Miss Baker turned City Hall Plaza into a staging area for \n     endless contests--marbles, pogo sticks, chess, checkers, \n     Hula-Hoops, yo-yos, roller skates, bicycles, kites and tops.\n       She invented the Fun Wagon, a small trailer with a \n     basketball hoop on back and stuffed with toys. Five of them \n     toured the city. She started the Kid Swap Shop, where \n     children traded toys, an event copied across the nation \n     because of Miss Baker's knack for publicity.\n       ``She was a great old girl,'' Mr. Schaefer said yesterday. \n     ``She initiated all sorts of hokey things and everybody loved \n     them. I hog-called one year. I didn't have my own frog for \n     the jumping contest, but she gave me one. He didn't win. But \n     Virginia always had young people around her. She made them \n     work hard and feel good.''\n       For six decades, her motto never changed: ``A kid is still \n     a kid.''\n       Miss Baker lived at the Marylander Apartments from 1954 \n     until a stroke in 1992. She did not officially retire until \n     1995.

Mr. President, last night, the Senate passed the \nWorkforce Investment Act conference report, H.R. 1385. This legislation \nmakes important reforms to our job training, adult education, and \nvocational rehabilitation programs.\n  The Workforce Investment Act is one of the most significant proposals \nthat has passed the Senate this year. H.R. 1385 proposes a streamlined, \npractical, business-oriented approach to job training which empowers \nstates with the ability to transform a current patchwork of programs \ninto a comprehensive system.\n  This bill is the result of more than four years of hard work. The \nlast Congress, under the leadership of Senator Nancy Kassebaum, spent a \nconsiderable amount of time on similar legislation. Senator Kassebaum \ndid not act alone in championing the workforce legislation in the last \nCongress. Senator DeWine, Senator Kennedy and myself and many other \nmembers were also involved in that effort.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have been working on job training legislation \nfor over two decades. I count the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), \nwhich I co-authored along with Representative Hawkins and Senators \nKennedy, Hatch, and Quayle as a significant legislative accomplishment. \nToday, over twenty years later, it is clear that JTPA is not sufficient \nto meet the increasing demands being made on our education and training \nsystem.\n  The Workforce Investment Act conference report as passed by the \nSenate will enable states to better coordinate employment and training \nprograms and related activities, with a special emphasis on \ncoordinating adult education and job training initiatives. This \ncoordination will lead to customer satisfaction--which is perhaps the \nmost important aspect of this bill. Individuals seeking job training \nand adult education services will choose to enroll in high quality \nprograms which will lead to better paying jobs. In addition, employers \nwill also be satisfied customers because they will have the ability to \nhire better skilled employees.\n  The Workforce Investment Act is a product of many efforts. In \nparticular, I would like to thank Senator Mike DeWine, the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Employment and Training for his leadership in this \narea. He has done an outstanding job in putting this bill together and \nhis contribution regarding the redesigning of our youth training \nprograms will be of great benefit to our nation's disadvantaged youth. \nI would also like to thank Senator Paul Wellstone, the Employment and \nTraining Subcommittee's ranking member for his work on the bill.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy and I have been working for many years on \nemployment and training issues. The Workforce Investment Act has been a \nbipartisan effort. I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for his \nleadership.\n  Not only has this been a bipartisan effort, but it has also been \nbicameral. Representative Bill Goodling, the chairman of the House \nEducation and Workforce Committee and the chair of this conference has \nalso been working on job training legislation for over twenty years. I \ncommend him on his leadership and thank him for all of his hard work in \ncompleting action on H.R. 1385.\n  Chairman Goodling was joined by Representative Bill Clay, \nRepresentative Buck McKeon, and Representative Dale Kildee. This bill \nis a product of their expertise and commitment to improving job \ntraining and adult education.\n  In addition, I would like to thank the staff of the Congressional \nResearch Service: Ann Lordeman, Rick Apling, and Paul Irwin. I would \nalso like to thank the Legislative Counsel staff: Liz King, Mark \nSigurski, and Mark Synnes. Their dedication and hard work were \nessential in completing the Workforce Investment Act Conference Report.\n  In May of 1997, I held a hearing at Vermont Technical College in \nRandolph, Vermont. The testimony that I received at that hearing was my \ntouchstone for the Workforce Investment Act. Witness after witness \ndiscussed the urgency for a skilled workforce. I would like to thank my \nhome state of Vermont for serving as an inspiration for this \nlegislation. I would especially like to thank Susan Auld, the \nCommissioner for Vermont's Department of Employment and Training, and \nKathy Finck, the director of Vermont's Adult and Vocational Education \nprogram for their contributions to this legislation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, customer satisfaction, flexibility, and \nstronger accountability are the themes of H.R. 1385. A provision of the \nbill which relates to these issues is the ability of states to submit \none plan to Washington for a variety of federal programs. This \nencourages states to coordinate their programs; also cuts through \nbureaucratic red tape by giving states the option to submit one plan \nversus several plans. Another provision which emphasizes the importance \nof customer satisfaction and accountability is the opportunity for \nstates to be rewarded, through incentive grants, for exceeding their \nperformance standards in delivering employment and training and \neducation related services.\n  When this bill originally passed the Senate, vocational education was \na major section of the legislation. The one disappointment I have is \nthat we were unable to include vocational education in this conference \nreport. However, I do hope that the House and Senate conferees will be \nable to bring a vocational education conference report to the Congress \nbefore the October adjournment.\n  The final section of the conference report is the reauthorization of \nthe Vocational Rehabilitation Act. The rehabilitation provisions in \nthis bill will\n\n[[Page S9613]]\n\nopen up more employment opportunities to individuals with disabilities. \nThey will also provide state vocational rehabilitation agencies and \nother agencies and organizations that offer employment-related \nassistance to individuals with disabilities with the tools they need to \ngive appropriate, timely help to individuals with disabilities who want \nto work. These provisions bring us closer to a seamless system for job \ntraining and employment assistance for individuals with disabilities.\n  The Workforce Investment Act lays the groundwork to establish an \noutstanding employment and training system nationwide that will meet \nthe economic demands of the next century. The business community and \nthe Administration have been very helpful in this endeavor. I want to \nespecially thank Secretary Herman and Secretary Riley and their staffs \nfor their work and who literally worked on this legislation up to the \nlast minute. The passage of H.R. 1385 means that this nation will have \na better skilled workforce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9612-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       BILL TUTTLE, 69, VICTIM AND OPPONENT OF SMOKELESS TOBACCO\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a baseball star died this week. \nBill Tuttle, centerfielder for the Detroit Tigers, Kansas City \nAthletics, and Minnesota Twins over a period of 11 years, succumbed to \noral cancer after a five-year battle. Among baseball fans, Mr. Tuttle's \nbaseball card picture, with a bulging cheek full of chewing tobacco, is \nwell-known. Unfortunately, that ever-present wad of tobacco was his \nundoing. Over the past five years, it cost him part of his jaw, his \ncheek, a number of teeth, his taste buds, and ultimately his life.\n  To his credit, when Mr. Tuttle realized what spit tobacco, as he \naccurately called it, had begun to do to him, he devoted the last years \nof his life to warning other ballplayers about what might happen to \nthem if they too use spit tobacco. But he did more than reach out to \nhis fellow ballplayers. He spent many hours and days working to prevent \nyoung people from starting to use this addictive product.\n  I ask that a letter be printed in the Record that I received from \nBill Tuttle during the debate on the tobacco bill earlier this year. It \ndescribes his firsthand experience of the ravages of spit tobacco and \nhis efforts to educate children, as well as Major League players, about \nthe dangers of spit tobacco use.\n  Spit tobacco is addictive, causes cancer and other serious illnesses, \nand leaves a trail of devastation among its victims and their families. \nIt is essential that we listen to the words of Bill Tuttle and others \nlike him, and continue to fight to prevent the use of smokeless tobacco \nby our Nation's kids.\n  The letter follows:\n                                                     May 18, 1998.\n       The Honorable Members of the United States Senate: My name \n     is Bill Tuttle. I hope that some of you remember me as a \n     former Major League Baseball player who played with the \n     Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, and Kansas City Athletics. \n     But, I hope more of you know me as a staunch anti-spit \n     tobacco fighter who, at this very moment, is literally \n     fighting for his life. Little did I know when I started \n     experimenting with spit tobacco some forty years ago at the \n     invitation of a fellow ballplayer, that spit tobacco would \n     become such a major part of my life and death. I chewed every \n     day for many years, right up until the time I was diagnosed \n     with oral cancer five years ago. I have undergone numerous \n     operations to remove cancerous growths in my head and neck. I \n     have endured unimaginable pain and disfigurement from the \n     surgeries and treatments and I have been literally cut apart \n     and patched back together. My family has suffered with me \n     every step of the way. Life has been a living hell for \n     several years now.\n       I have been blessed, however, with the opportunity to talk \n     to others about the dangers of spit tobacco, particularly \n     young people. I know that the temptation to try new things, \n     especially forbidden things, can be tough for young people. \n     In my message to the thousands of youngsters that I have \n     talked to, I have emphasized that they just should not start \n     using any form of tobacco. If you don't start, you'll never \n     need to stop. But once started, tobacco use can literally \n     addict you to a substance that stands a good chance of \n     killing you. Even after enduring several surgeries and having \n     half of my face cut away, I hate to admit that I still have a \n     craving to try spit tobacco. That's how addicting spit \n     tobacco can be.\n       I have had some excellent partners in the fight against \n     spit tobacco. Joe Garagiola, Oral Health America, The Robert \n     Wood Johnson Foundation, Major League Baseball, the Major \n     League Baseball Player Association, the Professional Baseball \n     Athletic Trainers Society, and others have supported me in \n     many ways. But my most ardent supporter and best friend is my \n     wife Gloria. She has accompanied me on my visits to schools, \n     community meetings, and spring training. She has become an \n     expert on spit tobacco, particularly what it can do to \n     destroy lives and families.\n       I am sorry that I can not meet you in person to talk about \n     his matter as my physical condition just won't permit it. But \n     I wish to implore you to become a partner in the fight \n     against spit tobacco. So many of you have already done so \n     much to move badly needed tobacco legislation forward that we \n     must not stop short of the goal--that is to make tobacco \n     products, including spit tobacco, as unavailable and \n     unattractive to young people as possible. I urge you to take \n     the necessary action that will address spit tobacco as \n     aggressively as you will smoking. We need taxes that make all \n     tobacco equally unattractive for young people. We need to \n     monitor not just highly addicted daily users, but also \n     experimenters, if we are to practice prevention and be able \n     to measure progress. And we need to tell people the truth \n     about the addictive nature of spit tobacco, including putting \n     the nicotine content on labels. None of us wishes to see spit \n     tobacco become the bargain basement pathway for young people \n     into a lifetime of tobacco addiction.\n       On May 19, 1998, my wife Gloria and I will be honored at \n     the Metrodome in Minneapolis as the first recipients of the \n     Bill Tuttle Award. This recognition of our efforts to try to \n     save American children from hazards of tobacco use is greatly \n     appreciated. At the same time, however, this is a very sad \n     occasion for us. We both know that my remaining time in this \n     fight and our remaining time together is limited. It would \n     honor us greatly if you, as the distinguished elected leaders \n     of our country, would commit to an aggressive course of \n     action against spit tobacco. That would be a big league \n     accomplishment and one for which you would never be \n     forgotten.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Tuttle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9613-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9613-S9614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a \nnational resource that is training the military leaders of today and \ntomorrow. It is the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California.\n  The commanding officer of the National Training Center, Brigadier \nGeneral Dean Cash, is a soldier's soldier. He is dedicated to \ndeveloping leaders, and he leads by example. General Cash is also \ndedicated to the soldiers' families. Despite the long hours and tough \nduty, General Cash makes sure none of the soldiers or officers in his \ncommand misses the birth of their child or a birthday celebration. He \nbelieves those are significant events that cannot be missed.\n  And General Cash wants to make sure the families are cared for. \nWhether its child care, shopping or support groups, the families of the \nsoldiers assigned to Fort Irwin get the best available. The base takes \nan active role in the schools and also has extended its reach to at-\nrisk children in the Los Angeles basin.\n  The soldiers at Fort Irwin and the National Training Center are \nprofessionals. They present the greatest challenge for units training \nat the center. This is their mission, and they do it well.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that the reason our forces were successful \nagainst Saddam Hussein in Operation Desert Storm was the training they \nreceived at NTC. They were in an environment very similar to conditions \nin the Middle East. They were fighting against forces simulating the \nstyle of the former Soviet bloc. And they were fighting against tanks, \nartillery and infantry units with a ``home field'' advantage. The \npermanent opposition force at NTC knows every rock, every hill and \nevery ravine. That is a tremendous advantage, and really tests the \nleadership skills of the training forces.\n  As we see the downsizing of our active Army force, we must have a \nNational Guard and Reserve component acting as an integral part of our \nmilitary if we have a significant crisis anywhere in the world that we \nhave to deal with. That is why, Mr. President, I am so pleased that the \nIdaho Snake River Brigade is able to train at NTC. We need to make sure \nthey're ready if called upon.\n  The facilities at NTC are, to say the least, very impressive. Using \nthe latest state-of-the-art computer, laser and satellite technology, \nthe instructors and observers at NTC can tell, in real\n\n[[Page S9614]]\n\ntime, where every tank, every piece of artillery and every humvee is at \nany moment. And each soldier's movements, radio communications and \nweapons are continuously monitored.\n  When a simulated battle is complete, the instructors go through each \nexercise with the individual unit commanders. They find out what went \nright, what went wrong, and what can be done to improve. This attention \nto detail is vital. The only way our nation is going to maintain the \nbest military in the world is to have the best leaders leading the \nbest-trained forces. They're getting that education at the National \nTraining Center.\n  Countless individuals provide that education. I met two who I'd like \nto highlight. Colonel J.D. Thurman is Chief of the Operations Group, \nand Colonel John Rosenberger is Commander of the 11th Armored Cavalry \nRegiment. Both men are soldiers. But both are educators. They take \ntheir jobs very seriously, and they see the value to what they're \ndoing. It's because of their dedication and skill that our Army turns \nout commanders for the next century--commanders who will be on the \nfront lines of defending democracy.\n  I would like to encourage my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and others in the Senate to visit the National Training \nCenter and see it first hand. You can't leave there without being \ntotally impressed with the dedication of the officers and the enlisted \npersonnel at Fort Irwin and their belief in what they're doing. To see \nhow it enhances the morale and training of units that rotate through \nNTC, is impressive. This is a national resource that deserves our \nutmost support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9613-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF JOHN TURNER\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, John Turner will retire this year \nafter more than twenty-five years of service to the forest products \nindustry. A native of Camden, Arkansas, John is completing a long and \ndistinguished career with the Georgia-Pacific Corporation.\n  John joined Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 1972 as Public Relations \nManager for the Crossett, Arkansas, Division. His responsibilities were \nexpanded to include government relations in 1977 for the states of \nAlabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas. In 1983, he assumed responsibility \nfor state-level government affairs for the corporation and relocated to \nWashington, D.C.\n  In his present position as Vice President of Government Affairs, John \nhas directed and coordinated the corporation's Federal and State \ngovernment affairs staff and legislative policy for the corporation in \nWashington and in the eight state office locations.\n  In addition to a long association with various entities in the forest \nproducts industry, John also had a career in radio and television \nbroadcasting. John was educated at Southern Arkansas University in \nMagnolia, Arkansas, receiving a degree in communications.\n  Active in forestry and trade associations, John serves on the \nAmerican Forest and Paper Association's Energy Council and chairs the \nEndangered Species Reauthorization Committee. John has also served two \nterms on the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission and one term on the \nArkansas Forestry Commission. He is also a member of the Public \nRelations Society of America.\n  Despite his consuming dedication to his industry, John has made time \nfor numerous civic duties, including work with the Jaycees, Lions Club, \nRotary Club, Boys Club of America, and United Way. He has served his \nlocal community as a city airport commission member and as a member of \nthe hospital board of directors.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of the association I have had with John \nTurner over the years. He has been a steadfast friend and a trusted \nadviser on issues of importance not only to his industry, but to the \neconomy of our beloved State as well. His preparedness, integrity and \nwillingness to compromise have served him and his industry well.\n  I wish John and his lovely wife Jean a long and relaxing retirement. \nPerhaps John's retirement from his ``day'' job will give them time to \nmore faithfully follow their beloved Razorbacks football and basketball \nteams, as well as enjoy their two daughters and two granddaughters.\n  Mr. President, John Turner leaves big shoes to fill in the forest \nproducts industry. I hope his successors will look to his fine example \nof the role of the lobbyist and spokesperson in our system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9614-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9614-S9615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL KEVIN ``SPANKY'' KIRSCH, USAF\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nLieutenant Colonel Kevin ``Spanky'' Kirsch, United States Air Force, on \nthe occasion of his retirement after over twenty years of exemplary \nservice to our nation. Colonel Kirsch's strong commitment to excellence \nwill leave a lasting impact on the vitality of our nation's military \nprocurement and information technology capabilities. His expertise in \nthese areas will be sorely missed by his colleagues both in the \nPentagon and on Capitol Hill.\n  Before embarking on his Air Force career, Colonel Kirsch worked as an \nestimator/engineer for Penfield Electric Co. in upstate New York, where \nhe designed and built electrical and mechanical systems for commercial \nconstruction. In 1978, Colonel Kirsch received his commission through \nthe Officer Training School at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, TX. Eagerly \ntraveling to Williams AFB in Arizona for flight training, Colonel \nKirsch earned his pilot wings after successful training in T-37 and T-\n38 aircraft.\n  In 1980, Colonel Kirsch was assigned to Carswell AFB, in Fort Worth, \nTX, as a co-pilot in the B-52D aircraft. While serving in this capacity \non nuclear alert for the next five years, he earned his Masters degree, \ncompleted Squadron Officer School and Marine Corps Command and Staff \nSchool by correspondence, and earned an engineering specialty code with \nthe Civil Engineering Squadron.\n  An experienced bomber pilot serving with the 7th Bomb Wing, Colonel \nKirsch, then a First Lieutenant, served as the Resource Manager for the \nDirector of Operations--a position normally filled by an officer much \nmore senior in rank. He was selected to the Standardization Evaluation \n(Stan-Eval) Division and became dual-qualified in the B-52H. \nSubsequently, he was selected ahead of his peers to be an aircraft \ncommander in the B-52H.\n  Colonel Kirsch was selected in 1985 as one of the top 1% of the Air \nForce's captains to participate in the Air Staff Training (ASTRA) \nprogram at the Pentagon. His experience during that tour, working in \nAir Force contracting and legislative affairs, would serve him well in \nlater assignments.\n  In 1986, Colonel Kirsch returned to flying in the FB-111 aircraft at \nPlattsburgh AFB, NY. He joined the 529th Bomb Squadron as an aircraft \ncommander and was designated a flight commander shortly thereafter. He \nemployed his computer skills to help automate the scheduling functions \nat the 380th Bomb Wing and was soon designated chief of bomber \nscheduling.\n  Following his tour with the 529th, Colonel Kirsch was assigned to \nStrategic Air Command (SAC) Headquarters at Offutt AFB, NE. As Chief of \nthe Advanced Weapons Concepts Branch, he served as a liaison with the \nDepartment of Energy on nuclear weapons programs and worked on \ndevelopment of new strategic systems--including the B-2 bomber. Colonel \nKirsch was one of four officers chosen to be part of the commander-in-\nchief's (CINC's) staff group to facilitate the transition of SAC to \nStrategic Command (STRATCOM). Originally picked as a technical advisor \nfor weapon systems, he soon became the legislative liaison for \nSTRATCOM. In this capacity, Colonel Kirsch organized congressional \ndelegations to visit STRATCOM, and managed CINC STRATCOM's interaction \nwith Capitol Hill.\n  In 1994, Colonel Kirsch traveled here, to Washington, to begin his \nfinal assignment on active duty. Initially serving as a military \nassistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative \nAffairs, Colonel Kirsch once again quickly distinguished himself and \nwas designated the special assistant for acquisition and C3 policy. \nRepresenting the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense \nfor Acquisition and Technology and the Assistant Secretary of Defense \nfor C3I, Colonel Kirsch managed a myriad of critical initiatives \nincluding acquisition reform and information assurance. He\n\n[[Page S9615]]\n\nalso served as the principal architect for the organization's web page, \ncomputer network, and many of the custom applications used to automate \nthe office's administrative functions.\n  Colonel Kirsch's numerous military awards include the Defense \nSuperior Service Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal with Oak \nLeaf Cluster, the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force \nCommendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Air Force Achievement \nAward.\n  Following his retirement, Colonel Kirsch and his wife Carol will \ncontinue to reside in Springfield, VA with their children Alicia and \nBenjamin.\n  Mr. President, our nation, the Department of Defense, the United \nStates Air Force, and Lieutenant Colonel Kirsch's family can truly be \nproud of this outstanding officer's many accomplishments. His honorable \nservice will be genuinely missed in the Department of Defense and on \nCapitol Hill. I wish Lieutenant Colonel Spanky Kirsch the very best in \nall his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9614-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FIGHTING VIOLENT CRIME IN SANTA ANA, CALIFORNIA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on July 11, I had the pleasure of \nvisiting the Santa Ana Police Department to observe its community \npolicing program. Santa Ana is the largest city in Orange County and \nthe ninth largest city in the State of California. Thanks in part to \ntheir aggressive community policing program, violent crime in Santa Ana \nhas fallen dramatically.\n  According to the FBI, violent crime in Santa Ana has dropped 39 \npercent since 1992; homicides alone are down more than 60 percent, \nproperty crimes have dropped 51 percent, and grand theft is down 43 \npercent.\n  As one of the first recipients of a Department of Justice Law \nEnforcement Assistance Administration grant over twenty years ago, the \nSanta Ana Police Department has been a leader in community policing \nprograms. The Santa Ana Police Department initiated a test program \ncalled Community Oriented Policing (COP), designed to create greater \ninteraction between the police department and the community.\n  The COP philosophy utilizes two strategies: prevention and response. \nThe prevention element aims to remove many of the causes of crime in a \ncommunity. The Santa Ana Police Department, for example, adopted the \n``Broken Windows'' philosophy of James Wilson and George Kelling. This \ntheory states that minor crimes, disorder, and community disrepair \nbreed crime. Santa Ana put this theory to the test with its \n``Operation: Round Up'' program. By making cosmetic improvements to \ncrime-ridden neighborhoods--repairing homes and removing abandoned cars \nfor example--and by prosecuting minor violations, the police sent a \nstrong message that crime of any and all magnitude is not acceptable. \nAs a result, the ``Operation: Round Up'' program was able to eliminate \na notorious street gang and improve the infrastructure and appearance \nof the neighborhood.\n  The response element of the COP philosophy focuses on improved \nreaction to crime and effective use of police resources. As part of the \nCOPS MORE 96 grant from the Department of Justice, the city received a \n$1.8 million grant that allowed for the purchase of 150 laptop \ncomputers for its police department, which do the work of 55 police \nofficers. These computers enable officers to file police reports from \nthe field electronically, allowing them to patrol the community longer. \nThe increase in the number of available officers has decreased the \nnumber of calls for assistance. The COP program has allowed the Santa \nAna Police Department to concentrate all available resources on \nfighting and preventing crime.\n  Mr. President, I am so pleased to recognize Police Chief Paul Walters \nand the entire Santa Ana Police Department for providing outstanding \nservice to the people of California. Their actions serve as a model for \nother communities to follow.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nUnited States Coast Guard as it celebrates the 208th Anniversary of its \nfounding on August 4, 1998.\n  On August 4, 1790, Congress passed a law creating within the \nDepartment of Treasury a service to enforce customs laws. The passage \nof this law was the foundation for the modern day Coast Guard. The \nfollowing year, Hopley Yeaton was commissioned as ``Master of a Cutter \nin the service of the United States for the protection of revenue.'' \nYeaton's commission, which was signed by President George Washington, \nmarks the first commission of a seagoing officer, thus giving the Coast \nGuard the distinction of being the oldest continuous seagoing service \nof the United States Armed Forces.\n  Today, the Coast Guard has grown into a force of over 35,000 men and \nwomen on active-duty and 8,000 reservist. On a daily basis, the \ndedicated members of the Coast Guard carry out a number of task which \nensure the safety of our waters. These tasks include Search and Rescue, \nMaritime Law Enforcement, Aids to Navigation, Ice Breaking, \nEnvironmental Protection, Port Security and Military Readiness.\n  In times of war, the Coast Guard has performed valiantly to protect \nour national interests. From the War of 1812 to the Persian Gulf War, \nmembers of the Coast Guard have served and given their lives during our \nNation's most trying times. The Coast Guard's wartime service was \nespecially noteworthy during the Second World War when 241,093 \nAmericans answered the call to service as members of the Coast Guard, \n1,917 of whom were either killed or wounded in the service of their \ncountry.\n  Equally impressive are the often unsung acts of heroism performed by \nthe Coast Guard on a daily basis. Whether the action is a preventative \nmeasure such as ensuring our waterways are clear of hazardous ice, or \nsaving the lives of boaters in danger in the high seas, the work of the \nCoast Guard affects us all and is a contributing factor to the security \nwe enjoy as Americans.\n  Mr. President, the Coast Guard motto of ``Semper Paratus'', meaning \n``Always Ready'', indeed speaks to the dedication and efficiency of the \nCoast Guard as it stands watch over America's waters. For more than two \ncenturies the Coast Guard has responded with the utmost dedication to \nservice, and for this, Mr. President, all Americans have reason to be \ngrateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9615-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9615-S9616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FEDERAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to add a few remarks \nconcerning S. 314, the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act \nof 1998. I understand that under this measure, each federal government \nagency will be required to annually publish an inventory of \ngovernmental activities that are not inherently governmental in nature.\n  Under S. 314, agencies will retain discretion to determine whether an \nactivity is inherently governmental or commercial, and private industry \nwill be given the option to challenge that decision. An agency may also \ndecide that an activity is inherently governmental, but nonetheless \npursue outsourcing. This latter practice can be continued and is \nencouraged by S. 314. For example, I would point my colleagues to the \npractices of the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency \ncharged with managing all federal personal and real property--including \nthe disposal of property no longer needed by the government, but \ndesired by private consumers.\n  Three years ago, an Arthur Anderson study concluded that the \nauctioning function is inherently governmental to GSA's mission. \nNevertheless, GSA has increasingly outsourced this function to the \nprivate sector.\n  Today's legislation in no way discourages the federal government's \nreliance on private industry--particularly, where, as in the case of \nGSA, a reputable commercial property disposal industry is established \nand no federal jobs or careers are displaced or otherwise placed at \nrisk. Moreover, auctioning by commercial companies will yield a greater \nreturn on the government's investment due to the utilization of \ncommercial incentives and practices. Under Office of Management and \nBudget Circular Number A-76,\n\n[[Page S9616]]\n\nagencies are already required to maintain and update a baseline \ninventory of activities that could be performed by the private sector. \nS. 314 would largely codify current administrative policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9615-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to engage my colleague, \nSenator DeWINE, in a colloquy.\n  I thank Senator Jeffords, and the other members of the Senate \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources for your collective efforts in \npassing H.R. 1385, the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. This bill \npromises to improve and revitalize our country's workforce system and \nwill enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our federal job \ntraining programs.\n  As you know, Texas has been in the forefront of the remaking its \nstate and local workforce delivery system. Beginning in 1993, Texas \ncreated a system very similar to one embodied in HR 1385. As with this \nfederal legislation, the new Texas system is based on the principles of \nlocal control, customer service, and consolidation.\n  In this regard, I commend you for recognizing in the bill the \nuniqueness and foresight of the Texas workforce system by providing \nflexibility in the bill for our state to fully implement its new laws.\n  Specifically, I understand that HR 1385 provides that Texas will be \nable to maintain use of its Human Resource Investment Council (known as \nthe Texas Council for Workforce and Economic Competitiveness) as \ndefined in Texas statute and regulation to fulfill the State Board \nrequirements under Section 111. In addition, Section 117(I) provides \nthat Texas will be able to maintain the Local Workforce Development \nBoards as defined in Texas statute and regulation to fulfill the Local \nBoard requirements under Section 117. Section 189(I)(2) provides that \nTexas may maintain the current local workforce board areas as defined \nin Texas statute and regulation to fulfill the requirements under \nsection 116, and that no other language in HR 1385 may be construed to \nforce Texas to change the configuration of its 28 local workforce \nareas. Section 189(I)(3) provides that Texas may maintain its \nsanctioning process for local boards. Section 194(a)(1)(A) provides \nthat Texas may maintain it current process and formulas for allocating \nfunds under sections 127 and 132 to its local workforce boards and that \nTexas may maintain it current procedures for disbursing money that is \nallocated to local workforce boards. Section 194(a)(1)(B) provides that \nlocal workforce boards in Texas may maintain their disbursal processes \nand procedures for monies provided under sections 127 and 132. Section \n194(a)(2) provides that Texas may maintain the procedure as defined in \nTexas statute and regulation through which fiscal agents are designated \nby local boards for monies provided under sections 127 or 132. Section \n194(a)(3) provides that Texas may maintain its process by which local \nboards designate or select one-stop partners and one-stop operators, \nnotwithstanding any requirements set forth in section 121. Section \n194(a)(4) provides that Texas may maintain its requirements that \nservice providers shall not be permitted to perform both intake and \ntraining services. Section 194(a)(5) provides that Texas may maintain \nthe roles and functions of its state board (otherwise known as the \nTexas Council for Workforce and Economic Competitiveness) and that no \nrequirements for elements of state plans shall be construed to force a \nrole or function upon Texas' State Board that is inconsistent with \nTexas statute or regulation. Section 194(a)(6) provides that Texas may \nmaintain the roles and functions of its Local Boards and that no \nrequirements for elements of state or local plans shall be construed to \nforce a role or function upon Texas' local board that is inconsistent \nwith Texas statute or regulation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. The Senator is correct, and I, too, share your commitment \nto preserving the leading edge reforms Texas is implementing.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator. There is, however, one final \nitem on which I request clarification. It is my understanding that the \nintent of Section 194(a)(4) is to allow Texas to limit providers to \nprovide either intake or training services as defined under section \n134.\n  Mr. DeWINE. The Senator is correct. It was the intent of the \nConference Committee to allow Texas this specific flexibility with \nregard to intake and training providers.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator for his leadership and his \nassistance and cooperation in ensuring that the intent of this \nimportant bill is allowed to be carried-out according to specific state \nneeds and laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9616-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9616-S9617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STATUS OF THE HAWAIIAN MONK SEAL\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, a we continue to celebrate the \nInternational Year of the Ocean, I would like to inform members of the \nstatus and efforts to save the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the only \nseal endemic to the Hawaiian islands.\n  As you may know, the Hawaiian monk seal is one of three species of \nmonk seal known in the world. The other two are the Caribbean and \nMediterranean monk seal. The last Caribbean monk seal was sighted in \n1952 and is thought to be extinct; the Mediterranean monk seal still \nsurvives, but barely, with a population of only 500-1,000 individuals. \nThe rarity of the monk seal makes efforts to save the Hawaiian variety \nall the more urgent.\n  Monk seals belong to an order known as pinnipedia, which in Latin \nmeans feather or flipper footed. This order includes seals, sea lions, \nand walruses. Walruses are not found in Hawaii because the weather is \nnot cold enough for them to survive; sea lions are also not natural to \nthe area. The only pinniped found in Hawaiian waters is a seal--the \nHawaiian monk seal. Although, Hawaiian monk seals predominately inhabit \nthe Northwestern Hawaiian islands, including Kure Atoll, French Frigate \nShoals, Laysan Island, Lisianski Island, Pearl and Hermes Reef, they \nare occasionally found in the main Hawaiian islands. In fact, the \nHawaiian monk seal is one of only two mammals that are endemic to the \nHawaiian islands, the other being the Hoary bat.\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) estimates that there is \na population of approximately 1,200-1,400 Hawaiian monk seals. This is \nhalf of what the population was in the 1950s. Factors threatening this \nspecies include entanglement and consumption of marine debris, \ndisturbance by humans and animals on pupping and haul out beaches, \nmobbing of females by males, and shark predation.\n  The NMFS is leading the effort to save the Hawaiian monk seal from \nfurther endangerment and ultimate extinction. Under federal law, the \nagency protects Hawaiian monk seals through education, research, and \nrecovery programs. For example, NMFS has appointed a Hawaiian Monk Seal \nRecovery team to help with research programs, data analysis, population \nassessment, and addressing specific problems such as mobbing, human \ndisturbance, and fishing line/net entanglement. The recovery team's \nmission is to eliminate the causes leading to the declining monk seal \npopulation and recommend how further efforts should be managed to \nstabilize and impede endangerment of this species.\n  Throughout the years, NMFS has monitored activity on primary breeding \nlocations and taken appropriate actions to aid young monk seal pups and \ntheir mothers to a full and healthy life. In order to do this, NMFS has \ninitiated recovery plans to protect females and their offspring from \nvicious male mobbing which occurs when adult male monk seals attack \npups, juveniles, and sub-adult females, probably mistaking them for \nbreeding females. Some of the efforts that NMFS has launched include \nremoving weaned pups from the beach and placing them in enclosed pens \nuntil they are strong enough to be released on their own, relocating \nmonk seal males from areas where they greatly outnumber females, and \nrehabilitating small abandoned pups until they can be released back \ninto the wild.\n  NMFS also strives to decrease indirect and direct human activities \nthat result in harmful occurrences, like a seal swallowing marine \ndebris or entangling itself in fishing lines or nets. In order to \naccomplish the task of cleaning up beaches and ridding the\n\n[[Page S9617]]\n\noceans of debris, NMFS offers information to schools, marine parks, \norganizations, and individuals who want to learn what they can do to \nhelp the recovery of this species. NMFS also sets up signs on beaches \nwhere monk seals are most likely to breed or visit informing visitors \nhow to avoid disturbing the sea animals.\n  Fortunately, the agency is supported by other organizations that have \nfostered efforts for the recovery of this unique and beautiful species. \nThese include: the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, \nwhich assists and supports NMFS's recovery efforts; Earthtrust and the \nHawaii Wildlife Fund, which promote awareness of and education about \nthe Hawaiian monk seal; Sea Life Park Hawaii, which has in the past \noffered rehabilitation for monk seal pups; and Dolphin Quest, which \nfinancially supports monk seal recovery efforts.\n  In addition to these organized efforts to save the monk seal, I \nshould recognize the conservation conscious beachgoers, fishermen, and \nother individuals, who go out of their way to ensure that their \nactivities do not disturb or harm Hawaiian monk seals or other marine \nlife. By simply picking up trash before they leave the beach, \nbeachgoers can do much to promote the survival of the Hawaiian monk \nseal. Fishermen can also help by being aware of where they fish and \nmaking sure that they do not cast their lines in an area where Hawaiian \nmonk seals may inhabit and accidentally bite onto a baited hook. It is \nalso important to make sure that fishing lines and nets are not left in \nthe ocean for a monk seal to swallow or become entangled in. Thus, \nconscientious citizens can do much to perpetuate the existence of this \nspecial creature.\n  Mr. President, the Hawaiian monk seal is one of Hawaii's biological \ntreasures. Through the combined efforts of government agencies, \ncommunity organizations, and ordinary citizens, we may one day witness \nthe full recovery of the Hawaiian monk seal. It is my hope that through \nthe education and preservation of this rare species, more people will \nlearn to respect and value all marine life and, by extension, \nunderstand our own relationship to our living environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9616-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO ST. THERESA OF THE LITTLE FLOWER CATHOLIC CHURCH ON \n                  ITS APPROACHING FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Reno, \nNevada's Little Flower Catholic Church, which will soon be marking its \nfiftieth anniversary. This amazing church has truly been a blessing for \nthe people of northern Nevada, as it has become a pillar of strength, \ninspiration, and hope for the thousands who have passed through its \ndoors.\n  Little Flower has truly blossomed since its first mass was celebrated \non October 17, 1948. Senator Patrick McCarran, Representive Walter \nBaring and area religious leaders of all denominations were just a few \nof those who filled the church's 200 seats on that special day. But the \ntime Father Robert Bowling became pastor in 1974, facilities has \nexpanded and the parish had grown to several hundred people. And, \nduring the following year, the parish actually doubled in size. Today, \nunder Father Bowling's continued stewardship, the church ministers to \nalmost four thousand families, reflecting an extraordinary increase--\nparticularly over the last twenty-five years. Moreover, each month, a \nLittle Flower worship service is taped and later aired on local \ntelevision for the benefit of those who would like to attend mass but \nare too infirm to do so.\n  In celebrating this anniversary, I am reminded of the well-known \nbiblical passage that refers to our duty as our brother's keeper. This \nmessage is clearly not lost on the Little Flower congregation. While \nthe church is by no means what one would consider wealthy, its \nparishioners' generosity is boundless. In addition to monthly donations \nto St. Vincent's shelter, the Little Flower distributes food vouchers \nto the hungry on a daily basis. A local supermarket honors the \ncertificates and then bills the church at the end of each month. \nLikewise, gas vouchers are provided to stranded motorists. Bus fare is \navailable for runaways looking to return home and for others caught in \nsimilarly difficult straits. Even money for medicine is given to the \nuninsured poor. Little Flower's policy holds that nobody in need is \nturned away, and no questions are ever asked.\n  Yet, Little Flower Catholic Church is not just about worship and \ncharity; it's also a garden of personal and community development. The \nchurch operates a school that enrolls three hundred youngsters, \nproviding top-notch religious and academic instruction. In addition, \nthe church sponsors countless organizations such as a Mom's Group, \nAltar Society, Knights of Columbus, as well as Filipino, Hispanic, and \nyouth-centered choirs. Of course, standard Marriage, Baptism and Sunday \nschool classes are also included in the Little Flower's crowded slate \nof activities. Sometime I think that if a book could be written about \nthe church's history, it may well be called the Little Flower That \nCould.\n  Father Omar, one of the parish priests, is a more recent example of \nLittle Flower's devotion to its parishioners. Born in Colombia, with a \nheart big enough to fill the world, Father Omar today sets the standard \nfor spirituality and community activism. He is truly a man for others.\n  Hanging over the entrance of the church chapel is a sign declaring \nthat ``love is spoken here.'' Indeed, it's a language the folks at \nLittle Flower Catholic Church have clearly mastered. The church has \nembraced newcomers, comforted and cheered the downtrodden, and is one \nof those special places that brings out the best in all of us. While \nits history is grand, Little Flower Catholic Church's future promises \nto be equally as rosy. Congratulations on the approaching fiftieth \nanniversary to Reno Bishop Phillip Straling, Father Bowling, the \nchurch's chapter members, and all of the parishioners that have made it \nsuch a sanctuary of unconditional love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9617-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9617-S9618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CATHERINE KENNEDY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, our nation's struggle against the \nAIDS virus has been a difficult one. More and more Americans are \nbeginning to learn the facts about this disease that has become the \nleading killer of U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 44. And in \nrecent years, we have finally begun to devote significant resources \ntoward quality treatment and the search for a cure. But as my \ncolleagues know, for many years, attention to the disease was severely \nlacking, and only a handful of people in this country were actively \nworking for better treatment of its victims. I am proud to say that one \nof the true heroes and pioneers in the fight against AIDS hails from \nConnecticut: Catherine Kennedy of New Haven. Sadly, Mrs. Kennedy \nrecently died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 51.\n  Catherine Kennedy was active on many fronts in the fight against \nAIDS, but she is best known for her efforts to establish Connecticut's \nfirst nursing home for people afflicted with this disease.\n  A native of England, Catherine Kennedy moved to New Haven in 1983. \nShortly after moving to Connecticut, she noticed the lack of nursing \ncenters and services for people in the area living with AIDS. She saw \nnursing homes that were refusing care to many individuals. Patients \nwere being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals that were \nessentially unequipped to treat them. And other patients were in fact \nhomeless.\n  Catherine Kennedy took it upon herself to create a nursing home \ndesigned specifically to treat persons living with HIV/AIDS who were \ntoo sick to stay at home but too healthy to need hospital care. Her \nefforts were met with great resistance along the way.\n  But she eventually gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of \nU.S. Representative Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS. Together \nthey were able to convince the Governor and state legislature to \nsupport the idea of a treatment center, and a law was passed which \nprovided funding to cover non-hospital care costs for AIDS patients and \nto convert an old factory in New Haven into a nursing home. She was \nalso able to secure a grant from Yale-New Haven Hospital to help \nfinance the home.\n  In 1995, eight years after Catherine Kennedy began her efforts to \nestablish this center, Leeway, Inc. opened its\n\n[[Page S9618]]\n\ndoors and became the first nursing home in Connecticut for the \ntreatment of persons with AIDS or the HIV virus. Since it opened, \nLeeway has treated more than 150 individuals. And while Catherine \nKennedy's original idea was to create a center to primarily provide \nquality care for dying patients, today nearly half of their patients \nare able to go home and resume their everyday lives.\n  Catherine Kennedy is a shining example of what one person can \naccomplish if they are willing to fully commit themselves to the \nbetterment of their community. She overcame tremendous resistance and \neven greater odds to open this nursing home. Her determination has \nresulted in a better life for hundreds of people living with HIV/AIDS \nin Connecticut, as well as in communities all across the country who \nlook at Leeway as a model for providing quality care.\n  But Catherine Kennedy touched the lives of many more people than just \nthose who struggle with this deadly disease. She was a beloved figure \nby all who knew her, and she inspired those around her to ask more of \nthemselves and reach out to others in need. She will be dearly missed.\n  She is survived by her husband Paul, her three sons, two brothers and \ntwo sisters. I offer my heartfelt condolences to them all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9617-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ELIMINATING THE BACKLOG OF VETERANS REQUESTS FOR MILITARY MEDALS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to \naddress an unfilfilled obligation we have to our nation's veterans. The \nproblem is a substantial backlog of requests by veterans for \nreplacement military medals.\n  I first became aware of this issue a few years ago after dozens of \nIowa veteans began contacting my State offices requesting assistance in \nobtaining medals and other military decorations they earned while \nserving the country. These veterans had tried in vain--usually for \nmonths, sometimes for years--to navigate the vast Pentagon bureaucracy \nto receive their military decorations. The wait for medals routinely \nexceeded more than a year, even after interventin by my staff. I \nbelieve this is unacceptable. Our nation must continue its commitment \nto recognize the sacrifices made by our veterans in a timely manner. \nAddressing this simple concern will fulfill an important and solemn \npromise to those who served to preserve democracy both here and abroad.\n  Let me briefly share the story of Mr. Dale Homes, a Korean Way \nveteran. Mr. Holmes fired a mortar on the front lines of the Korean \nWar. Stacy Groff, the daughter of Mr. Holmes, tried unsuccessfully for \nthree years through the normal Department of Defense channels to get \nthe medals her father deserved. Ms. Groff turned to me after her letter \nwriting produced no results. My office began an inquiry in January of \n1997 and we were not able to resolve the issue favorably until \nSeptember 1997.\n  Ms. Groff made a statement about the delays her father experienced \nthat sum up my sentiments perfectly: ``I don't think it's fair . . . My \ndad deserves--everybody deserves--better treatment than that.'' Ms. \nGroff could not be more correct. Our veterans deserve better than that \nfrom the country they served so courageously.\n  Another example that came through my district offices is Mr. James \nLunde, a Vietnam-era veteran. His brother in law contacted my Des \nMoines office in January of this year for help in obtaining a Purple \nHeart and other medals Mr. Lunde earned. These medals have been held up \nsince 1975. Unfortunately, there is still no determination as to when \nMr. Lunde's medals will be sent.\n  The numbers are disheartening and can sound almost unbelievable. For \nexample, a small Army Reserve staff at the St. Louis Office faces a \nbacklog of tens of thousands of requests for medals. So why the lengthy \ndelays? Why, at one personnel center, is there a backlog of 40,000 \nrequests?\n  The primary reason DOD officials cite for these unconscionable delays \nis personnel and other resource shortages resulting from budget cuts \nand hiring freezes. For example, the Navy Liaison Office has gone from \n5 or more personnel to 3 within the last 3 years. Prior to this, the \nturnaround time was 4-5 months. Budget shortages have delayed the \nagencies ability to replace employees who have left, and in cases where \nthey can be replaced, the ``learning curve'' in training new employees \nleads to further delays.\n  Yesterday, during the debate over the Defense Appropriations bill, I \noffered an amendment to eliminate the backlog of unfulfilled military \nmedal requests. The amendment was accepted by unanimous consent.\n  My amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to allocate resources \nnecessary to eliminate the backlog of requests for military medals. \nSpecifically, the Secretary of Defense shall make available to the Army \nReserve Personnel Command, the Bureau of Naval Personnel, the Air Force \nPersonnel Center, the National Archives and Records Administration, and \nany other relevant office or command, the resources necessary to solve \nthe problem. These resources could be in the form of increased \npersonnel, equipment or whatever these offices need for this problem. \nIn addition, this reallocation of resources is only to be made in a way \nthat ``does not detract from the performance of other personnel service \nand personnel support activities within the DOD.''\n  Our veterans are not asking for much. Their brave actions in time of \nwar deserve our highest respect, recognition, and admiration. My \namendment will help expedite the recognition they so richly deserve. \nOur veterans deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9618-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING THE COUNTRYSIDE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT\n\n Ms. Moseley-Braun. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure \nto bring to the attention of the Senate the achievements of one of the \nNation's most accomplished firefighting districts.\n  The Countryside Fire Protection District, in my home state of \nIllinois, has recently received accreditation from the Commission on \nFire on Accreditation International. The Countryside Fire Protection \nDistrict, serving the towns of Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, Long \nGrove, Vernon Hills and portions of unincorporated Lake County, was the \nfirst district in the world to be awarded this prestigious mark of \nfirefighting quality and excellence. The Village of Long Grove, the \nLake County Board and the Office of the Illinois State Fire Marshall \nhave since recognized this important achievement.\n  The Commission on Fire Accreditation International, created by the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs and the International City/\nCounty Manager Association, is a non-profit trust organization \ndedicated to the quality and improvement of fire and emergency service \nagencies. The Commission offers accreditation for local firefighting \ndistricts after a comprehensive evaluation. Accreditation is awarded \nif, among other qualifications, a district's firefighting program is \nbroad, rigorous, contemporary and adaptive. The Countryside Fire \nProtection District, under the exemplary leadership of Chief A. Lewis \nLandry, has demonstrated those standards and continues to be a model \nfor both this Nation and the international firefighting community to \nfollow.\n  As a member of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I am deeply \nimpressed by the caliber of services that the Countryside Fire \nProtection District Provides. With admirable distinction, Chief Landry \nand the fire fighters of his district have gallantly protected their \ndistrict from the perils of disaster, ensuring the safety of their \nfellow citizens. I congratulate the members of the Countryside Fire \nProtection District on this momentous achievement, and I extend my \ngratitude to you for your selfless dedication to the safety of your \ncommunity and your neighbors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9618-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9618-S9620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING SECRETARY OF EDUCATION RICHARD RILEY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I would like to \nrecognize the extraordinary work and dedication of our Secretary of \nEducation, the Honorable Richard Riley. I am quite proud to call \nSecretary Riley a good friend. Over many years, I have had the \nprivilege of working closely with the Secretary to promote quality \neducation and help children and families. I believe everyone in the \nSenate understands the importance of quality education for every child, \neven if we may sometimes disagree on the best ways to achieve this \nfundamental goal.\n\n[[Page S9619]]\n\n  I believe that education technology provides enormous promise for \nstrengthening education, enhancing choice, and helping every child gain \naccess to the wealth of information and educational resources on the \nInformation Superhighway. In my our state of West Virginia, distance \nlearning has provided access to advance courses in math, science, and \neven foreign languages like Japanese in some of the poorest, most rural \nareas. And this is just one example. There is much we can do, as noted \nby the Secretary's speech to the National Conference of Young Leaders \nabout the role of technology and education. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Secretary Riley's remarks be printed in the Record so that all of \nmy colleagues can review these compelling remarks.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n    Technology and Education--An Investment in Equity and Excellence\n\n                         (By Richard W. Riley)\n\n       Thank you Senator Glenn. I am so grateful that you could \n     take the time out of your busy schedule--between being a \n     Senator and preparing to return to space--to be here with us \n     today. I am especially delighted by your presence because I \n     can think of no American who better exemplifies the link \n     between education and technology--and whose life has been a \n     constant quest of new challenges, new experiences and, \n     perhaps most importantly, new knowledge.\n       On that note, let me say what a great delight it is to \n     address the many students who are taking part in the National \n     Young Leaders Conference who are here in Washington to study \n     our government. I also want to welcome those education and \n     technology leaders who are with us today--as well as the \n     students, teachers, librarians, and others who are joining us \n     across the country on the Internet.\n       I am very pleased--and I think it is so appropriate--that \n     this event, which focuses on the critical relationship \n     between education and technology, is being Webcast via the \n     Internet. It is an example of the kind of opportunity \n     available to those who might not otherwise be able to \n     participate in these kinds of discussions.\n       My friends, I come before you to talk about the promise and \n     the possibilities of technology in education. I want to \n     assure you that this future can be a rich and limitless one, \n     full of opportunity for students of all ages. But I also want \n     to make clear that to achieve this kind of bright future \n     requires a real commitment by this nation to end the great \n     disparity that exists between those who have, and those who \n     do not have these exciting tools for learning. We have the \n     potential to do great things with technology in our schools, \n     but it is a potential still largely unrealized.\n       Right now, if I had to describe the application of \n     technology in our nation's schools, I would say that it is a \n     tale of two worlds. One world is a world of families and \n     communities that have the best in educational technology and \n     are reaping the benefits.\n       In the other world, the use of technology in schools to \n     achieve maximum educational benefit is usually little more \n     than a dream. Figures from the Commerce Department--just \n     released--confirm that we are in the midst of a severe \n     digital divide--a gap between those who have access to \n     computers and the Internet--and those who do not. The figures \n     show that it is a divide centered largely on racial, \n     economic, and other demographic lines. But it is a divide \n     that does not have to be.\n       The Commerce numbers show, for instance, that White \n     Americans are more than twice as likely to own a computer as \n     African Americans or Hispanics, 41% to 19%. Households \n     earning more than $75,000 have more than 75 percent computer \n     ownership, while households with incomes under $10,000 have \n     11 percent or less computer ownership. And Americans with a \n     college degree are almost ten times more likely to own a \n     personal computer than those with eight years of school or \n     less.\n       The statistics are equally disappointing in our schools. \n     Too many of our nation's classrooms lack the resources and \n     connections to hook into these effective learning \n     technologies. According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics, although 78 percent of our public schools are now \n     connected to the Internet, thanks to communities and schools \n     working together, only 27 percent of classrooms have access. \n     What is more, in low income communities and minority \n     neighborhoods, only 13 percent of classrooms have such \n     access.\n       Now, it doesn't take a statistician to figure out what all \n     these numbers mean. We, as a nation, are missing the \n     opportunity of a lifetime. It is the opportunity it offers a \n     student living in a rural area to experience the greatest \n     museums and libraries in our cities and around the world. It \n     is the chance a student with a disability has to gain access \n     to all kinds of information.\n       It is the ability of all students--no matter whether rich \n     or poor, or whether they are from a small town, a city, a \n     rural area, or a suburb--to learn at the highest levels with \n     the greatest resources and have the promise of a future of \n     real opportunity. This is the potential of technology.\n       Quite simply, technology can be one of the greatest \n     equalizers of opportunity that has existed since the first \n     textbook was distributed in our nation's public schools. But \n     a single computer in the principal's office won't allow kids \n     to benefit from these learning technologies. We need to get \n     the technology to where kids learn--in the classroom.\n       I believe it is time to think seriously about the direction \n     in which we want to go and the kind of investment we want to \n     make in our nation and our children's future. It is time to \n     break the cycle of technological inequity--not perpetuate it.\n       Today's students are the first generation that will be \n     expected to have technology skills for careers and future \n     success. These skills are the ``new basics.'' By the year \n     2000, 60 percent of all jobs will require high tech computer \n     skills. Over the next seven years, according to the Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics, it is estimated that there will be a 70% \n     growth in computer and technology related jobs--jobs with a \n     real future.\n       In this Information Age, information is the currency that \n     drives the economy. If people do not have access to \n     information or the necessary tools, they cannot participate \n     in this economy.\n       In some schools, students already are getting this kind of \n     training. Covington High School in Covington, Louisiana, for \n     instance--and I understand that Stephanie Piranio is here \n     from that school today--has integrated technology into almost \n     every aspect of learning to help students further their \n     development of basic and advanced skills like reading, \n     writing, mathematics, science, and geography.\n       In one environmental science class, students focused on \n     cleaning up and restoring a local stream. They conducted \n     research on restoration, worked at improving water quality \n     and analyzed results. They wrote reports, prepared multimedia \n     presentations, and met with local and state leaders. The Army \n     Corps of Engineers even awarded a grant to the city, in large \n     part due to the students' work, which it said was the \n     equivalent of more than $50,000 in research and preparation.\n       The ``Do-It Scholars'' program at the University of \n     Washington, is another exciting program that used technology \n     to expand learning opportunities. High school students with \n     disabilities who have interests in science and engineering \n     are provided with special tools and training to use the \n     Internet to explore academic and career interests.\n       One student, who was totally blind used a computer with \n     speech output to explore the fields of biology and computer \n     science. That student commented, ``I have all of the \n     information for school projects. I no longer have to get help \n     from fellow students to do my research papers. In fact, a few \n     have even asked me for help.''\n       But it's not just students who can reap these benefits. \n     Teachers can spend more individual time with students; they \n     can communicate with each other and be exposed to new and \n     engaging methods of teaching; and they can communicate with \n     parents about their children's schoolwork.\n       I think a science teacher in Florida explained it best when \n     she said that using technology to learn is ``the difference \n     between looking at a picture of a heart in a textbook, and \n     looking at a beating heart and being able to slow it down and \n     analyze it to see exactly how it works, step by step.''\n       Research by David Dwyer and others shows significant links \n     between computer-assisted instruction and achievement in \n     traditional subject matter. Students with access to these \n     technologies have shown better organizational and problem-\n     solving skills when compared with students who do not have \n     access to these technologies.\n       Perhaps even more important, research shows that students \n     in schools that integrate technology into the traditional \n     curriculum have higher attendance and lower dropout rates--\n     which leads to greater academic success.\n       This can be seen at one of our Blue Ribbon schools, \n     Westwood High School in Austin, Texas, which has developed a \n     comprehensive program to use technology to enhance teaching \n     and learning. I believe Stephanie Pan is here today from that \n     school. Westwood's SAT and ACT test scores are among the \n     highest in the state, and the school's AP placement programs \n     rank 20th in the nation.\n       The use of computers has also been shown to be an \n     especially effective way to improve learning and educational \n     opportunities for at-risk students, as a recent study by City \n     University of New York demonstrates.\n       Significant academic improvement was found, especially in \n     reading, when computers were provided in the homes of at-risk \n     middle school students. The greatest improvement was shown by \n     those who spent the most time on their computers because it \n     helped them learn to think and express themselves, and use \n     their time more productively.\n       The strong connection between technology and learning only \n     serves to highlight the utter injustice of the continuing \n     inequity in computer ownership and access that was confirmed \n     so clearly in the Commerce Department statistics I mentioned \n     earlier.\n       President Clinton and Vice President Gore have been working \n     hard to end this digital divide--and to give all young people \n     in poorer communities the chance to use these kinds of \n     resources and build stronger schools. One of the most \n     important of these initiatives is called the E-Rate, or \n     Education Rate.\n       Now ``E'' could also stand for equality or equal access--\n     because the fastest way I know\n\n[[Page S9620]]\n\n     to help close the ``digital divide'' is by providing \n     significantly discounted telecommunications services for \n     schools and libraries. This initiative is critically \n     important because it guarantees affordable telecommunications \n     access to all schools--public and private.\n       Curiously, in spite of the great benefits it would bring to \n     communities around the country, the E-Rate has faced a number \n     of serious challenges. This offers a good example of how even \n     the best ideas can get sidetracked or derailed by powerful \n     special interests. Let me tell you what happened.\n       Two years ago, after months of public hearings and with \n     bipartisan support, Congress passed, and the FCC implemented, \n     the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This law deregulated the \n     industry and provided telecommunications companies with broad \n     new opportunities for growth.\n       Linked to this opportunity was a responsibility to continue \n     Universal Service--a 60-year old program that has provided \n     affordable telephone services to some rural communities and \n     other areas with unusually high telephone costs. The Congress \n     also expanded this critical program to provide schools and \n     libraries with more affordable telecommunications services \n     through what is referred to as the E-rate. It was a win-win \n     situation.\n       In exchange for their continued support of Universal \n     Service, the long distance telephone carriers were given \n     significant reductions in their costs through reduced access \n     fees. Unfortunately, after the plan was enacted, some of the \n     long distance companies sought to change the way it was \n     funded, jeopardizing the E-rate. And some members of Congress \n     have sought short term political gain by trying to pull the \n     plug on the program.\n       The long distance companies added a surcharge to phone \n     bills purportedly to recover the cost of Universal Service. \n     But we argue that they already had been reimbursed through \n     the reduced access fees.\n       They also failed to distinguish between all Universal \n     Service charges and the E-Rate. One large long distance \n     company put a 95 cent surcharge on telephone bills. But only \n     19 cents of that was for the school and library program--\n     which amounted to less than a penny a day. I can think of no \n     more worthwhile investment for our children.\n       Now, I am pleased to say that grass roots groups and \n     student organizations have fought diligently for this effort. \n     As a result, we were able to save the E-rate, but attacks on \n     it continue. If the E-rate is taken away or reduced any \n     further, as a recent report by the National School Boards \n     Association clearly demonstrates, students in schools and \n     people in libraries across the country will be left high and \n     dry. That is wrong and people need to speak out about it.\n       Let me tell you in no uncertain terms--President Clinton, \n     Vice President Gore, and I will continue to fight any efforts \n     to dismantle the e-rate and widen the digital divide.\n       What good is it to be the richest nation in the world--with \n     the greatest technological resources in the world--if the \n     ability to benefit from technology is dependent on whether a \n     student goes to a particular school?\n       There are many who criticize the use of technology in our \n     schools. The irony is that those who belittle this use of \n     technology are those who already have access to computers and \n     the preparation to participate fully in today's Information \n     Age.\n       This debate has never been about technology. It has been \n     about what our children have the opportunity to do. It's \n     about much more than just giving a young person a computer or \n     connecting that person to the Internet. It's about connecting \n     students to a whole new world of learning resources and \n     offering the mind the opportunity to expand and take on a new \n     and challenging future.\n       As I'm sure many of you already know, the web is a wondrous \n     resource for those of you thinking about college. A recent \n     survey of college-bound high school seniors found that 78% \n     had used college web sites during their hunt for campus \n     information--up from 4% just two years earlier.\n       The Department of Education's own web site provides \n     publications such as ``Getting Ready for College Early,'' the \n     ``Student Guide to Financial Aid'' and ``Funding your \n     Education.'' You can even get and fill out your financial aid \n     forms for college (FAFSA) via the web.\n       I am delighted to announce that today we are unveiling our \n     ``Think College Early'' web site. This new site (www.ed.gov/\n thinkcollege) will provide middle school students, parents, \n     and teachers critical information they need to know to begin \n     to get prepared for college. If parents are not computer \n     literate, I would encourage students to download a copy of \n     the Department's own ``Parents Guide to the Internet''--so \n     that parents and children can discuss and research these \n     issues together.\n       We also need to improve opportunities for teachers to use \n     technology--so that it is just as easy as it is for most \n     teachers to use a chalkboard today. The best high tech \n     learning equipment is of little value if a teacher doesn't \n     know how to use it effectively in the classroom. Colleges of \n     education need to incorporate technology resources and \n     training into their curriculum. Some already use this, most \n     do not, and all of them should.\n       This Administration has proposed a number of initiatives \n     designed to strengthen teacher training, with an emphasis on \n     application of technology in the classroom. One such effort \n     would provide $75 million to help ensure that all new \n     teachers entering the workforce can integrate technology \n     effectively in the curriculum.\n       This is particularly important, given the expected need \n     over the next 10 years for more than two million new \n     teachers. And I hope when the full House of Representatives \n     takes up this issue, it will reverse the decision of the \n     House Appropriations Committee, which refused to fund this \n     important initiative.\n       Now before I close, I want to emphasize another very \n     important point. While we know that technology makes a very \n     real difference in helping teaching and learning, it is not--\n     I repeat--it is not a panacea for fixing all of the \n     challenges that our schools face. It is a not a substitute \n     for solid teaching and learning, but an opportunity to \n     enhance and build upon it.\n       The benefits of technology in schools can only be achieved \n     by entire communities coming together. And this \n     Administration is fighting to make the investment to improve \n     education and our schools. We want to give every community \n     more resources--through efforts to raise standards, lower \n     class size, strengthen teaching, improve reading, build and \n     modernize schools, and expand after-school programs. And \n     technology is an important part of this.\n       The majority in Congress has so far been only negative and \n     opposed full investment in these initiatives. But I hope with \n     the new school year they will get the education spirit. Quite \n     simply, we need to work together--in our local communities \n     and with national leadership and assistance--to make sure \n     that all schools have the hardware, software, wiring, and \n     teacher training they need and every child has the \n     opportunity to click into the educational promise of \n     technology.\n       We have it in our power to make sure that this tool for \n     learning not only does not exacerbate the divide between rich \n     and poor--but also works to close it.\n       Most parents and educators understand the value of \n     technology even if they don't understand the technology \n     itself. It is a reflection of Americans' overall deep feeling \n     about the promise and the power of education--its enormous \n     capacity to open doors, create opportunities and help make \n     people better citizens. Americans understand that without \n     education, we can have neither excellence nor equity. I hope \n     Congress will hear the voices of America.\n       As President Clinton said recently, ``We can extend \n     opportunity to all Americans--or leave many behind. We can \n     erase lines of inequity--or etch them indelibly. We can \n     accelerate the most powerful engine of growth and prosperity \n     the world has ever know--or allow that engine to stall.''\n       I say it is time we take on the challenge and commit \n     ourselves to ending the digital divide. I challenge this \n     nation to work to ensure that every young person in America \n     has the opportunity to sign on to the Internet, to conduct \n     research, look for information about colleges, and just \n     express a natural curiosity and strengthen a love for \n     learning.\n       What we can not do is let this opportunity pass us by. We \n     must fulfill the promise of this new age of education and \n     information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9618-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINE JACOBS\n\n Mr. CLELAND.

Mr. President, late last night, the Senate \npassed by unanimous consent S. 53. I have been contacted by the \nAttorney General of my State, Hubert H. Humphrey III, and asked to try \nto clarify a technical legal point about the effect of this \nlegislation. The State of Minnesota, through the office of Attorney \nGeneral, and the Minnesota Twins are currently involved in an \nantitrust-related investigation. It is my understanding that S. 53 will \nhave no impact on this investigation or any litigation arising out of \nthe investigation.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. The bill simply makes it clear that major \nleague baseball players have the same rights under the antitrust laws \nas do other professional athletes. The bill does not change current law \nin any other context or with respect to any other person or entity.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you for that clarification. I also note that \nseveral lower courts have recently found that baseball currently enjoys \nonly a narrow exemption from antitrust laws and that this exemption \napplies only to the reserve system. For example, the Florida Supreme \nCourt in Butterworth v. National League, 644 So.2d 1021 (Fla. 1994), \nthe U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania in Piazza v. Major League \nBaseball, 831 F. Supp. 420 (E.D. Pa. 1993) and a Minnesota State court \nin a case involving the Twins have all held the baseball exemption from \nantitrust laws is now limited only to the reserve system. It is my \nunderstanding that S. 53 will have no effect on the courts' ultimate \nresolution of the scope of the antitrust exemption on matters beyond \nthose related to owner-player relations at the major league level.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. S. 53 is intended to have no effect other \nthan to clarify the status of major league players under the antitrust \nlaws. With regard to all other context or other persons or entities, \nthe law will be the same after passage of the Act as it is today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I concur with the statement of the Chairman of the \nCommittee. The bill affects no pending or decided cases except to the \nextent that courts have exempted major league baseball clubs from the \nantitrust laws in their dealings with major league players. In fact, \nSection 3 of the legislation makes clear that the law is unchanged with \nregard to issues such as relocation. The bill has no impact on the \nrecent decisions in federal and state courts in Florida, Pennsylvania \nand Minnesota concerning baseball's status under the antitrust laws.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator. I call to my colleagues attention \nthe decision in Minnesota Twins v. State by Humphrey, No. 62-CX-98-568 \n(Minn. dist.

Carolyn \nGay Labouisse, a community leader and civic activist for many decades, \ndied this past weekend at the age of 83. She was the daughter of Edward \nJames Gay, a Senator from Louisiana from 1918 until 1921.\n  Known to everyone as ``Blondie,'' she was the classic Southern woman \nwho, when she saw something lacking in the community, would immediately \nstep forward, roll up her sleeves, and set about making things right. \nFor example, when she saw that New Orleans had an inadequate, out-of-\ndate library facility, she immediately began to spearhead efforts to \nbuild a new, modern Main Library. She also worked to develop and expand \npublic affairs programming at our local public television station \n(WYES). She was an active participant in several task force committees \ndealing with education in New Orleans.\n  Blondie was dedicated to progressive politics. In the 1940's and \n1950's, she was part of a circle of young people in New Orleans who \nfought hard to eliminate corruption from politics and to make state and \nlocal government more responsive to the needs of its citizens. She \ncampaigned to elect reform candidates as governor of Louisiana and \nmayor of New Orleans. She was one of the founding members of the \nIndependent Women's Organization, which is a leading reform \norganization in New Orleans.\n  She received the 1991 Times-Picayune Loving Cup, the single most \nprestigious award given annually in New Orleans for community service. \nThe selection committee, in recommending her, noted that ``few show \nmore care and compassion for community and fellow man.''\n  I extend my sympathies to her family. Blondie Labouisse meant a great \ndeal to the people of New Orleans. She will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9621-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF GENERAL RICHARD I. NEAL\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine Marine \nOfficer, General Butch Neal, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, who will soon retire from active duty.\n  General Neal's long and distinguished career began more than thirty \nyears ago following his graduation from Northeastern University when he \nwas commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. \nFollowing the completion of The Basic School at Quantico, Butch was \ntrained as an artillery officer and was assigned to duty in the \nRepublic of Vietnam where he served tours as a Forward Observer and as \nan Advisor to the Vietnamese Marine Corps.\n  While serving in Vietnam, he was wounded and received the Purple \nHeart. He was also awarded the Silver Star Medal on two occasions for \nhis heroism as well as the Bronze Star Medal with Combat ``V'' device.\n  General Neal distinguished himself over the years as one of the \nMarine Corps' finest commanding officers. Whether as a battery \ncommander, artillery battalion commander, Deputy Marine Expeditionary \nForce Commander or Commanding General of the 2nd Marine Division, his \nreputation as an uncommonly gifted leader of Marines has grown with \neach billet he held. In the joint arena, he served with distinction as \nthe Commanding General, Joint Task Force for Operation GITMO, the \nhumanitarian relief effort for Haitian immigrants in Cuba and as the \nDeputy Commander in Chief/Chief of Staff for U.S. Central Command.\n  Day after day, year after year he demonstrated the rare quality of \nbalancing difficult and often dangerous responsibilities with a keen \nconcern for the welfare of his Marines. Butch has been a superb staff \nofficer. Most Americans remember him from his no-nonsense daily \nbriefings during the Persian Gulf War, but he also distinguished \nhimself in personnel management as well as in operational planning.\n  This unique combination of leadership and administrative skills \ncarried him to the very highest levels of the Marine Corps. His \nimpeccable character and strong moral fiber make him a leader among the \nvery best of our nation's military commanders. Yet what stands out most \nto me when I think of this fine officer is his simplicity and \nunassuming nature.\n  Despite all the accolades and all the honors, he remains a simple man \nfrom Massachusetts. I got to know him and his wife Kathy because they \nattend the same church as my wife Marcelle and I. He is a hard working \nNew Englander who with love of God, country and Corps dedicated a \nlifetime in service to our nation. Too often we do not thank the Butch \nNeals of the world, those who choose a lifetime of service and \nsacrifice so that the rest of us can live safe and free.\n  Butch, we are grateful for the service you have rendered as a Marine, \nas well as the sacrifices made by both you and your family. I wish \nButch, his wife Kathy and their children Andrew, Amy and Erin much \nhealth and happiness in the years ahead. Our country is better for the \nmany contributions he has given us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9621-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9621-S9622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PAUL O'DWYER\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe most passionate and committed political leaders that this country \nhas ever known: Paul O'Dwyer of New York City. Sadly, Mr. O'Dwyer \nrecently died, one day before his 91st birthday.\n  A former New York City Council President, Paul O'Dwyer was the soul \nof political activism in New York for a half-century.\n\n[[Page S9622]]\n\n  Author Frank McCourt mourned him as ``one of the pure souls'' who \n``developed convictions early in life and never wavered.'' And not only \ndid Paul O'Dwyer hold deep convictions, he also acted on them. Mr. \nO'Dwyer once said, ``Politics is the only machinery around on which you \ncan really straighten things out.'' And hardly a day went by, where \nPaul O'Dwyer didn't work to ``straighten things out'' for the people of \nour country and our world who were most in need.\n  He was the quintessential champion of the underdog, and his thick \nwhite mane of hair became the symbol of most every significant social \nmovement in New York during the past 50 years.\n  The causes he championed were as diverse as the people and places of \nour great nation, but at the soul of each of his endeavors was the \npursuit of social justice.\n  He immigrated to the United States from Ireland when he was 17, and \nhe worked his entire adult life for a united Ireland. He was the \nnational coordinator for the American League for an Undivided Ireland. \nHe worked very closely with Gerry Adams and fought for his historic \ntrip to the United States so he could plead his case for peace and \nunderstanding in his homeland. And he insisted on meeting with \nProtestant leaders who visited our shores.\n  He fought diligently for the creation of the State of Israel. As \nchairman of the Lawyer's Committee for Justice in Palestine, he pleaded \nat the United Nations in the late 1940s for Israeli sovereignty.\n  He was deeply committed to ending segregation in our country. He \nsuccessfully litigated a critical desegregation suit in 1951, which \nopened the way for blacks to live in Stuyvesant Town, a large Manhattan \nhousing complex. He also went to the Deep South to register African-\nAmerican voters, campaign for black candidates, and provide legal \nassistance.\n  He successfully argued before the Supreme Court for the right of \nmainland Puerto Ricans to take their voter literacy test in Spanish.\n  His constant support of minority causes helped deny him a mainstream \nrole in American politics. In all his efforts to win elective public \noffice, he succeeded just twice, once as Manhattan's councilman at \nlarge and the other time as New York City Council President. He also \nwon the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator in 1968, but lost the \ngeneral election to Senator Jacob Javits. But Paul O'Dwyer didn't enter \npolitics to win elections, he did so because he saw injustice in this \ncountry, and he was determined to eradicate it.\n  In the end, Paul O'Dwyer may have lost more elections than he won, \nbut his leadership was not based on titles. It was built on principles.\n  Perhaps that is why few individuals have ever earned the level of \nrespect and admiration that Paul O'Dwyer received from both his \ncolleagues and his adversaries.\n  Paul O'Dwyer was truly one of a kind, and he will be dearly missed \nfor his leadership and more importantly for his friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9621-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9622-S9623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   S. 53--THE CURT FLOOD ACT OF 1998\n\n  The text of S. 53, the Curt Flood Act of 1998, as passed by the \nSenate on July 30, 1998, is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 53\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Congress further \n     declares that free and competitive markets create the most \n     efficient conditions for promoting economic development, and \n     should therefore govern the economic development of Earth \n     orbital space. The Congress further declares that the use of \n     free market principles in operating, servicing, allocating \n     the use of, and adding capabilities to the Space Station, and \n     the resulting fullest possible engagement of commercial \n     providers and participation of commercial users, will reduce \n     Space Station operational costs for all partners and the \n     Federal Government's share of the United States burden to \n     fund operations.\n       (b) Reports.--(1) The Administrator shall deliver to the \n     Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate, within 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, a study that identifies and examines--\n       (A) the opportunities for commercial providers to play a \n     role in International Space Station activities, including \n     operation, use, servicing, and augmentation;\n       (B) the potential cost savings to be derived from \n     commercial providers playing a role in each of these \n     activities;\n       (C) which of the opportunities described in subparagraph \n     (A) the Administrator plans to make available to commercial \n     providers in fiscal year 1999 and 2000;\n       (D) the specific policies and initiatives the Administrator \n     is advancing to encourage and facilitate these commercial \n     opportunities; and\n       (E) the revenues and cost reimbursements to the Federal \n     Government from commercial users of the Space Station.\n       (2) The Administrator shall deliver to the Committee on \n     Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, within \n     180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, an \n     independently-conducted market study that examines and \n     evaluates potential industry interest in providing commercial \n     goods and services for the operation, servicing, and \n     augmentation of the International Space Station, and in the \n     commercial use of the International Space Station.

To date, very few states have the ability \n     to do so without engaging the academic institutions within \n     their boundaries. In order to develop a market for the \n     commercial sector, the states must have the capacity to fully \n     utilize the technology.\n       (b) Amendments.--The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 \n     is amended--\n       (1) in section 2 (15 U.S.C. 5601)--\n       (A) by amending paragraph (5) to read as follows:\n       ``(5) Commercialization of land remote sensing is a near-\n     term goal, and should remain a long-term goal, of United \n     States policy.'';\n       (B) by striking paragraph (6) and redesignating paragraphs \n     (7) through (16) as paragraphs (6) through (15), \n     respectively;\n       (C) in paragraph (11), as so redesignated by subparagraph \n     (B) of this paragraph, by striking ``determining the design'' \n     and all that follows through ``international consortium'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``ensuring the continuity of \n     Landsat quality data''; and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(16) The United States should encourage remote sensing \n     systems to promote access to land remote sensing data by \n     scientific researchers and educators.\n       ``(17) It is in the best interest of the United States to \n     encourage remote sensing systems whether privately-funded or \n     publicly-funded, to promote widespread affordable access to \n     unenhanced land remote sensing data by scientific researchers \n     and educators and to allow such users appropriate rights for \n     redistribution for scientific and educational noncommercial \n     purposes.'';\n       (2) in section 101 (15 U.S.C. 5611)--\n       (A) in subsection (c)--\n       (i) by inserting ``and'' at the end of paragraph (6);\n       (ii) by striking paragraph (7); and\n       (iii) by redesignating paragraph (8) as paragraph (7); and\n       (B) in subsection (e)(1)--\n       (i) by inserting ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (A);\n       (ii) by striking ``, and'' at the end of subparagraph (B) \n     and inserting in lieu thereof a period; and\n       (iii) by striking subparagraph (C);\n       (3) in section 201 (15 U.S.C. 5621)--\n       (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``National Security.--'' in \n     subsection (b);\n       (B) in subsection (b)(1), as so redesignated by \n     subparagraph (A) of this paragraph--\n       (i) by striking ``No license shall be granted by the \n     Secretary unless the Secretary determines in writing that the \n     applicant will comply'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``The \n     Secretary shall grant a license if the Secretary determines \n     that the activities proposed in the application are \n     consistent'';\n       (ii) by inserting ``, and that the applicant has provided \n     assurances adequate to indicate, in combination with other \n     information available to the Secretary that is relevant to \n     activities proposed in the application, that the applicant \n     will comply with all terms of the license'' after ``concerns \n     of the United States''; and\n       (iii) by inserting ``and policies'' after ``international \n     obligations'';\n       (C) by adding at the end of subsection (b) the following \n     new paragraph:\n\n[[Page S9626]]\n\n       ``(2) The Secretary, within 6 months after the date of the \n     enactment of the Commercial Space Act of 1997, shall publish \n     in the Federal Register a complete and specific list of all \n     information required to comprise a complete application for a \n     license under this title.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 265, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 265) commending the Naval Nuclear \n     Propulsion Program on its 50th Anniversary and expressing the \n     sense of the Senate regarding continuation of the program \n     into the 21st century.\n\n\n[[Page S9628]]\n\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Naval \nNuclear Propulsion Program and to introduce a resolution to commemorate \nthe 50th anniversary of this outstanding institution.\n  The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program was founded by the legendary \nAdmiral Hyman Rickover in 1948 when he was a Captain. At that time, the \ntechnology that enabled the release of nuclear power was in its \ninfancy--a byproduct of the atomic bomb. Captain Rickover assigned \nhimself the task of building a nuclear submarine. Just seven years \nlater, U.S.S. Nautilus put to sea under nuclear power.\n  Admiral Rickover's legacy--the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program--is a \ntechnical organization unequaled in accomplishment throughout the \nworld.\n  The Program is truly a gem of efficiency in government and a crown \njewel in our Nation's security. The program fulfills its multifaceted \nresponsibilities over all aspects of naval nuclear propulsion with only \n750 Government personnel led by a single Director, currently Admiral \nSkip Bowman, USN.\n  By law, the Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion, is singularly \nresponsible for the design, construction, operation, operator training, \nmaintenance, refueling, and ultimate disposal of naval nuclear \npropulsion plants. During its 50 years of existence, the Naval Nuclear \nPropulsion Program has developed, built, and operated 246 nuclear \nreactors of more than 30 different designs. Since the Nautilus first \nsailed, the Navy has delivered 209 nuclear-powered warships which have \nsafely steamed a combined total of over 113 million miles.\n  The accomplishments of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program provide \nevidence that good engineering does not happen by coincidence, or by \nclever management technique. Good engineering is the result of \nthoroughly trained, dedicated people who are committed to ensuring \nproper attention to technical details.\n  The high degree of public confidence in the Navy's nuclear-powered \nwarships results from the Program's unparalleled operating, \nenvironmental, and safety record. This record is made possible because \nthe Program has the requisite authority, structure, expertise, and \nexperience necessary to focus all aspects of work on a common goal: \nSafe and reliable nuclear propulsion supporting military objectives.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program on \nits 50th anniversary and on all the accomplishments it has achieved \nduring that time.\n  On a personal note, I wish to acknowledge the contributions of the \nDirectors of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program past and present--\nAdmiral Hyman G. Rickover, Admiral Kin McKee, Admiral Bruce DeMars and \nAdmiral Skip Bowman--all of whom I am proud to have known and with whom \nI have worked closely over the years.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring this fine organization by \ncosponsoring this resolution.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that a statement by \nSenator Warner in explanation appear at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 265) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 265\n\n       Whereas in 1948, Admiral (then Captain) Hyman G. Rickover \n     first assembled his team of Navy professionals, other \n     Government professionals, and contractor professionals that \n     would adapt the relatively new technology of atomic energy to \n     design and build the United States' fleet of nuclear-powered \n     warships;\n       Whereas over the next seven years, Admiral Rickover and his \n     team developed an industrial base in a new technology, \n     pioneered new materials, designed and built a prototype \n     reactor, established a training program, and took the world's \n     first nuclear-powered submarine, the U.S.S. Nautilus, to sea \n     thus ensuring America's undersea superiority;\n       Whereas since 1955, when the U.S.S. Nautilus first sailed, \n     the Navy has put to sea 209 nuclear-powered ships whose \n     propulsion plants have given the Navy unparalleled mobility, \n     flexibility, and, additionally for submarines, stealth, with \n     an outstanding record of safety;\n       Whereas during its 50 years of existence, the Naval Nuclear \n     Propulsion Program has developed, built, and managed the \n     operation of 246 nuclear reactors of more than 30 different \n     designs with a combined total of 4,900 reactor years of \n     operation, thereby leading the world in reactor construction, \n     servicing, and operational experience;\n       Whereas since its inception, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion \n     Program has trained over 90,000 reactor operators and the \n     Navy's nuclear-powered warships have achieved over \n     113,000,000 miles of safe steaming on nuclear power; and\n       Whereas nuclear energy now propels more than 40 percent of \n     the Navy's major combatant vessels and these nuclear-powered \n     warships are accepted without reservation by over 50 \n     countries and territories into 150 ports: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate commends the past and present personnel of \n     the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program for the technical \n     excellence, accomplishment, and oversight demonstrated in the \n     program and congratulates those personnel for the 50 years of \n     exemplary service that has been provided to the United States \n     through the program; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the Naval Nuclear \n     Propulsion Program should be continued into the next \n     millennium to provide exemplary technical accomplishment in, \n     and oversight of, Naval nuclear propulsion plants and to \n     continue to be a model of technical excellence in the United \n     States and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9627-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9628-S9629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING CENTENNIAL OF FOUNDING OF DePAUL UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 266, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Moseley-Braun and Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 266) honoring the centennial of the \n     founding of DePaul University in Chicago, IL.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is my privilege to join my \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Richard Durbin, in recognizing an \nimportant milestone in our nation's history of higher education. This \nyear marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the country's \nlargest Catholic university, DePaul University, in my hometown of \nChicago.\n  One hundred years ago, the Vincentian Fathers founded a college to \neducate immigrants who were otherwise denied admission to many of the \nnation's colleges and universities. Today, DePaul University serves a \nstudent population of 17,000 young men and women. Over the course of \nthese 100 years, DePaul's growth has been guided by the original \nmission of the Fathers to foster in higher education a deep respect for \nthe God-given dignity of all persons, and to instill in educated \npersons a dedication to the service of others.\n  From its humble beginnings, DePaul University has grown to become a \nmajor educational and economic force in both the city of Chicago and \nthe State of Illinois. The more than 65,000 DePaul alumni who live and \nwork in Illinois are prominent in such diverse fields as law, \neducation, business, music and art.\n  Mirroring its hometown of Chicago, DePaul is nationally recognized \nfor the diversity of its faculty and student body. In fact, the \nUniversity enrolls the largest combined number of African-American and \nLatino students of any private college or university in Illinois.\n  A few of the many areas of study in which DePaul has distinguished \nitself include the performing arts, education, law, telecommunication \nand business. The School of Music and Theater also are nationally \nrecognized institutions. The School of Education has provided \nelementary and high school teachers to many schools throughout the \nChicago metropolitan area. Furthermore, on an issue that is very near \nto my heart, the School of Education has joined forces with the Chicago \nPublic School system in an effort to help develop new and innovative \nteaching techniques to meet the demands of the 21st century.\n\n[[Page S9629]]\n\n  Many of Illinois' finest jurists and lawyers received their training \nat DePaul University's School of law. The Law School, internationally \nknown for its work on human rights, is currently working with the \nUniversity's International Criminal Justice and Weapons Control Center \nin support of the establishment of an International Criminal Court.\n  In the field of business, DePaul University has distinguished itself \nwith a nationally ranked graduate school, which is one of the largest \nin the country, and whose part-time MBA program has received national \nrecognition as one of the country's top ten programs for each of the \npast four years. Moreover, the School of Computer Science, \nTelecommunications Information Systems is one of the largest graduate \nschools of its kind in the United States.\n  Mr. President, there are but a few of the many ways in which DePaul \nUniversity has repeatedly demonstrated its great worth to the State of \nIllinois and our nation as a purveyor of quality higher education and \ninvaluable academic research. It is important, however, that it be \nmentioned that DePaul University accomplishes all this while \nmaintaining a strong commitment to high moral ideals and the selfless \nservice to others and to God.\n  It is, therefore, right and appropriate that the United States Senate \npass this resolution, and join me and Senator Durbin in congratulating \nDePaul University on its Centennial Anniversary, and in wishing the \nUniversity much continued success for the next 100 years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nMoseley-Braun, in honoring DePaul University on its 100th anniversary.\n  The students, alumni, and faculty of DePaul University have much to \nbe proud of. One hundred years ago, a group of Vincentian fathers \nfounded what would become DePaul University in order to teach \nimmigrants who would otherwise be denied access to a college education. \nSince that time, DePaul has been guided by its original mission: to \nfoster in higher education a respect for all persons and a commitment \nto service of others.\n  It is no surprise that DePaul produces some of Illinois' top citizens \nand plays a significant role in the Illinois economy. The University \nhas distinguished itself in major education fields such as business, \nlaw, telecommunications, and art. The School of Education has provided \nthe Chicago metropolitan area with many devoted and innovative \nprofessional elementary and high school teachers. Further, DePaul's \nSchool of Business is a nationally ranked program that has been \nrecognized as one of the best in the nation.\n  Moreover, the DePaul School of Law has garnered an international \nreputation for its work in international human rights. The \nInternational Criminal Justice and Weapons Control Center of DePaul \nUniversity is working to establish an International Criminal Court in \norder to discourage war crimes.\n  In keeping with its original mission to teach immigrants who faced \ndisadvantages, DePaul continues to be committed to educating minority \nstudents who still face barriers to their advancement. The University \nis nationally recognized for the diversity of its faculty and enrolls \nthe largest number of African-American and Latino students of any \nprivate college or university in Illinois.\n  DePaul has matured into a prestigious university and an integral part \nof the city of Chicago. There are over 65,000 working DePaul graduates \nliving in Illinois. Further, DePaul graduates are prominent in every \nfacet of employment, including law, business, and the arts.\n  Again, I extend my congratulations to DePaul University. The \nUniversity has proven itself to be a great asset to the state of \nIllinois and the city of Chicago. I hope that its second century proves \nto be as successful as its first.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, en bloc; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements relating \nthereto be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 266) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S.

Res. 54\n\n       Whereas hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on \n     February 28, 1991, and the conditions governing the cease-\n     fire were specified in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 686 (March 2, 1991) and 687 (April 3, 1991);\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 \n     requires that international economic sanctions remain in \n     place until Iraq discloses and destroys its weapons of mass \n     destruction programs and capabilities and undertakes \n     unconditionally never to resume such activities;\n       Whereas Resolution 687 established the United Nations \n     Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) to uncover all aspects of \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs and tasked the \n     Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency to \n     locate and remove or destroy all nuclear weapons systems, \n     subsystems or material from Iraq;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 715, \n     adopted on October 11, 1991, empowered UNSCOM to maintain a \n     long-term monitoring program to ensure Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction programs are dismantled and not restarted;\n       Whereas Iraq has consistently fought to hide the full \n     extent of its weapons programs, and has systematically made \n     false declarations to the Security Council and to UNSCOM \n     regarding those programs, and has systematically obstructed \n     weapons inspections for seven years;\n       Whereas in June 1991, Iraqi forces fired on International \n     Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and otherwise obstructed and \n     misled UNSCOM inspectors, resulting in UN Security Council \n     Resolution 707 which found Iraq to be in ``material breach'' \n     of its obligations under United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 687 for failing to allow UNSCOM inspectors access \n     to a site storing nuclear equipment;\n       Whereas in January and February of 1992, Iraq rejected \n     plans to install long-term monitoring equipment and cameras \n     called for in UN resolutions, resulting in a Security Council \n     Presidential Statement of February 19, 1992 which declared \n     that Iraq was in ``continuing material breach'' of its \n     obligations;\n       Whereas in February of 1992, Iraq continued to obstruct the \n     installation of monitoring equipment, and failed to comply \n     with UNSCOM orders to allow destruction of missiles and other \n     proscribed weapons, resulting the Security Council \n     Presidential Statement of February 28, 1992, which reiterated \n     that Iraq was in ``continuing material breach'' and noted a \n     ``further material breach'' on account of Iraq's failure to \n     allow destruction of ballistic missile equipment;\n       Whereas on July 5, 1992, Iraq denied UNSCOM inspectors \n     access to the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture, resulting in a \n     Security Council Presidential Statement of July 6, 1992, \n     which declared that Iraq was in ``material and unacceptable \n     breach'' of its obligations under UN resolutions;\n       Whereas in December of 1992 and January of 1993, Iraq \n     violated the southern no-fly zone, moved surface to air \n     missiles into the no-fly zone, raided a weapons depot in \n     internationally recognized Kuwaiti territory and denied \n     landing rights to a plane carrying UN weapons inspectors, \n     resulting in a Security Council Presidential Statement of \n     January 8, 1993, which declared that Iraq was in an \n     ``unacceptable and material breach'' of its obligations under \n     UN resolutions;\n       Whereas in response to continued Iraqi defiance, a Security \n     Council Presidential Statement of January 11, 1993, \n     reaffirmed the previous finding of material breach, followed \n     on January 13 and 18 by allied air raids, and on January 17 \n     with an allied missile attack on Iraqi targets;\n       Whereas on June 10, 1993, Iraq prevented UNSCOM's \n     installation of cameras and monitoring equipment, resulting \n     in a Security Council Presidential Statement of June 18, \n     1993, declaring Iraq's refusal to comply to be a ``material \n     and unacceptable breach'';\n       Whereas on October 6, 1994, Iraq threatened to end \n     cooperation with weapons inspectors if sanctions were not \n     ended, and one day later, massed 10,000 troops within 30 \n     miles of the Kuwaiti border, resulting in United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 949 demanding Iraq's withdrawal \n     from the Kuwaiti border area and renewal of compliance with \n     UNSCOM;\n       Whereas on April 10, 1995, UNSCOM reported to the Security \n     Council that Iraq had concealed its biological weapons \n     program, and had failed to account for 17 tons of biological \n     weapons material resulting in the Security Council's renewal \n     of sanctions against Iraq;\n       Whereas on July 1, 1995, Iraq admitted to a full scale \n     biological weapons program, but denied weaponization of \n     biological agents, and subsequently threatened to end \n     cooperation with UNSCOM resulting in the Security Council's \n     renewal of sanctions against Iraq;\n       Whereas on March 8, 11, 14, and 15, 1996, Iraq again barred \n     UNSCOM inspectors from sites containing documents and \n     weapons, in response to which the Security Council issued a \n     Presidential Statement condemning ``clear violations by Iraq \n     of previous Resolutions 687, 707, and 715'';\n       Whereas from June 11-15, 1996, Iraq repeatedly barred \n     weapons inspectors from military sites, in response to which \n     the Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1060, noting the ``clear violation on United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions 687, 707, and 715'' and \n     in response to Iraq's continued violations, issued a \n     Presidential Statement detailing Iraq's ``gross violation of \n     obligations'';\n       Whereas in August 1996, Iraqi troops overran Irbil, in \n     Iraqi Kurdistan, employing more than 30,000 troops and \n     Republican Guards, in response to which the Security Council \n     briefly suspended implementation on United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 986, the UN oil for food plan;\n       Whereas in December 1996, Iraq prevented UNSCOM from \n     removing 130 Scud missile engines from Iraq for analysis, \n     resulting in a Security Council presidential statement which \n     ``deplore[d]'' Iraq's refusal to cooperate with UNSCOM;\n       Whereas on April 9, 1997, Iraq violated the no-fly zone in \n     southern Iraq and United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     670, banning international flights, resulting in a Security \n     Council statement regretting Iraq's lack of ``specific \n     consultation'' with the Council;\n       Whereas on June 4 and 5, 1997 Iraqi officials on board \n     UNSCOM aircraft interfered with the controls and inspections, \n     endangering inspectors and obstructing the UNSCOM mission, \n     resulting in a UN Security Council presidential statement \n     demanding Iraq end its interference and on June 21, 1997, \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1115 threatened \n     sanctions on Iraqi officials responsible for these \n     interferences;\n       Whereas on September 13, 1997, during an inspection \n     mission, an Iraqi official attacked UNSCOM officials engaged \n     in photographing illegal Iraqi activities, resulting in the \n     October 23, 1997, adoption of United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1134 which threatened a travel ban on Iraqi \n     officials responsible for non-compliance with UN resolutions;\n       Whereas on October 29, 1997, Iraq announced that it would \n     no longer allow American inspectors working with UNSCOM to \n     conduct inspections in Iraq, blocking UNSCOM teams containing \n     Americans to conduct inspections and threatening to shoot \n     down U.S. U-2 surveillance flights in support of UNSCOM, \n     resulting in a United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1137 on November 12, 1997, which imposed the travel ban on \n     Iraqi officials and threatened unspecified ``further \n     measures'';\n       Whereas on November 13, 1997, Iraq expelled U.S. inspectors \n     from Iraq, leading to UNSCOM's decision to pull out its \n     remaining inspectors and resulting in a United Nations \n     Security Council presidential statement demanding Iraq revoke \n     the expulsion;\n       Whereas on January 16, 1998, an UNSCOM team led by American \n     Scott Ritter was withdrawn from Iraq after being barred for \n     three days by Iraq from conducting inspections, resulting in \n     the adoption of a United Nations Security Council \n     presidential statement deploring Iraq's decision to bar the \n     team as a clear violation of all applicable resolutions;\n       Whereas despite clear agreement on the part of Iraqi \n     President Saddam Hussein with United Nations General Kofi \n     Annan to grant access to all sites, and fully cooperate with \n     UNSCOM, and the adoption on March 2, 1998, of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1154, warning that any violation \n     of the agreement with Annan would have the ``severest \n     consequences'' for Iraq, Iraq has continued to actively \n     conceal weapons and weapons programs, provide misinformation \n     and otherwise deny UNSCOM inspectors access;\n       Whereas on June 24, 1998, UNSCOM Director Richard Butler \n     presented information to the UN Security Council indicating \n     clearly that Iraq, in direct contradiction to information \n     provided to UNSCOM, weaponized the nerve agent VX; and\n       Whereas Iraq's continuing weapons of mass destruction \n     programs threaten vital United States interests and \n     international peace and [security; and] security:\n       [Whereas the United States has existing

KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS AUTHORIZATION ACT OF \n                                  1998\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe consideration of calendar No. 488, H.R. 3504.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3504) to amend the John F. Kennedy Center Act \n     to authorize appropriations for the John F. Kennedy Center \n     for the Performing Arts and to further define the criteria \n     for capital repair and operation and maintenance.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the bill now before the Senate is the \n``John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Authorization Act.''\n  The concept of a national Center for the performing arts originated \nduring the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. President \nEisenhower envisioned a national cultural center in the nation's \ncapital, and in 1958, with the support of Congress, he signed into law \nthe National Cultural Center Act, which established the Center as an \nindependently administered bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. \nFollowing the death of President Kennedy, the Congress in 1964 renamed \nthe Center in honor of the late president.\n  The Kennedy Center was opened to the public in September 1971. The \nresponse was overwhelming--so much so that the Center's Board of \nTrustees requested help from Congress in maintaining and operating the \nCenter, for the benefit of the millions of visitors. In 1972, Congress \nauthorized the National Park Service to provide maintenance, security, \nand other services necessary to maintain the facility. For the next two \ndecades, the Park Service received federal appropriations for the \nmaintenance and operation of the Presidential monument.\n  In the early part of this decade, however, it became clear that the \nKennedy Center facility--which had not seen comprehensive capital \nrepair since its opening--had deteriorated significantly due to both \nage and intensive public use. Those repairs that had taken place--such \nas the 1977 repair of the leaking roof--were undertaken in response to \nthreatening conditions. The Board of Trustees, with the support of the \nPark Service, therefore set out to achieve a more effective long-term \napproach to management of the facility, with one entity responsible for \nboth the care of the physical plant and the staging of performance \nactivities.\n  In 1994, therefore, Congress approved and the President signed the \nJohn F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments (Public Law 103-279). That Act \nauthorized the transfer of all capital repair, operations, and \nmaintenance of the Center from the Park Service to the Kennedy Center \nBoard of Trustees.\n  The Act also directed the Board to develop a comprehensive, multi-\nyear plan for the restoration and ongoing maintenance of the Kennedy \nCenter. In 1995, the Board delivered the Comprehensive Building Plan, \nwhich set forth a long-term, two-stage program for the remediation of \nsubstandard building conditions, as well as continuous maintenance for \nthe future. Phase I, scheduled for Fiscal Years 1995 through 1998, has \nconcluded successfully. During this time, several major projects were \ncompleted, including the installation of a new, energy-efficient \nheating and cooling system, replacement of the leaking roof and roof \nterrace, and the major renovation of the Concert Hall. Phase II is \nscheduled to take place over the next eleven fiscal\n\n[[Page S9661]]\n\nyears, through Fiscal Year 2009. This stage will involve the massive \n``Center Block'' project, during which the Opera House will be \noverhauled, as well as projects to make improvements to the plaza, \nimprove accessibility to the theaters, install fire and other safety \ntechnology, and make a host of other repairs designed to ensure that \nthe facility meets life safety standards.\n  That brings us to the legislation we are considering today. For the \nmajor Phase II projects to get underway, Congress must revise the 1994 \nAct to authorize appropriate funding for the next several fiscal years. \nThis bill authorizes significant funding levels for the next eleven \nfiscal years for maintenance as well as capital repair work.\n  The bill before the Senate is H.R. 3504, the House-passed bill. It is \nalmost identical to S. 2038, legislation that I introduced and that was \nreported by the Environment and Public Works Committee on June 12, \n1998. Because of the similarity in the two bills, we are pleased to \npass the House bill without amendment sending it to the President for \nhis signature.\n  The Kennedy Center is a living Presidential memorial and a national \nmonument, and as such demands a high standard of maintenance and \nupkeep. As an ex-officio member of the Board, and Chairman of the \nauthorizing Committee, I am dedicated to the appropriate restoration \nand preservation of the facility, which millions of Americans have \nenjoyed for more than a quarter of a century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office setting forth the budgetary impacts of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1998.\n     Hon.

Kennedy Center. The bill would authorize spending on \n     maintenance, repair, and security at $13 million for 1999, \n     $14 million for each of fiscal years 2000 and 2001, and $15 \n     million for each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Capital \n     projects would be authorized at $20 million annually for \n     fiscal years 1999-2001, $19 million for fiscal year 2002, and \n     $17 million for fiscal year 2003. Currently these functions \n     are authorized through fiscal year 1999--maintenance, repair \n     and security at $12 million and capital projects at $9 \n     million. Thus, enactment of H.R. 3504 would result in a net \n     increase in authorizations of $12 million for fiscal year \n     1999 and $146 million over the 1999-2003 period. Assuming \n     that the amounts authorized are appropriated and that \n     spending follows historical outlay patterns, H.R. 3504 would \n     result in increased outlays of $112 million during fiscal \n     years 1999-2003.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: H.R. 3504 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 and would \n     not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Previous CBO estimates: On May 6, 1998, CBO provided an \n     identical estimate for H.R. 3504 as ordered reported by the \n     House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In \n     addition, CBO provided an identical estimate for a similar \n     bill, S. 2038, on May 22, 1998.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost: Christina Hawley \n     Sadoti; Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Marc \n     Nicole; and Impact on the Private Sector: Jean Wooster.\n       Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

KELLY\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today this body formally approved the \nnomination of Raymond W. Kelly, of New York, to be Commissioner of \nCustoms. I am deeply, deeply pleased and believe that we have a Customs \nCommissioner of whom we can be proud, who will do the kind of \noutstanding work that Ray Kelly has done over the years in law \nenforcement.\n  He is a native New Yorker. He spent quite a bit of his time as a \nyoung man in the village of Island Park, where I live and grew up. So \nit is a great pleasure to see him come to this highly regarded \nposition. I know he is going to be an outstanding Commissioner, and I \nlook forward to working with him.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JACOB JOSEPH LEW\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as we confirm the nomination of Mr. \nJack Lew to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, I want \nto take this opportunity to highlight a problem that OMB has the power \nto help correct, but to this date has chosen not to.\n  As many are aware, there is a real problem right now in rural America \nbrought about the dismal farm prices. The only way that commodity \nprices are going to increase is to boost exports. Certainly, passage of \nFast Track, funding of the IMF, continuing normal trade relations with \nChina, and lifting sanctions are necessary parts of the strategy to \ngrow our export markets.\n  However, there is also a tool, the Export Enhancement Program, that \nthe federal government can be using to help boost exports and revive \nfarm exports in the near term. Congress has done its part in providing \nappropriations for this program, but the Administration has failed to \nutilize the program.\n  The EEP program is designed to help our agricultural exports compete \nin the face of subsidized competition in international markets. Despite \nclear evidence that subsidized competition is eroding U.S. markets, \nparticularly for wheat flour, the Administration has been dragging its \nfeet in initiating the EEP.\n  The USDA has been pushing for the use of the Export Enhancement \nProgram for wheat flour for almost two years. However, before the \nprogram can be initiated, an interagency review group, of which OMB is \na member, must approve the initiative. OMB has not endorsed usage of \nthe Export Enhancement Program to counteract European subsidies for \nwheat flour, and thus has effectively blocked use of the program.\n  It is objectionable that the Clinton Administration is not compelled \nto stand up for its farm community in the face of adversity in the same \nway that its European counterparts are. Secondly, it is objectionable \nthat the OMB is driving agricultural trade policy, instead of the \nDepartment of Agriculture in conjunction with the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative.\n\n[[Page S9664]]\n\n  Exports of U.S. wheat flour have come to a virtual standstill, and it \nis not because U.S. farmers and millers are relatively inefficient. It \nis because our competitors, namely the European Union, highly subsidize \nflour milling. The Administration has the power to correct this by \nusing our own export subsidy program, but OMB is preventing it.\n  The Administration has announced its intention to purchase wheat and \ndonate it overseas for humanitarian purposes. This is a fine idea, but \nit is not a substitute for an initiative that will target commercial \nmarkets. The EEP program can be used in countries that pay cash for the \nwheat flour they consume and that do not qualify for humanitarian \nassistance. These are important markets that the U.S. wheat industry \nhas spent years developing. Furthermore, using the EEP to leverage \nsales will allow USDA to facilitate a larger amount of wheat flour \nsales using fewer federal dollars that it would through a donation \nprogram.\n  The EEP is needed not only because it wall help us regain our \ncommercial presence in markets traditionally held by the U.S., but also \nbecause it will increase our leverage in future trade negotiations. The \nreal objective here needs to be to eliminate export subsidies \nworldwide. However, our competitors have no reason to come to the \nnegotiating table if the U.S. has already unilaterally eliminated \nexport subsidies.\n  The Export Enhancement Program needs to be utilized now for wheat \nflour. I encourage Mr. Lew to make that a priority when he enters \noffice.\n\n\n        NOMINATION OF BILL RICHARDSON TO BE SECRETARY OF ENERGY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to work with \nthe current Ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, on a \nnumber of occasions. I have met with him briefly twice this week. I \nfind him to be a very impressive man.\n  I, first, wish to commend him for his work at the United Nations, and \nparticularly that chapter of his work which occurred during the course \nof the crisis in the gulf with Saddam Hussein in the early part of this \nyear. I accompanied the Secretary of Defense on his trip to the gulf \nregion and to Russia and to meet with his counterpart in Germany, and \nthroughout that process then-Ambassador Richardson played a key role.\n  I know for a fact Ambassador Richardson had a very significant \nparticipation, together with the President and the Secretaries of State \nand Defense, in negotiating with other nations to avoid the need for \nthe use of force and to bring about a conclusion, while not entirely \nsatisfactory to this Senator and to others, nevertheless, it was the \nbest that could be achieved at that time. It was an extraordinary role \nthat he played.\n  I also observed, as did others, his tireless efforts throughout the \nworld in fulfilling his responsibilities as Ambassador to the United \nNations, and, indeed, he put a particular emphasis on Africa, where \nassistance is very gravely needed at this time.\n  I think he comes eminently qualified to the position of Secretary of \nEnergy. The Armed Services Committee, of which I am privileged to be a \nmember, has oversight of approximately two-thirds of the budget of the \nDepartment. The key elements of that budget relate to stewardship of \nour nuclear weapons stockpile. We currently do no underground nuclear \ntesting, and, therefore, there is a very significant challenge placed \non the Secretary of Energy to make certain that the nuclear stockpile \nis maintained in a state of readiness to ensure its safety and \nreliability. The nuclear stockpile is an essential part of our arsenal \nof deterrence, and the certification of the stockpile's safety and \nreliability is a responsibility under the Secretary.\n  That, together with the need to do cleanup at numerous Department of \nEnergy weapons sites, places a great challenge on the Secretary. In my \njudgment, I believe unequivocally he has the ability to meet these \nchallenges, and I join others in the Senate in supporting his \nnomination.\n  Again, the term Secretary of Energy is aptly named for Bill \nRichardson because, as I think my good friend and colleague from New \nMexico would say, he is a man of unlimited energy and is, indeed, the \nright man for that job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on July 22, exactly one week after \nreceiving the nomination of Ambassador Bill Richardson to be Secretary \nof Energy, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing \non his nomination. Two days ago, exactly one week after the hearing, \nthe Committee ordered his nomination reported. Now, two days later, the \nnomination is before this body for final passage at 2:00 p.m. I \ndescribe this to make it clear that the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, and its Chairman, have made every effort to go beyond simple \ngood faith and work cooperatively with the White House and Department \nof Energy to fill this vital cabinet position.\n  I believe that Ambassador Richardson is personally well-qualified to \nbe Secretary of Energy. However, I, along with other members of the \nEnergy Committee, have had serious reservations about this nomination. \nI have supported the demand of Senators Craig and Grams, and others, \nthat this Administration show that it intends to live up to its \nresponsibility to solve this Nation's nuclear waste problem.\n  The Federal government is in breach of its contractual obligation to \nremove nuclear waste from more than 80 sites in 40 states by last \nJanuary, making the American taxpayer liable for as much as $80 billion \nin damages. The Administration's failure to address this pressing \nenvironmental problem threatens to eliminate our single largest source \nof emissions-free power, and is already resulting in dirtier air.\n  The Administration not only failed to propose a solution for this \nproblem, they threatened to veto a Congressional solution that has \noverwhelming bipartisan support in both Houses. This issue was raised \nwhen the previous Secretary was nominated and confirmed, and we \nreceived assurances that he would work with us to address this problem. \nHowever, all we received from the Department of Energy was silence and \na threat to veto Congress' proposed solution.\n  All during this time, my request, echoed by many others on both sides \nof the aisle, to the Administration has been simple: live up to your \nobligation. The problem is real, and getting worse every day. If you do \nnot like the solution Congress has proposed, you have an obligation to \npropose an alternative. I have made it clear that, while I can accept \nand support Ambassador Richardson as Secretary of Energy, I cannot \naccept any Secretary of Energy that would attempt to undertake all of \nthis responsibility with no real authority. If the President does not \ntrust, or expect, his nominee to undertake a resolution of one of the \nmost important problems facing the Department of Energy, then he should \nnot nominate him. If the Secretary of Energy cannot work with Congress \nto resolve such problems, then there is no point in having a Secretary \nof Energy.\n  As I indicated earlier, despite these reservations, I, along with all \nof the members of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources have \ngone out of our way to engender a spirit of cooperation with the \nAdministration with respect to this nomination. In response, I am glad \nto say that the President has confirmed, via letter, the \nAdministration's commitment to resolving the nuclear waste storage \nissue, and has assured me that Ambassador Richardson, if confirmed, \nwill have the portfolio, and full authority, to address this problem. I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 30, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to encourage your support \n     for an expeditious confirmation of Ambassador Bill Richardson \n     as Secretary of Energy. Ambassador Richardson brings a wealth \n     of experience to this position and I believe he will be able \n     to move the Department of Energy forward on its many critical \n     missions.\n       I want to assure you that my Administration is committed to \n     resolving the nuclear waste storage issue. I have personal \n     confidence in Ambassador Richardson's ability to deal with \n     this complex matter in a competent, straight-forward \n     professional manner.\n       It is extremely important that Ambassador Richardson be \n     confirmed so he can oversee\n\n[[Page S9665]]\n\n     the Department of Energy's viability assessment process for \n     the Yucca Mountain site. As you know, the viability \n     assessment will be completed by the end of this year. Once \n     that assessment is made, the Ambassador will have my complete \n     support in talking with Members of Congress on future issues \n     related to the Yucca Mountain site. Let me assure you that \n     Ambassador Richardson has the portfolio for addressing the \n     nuclear waste issue and has full authority to carry out his \n     responsibilities in this area.\n       I believe it is in the Nation's interest to confirm \n     Ambassador Richardson as quickly as possible so that he can \n     bring his full attention to the viability assessment and the \n     future of Yucca Mountain as well as to the other important \n     missions of the Department of Energy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The letter does make it clear that Congress should not \nexpect to hear anything substantive from the new Secretary of Energy on \nthis matter until the end of the year, well after the election. This \nconcerns me, as a signal that the Administration plans to continue to \nhold nuclear waste hostage for political posturing, while the physical \nand economic health of American citizens is held in abeyance.\n  However, the President also assures me of his faith in Ambassador \nRichardson's ability to deal with this complex matter in a competent, \nstraight-forward professional manner. I have faith in his ability, as \nwell, as long as he is given the authority to exercise it. As I now \nhave a promise that he will have such authority, I will take this \ncommitment in good faith, the spirit in which I have conducted this \nentire process, and will expect no less from President and Ambassador \nRichardson.\n  Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nconfirmation of Ambassador Richardson to be Secretary of Energy.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Senate today passed by unanimous \nconsent the nomination of Bill Richardson to be the next Secretary of \nEnergy. Mr. Richardson's nomination passed the Senate unanimously \nbecause he was an honorable Member of Congress, he was an honorable \nrepresentative for our country at the United Nations, and he is an \nhonorable man. Mr. Richardson has the capability to be among the best \nSecretaries of Energy to serve our nation.\n  But if we had voted today on Mr. Richardson's nomination, I would \nhave voted no. I would have done so not out of doubt for Mr. \nRichardson's capabilities, but because of the horrible record of the \nClinton Administration in responding to my concerns and the concerns of \nmany other Members of Congress with regard to nuclear waste storage.\n  On April 8, 1998, I wrote a detailed letter to the President \noutlining my dissatisfaction with responses to questions I have posed \nto nominees for positions within the Department of Energy. In that \nletter I quoted those nominees and showed very clearly how they all \nwant to do something, how they all want to work with Congress, and how \nthey all recognize the problems at the DOE. Regrettably, not one of \nthem has ever been allowed to tackle the issues for which they express \nso much concern before Congress. This Administration has yet to allow a \nnominee or professional staffer from the DOE to come to Congress and \nspeak openly about nuclear waste.\n  As I stated earlier, I wrote to the Administration with my concerns \non April 8, and just received a response this morning. They knew I was \ngoing to be looking closely at the answers of Mr. Richardson and that I \nexpected those answers to be detailed and substantive. Instead, they \nignored my letter until the last minute and sent to me responses from \nMr. Richardson that displayed the same lack of candor as all previous \nnominees. Let me read for the Senate a couple of examples.\n  I provided Mr. Richardson with a detailed description of what I \nlearned on a recent trip to France about its nuclear industry. I \nexplained how France uses nuclear energy to meet over 80% of its \nelectricity needs. I explained their use of reprocessing and MOX fuel \nand the level to which they are able to reduce the amount of nuclear \nwaste they retain for final disposal. I then asked Mr. Richardson if he \nfelt we should begin to look for ways to expand our use of nuclear \nenergy. Mr. Richardson's response was notable in its brevity. He wrote:\n\n       I agree that nuclear energy must be a viable option to \n     meeting future electricity demand in the United States.\n\n  I find it hard to believe that Mr. Richardson, who used to represent \nthe Congressional District in which Los Alamos National Laboratory \nrests, cannot be more specific in his views on the future of nuclear \npower in the United States. The answer provided above was written by a \nstaffer at the DOE who sought to evade my question.\n  I expanded on that question by asking Mr. Richardson how we expand \nour use of nuclear power? He wrote:\n\n       The Department, in its FY 1999 Budget Request, recognized \n     the need to maintain a viable nuclear option for the future. \n     The Budget Request proposed new programs to work on the \n     technologies required to extend the licenses nuclear plants \n     and to undertake the research necessary to develop more \n     efficient, more reliable, and safer nuclear plants for the \n     future. I think these efforts are a good start at providing \n     the Nation with the option of safe and affordable nuclear \n     power in the future.\n\n  Again, not a very definite statement on the future of nuclear power, \nbut at least it was longer than the one sentence answer to the previous \nquestion. Sadly, Mr. Richardson's answer doesn't address any of the \nreal issues in relation to the continuation and expansion of nuclear \npower. First, he never once mentioned nuclear waste storage in his \nanswer. Without a storage solution, not only will we not build new \nplants, but our existing plants will begin to shut down prematurely. In \nfact, Minnesota is set to lose our Prairie Island facility in 2007 due \nto a lack of storage space for nuclear fuel. Minnesota will at that \npoint lose 20% of its electricity generating capacity and will be \nforced to replace clean nuclear power with polluting fossil fuels at \nexactly the same time the Kyoto Protocol is set to take effect--and \nconsumer costs will soar.\n  That brings me to the next consideration unmentioned in Mr. \nRichardson's response: the role of nuclear power in our efforts to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power is responsible for 90% \nof our greenhouse gas emissions reductions from the electricity \nindustry since 1973. The countries of Europe and Japan are going to \nmeet their requirements under the Kyoto Protocol using nuclear power. \nMr. Richardson mentioned a new program to develop more reliable and \nsafer nuclear power plants. Europe, Japan, and others are using our \ntechnology right now to build new plants--technology we continue to \nignore.\n  Those are but two of the important issues which must be addressed \nwhen we consider expanding or maintaining our use of nuclear power in \nthe next century. I find it unreasonable that this Administration would \nsend to me responses which so clearly lack the information directly \nasked for in the question.\n  Mr. Richardson did, however, write some interesting things about \nnuclear power in his responses. Let me share with you a couple of those \nresponses. They read:\n\n       Nuclear power is a proven means of generating electricity. \n     When managed well, it is also a safe means of generating \n     electricity.\n       It is my understanding that spent nuclear fuel has been \n     safely transported in the United States in compliance with \n     the regulatory requirements set forth by the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission and the Department of Transportation.\n       From the experience that France, England, and Japan have \n     reported, it appears that they have engaged in successful \n     shipping efforts. However, my understanding is that these \n     countries also have experienced some degree of difficulty and \n     criticism from the public.\n       The widely publicized shipment last week of spent fuel from \n     California to Idaho is proof that transportation can be done \n     safely. The safety record of nuclear shipments would be among \n     the issues I would focus on as Secretary of Energy.\n\n  I asked Mr. Richardson to tell me who would pay the billions of \ndollars in damages some say the DOE will owe utilities as a result of \nDOE failure to remove spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. After \nwriting about the DOE's beliefs on their level of liability he wrote: \n``I will give this issue priority attention once I am confirmed as \nSecretary of Energy.''\n  I asked Mr. Richardson if he felt the taxpayers had been treated \nfairly. Again, after telling me about the history of the Department's \nactions to avoid their responsibilities, he wrote: ``I share your \ninterest in resolving these issues and I will continue to pursue this \nonce I am confirmed.''\n\n[[Page S9666]]\n\n  Now, Mr. President, lets look at who then nominee Federico Pena \nresponded to my question regarding the responsibility of the DOE to \nbegin removing spent nuclear fuel from my state. He said in testimony \nbefore the Energy and Natural Resources Committee:\n\n       . . . we will work with the Committee to address these \n     issues within the context of the President's statement last \n     year. So we've got a very difficult issue. I am prepared to \n     address it. I will do that as best as I can, understanding \n     the complexities involved. But they are all very legitimate \n     questions and I look forward to working with you and others \n     to try to find a solution.\n\n  Does that sound familiar? I suspect Secretary O'Leary had something \nequally vague to say about nuclear waste storage as well. Secretary \nPena, I believe, said it best when he stated, ``I will do that as best \nas I can, understanding the complexities involved.'' Those \ncomplexities, Mr. President, are not that complex at all. Quite simply, \nthe President of the United States, despite the will of 307 Members of \nthe House of Representatives and 65 Senators, does not want to keep the \nDOE's promise and does not want to address this important issue for our \nnation. His absence in this debate is all the complexity we need \nidentify.\n  Mr. President, I want to be very clear that I am sincere in these \ncomplaints. My concern is for the ratepayers of my state and ratepayers \nacross the country. They have poured billions of dollars into the \nNuclear Waste Fund expecting the DOE to take this waste. They have paid \ncountless more millions paying for on-site nuclear waste storage. \nEffective January 31, 1998, they are paying for both of these cost \nsimultaneously even though no waste has been moved.\n  Mr. President, when the DOE is forced to pay damages to utilities \nacross the nation, the ratepayers and taxpayers will again pay for the \nfollies authorized by the DOE. Some estimate the costs of damages to be \nas high as $80 to $100 billion or more. The ratepayers will also have \nto pay the price of building new gas or coal fired plants when nuclear \nplants must shut down. And, if the Administration gets its way, my \nconstituents will pay again when the Kyoto Protocol takes effect in \n2008--exactly the same time Minnesota will be losing 20% of its \nelectricity from clean nuclear power and replacing it with fossil \nfuels.\n  Six years of rudderless leadership in the White House with regard to \nnuclear energy holds grave consequences for the citizens of my state. I \ncannot merely sit by now and tell my constituents I tried. I must take \nwhatever action I can to raise this issue with this Administration and \nwith this Congress.\n  The Administration has admitted nuclear waste can be transported \nsafely. They have admitted they neglected their responsibility. They \nhave admitted nuclear power is a proven, safe means of generating \nelectricity. And they have admitted there is a general consensus that \ncentralized interim storage is scientifically and technically possible \nand can be done safely. If you add all of these points together and \nhold them up against the Administration's lack of action, you can only \ncome to one conclusion: politics has indeed won out over policy and \nscience.\n  If the Senate would have voted on the Richardson nomination I would \nhave voted no. I like Bill Richardson and I think he will do a fine job \nas Secretary of Energy--but my state and my constituents need someone \nto take substantive action at the DOE to begin removing nuclear fuel \nfrom my state. Regrettably, as long as Bill Clinton occupies 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue, I do not believe it will happen. I do not believe \nBill Richardson will have the opportunity to do what is needed to \nresolve these problems. I know he will have to advocate the policies of \nPresident Clinton and Vice President Gore. And in my opinion, that is \nthe problem. This Administration has made this a political issue at the \nexpense of the electricity needs of the country. Until this \nAdministration wants to deal with policy and not politics, I will not \nsupport its continued lack of action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9663-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 267 submitted earlier by Senator \nFrist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 267) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the President, acting through the United States \n     Agency for International Development, should more effectively \n     secure emergency famine relief for the people of Sudan, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of a Sense of the \nSenate which, with the help of Senators Feingold, DeWine, Ashcroft, and \nGrams, I have brought before this body in an effort to more clearly \ndefine the role of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment in the ongoing multinational effort to address the needs of \nthe people of southern Sudan. At least 1.2 million Sudanese are \nhovering on the brink of starvation, with an additional 1.4 million \nbeing targeted by the World Food Program in an effort to stave off the \nfamine conditions which may soon threaten them.\n  This Sense of the Senate we offer both urges the President to go \nforward with a more aggressive approach to our contribution to that \neffort, and it gives him explicit Senate backing for the efforts which \nthe Administration is already undertaking to that end. The underlying \npremise of the legislation is simple: the United States' role in that \nrelief effort and in other, proactive self-sufficiency programs has \ngeneral recognized the constraints placed upon the members of Operation \nLifeline Sudan--the United Nations' agreement with the government of \nSudan in Khartoum, where the regime holds veto authority over the \nmember's specific deliveries of humanitarian relief. This flawed \narrangement has allowed Khartoum to use that very humanitarian relief \nas a weapon in their war on the South, and with devastating effect. \nIndeed, the current famine conditions now threatening the lives of over \n2 million Sudanese is largely created by the massive disruptions to the \nfragile agrarian and pastoralist populations in the South these acts of \nwar represent. While the United States should continue to provide \nrelief through the established channels of Operation Lifeline Sudan, it \nmust also seek to use other distribution channels to reach populations \nto which Khartoum has routinely and with devastating calculation denied \nrelief agencies access. Additionally, the United States must also begin \nto plan how we can help in preventing future threats of famine.\n  To realize these goals and directives, the Sense of the Senate \nrecommends that the President take three specific actions. First, \nthrough the Agency for International Development, he should begin to \nmore aggressively utilize relief agencies which distribute famine \nrelief outside the umbrella of Operation Lifeline Sudan, thus \nunimpaired by the restrictions of Khartoum. Second, the Agency for \nInternational Development should begin to incorporate areas of southern \nSudan which are outside of Khartoum's control into its overall strategy \nfor sub-Saharan Africa in an effort to prevent future famine conditions \nand assist in helping the region realize a greater level of self-\nsufficiency--both in food production and in rule of law. Finally, the \nPresident is urged to use the current tentative cease-fire in Sudan, \nand international attention the famine has created, to push for the \nUnited Nations and the State Department to revamp the terms under which \nOperation Lifeline Sudan operates. It is especially important to \nguarantee that food cannot be used as a weapon and thus end Khartoum's \nveto authority over shipments of humanitarian relief in southern Sudan.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for the support this critical piece of \nlegislation has received on both sides of the aisle, and I am \nespecially thankful for the effort and support of the Senators who have \ncosponsored this Sense of the Senate. It is important that the \nAdministration and the Congress work together to ensure that the United \nStates relief effort is the most effective it can possibly be.\n\n[[Page S9667]]\n\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that an op-ed I wrote for \nThe Washington Post's July 19, 1998 edition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 19, 1998]\n\n                Sudan's Merciless War on Its Own People\n\n                        (By Senator Bill Frist)\n\n       When the United Nations World Food Program announced last \n     week that up to 2.6 million people in Southern Sudan are in \n     imminent danger of starvation, the news was received with \n     surprising nonchalance. Such news is becoming almost routine \n     from misery-plagues East Africa, but what is unfolding in \n     southern Sudan is at least the fourth widespread, large-scale \n     humanitarian disaster in the region in the past 15 years.\n       In all cases, the United States' record is not one of \n     success. Ethiopia in 1984, a disastrous military involvement \n     in Somalia in 1993 and shameful neglect in Rwanda in 1994 \n     have left the public bitter toward the prospect of yet more \n     involvement. But again, as famine hovers over the region, we \n     face a disconcertingly similar quandary on the nature of our \n     response.\n       In January I worked in southern Sudan as a medical \n     missionary, and I have seen firsthand the terrible effects of \n     the continuing civil war and how that war came to help create \n     this situation. As a United States senator, however, I fear \n     that by failing to make necessary changes in our response, \n     American policy toward Sudan may be a contributing factor in \n     the horrendous prospect of widespread starvation.\n       The radical Islamic regime in Khartoum is unmatched in its \n     barbarity toward the sub-Saharan or ``black African'' \n     Christians of the country's South. It is largely responsible \n     for creating this impending disaster through a concerted and \n     sustained war on its own people, in which calculated \n     starvation, bombing of hospitals, slavery and the killing of \n     innocent women and children are standard procedure.\n       Our policy toward Khartoum looks tough on paper, but it has \n     yet to pose a serious challenge to the Islamic dictatorship. \n     Neither has our wavering and inconsistent commitment to \n     sanctions affected its behavior or its ability to finance the \n     war.\n       Khartoum is set to gain billions of dollars in oil revenues \n     from fields it is preparing to exploit in areas of rebel \n     activity. The U.S. sanctions prohibit any American \n     investment, but recent evidence indicates that enforcement is \n     lax. Additionally, relief groups operating there report that \n     new weapons are flowing in as part of a deal with one of he \n     partners--a government-owned petroleum company in China.\n       It is our policy toward southern Sudan that is of more \n     immediate importance to the potential humanitarian disaster. \n     From my own experience operating in areas where U.S. \n     government relief is rarely distributed, I fear that both \n     unilaterally and as a member of the United Nations, the \n     United States unnecessarily restricts our own policy in odd \n     deference to the regime in Khartoum.\n       In southern Sudan our humanitarian relief contributions to \n     the starving are largely funneled through nongovernmental \n     relief organizations that participate in Operation Lifeline \n     Sudan. All of our contributions to the United Nations efforts \n     are distributed through this flawed deal.\n       In this political arrangement the Khartoum regime has veto \n     power over all decisions as to where food can be sent. That \n     which is needed in the areas outside their control is often \n     used as an instrument of war, with Khartoum routinely denying \n     permission for a flight to land in an area of rebel activity, \n     especially during times when international attention lacks \n     its current focus. This practice starves combatants and \n     noncombatants alike and compromises the integrity and \n     effectiveness of relief groups desperately trying to fend off \n     famine.\n       Despite associated risks, some relief groups operate \n     successfully outside the arrangement's umbrella, getting food \n     and medicine to areas that the regime in Khartoum would \n     rather see starve. Out of concern that the Khartoum regime \n     would be provoked into prohibiting all relief deliveries \n     under the scheme, the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development and its Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance do \n     not regularly funnel famine relief through outside \n     organizations, and thus our relief supplies are only \n     selectively distributed--a decision that unnecessarily abets \n     Khartoum's agenda.\n       The U.S. policy in Sudan does not seek an immediate rebel \n     victory and the fragmenting of Sudan that could follow. \n     Because the splintered rebel groups could not provide a \n     functioning government or civil society at this time, that \n     policy cannot be thrown out wholesale. Yet our failure to \n     separate this policy from the action necessary to save these \n     people from starvation results in absurdity.\n       Thus, even while generously increasing the amount of aid, \n     for political reasons we seek the permission of the ``host \n     government'' in Khartoum to distribute it and feed the very \n     people they are attempting to kill through starvation and \n     war. A second reason for this posture is, presumably, a fear \n     that even modest, calculated food aid would allow the rebels \n     to mobilize instead of foraging for their families--a factor \n     that could turn the outcome on the battlefield in their \n     favor.\n       The prospect of widespread starvation in southern Sudan \n     does not necessitate that the United States seek a quick \n     solution on the battlefield. Military victory and an end to \n     hostilities are not a substitute for food. However, the \n     administration should make an immediate and necessary \n     distinction between the policy principle and the humanitarian \n     challenge. It should articulate a response without political \n     limitations, which, frankly, are trivial in comparison to the \n     human lives at stake, and it should press the United Nations \n     to do the same.\n       We can no longer afford to dance around the issues of \n     sovereignty and political principles while restraining our \n     response to a looming disaster that Khartoum helped create. \n     Such academic debates and diplomatic concerns are for the \n     well fed, but offer no solace to the starving.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the resolution appear in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 267) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 267\n\n       Whereas the National Islamic Front regime in Khartoum, \n     Sudan, continues to wage a brutal war against its own people \n     in southern Sudan;\n       Whereas that war has already caused the death of more than \n     1,500,000 Sudanese since 1983;\n       Whereas famine conditions now threaten areas of southern \n     Sudan as a direct consequence of the concerted and sustained \n     effort by the regime in Khartoum to subdue its southern \n     regions by force and including violations of basic human \n     rights;\n       Whereas famine conditions are exacerbated by diversions of \n     humanitarian assistance by armed parties on all sides of the \n     conflict;\n       Whereas the United Nations World Food Program has now \n     targeted 2,600,000 Sudanese for famine relief aid, to be \n     distributed through an umbrella arrangement called \n     ``Operation Lifeline Sudan'';\n       Whereas the regime in Khartoum retains the ability to deny \n     the relief agencies operating in Operation Lifeline Sudan the \n     clearance to distribute food according to needs in Sudan;\n       Whereas the regime in Khartoum has used humanitarian \n     assistance as a weapon by routinely denying the requests by \n     Operation Lifeline Sudan and its members to distribute food \n     and other crucial items in needy areas of Sudan both within \n     the Khartoum regime's control and areas outside the Khartoum \n     regime's control, including the Nuba Mountains;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development provides famine relief to the people of Sudan \n     primarily through groups operating within Operation Lifeline \n     Sudan and, thus, subjects that relief to the arrangement's \n     associated constraints imposed by the regime in Khartoum;\n       Whereas several relief groups already operate successfully \n     in areas of southern Sudan where Operation Lifeline Sudan has \n     been denied access in the past, thus providing crucial \n     assistance to the distressed population;\n       Whereas it is in the interest of the people of Sudan and \n     the people of the United States, to take proactive and \n     preventative measures to avoid any future famine conditions \n     in southern Sudan;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development, when it pursues assistance programs most \n     effectively, encourages economic self-sufficiency;\n       Whereas assistance activities should serve as integral \n     elements in preventing famine conditions in southern Sudan in \n     the future;\n       Whereas the current international and media attention to \n     the starving populations in southern Sudan and to the causes \n     of the famine conditions that affect them have pushed the \n     regime in Khartoum and the rebel forces to announce a \n     tentative but temporary cease-fire to allow famine relief aid \n     to be more widely distributed; and\n       Whereas the current level of attention weakens the resolve \n     of the regime in Khartoum to manipulate famine relief for its \n     own agenda: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President, acting through the United States Agency \n     for International Development, should--\n       (A) aggressively seek to secure emergency famine relief for \n     the people of Sudan who now face widespread starvation;\n       (B) immediately take appropriate steps to distribute that \n     famine relief to affected areas in Sudan, including the use \n     of relief groups operating outside the umbrella of Operation \n     Lifeline Sudan and without regard to a group's status with \n     respect to Operation Lifeline Sudan; and\n       (C) encourage and assist Operation Lifeline Sudan and the \n     ongoing efforts to develop relief distribution networks for \n     affected areas of Sudan outside of the umbrella and \n     associated constraints of Operation Lifeline Sudan;\n       (2) both bilaterally and within the United Nations, the \n     President should aggressively seek to change the terms by \n     which Operation Lifeline Sudan and other groups are \n     prohibited from providing necessary relief according to the \n     true needs of the people of Sudan;\n\n[[Page S9668]]\n\n       (3) the President, acting through the United States Agency \n     for International Development, should--\n       (A) begin providing development assistance in areas of \n     Sudan not controlled by the regime in Khartoum with the goal \n     of building self-sufficiency and avoiding the same conditions \n     which have created the current crisis, and with the goal of \n     longer-term economic, civil, and democratic development, \n     including the development of rule of law, within the overall \n     framework of United States strategy throughout sub-Saharan \n     Africa; and\n       (B) undertake such efforts without regard to the \n     constraints that now compromise the ability of Operation \n     Lifeline Sudan to distribute famine relief or that could \n     constrain future multilateral relief arrangements;\n       (4) the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development should submit a report to the \n     appropriate congressional committees on the Agency's progress \n     toward meeting these goals; and\n       (5) the policy expressed in this resolution should be \n     implemented without a return to the status quo ante policy \n     after the immediate famine conditions are addressed and \n     international attention has decreased.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President and the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9666-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9668-S9669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    CONVENTION ON COMBATING BRIBERY OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN \n                  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

This shall \n     include:\n       (1) a description of efforts by the United States to amend \n     the Convention to require countries to expand the definition \n     of ``foreign public official,'' so as to make illegal the \n     bribery of:\n       (i) foreign political parties or party officials,\n       (ii) candidates for foreign political office, and\n       (iii) immediate family members of foreign public officials.\n       (2) an assessment of the likelihood of successfully \n     negotiating the amendments set out in paragraph (1), \n     including progress made by the Parties during the most recent \n     annual meeting of the OECD Ministers; and\n       (3) an assessment of the potential for expanding the \n     Convention in the following areas:\n       (i) bribery of foreign public officials as a predicate \n     offense for money laundering legislation;\n       (ii) the role of foreign subsidiaries and offshore centers \n     in bribery transactions; and\n       (iii) private sector corruption and corruption of officials \n     for purposes other than to obtain or retain business.\n       (F) Expanded membership.--a description of U.S. efforts to \n     encourage other non-OECD member to sign, ratify, implement, \n     and enforce the Convention.\n       (G) Classified annex.--a classified annex to the report, \n     listing those foreign corporations or entities the President \n     has credible national security information indicating they \n     are engaging in activities prohibited by the Convention.\n       (2) Mutual legal assistance.--When the United States \n     receives a request for assistance under Article 9 from a \n     country with which it has in force a bilateral treaty for \n     mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, the bilateral \n     treaty will provide the legal basis for responding to that \n     request. In any case of assistance sought from the United \n     States under Article 9, the United States shall, consistent \n     with U.S. laws, relevant treaties and arrangements, deny \n     assistance where granting the assistance sought would \n     prejudice its essential public policy interest,\n\n[[Page S9669]]\n\n     including cases where the Responsible Authority, after \n     consultation with all appropriate intelligence, anti-\n     narcotic, and foreign policy agencies, has specific \n     information that a senior government official who will have \n     access to information to be provided under this Convention is \n     engaged in a felony, including the facilitation of the \n     production or distribution of illegal drugs.\n       (3) Supremacy of the constitution.--Nothing in the \n     Convention requires or authorizes legislation or other action \n     by the United States of America that is prohibited by the \n     Constitution of the United States as interpreted by the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nConvention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in \nInternational Business Transactions, and am pleased that the Senate is \npoised to ratify it today.\n  This convention seeks to establish worldwide standards for the \ncriminalization of the bribery of foreign officials to influence or \nretain business. That this treaty has overwhelming bipartisan support \nis not surprising. But that we have this treaty to consider at all is a \nrather exceptional event.\n  For it was just over 20 years ago that the Congress passed the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. This landmark legislation, \nwhich I am proud to say was sponsored by one of Wisconsin's most \nrespected elected officials, Senator William Proxmire, was enacted \nafter it was discovered that some American companies were keeping slush \nfunds for making questionable and/or illegal payments to foreign \nofficials to help land business deals.\n  For these 20 years, the FCPA has succeeded at curbing U.S. corporate \nbribery of foreign officials by establishing extensive bookkeeping \nrequirements to ensure transparency and by criminalizing the bribery of \nforeign officials.\n  These very important principles do not simply reflect an American \nsense of morality and fair play in business. They also strengthen \nAmerica's trade policy, foster faith in American democracy, and protect \nour interests in requiring an open environment for U.S. investment.\n  Certainly, these are principles and guidelines in everyone's best \ninterest, and as such, well worth promoting worldwide.\n  Yet there has been a price for taking the ethical high road. U.S. \ncompanies that are trying to pursue opportunities in the global \nmarketplace are forced to compete with firms from countries whose \nnational laws take a more--shall we say--``laissez-faire'' approach to \nthis issue, and turn a blind eye to the corruption and graft evident in \nmany business transactions. Some countries--Germany is the most-often \ncited example--even allow companies to take a tax deduction for bribes \npaid to foreign officials as a business expense.\n  I call such practices corporate welfare of the worst kind!\n  These laws and practices by our closest trading partners clearly put \nour businesses at a disadvantage. I have heard from more than one \nWisconsin company about international contracts lost as a result of \nsome non-American company paying a bribe to a foreign official. These \nlost contracts represent lost employment and revenue opportunities for \nmy state, and I am sure for many other states. A 1997 report by the \nTrade Promotion Coordinating Committee estimates that in a single year, \nU.S. firms lost at least 50 international commercial contracts--valued \nat more than $15 billion--as a result of bribes by competitors.\n  But with the signing of the OECD Convention last December, the rest \nof the industrialized world, along with several key lesser developed \ncountries, is finally beginning to follow America's lead. What this \nconvention does is initiate several significant steps to raise the \nstandards of our major trading partners to the level established by the \nFCPA.\n  Specifically, the convention obligates the parties to criminalize \nbribery of foreign public officials in all branches of government. \nIndividuals who bribe public officials will be subject to ``effective, \nproportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties,'' and the parties \nagree to cooperate in investigations and proceedings related to such \ncrimes.\n  I have been keenly interested in anti-corruption efforts for many \nyears. In 1994, I authored a provision to close a loophole in defense \ncontracting by outlawing kickback payments in the conduct of offsets--\nan issue brought to my attention by a major Wisconsin corporation. I \nhave raised the potential problem of corruption in taxpayer-supported \nexport promotion programs to a Wisconsin State trade promotion \ncommission, the Lucey Commission.\n  In 1995, I introduced legislation that would have specifically barred \nthe extension of U.S. export financing and trade promotion to U.S. \nsubsidiaries of foreign corporations which have not adopted and \nenforced a company-wide anti-bribery code. I also introduced a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that bribery is indeed a \nmorally reprehensible business practice and has destabilizing \nconsequences for the international trade environment. Finally, I \noffered an amendment to the 1996 State Department authorization bill \nrequiring an inter-agency study on bribery and corruption and the \nimpact it has on American businesses.\n  I believe the Administration's actions with respect to negotiation of \nthis convention have been consistent with my intent in all of these \nefforts, as well as the intent of the authors of the 1988 amendments to \nthe FCPA. I commend all the individuals involved for their efforts.\n  In addition, I commend the Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nForeign Relations for moving the Committee quickly to recommend \nratification of this convention.\n  I will highlight for my colleagues several provisions in the \nresolution of ratification. Section (c)(1) requires the President to \nsubmit to Congress an annual report that sets out various details \nregarding ratification, relevant domestic legislation of the parties, \nand enforcement. It also requires a description of the future work of \nthe parties to expand the definition of ``foreign public official.'' In \nparticular, the President will need to report on the steps taken by the \nParties to specifically make illegal the bribery of foreign political \nparties or party officials and candidates for public office. This \nprovision reflects the strong views of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations that the pernicious practice of bribery also pervades the \npolitical world, and it too must be stopped.\n  Finally, Section (c)(1)(F) requires the President to provide a \ndescription of U.S. efforts to encourage other non-OECD members to \nsign, ratify, implement, and enforce the treaty. This provision, which \nI encouraged the Committee to include, is important because it \nrecognizes that while most major international companies are based in \nOECD members states--the major industrialized nations of the world--it \nis vitally important to include less developed countries in an \nundertaking of this nature. As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \nnoted at the December 1997 signing ceremony for the Convention, \n``supplier nations have a special responsibility to stop this \ndestructive practice. * * * At the same time, * * * it is vital that \nnations in the developing world meet their responsibility to act.'' As \nnoted in the Committee report, we expect the Executive to work through \nbilateral and multilateral fora to encourage other non-OECD members to \njoin this effort by ratifying the treaty and implementing its \nprovisions.\n  I think those of us that are members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee can help in this effort. For example, at the most recent \nhearing of the Subcommittee on Africa to consider ambassadorial \nnominations, I asked a panel of seven nominees to provide their views \non the effectiveness of the efforts of their respective, prospective \nhost countries' governments to combat corruption, and asked them to \ncomment on how they might work individually with these governments to \nbecome more active in dealing with this issue at a multilateral level. \nThese nominees provided quite thoughtful responses, and I certainly \nencourage all of our ambassadors to pursue similar goals in their \nrespective countries.\n  Mr. President, in sum, I believe this is a vitally important treaty, \nand I am thrilled that the Senate has moved so quickly to ratify it. As \na direct descendent of Senator Proxmire's Foreign Corrupt Practices \nAct, it represents the best of a long Wisconsin tradition of good \ngovernment and ethics, and I am proud to have been a part of the \nSenate's ratification of this effort.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/31/senate-section/article/S9668-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9670]]\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
