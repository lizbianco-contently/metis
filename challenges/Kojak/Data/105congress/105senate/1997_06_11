Madam President, today the State of New Hampshire and a \nnumber of communities in the State of New Hampshire were afforded a \nsingular and appropriate honor. The city of Nashua, my hometown, where \nI was born, raised, and went to school, was rated the best place in \nAmerica in which to live. The city of Manchester and the city of \nPortsmouth were rated the sixth and fifth best places in the country in \nwhich to live. That means the State of New Hampshire, which is a small \nState--and to paraphrase Daniel Webster, a small State but there are \nthose of us who love it--received the designation of having three of \nits major communities within the State identified as the best places to \nlive of the top 10 in the country. In fact, only one other State, \nFlorida, was able to put three communities in the top 10. And, of \ncourse, Florida is about 6 or 7 times the size of New Hampshire in \npopulation.\n  In addition, no other State was able to put two of its communities in \nthe top five, and New Hampshire has the first community and the fifth \ncommunity in Nashua and Portsmouth. Those of us who live in New \nHampshire and have enjoyed the fruits of being part of that wonderful \ncommunity, understand that this is not an award which is received as a \nresult of luck, but it is an award which is received as a result of a \nlot of hard work and, more important, a lot of community spirit. We are \na State where people still care about their neighbors. We are a State \nwhere we care about how we deal with each other. And, as a result, we \nhave built\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\ncommunities where crime is low, where education is extremely strong, \nwhere our health care is rated the best in the country, where our \nmental health care is rated the best in the country, where we are rated \nbest in the country for caring for troubled children, and where we \nstill maintain a State which has no sales or income tax and delivers \neffective and efficient and first-class community services to our \ncitizens.\n  And our citizens get involved. It is a State of voluntarism, a State \nwhere people understand if they are going to make their community work \nwell they have to take the time to be involved in the local community \nactivities whether it is the local Babe Ruth League or baseball team, \nor whether it happens to be the arts community or whether it is just \nthe process of cleaning up the main street on cleanup day.\n  So I rise to congratulate my fellow citizens of New Hampshire, to \nespecially congratulate the cities of Manchester, Portsmouth, and \nNashua, and with a unique emphasis on Nashua in that it was rated No. 1 \nand that it is my hometown, where I was born and raised and went to \nschool, and I am very proud that they have done so well. I congratulate \nall of those who make New Hampshire such a fine place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5485-7", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PAYING OUR UNITED NATIONS ARREARS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wanted to talk a little bit about the \nagreement which we are about to reach, it appears, relative to the \nUnited Nations and how we are going to pay our arrears. I chair the \nCommittee on Commerce, State, and Justice, which has jurisdiction over \nthe appropriations that go to the United Nations. At the behest of the \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, and at the request of the Secretary of \nState, Madeleine Albright, myself and Senator Helms and Senator Grams \nand our staffs have been meeting assiduously with Ambassador \nRichardson's staff, and the staff of Secretary Albright. We have made \nconsiderable progress. In fact, we believe we have reached an agreement \nas to how to handle these arrearages.\n  The basic theme of this agreement is that we are going to ask the \nUnited Nations to be a better place. We are not going to ask them to do \nthings which are unreasonable. We are not going to ask them to do \nthings which are political. We are just going to ask them to do a \nbetter job of handling our money. And to assure that, we are going to \nset certain benchmarks.\n  So, we are going to commit to the United Nations; we are basically \ngoing to give them what amounts to, in my opinion, an irrevocable \nletter of credit that we will pay the arrearages as we see them. The \nnumber that we agreed on I believe is significant, and I believe it \nwill be agreeable to the people at the United Nations But, in exchange \nfor paying those arrearages--and we are going to do it over a period of \ntime--we are going to ask that the United Nations run a better shop, \nthat it be more efficient, that it use those dollars more efficiently \nand that it make sure that it handles those dollars the way American \ntaxpayers expect us to handle the dollars that they pay us. Because for \nevery dollar spent at the United Nations today, 25 cents comes from the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n\n  It is very hard today to go back to the people in New Hampshire, my \ngood people who have just been rated so highly as the great place to \nlive by Money magazine--it is very hard to go back to them and say, \n``Well, we are going to give the United Nations this amount of money \nfor our dues but we are not sure where the money is spent, how it is \nspent, who it is spent on, or whether, when it is spent, it goes to \nwhere they say it is going to go.''\n  To try to correct that, we are asking that the United Nations meet \ncertain very definable, enforceable benchmarks. The Senator from \nMinnesota, who I notice is on the floor, Senator Grams, has been a \nmajor player in defining those benchmarks, and of course the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, has been a force of immense proportions on defining those \nbenchmarks.\n  But agreement appears to have been reached, at least between \nourselves and the administration. It is an agreement which is fair and \nwhich gives the United Nations the dollars which they feel they \ndeserve. But, in exchange for those dollars, it does require that the \nUnited Nations be responsible with the management of those dollars and \nthe management of additional dollars that we will be giving them in the \nforeseeable future. This agreement, I believe, will be included in the \nforeign relations bill, the authorization bill for foreign affairs, \nforeign relations, which is going to be coming through--the State \nDepartment authorization. It will be marked up later this week.\n  I just want to express my appreciation for all the people who worked \nso hard on this. We worked on it for about, I guess, now, almost 4 \nmonths. Fairly aggressive negotiations have occurred. I think it is \ngood we have reached an agreement and it is positive for the process \nand it will immensely improve the operation of the United Nations, \nshould the United Nations decide to go along with proposals that we \nhave made. I presume they will because they are reasonable proposals.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me claim as much time as I may \nconsume of the leader's time and ask unanimous consent I may be \nfollowed by the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If this would help in the deliberations, we have \ntalked to Senator Grams and I plan on restricting my remarks to 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from North Dakota seeking the \ntime that has been designated in the agreement to the minority leader?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, that is what I requested, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will not consume but a fraction of the \n1 hour, and the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, will consume \na very short amount of time. I believe Senator Grams will then be \nrecognized. We had a visit about that and I appreciate the courtesy of \nboth of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5486-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5486-S5488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A VIGIL ON THE DISASTER RELIEF BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, last evening a number of us were here, a \ngood many Senators, as a matter of fact, were here almost all night \nholding a vigil on the issue of the disaster relief bill that seems \nensnarled in, regrettably, politics as usual. We have done the only \nthing we can do, and that is to apply as much consistent pressure as is \npossible to the Congress to say, ``Do the right thing.'' And the right \nthing is to pass disaster relief for victims who have suffered natural \ndisasters, especially the flood victims in the region of Minnesota, \nNorth Dakota, and South Dakota, and get them that aid as soon as is \npossible.\n  I am not here to point fingers or to say that there is this side or \nthat side. For me there is only one side and that is being on the side \nof victims of a natural disaster. I know there are a lot of things \nfloating around here, back and forth, with extraneous amendments and so \non. I am not interested in politics. I am only interested in progress, \nspeaking on behalf of some people who were dealt a very serious blow, \none they did not deserve but one that they now have to try to recover \nfrom, and one they will recover from when we reach out our hand of help \nto say, ``You are not alone. The rest of the country wants to offer you \nsome help.''\n  During this vigil we held last night--my time was from midnight to 3 \nin the morning--I found myself at 2 in the morning talking on a \nnationwide radio talk show with ``The Trucking Bozo,'' I guess his show \nis called. I guess I didn't think, when I came to the Senate, that I \nwould be, at 2 a.m., talking to the ``Trucking Bozo'' on a national \nradio program. But to the extent I had an opportunity to talk to \ntruckers across this country who were hauling America's goods back and \nforth, I am glad I did. I hope they got the message as well, that most \nof us want what is right for this country, and what is right at this \nmoment is for Congress to stop all the extraneous things that are going \non and pass disaster relief.\n  In the middle of all of these discussions, however, with the \n``Trucking\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\nBozo'' and a call-in radio station in New York and Denver and Boston \nand elsewhere across the country, we visited with many victims of the \ndisaster. One of them last evening, among many who shed tears talking \nabout their plight, was a man named Mark. Mark called from Grand Forks, \nND. He has been out of his home now, I guess, for 5 or nearly 6 weeks. \nHe has not seen his children, he said, for close to a month. They are \nwith the grandparents. And his wife, he said, is in the hospital, dying \nof cancer, with a month or month and a half left to live.\n\n  He, at 1 in the morning, was calling me to say, ``Somehow it's unfair \nfor us to be held hostage here. For me, for my family, for our \ncommunity, we desperately need to get the help that is in this bill to \nput our lives back together.''\n  For this person to come, with all of the burdens in his life, to call \nin and urge, once again, the responsible thing be done, it really \nalmost breaks your heart to know that all of these families, many of \nwhom are now separated, some of whom last night said they are living in \ntents in their front yard because their home was destroyed and is \nuninhabitable, others living in camper trailers, others living in \nshelters, others living in neighboring towns with families split, \nhaving lived like that for weeks and now wondering, what about \ntomorrow? What about my home that was destroyed? What about my job, \nit's not there. What about my future and asking us, ``Can't you please \ndo something?''\n  I will not today and will not in the future say that one side is \nwrong and the other side is right. We are better and they are not. That \nis not what this is about. It is about Congress doing what it \nhistorically always has done on a disaster bill. The Congress is a \nunique institution. In a democracy, it is a wonderful institution, and \nI feel privileged every day to wake up and come and serve this country \nin the U.S. Senate. But we have rules, very few of which in the Senate \nprevent us from adding things to other bills. On almost any occasion, \nany day, any way, someone brings a bill to the floor of the Senate and \nsomeone adds an amendment that is totally extraneous--and they do it on \nall sides of the political aisle, and I understand that--but, generally \nspeaking, on disaster bills, that has not been the case. Why? Because \ndisaster relief bills are different. They represent an emergency \nresponse to people in need.\n  This got caught up in some of those issues, and I say let's decide \ntoday to stop that. Let's take all of these extraneous issues off, pass \nthis bill, get the President to sign it and get help to the people who \ndesperately need it. I know, because I come from North Dakota and \nbecause that was perhaps the hardest hit area--North Dakota, Minnesota, \nSouth Dakota--in these disasters, that I have a very parochial interest \nin this. But I am telling you, if every Member of the Senate could \nvisit with our constituents in our region and walk away not having a \nbroken heart from what those people face and not have a feeling of \nenormous responsibility to help them in any way possible on an urgent \nbasis, to help them right now to put their lives together, there isn't \none Member of this body who can resist this.\n  The Senators from Minnesota, Senator Grams and Senator Wellstone, the \nSenators from South Dakota, Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson, and \nthe Senators from North Dakota, Senator Conrad and myself, all of us \nworked very hard to put the disaster package together. We had great \ncooperation from all sides of the political aisle in the Senate.\n  I want to close with this point. While I am enormously gratified by \nthe cooperation we have had and feel gratified with the work we did \ntogether, when those who now talk about scaling down this bill also \ntalk about maybe diminishing the amount of disaster aid we have already \nagreed to and fought so hard to get, I say to them, that is not a way \nto solve that problem this afternoon or tomorrow, by scaling back the \ndisaster aid those folks are waiting for. Let's instead scale back the \nextraneous provisions, scale back and eliminate the unrelated \namendments, get rid of them and get on with the business of this \nCongress to pass a disaster bill, have the President sign it and say to \nMark, whose wife is in the hospital and whose children are living with \ngrandparents, that we care about you, we want to help you and we want \nto help you and thousands and thousands of others like you who this \nmorning didn't wake up in their homes because they are destroyed; we \nwant to help you make your lives whole again.\n  That is part of the culture of this country. It is the best instincts \nof America to reach out and say, ``You're not alone, the rest of the \nAmerican people are with you and want to help you in this time of \ncrisis.''\n  Let's try to do that today. This Congress can pass this bill today, \nand I intend to make a unanimous-consent request again to do that, as I \ndid yesterday and the day before. I shall not do that at this moment. \nIf we do it today, the President could sign it tonight and the aid \nwould begin flowing tomorrow, and we would have helped many Americans \nget back on their feet.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I shall be brief \ntoday. Let me just build on the comments of my colleague from North \nDakota.\n  It is my fervent hope, and it is not an exaggeration to say prayer, \nthat when I go home this weekend, back to Minnesota, I will be able to \nsay to people, ``Congress has acted, and we have passed a disaster \nrelief bill that will provide you with help so that you can begin the \nprocess of rebuilding your lives.'' That is what people are asking for. \nNo more than that. All of us, if we had been flooded out or if we had \nbeen faced with some kind of disaster like this, would also be hoping \nto get the same kind of help.\n\n  Madam President, I, too, last night had a chance to talk to people \naround the country on radio and television and whatnot. I think that \nthe goal of yesterday and today, because the Senate is not going to \nreally be back conducting business as usual until we get this disaster \nrelief bill passed--that is our commitment, that is how we fight for \npeople in our States--but I think really the goal is to just press and \npress and press and keep fighting for people, but more with the focus \non what we can do as opposed to finger pointing and getting personal.\n  I have talked to enough Republican colleagues on the majority side \nwho, I believe, even if we don't agree on every issue, want to come \ntogether, and I hope it will happen. I think it should happen this \nweek.\n  I think that this particular form of gridlock is not working well for \nthis Congress, and I don't think people around the country understand \nhow it can be that on a bill which is to provide emergency assistance \nto people, you get all sorts of other measures dealing with how the \nCensus Bureau does its work or dealing with debates about \nappropriations bills and the budget and all the rest. I think most \npeople believe that when it comes to disaster relief, you should try \nand get it to people and keep off the extraneous measures that are so \ncontroversial.\n  There are a lot of good people here on both sides of the aisle. I was \nasked last night many, many times, especially from Minnesota, ``Do you \nthink there is going to be some agreement?'' And I said, ``I cannot \nbelieve there won't be.''\n  I just think it is going to happen. It has to happen.\n  The only appeal I would make to my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle is that if, in fact, we are going to be talking about scaling \nback the disaster relief, I worry about it because we had a very clear \ndefinition of what it would take by way of emergency assistance--and I \nuse those words carefully--to help people get back on their own two \nfeet. This was really a good bipartisan effort. That is what we had. I \nreally hope that my colleagues will understand that we are speaking and \nwe are fighting and we are using our leverage as Senators in order to \nget the help to people back in our States. We are going to continue to \ndo that until we, in fact, are able to get the job done.\n  So my appeal to my colleagues is: Let's have an agreement; take the \nextraneous provisions off this bill. We can debate them separately. We \ncan have an up-or-down vote, or if there is some alternative proposal \nthat people have, great. Let's just try and get the\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\nhelp to people, and let's not delay it any further.\n  I was asked by somebody back in Minnesota whether I really liked last \nnight. I was on the first shift. I said, ``Actually, not so much so. I \nwould rather be doing it on the floor of the Senate. I would rather be \nin a markup in committee. But I, as a Senator, will do everything I can \nto fight hard for people in Minnesota.''\n  I think from talking to colleagues in the majority party, we are \ngoing to reach agreement. I believe that, I say to my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Grams. There has to be an agreement. That is what we \nhave. We have to make that happen so all of us can go back to our \nStates and say to people, ``We wish this had not been delayed and \ndelayed and delayed, but now, finally, a good bill is passed and we are \ngoing to get the help to you.'' That is the goal, that should be the \nresult, and I hope that that happens this week. That is my appeal to my \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5486-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5488-S5489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DISASTER RELIEF AND PREVENTING A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, we have asked to set aside a little time \nthis morning to talk about the issue the Senator from Minnesota talks \nabout. Each of us wants to find a way to get help to people who need it \nas a result of the disaster. I think there are a number of issues \ninvolved. I believe as we move toward a solution, it is useful to talk \nabout those things.\n  Certainly, there are legitimate concerns on both sides of this bill. \nI am satisfied that our leadership is now putting together something \nthat will be presented, hopefully that will be acceptable.\n  I think it is well to recognize that we want to get this disaster aid \nout, but there are certain things that are very important, as in any \ndiscussion, to both sides. One of them is to get something in that \navoids the human disaster that might well happen in the future if we \nhad another shutdown of the Government. So this can be one of those \nthings.\n  There also has to be an understanding, of course, on an issue of \nwhere there are different points of view that both sides have to be \nwilling to make some accommodation. The idea that somehow you can't do \nanything unless the President approves is not the system we have here. \nWe have a divided Government. We have the President with authority to \ndo what he does and the Congress with the authority to do what they do. \nWhen they come to a conflict, there has to be some movement and not \nsimply a pronouncement that the President doesn't like that and, \ntherefore, it won't happen. That is not the way it works.\n  So, Madam President, we would like to talk a little bit about that. I \nam joined by my colleagues. I yield first to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank my colleague from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I was very disappointed by President \nClinton's veto of the emergency aid bill, which provided some $5.5 \nbillion in disaster relief nationwide, with a major portion of those \ndollars dedicated to helping to rebuild the flood-ravaged communities \nof my home State of Minnesota and also in the Dakotas.\n  Having been with the President in seeing firsthand the damage and the \ndespair that was caused by the flooding, I cannot believe that he was \nwilling to reject our legislation to help support the people of \nMinnesota and the Dakotas as they rebuild their homes, communities, and \ntheir lives in the wake of the flood.\n  Our legislation sent a very clear message that the people of \nMinnesota have not been forgotten by Congress during this critical \ntime, but the President's veto suggests, however, that some in \nWashington need to have their memories refreshed.\n  I am particularly disturbed by the fact that the President used as \nhis primary excuse for vetoing the emergency flood relief bill our \ninclusion of a measure to protect flood victims in Minnesota and \nAmericans everywhere from a potential Government shutdown later this \nyear.\n  For reasons I have repeated on this floor many times, I believe that \ndelivering emergency aid to flood victims and keeping the Government \nopen for business during the rebuilding process must be our twin goals \nat this time.\n  Just as the emergency flood relief serves as an assurance to \nMinnesotans that their urgent needs will be met, our efforts to keep \nthe Government from shutting down will also give them a guarantee that \nany budget squabbles that happen to pop up here in Washington will not \naffect our long-term efforts to help rebuild our State. And that is an \nassurance we can't afford to go without.\n  By vetoing our flood relief bill, the President indicated that having \na leg up in this year's budget debate is higher on his priority list \nthan delivering flood assistance to those who need it. That was wrong, \nbut, as we know, it cannot be changed. The people of Minnesota and the \nDakotas already know how well Washington politicians can talk, and they \ndon't want any more talk; they want some action.\n  Stopping our work in the Senate and blocking us from taking action on \nanything accomplishes nothing. Positive, constructive action is what \nthe Senate should be working on to deliver. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in working to ensure that flood relief gets out \nof Washington and that it gets into the hands of the people of \nMinnesota and the Dakotas as quickly as possible.\n  Immediately after the veto was announced, I wrote letters to Senate \nMajority Leader Trent Lott and also Minority Leader Tom Daschle. In \nthat letter, I proposed a compromise I believe will help speed up the \nenactment of the disaster relief legislation, while at the same time \nallowing Congress a separate vote, without any unnecessary delays, on \nthe Government Shutdown Prevention Act. In my letters to Senators Lott \nand Daschle, I proposed that they consider removing the Government \nshutdown provision from the emergency aid legislation with a specific \ntime agreement for debating and voting on the two issues in separate \npieces of legislation.\n  That would allow the Senate to debate and pass both the emergency \nflood relief bill and the Government Shutdown Prevention Act on their \nindividual merits, away from the political haggling that has delayed \naction on these important bills.\n  I was encouraged yesterday to learn of the support for my proposal by \nVice President Al Gore and Senate Minority Leader Daschle. Their \nannouncement of support clearly shows that there is room for \nnegotiations to reconcile our differences and to deliver the flood \nassistance to Minnesota and the Dakotas.\n  I have also been in negotiations with the majority leader, who \nexpressed his intention to consider a number of different alternatives, \nincluding mine, on how best to move ahead and deliver flood relief.\n  I am going to continue to work closely with both Senators Lott and \nDaschle, as well as my other colleagues in the Senate, to expedite this \nprocess. From the events of the last 2 days, I am optimistic that the \ntwo sides are closer to a reasonable settlement than anyone in the \nmedia may be suggesting.\n  Now we must take action to bridge the gap and ensure the delivery of \nemergency disaster relief and the continued protection of the American \npeople from a Government shutdown.\n  At the very least, my proposal has opened the negotiation process to \nmove ahead on these important issues post-veto. Again, while I am \ndisappointed that the President chose to veto emergency flood relief, I \nhope that he will not shut the present window of opportunity to try to \nwork together to find some common ground.\n  Certainly, my constituents in Minnesota, who have already suffered so \nmuch at the hands of the flood, cannot afford inaction.\n  As flood victims in Minnesota begin rebuilding their homes, their \nneighborhoods, their businesses, and their lives in the wake of the \nflood, they need our assurance that the Federal Government will deliver \nthe aid that it promised.\n  Flood victims also need to know that the Government will be there \nthroughout the year to meet their urgent needs as their rebuilding \nprogresses.\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\n  Our efforts to keep the Government open for business will also help \ngive Minnesotans a guarantee that budget squabbles in Washington will \nnot affect the long-term efforts to rebuild our communities.\n  Now, I know we may have reached a budget agreement in overall numbers \nand terms, but a lot of the debate will continue. And there is still \nthe possibility of an agreement not being reached on every part of that \nbudget this fall which could lead to a possible Government shutdown. It \nhas happened before; it could happen again.\n  In light of that, we want to provide assurances to these victims of \nthe flood this spring in Minnesota and the Dakotas that they would not \ncome up short this fall, they would not face a stop in the work that \nthey are trying to do in rebuilding their lives.\n  Under my compromise proposal, checks would continue to go out and \ncontracts would be honored this year--in spite of what happens in \nWashington. And that is an assurance we cannot afford to go without.\n  In announcing the President's veto, the White House spokesman said \nthat ``Americans in need should not have to endure further delay.'' I \ncould not agree more with that statement.\n  The people of Minnesota and the Dakotas cannot afford for \nWashington's budget politics to stand in the way of the rebuilding that \nhas already begun. Now that we have a starting point, let us move ahead \nand pass the emergency disaster relief we promised. And let us do it as \nquickly as we can.\n\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I feel I need to respond to \nthe statement about the President's action. The President did not \ninclude unrelated items in a disaster bill. It is not his fault that we \nare in this circumstance. It is the fault of those who decided to put \nunrelated items into a disaster relief bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5488-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5489-S5490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE DELAY IN DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I represent the State of North Dakota. And \nour State has been absolutely devastated. We have people, thousands of \npeople, who are still sleeping on cots 54 days after the disaster \noccurred. Fifty-four days after the dikes broke, we still have \nthousands of people on cots, people living in cars, people whose homes \nand businesses have been devastated. And they cannot understand why \nCongress fails to act.\n  Mr. President, last night we had a linkup via computer with people \nwho are the leaders of the Grand Forks community--the mayors of Grand \nForks and East Grand Forks, the leaders of the business community, the \nhead of the chamber of commerce, leaders of other parts of the Grand \nForks community, people from the medical school. And their message was \nclear and unencumbered. They have asked Congress to send a clean \ndisaster relief bill to the President without unrelated measures, and \nto do it now. That is their request.\n  The message was powerful and compelling. People who have had \neverything lost, people who evacuated their homes at 1 o'clock in the \nmorning and who have not returned since, a city of 50,000, 95 percent \nof whom were evacuated, with 80 percent of the homes in that community \ndevastated. That is the reality that we are living with.\n  Mr. President, this chart says it, and says it clearly: Disaster \nVictims Held Hostage, Day 20. This is just since this Congress took the \nMemorial Day break without acting. Twenty days of inaction after a bill \nto provide disaster relief was completely agreed to.\n  The disaster provisions were agreed to by Democrats, by Republicans, \nand by the President. It is these unrelated measures that were stuck \ninto this disaster relief bill that have hung things up. The people \nthat I represent say, ``Take them out. Quit playing politics with the \nlives of people. Quit holding hostage thousands of people to a \npolitical agenda. Get the disaster relief where it's needed, and get it \nthere now.''\n  Mr. President, this is a sign that a resident of Grand Forks put out \non their lawn after Congress decided to take a break without passing \ndisaster relief. It says, ``Hey, Congress! Spend your break here!'' And \nhere is some of the refuse from the disaster in their front yard. You \ncan see the garbage bags piled up as people try to rebuild their lives.\n  I have a series of photos here that try to bring this back to what \nthis is really about. It is not about how we take the census in the \nyear 2000. It is not about some budget dispute. This is about people \nwho have been devastated and need help.\n  This is a picture from Grand Forks. This is the downtown area that \nnot only had a 500-year flood, but had a fire that devastated three \nentire city blocks. Here is some of the refuse that remains from that \ndisaster.\n  Go to another picture that shows what is happening in terms of Grand \nForks, ND. Here is a downtown area, one of the buildings that burned up \nin the fire, all the rubble that is there. It is staggering. You go \nthrough the city of Grand Forks, it looks like a giant junkyard.\n  Here is what you see as you go up and down every street in \nresidential Grand Forks--every street, because 80 percent of the homes \nwere damaged in this town. This is what you see on every boulevard. All \nof the contents of these homes, the washers, the dryers, the carpeting, \nthe furniture is not in the home, it is out here on the street because \nit has all been destroyed. And these people are asking for one thing, a \nchance to get their lives back in order.\n  They have had the worst winter in our history followed by the most \npowerful winter storm in 50 years that destroyed the electrical grid \nthat served 80,000 people. They were without power for nearly 10 days, \nin the midst of 40-degree below weather, and then they get hit by the \n500-year flood, and then by the worst fire in our State's history. Now \nthey are hit by a disaster of a Congress that fails to act.\n  Never before in the face of a disaster have we diddled for as long as \nwe have diddled on this disaster. People are asking for help. And this \nis the condition of their lives.\n  This is a picture of the business district. It is not just the homes, \nbut it is the businesses that have been destroyed.\n  I ask my colleagues, if you were in this circumstance wouldn't you \nexpect this body to act, wouldn't you expect a response, wouldn't you \nexpect some help?\n\n  This is another picture of what people are going through each and \nevery day now in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks--piles of garbage. \nThis water is not just rainwater, this is water that is putrid. You fly \nover it, and it stinks because it is filled with every imaginable awful \nthing. And every home and every business is just destroyed. All of the \nthings that are in there have to go.\n  This is again a picture of what is outside one of the commercial \nbuildings, and a tremendous amount of destruction. We are going to take \nyears to rebuild. We do not have much time.\n  We have a short construction season in our part of the country. By \nOctober 15 outdoor work will have to be completed. So we do not have \ntime for political games to be played here in Washington.\n  Let me again repeat the message from the people that I represent. \n``Please, Congress, pass a disaster relief bill without these unrelated \nmeasures so the aid can start to flow.''\n  Some have said, ``Well, nothing is being held up. There's money in \nthe pipeline.'' Last night we heard from the people of Grand Forks. And \nwhat they said was very clear. There is not money in the pipeline. \nThere is concrete in the pipeline, because the money is not getting \nthrough. There is no money for the buyouts and relocation of the homes \nand businesses that have been destroyed. There is no money in that \npipeline. There is no money in the pipeline to help the ranchers who \nhave lost hundreds of thousands of head of livestock. There is no money \nin that pipeline. There is no money in the pipeline for the school \ndistricts that have taken the kids from the disaster areas. There is no \nmoney in that pipeline.\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\n  The Governor of South Dakota, Republican by the way, said: On a \ndisaster bill you ought to deal with disasters. He said: For those who \nsay nothing is getting hung up, that's just wrong. And not just he said \nit, a Republican Congressmen from Minnesota, Jim Ramstad, said: Those \nwho say there's money in the pipeline are being disingenuous at best. \nThere is no money for housing. There is no money for buyouts and \nrelocations of the homes and businesses that have been destroyed. There \nis no money for sewage systems. There is no money for roads. There is \nno money for a whole series of things that desperately need resources.\n  This is the Republican Governor of South Dakota. He said, ``If you've \ngot a disaster bill, you ought to deal with a disaster.'' He was \ncomplaining about the congressional leaders here for sticking \ncontroversial measures in a disaster relief bill. And he has it exactly \nright. For those who say nothing is being hung up, `` * * * Janklow \nsaid the delay in the legislation is blocking reconstruction of sewage \nfacilities, highways and a State-owned rail line in South Dakota.''\n  Mr. President, this is how the flood victims feel.\n  This is from the largest newspaper in our State. The headline is very \nclear: ``You are playing with our lives.'' Let me just read what this \ndisaster victim said:\n\n       Ranee Steffan has strong words for members of Congress who \n     think flood victims can wait while bickering continues in \n     Washington . . .\n       ``You are playing with our lives'' . . . [she was speaking] \n     from the sweltering travel trailer she and her family now \n     call home. ``This isn't some game. . . . [She said] You \n     should come here and walk in my shoes for a day.''\n       Homeless for a month, out of work and bounced from one \n     temporary shelter to another, the wife and mother of two is \n     fed up with lawmakers who she believes think[s] Grand Forks \n     residents are ``getting along just fine.''\n\n  They are not getting along just fine. We had one of our colleagues \nsay, ``Well, we can send you a bunch of trailers.''\n  People in North Dakota do not see trailers as a long-term answer to \ntheir housing needs. Frankly, trailers in a North Dakota winter are not \na very acceptable form of housing. We need to rebuild housing, housing \nthat can withstand a North Dakota winter. We do not need a bunch of \ntrailers sent to our part of the country. That is not the answer to \nwhat we face.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about what is happening and what is not \nhappening, what people out there are asking for, what they are not \nasking for. How about hearing from the people out there. How about \nlistening to them.\n  This is the mayor of Grand Forks in a letter to Senators Lott and \nDaschle, this courageous mayor who has become, I think, an inspiration \nto the country because, in the face of adversity, she has provided \nextraordinary leadership. Let me just make clear she is not a partisan. \nTo my knowledge she is not a member of either political party. I have \nno idea what her political identification is. She has always said she \nis an independent, that her husband is a Republican. That is as much as \nanybody knows about her legal affiliation.\n  Here is what she says:\n\n       I urge you to strip all of the controversial amendments \n     from the disaster aid bill and send the humanitarian \n     emergency provisions of the bill to the President for his \n     signature.\n\n  That is what she says. She continues:\n\n       We are grateful for the emergency aid provisions included \n     in this bill. These provisions, especially funds for the \n     Community Development Block Grant program, will be essential \n     for Grand Forks to be able to recover and rebuild. North \n     Dakota's short construction season dictates that we must take \n     action quickly to rebuild and relocate homes away from the \n     floodplain.\n       But the political fight over provisions unrelated to \n     disaster relief have stalled this bill and delayed the \n     recovery process for Grand Forks and other cities in the Red \n     River Valley. This disaster aid is needed now. We are simply \n     unable to make decisions about how and if we will be able to \n     rebuild our city without knowing the extent of Federal \n     resources available. We need funds now for housing, for buy-\n     outs and relocation and homes of businesses, for roads and \n     bridges, for school districts and many more urgent needs. \n     With each passing day thousands of residents of Grand Forks \n     and other communities are unable to get on with their lives \n     and are forced to live in shelters, in government-issued \n     trailers, or with relatives.\n       Again, thank you for the emergency provisions included in \n     the disaster aid bill. I urge you to strip the controversial, \n     non-disaster related measures from the disaster bill and send \n     the humanitarian emergency provisions to the President for \n     his signature.\n\n  This was the elected leader of the city of Grand Forks.\n  Last night, we heard that identical message from the head of the \nchamber of commerce, from other leaders of the business community, from \npeople from all walks of life, a member of the police department, a \nmember of the city works department, all of them talking to people \nacross the country via satellite as they told their story, what has \nhappened in their community, and what they are asking for now.\n  It has been 83 days since the President asked for disaster \nlegislation. It has been 53 days since the dikes broke. It has now been \n20 days--20 days--since Congress agreed to a disaster package but left \ntown without enacting it before the Memorial Day recess.\n  Let me just read part of a letter from one of my constituents: ``The \npeople here have no homes, no jobs, and no other homes to go to. They \nhave no toys, no bikes, no clothes, or anything else for their \nchildren, and you go home for a break. What are you thinking of?''\n  That is a sample of the literally hundreds of letters that we have \ngotten from the disaster area.\n  This is a letter from another constituent:\n\n       Perhaps you should visit here and see and feel the pain and \n     devastation. Spend 3 days here, and you will soon understand \n     why people are depressed and the anxiety level is extreme. We \n     are stressed out.\n       Also, I am sure that if this disaster had hit your \n     district, you would want to pass the legislation with a sense \n     of urgency. That's all we expect.\n       What this means to me and my family: Relief from the flood \n     of the century. It brought flood waters into our community, \n     our house and six rental properties I own and manage. Indeed, \n     the amount of damage I have sustained is mind boggling. I'm \n     on the brink.\n       We urge you to pass the disaster relief bill today. Please \n     don't delay another day. We can't wait.\n\n  I have hundreds, if not thousands, of letters like this from people \nout there who are asking their Government to respond. These people are \nproud people. They are independent people. They are hard-working \npeople. But they have been hit with a series of disasters unprecedented \nin our State's history.\n  The worst winter ever, followed by the most powerful winter storm in \n50 years, followed by a 500-year flood, followed by a fire in the midst \nof flood that destroyed much of the town of Grand Forks, a city of \n50,000 people that had 95 percent of that town evacuated. That has \nnever happened in America's history, a town of that size completely \nevacuated. The town right across the river, East Grand Forks, in \nMinnesota, a city of 9,000, was entirely evacuated. We are not going to \nbe able to rebuild much of these towns. Many of these homes are just \nabsolutely destroyed. Those homes need to be torn down. They represent \na health hazard. The businesses, too, need to be torn down. We need to \nmove back from the river to a more defensible location, but that cannot \nhappen until and unless this Congress acts.\n\n  I just conclude by saying when the shoe is on the other foot--and I \nhave been in the Senate 10 years--we were ready to help. We never \ndelayed anybody's disaster bill ever. I never even thought of adding \ncontroversial provisions to a disaster bill that someone else needed. I \njust ask our colleagues to give us the same chance and extend the same \nrespect to our constituents. They desperately need help and they need \nit now.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I claim the time we had to talk about how \nto get this job done. We have talked for some time about the need. Now \nthe question is, how do we now find a vehicle to get that done? That is \nwhat we ought to be spending our time talking about.\n  Let me yield to my friend, the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding.\n  In my view, we have had a longstanding problem in the Congress with \nemergency appropriations, supplemental appropriations, or so-called \ndisaster bills. The problem has been--and truly there has been a \ndisaster such as in North Dakota and Minnesota with the Red River \nflooding, and that is legitimate. But then built on top of that is a \nlot of spending that has nothing to do with the emergency nature of \nthis piece of legislation.\n  I went on ahead and supported this supplemental appropriations bill \neven though I had some concerns about the amount of spending that was \nin the bill. In my view, the truly emergency provisions that are in \nthere run in the dollar range from $2.5 to $4 billion. The bill is an \n$8.6 billion bill.\n  The only thing that made me go ahead and support this particular \npiece of legislation is a provision in there that said that we would \nnot shut down the Federal Government. I felt it was an appropriate \nbill. I did not particularly like all the spending that was in there, \nbut I wanted to get something moving ahead so that we could take care \nof the needs of the people in North Dakota and Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that the President chose to put \npolitics ahead of people. I kept this need to take care of those people \nin mind, even though I was not entirely happy with the bill. I am \ndisappointed he took such a narrow view. By vetoing the 1997 \nsupplemental appropriations and rescissions bill, he has actually \ndelayed its progress after the Congress has moved ahead. This bill \nwould have provided funding for future disaster relief needs and \nensured that we would not face a disaster of another Government \nshutdown.\n  Now, the majority was accused by the minority of being ``hard headed \nand cold hearted'' for not submitting the bill to the President sooner. \nI cannot imagine how outraged they must be now that the President has \nvetoed the bill. I hope that those who promised to tie up the Senate \nuntil this bill is passed are now willing to fight just as hard to \noverride this veto, thereby providing funding for disaster relief and \nensuring that there will not be another Government shutdown.\n  Let's be clear, this bill is not about holding up money for the flood \nvictims, as some have suggested. Flood victims are currently receiving \ndisaster relief from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. To \ndate, FEMA has already allocated over $150 million to victims of the \nflood. Almost $40 million in housing assistance checks have been issued \nto more than 21,000 flood victims. In addition, the Small Business \nAdministration has approved more than $75 million in disaster loans.\n  In short, the flood victims are being cared for. This bill \nreplenishes funds for FEMA and ensures stability for future disaster \nfunding.\n  Just as importantly, this bill is about preventing another disaster, \nthe manmade disaster of a Government shutdown. This seems to be nothing \nmore than a political move by the President designed to ensure that he \ncan shut down the Government again, just as he did before when we were \ntrying to balance the budget.\n  This is the same strategy we have seen from the President before. He \nimpedes, stalls, and ultimately vetoes any compromise we reach, playing \npolitical games with public safety, and the productivity of our Federal \nemployees. He then tries to get political mileage out of it by blaming \nthe majority in Congress. When an agreement is finally reached, I have \nno doubt he will take credit for that, too.\n  I find it ironic that the President said during his State of the \nUnion Address that the Federal Government should never be shut down \nagain.\n  Why, then, does he now veto a bill that does exactly that: Ensure \nthat the Government won't be shut down again? The continuing resolution \nportion of this bill has ensured that Congress and the President will \nbe allowed to continue budget negotiations in good faith without \nharming the taxpayers or Federal employees and their families.\n  The President needs to put partisan politics aside and focus on what \nis good for our country.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5490-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5491-S5493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MFN STATUS FOR CHINA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, over the Memorial Day recess, I made a \nweek-long trip to East Asia. This included stops in Seoul, South Korea; \nPyongyang, North Korea; Beijing, China; Hong Kong, as well as Misawa \nAir Force Base in Japan. I spent most of my time on the three issues of \nmost immediate concern to us in northeast Asia this year. First, food \nand security problems on the Korean Peninsula; second, the negotiations \nover China's entry into the World Trade Organization; and third, Hong \nKong's transition to Chinese sovereignty, now less than 3 weeks away.\n  I also discussed longer term issues, including environmental \nprotection, human rights, and United States-China security relations. \nThese are complex subjects, with great implications for our national \ninterest in all sorts of areas. With respect to the three immediate \nissues, I think our basic strategies are well conceived, and we have \ngood people in the military and the Foreign Service working on them. I \nam in the process of drafting a trip report that will address them in \nmuch more detail.\n  But we in Congress must first take up a different issue; that is, \nwhether to support the President's decision to renew China's MFN \nstatus. So I will return to the floor in coming days to discuss the \nbasic security, trade, environmental, and humanitarian issues we face \nin China and in East Asia generally. But today I will concentrate on \nMFN status--why it is legally right; why it is morally right, and why, \ngiven our compelling interest in issues like security in Korea, more \nfair and reciprocal trade with China, and a smooth transition for Hong \nKong, it is right for our national interest.\n\n\n                             Legally Right\n\n  First, renewal of MFN status is right under our law. The Jackson-\nVanik law, which has governed renewal of MFN status for nonmarket \neconomies since 1974, is the main law in place. It conditions MFN on \ntwo things: the existence of a bilateral commercial agreement, and \nfreedom of emigration. Under the law, the President's choice is clear. \nWe have a bilateral trade agreement signed with China in 1980, and \nChina allows free emigration. Therefore, as a legal matter, the \nPresident was right to renew MFN and we should back him up.\n\n\n                             Morally Right\n\n  Second, renewing MFN status is morally right. At times, people in \nWashington are tempted to see a vote to revoke MFN as something which \nmight promote human rights in China. This is a fine sentiment. People \nwho advocate revoking MFN status to promote human rights are very well \nintentioned. But the effects of revoking MFN would be the opposite of \nwhat they intend.\n  To revoke MFN status, very simply, is to raise tariffs from Uruguay \nround to Smoot-Hawley levels. To take one example, that means raising \ntariffs on toys and stuffed animals from zero to 70 percent overnight, \nagain, automatically, from zero to 70 percent tariff overnight. That \nhits one of China's major exports to the United States, at about 6 \nbillion dollars' worth last year. And who makes them? On the whole, \nit's young Chinese working people trying to improve their lives.\n  What would happen if we revoke MFN status? The result should be \nobvious. Millions of innocent Chinese workers in toy factories and in \nother walks of life would lose their jobs. The Chinese Government would \ncertainly be hurt, but it would still be there the next day. But the \nlives of these workers would be ruined. So, far from improving human \nrights, revoking China's MFN status would cause immense human suffering \nin China.\n  Of course, that would discredit our human rights efforts with the \nChinese\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\npublic. No rational person can expect anyone in China to thank us for \nharming their economy and inflicting misery on them, their families, or \ntheir fellow citizens.\n  By contrast, if human rights is our motivation, MFN is an \nirreplaceable part of an effective policy. As the Democracy Wall \nactivist Wang Xizhe--until recently, a political prisoner--says:\n\n       The goal of exerting effective, long-term influence over \n     China can only be achieved by maintaining the broadest \n     possible contacts with China, on the foundation of MFN, thus \n     causing China to enter further into the global family and to \n     accept globally practiced standards of behavior.\n\n  A long-term policy may emotionally be hard to accept. There are real \nhuman rights problems in China: About 3,000 political prisoners remain \nin jail, strict limits on freedom of assembly exist, very severe \npolicies in Tibet. We would like to solve them all in a day, but the \nfact is, that won't happen. Only by staying the course, staying \ninvolved through trade and human exchange, as well as diplomacy, can we \nhope to make a difference.\n\n\n                    Right for the National Interest\n\n  Finally, we are Americans first, and we are responsible to the \nAmerican public on our policy decisions. And renewing MFN status is \nright for our own national interest.\n  Security issues are an example. I can say from firsthand experience \nthat we have a very complex, very dangerous situation at hand in the \nKorean Peninsula.\n  North Korea is a politically isolated government, with very severe \nfood and economic problems, and a large and well-armed military \nmachine. We have a commitment to joint defense of South Korea, we \nAmericans and the South Koreans, and we have 37,000 men and women \npermanently on the line just a few miles south of the DMZ. We owe it to \nthem to pursue a very serious, responsible policy that can keep the \npeace and ensure a swift victory if, God forbid, there is any conflict. \nAnd Chinese cooperation is absolutely essential to that. Deliberately \nantagonizing the Chinese Government and armed forces by revoking MFN \nwill not help at all.\n  We are also responsible to our own people to make trade with China \nmore fair, more reciprocal, and more beneficial to our country. We have \nan opportunity to do that this year by bringing China into the World \nTrade Organization on a commercially acceptable basis. Cutting off MFN \nstatus would put us on the opposite track: it would balance trade at \nclose to zero, cutting off jobs and prosperity here as well as in \nChina.\n  As we look into the next century, we must work to slow global \nwarming, ocean pollution, and the loss of biodiversity. To take just \none statistic, in the next 20 years, world greenhouse emissions will \ngrow from 6 to 9 trillion tons a year. Fully 1 trillion of the \nadditional 3 trillion tons will come from China. That is, one-third of \nall greenhouse gas emissions in the next 20 years, if nothing is done, \nwill come from China.\n  We have a chance now to moderate that trend. And a political crisis \ncaused by revoking MFN would make that mutually beneficial effort very \ndifficult.\n\n\n                    Views of Our Friends and Allies\n\n  Our own common sense should tell us that China is a key player on all \nthese issues. Wantonly picking a fight with the world's largest country \nby revoking MFN status, when only 6 countries in the world lack MFN \nstatus and 151 countries actually get tariff rates better than MFN, \nwould be foolish.\n  And our allies tell us the same thing. During my trip last month, I \nmet top national security officials in the South Korean Government. I \nspoke with senior officers of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. And I \nmet with Chinese dissidents and democratic political leaders in Hong \nKong.\n  These are our friends, our strategic allies, people we work with \nevery day, people who wish us well. Not a single one of them supported \nrevoking MFN status. To the contrary, they all felt that a good \nrelationship between the United States and China is crucial.\n  The right course to take, therefore, is very clear. From Korea to \nhuman rights to global warming to Hong Kong and Taiwan and trade, we \nhave very serious issues to discuss with the Chinese. And the annual \nMFN debate is an artificial, unnecessary crisis that makes results on \nall of them more difficult.\n  So we should not debate this question into the misty and indefinite \nfuture. Instead, we should back up the President this year, renew \nChina's MFN status, and when China faces up to its WTO \nresponsibilities, then make MFN permanent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an acknowledgement on the \nEast Asia trip be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Senator Max Baucus--Acknowledgments on East Asia Trip\n\n       Mr. President, we in Congress oversee the work of \n     government. It's our responsibility to eliminate waste. Fix \n     what's broken. Find what's wrong. That's an essential part of \n     the job. But every once in a while, we ought to stop and \n     remind ourselves what's right. And today I'd like to take a \n     few minutes to do that.\n       I recently returned from a week-long trip to South Korea, \n     North Korea, Beijing and Hong Kong, with a brief stop at \n     Misawa Air Force Base in Japan as well, on official business \n     for the Finance Committee.\n       In the future I will make a more formal report to the \n     Committee on these visits.

Mr. President, I want to take a couple of minutes of the \ntime allotted to thank so many of our colleagues from both sides of the \nCongress for their participation in our all-night vigil last night.\n  We began at 6 o'clock yesterday evening and worked through until 9 \no'clock this morning, nonstop. We had about 25 Senators who \nparticipated, Senators from all over the country, and some Senators \nfrom States that were not affected by the disaster, not included in the \nsupplemental legislation. We had Members of the House of \nRepresentatives who participated and came all the way over to express \ntheir concern and to participate. I am told we had close to 50 Members \nof Congress who participated throughout the night. Many of them stayed \nup all night. I myself had the opportunity to get a couple hours of \nsleep.\n  Especially, I want to thank all of the leadership committee staff for \nthe tremendous job that they did, the DTCC staff, the DPC staff, \ncertainly the steering coordination people, and my staff in the \nleadership office. They deserve our commendation and a heartfelt thanks \nfor all of the work they did in bringing this about. We had the \nopportunity, as some of my colleagues have already noted, to talk to \npeople around the country and express to them our sincere hope that \nthey know how hard it is sometimes to get this legislation back on \ntrack, but also recognize how desirous we are of making that happen \nsoon.\n\n  I have had the opportunity to talk to Senator Lott this morning. I am \nhopeful that as a result of our conversation and the conversations that \nI know he is having with other Members, especially on the House side, \nthat we might actually find some way to reach an agreement sometime \nbefore the end of the day. I think that is possible. I think there \nstill has to be a lot of good discussion and good-faith effort to try \nto find a compromise procedurally. But I certainly am hopeful that can \nbe done today.\n  Last night we talked to people who simply said that they cannot wait \nany longer, and there are those who said that the problem they are \nconcerned about now is the very short timeframe that we have within \nwhich to do any real construction work in the Dakotas and Minnesota. We \nhave no more than 120 to 125 days. In some cases it is less than 100 \ndays depending on the kind of construction project they are \nconsidering. So the bottom line is that if you do not get started soon, \nyou miss an entire construction period in the northern part of our \ncountry.\n  That is why it is imperative that these people know exactly how much \nmoney they can expect so they can budget for purposes of letting \ncontracts and making plans on infrastructure. There are going to be \nprojects that are going to require more than 1 year. The mayor of \nWatertown said she felt that it is going to take 2 to 3 years to deal \nwith all the infrastructure problems that are out there.\n  So there is no doubt that we are not going to be able to deal with \nall of the problems we have right now. But we are going to be able to \nprioritize as soon as we know what the budget is. We are going to be \nable to let contracts. We are going to be able to address these needs \none by one and make some effort at trying to resolve the most difficult \npriorities first--the most contentious and problematic issues that many \nof these people have to deal with.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is so critical that we get on with this \nlegislation, that we pass it, and that we take out the extraneous \nlegislation.\n  I indicated that we would be more than happy--and I will repeat it \nagain this morning--to work with leadership on both sides of the \nCongress and with our Republican colleagues in particular to design a \nway in which to have a time certain to consider these provisions with \neven an amount of time to be debated. We could even perhaps consider \nlimitations on amendments--I am not suggesting that today--but perhaps \neven an amendment limitation in an effort to expedite consideration of \nthese extraneous matters. The two most contentious, of course, are the \ncensus and the continuing resolution. They are the ones that we would \nwant to find a way in which there could be a separate debate, a date, \nand a time certain for consideration and ultimately a vote. Let's do \nthat. We can do it simultaneously with the passage of the disaster \nbill. But that would allow us the opportunity to move forward even this \nafternoon.\n  So I am hopeful that we can accomplish that. I am hopeful that \nperhaps now in the last 24 or 48 hours there can be a growing \nappreciation of the need to do something like that. I remain ready to \nsit down and discuss the matter with anybody who has another idea. \nUntil that time, I think it is important that we begin working on this \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the amount of \ntime allocated to the leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes twenty seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me follow on his remarks just for a \nfew minutes and read a couple of letters from some folks because, after \nall, this is not some theory or some debate about policy. It is a \ndiscussion about how this issue impacts the lives of citizens. I \nthought it would be useful to read a couple of the letters that we have \nreceived.\n\n  This is a letter from a fellow in Grand Forks, ND, who writes, ``The \npeople here have no homes, no jobs, no other homes to go to. They have \nno toys, no bikes, no clothes, nor anything else, for that matter, for \ntheir children.''\n  And he says, ``You go home and take a break for Memorial Day \nrecess,'' addressing that to the Congress. He said, ``I am very angry \nat the way people are playing with the disaster relief bill and the \nlives of the people who need help now. They have no right to delay this \nbill or add to this bill. They want to add things, add more money. We \nwill not have enough money even with this bill to repair our lives.''\n  This is a letter from someone named Tim, who is a disaster victim. \n``I am a victim of the flood of 1997, as well as my family and friends \nand businesses who are victims of the flood. As you know, we have \nsuffered a great deal, and as long as you continue to stall on the \nlegislation for disaster relief our pain and suffering is prolonged. \nPerhaps you should visit here and see and feel the pain and \ndevastation. Spend 3 days here and you will soon understand why people \nare depressed and why the anxiety level is extreme.'' He said, ``We \nstrive to help each other out in this country in times of need. \nAmericans like to spread the burden of disaster among everyone. That is \nwhat it means and that is why it makes us a great country, and we need \nyour help now. On behalf of my family, my wife, our two daughters, we \nneed your support.''\n  Rodney and Judy wrote this letter to the Congress and to the \nPresident. ``We were evacuated from our homes on the 19th of April \n1997. It sat under water for a period of 10 to 12 days with 56 inches \nof sewer and flood water on the main floor of our home. Currently the \nhouse is sitting empty because we are waiting on a bill to be passed by \nCongress providing flood relief. I am a staff sergeant in the Air \nForce. My wife and my child also happen to be from Grand Forks, North \nDakota. We are proud of our community, and we hate to see it wasted as \nit is. Right now, even through all of the mess, I have my bags packed \nand am ready to go at a moment's notice to fight and possibly die for \nour country. That is our calling in the Air Force. But what Congress is \ndoing to us really hurts. I still make a house payment for a home that \nsits empty.'' He said, ``The home is getting worse day after day. I \ncan't do anything but wait. Do you think this is fair? How did you \nenjoy your vacation\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\nover the Memorial Day weekend? I spent mine fixing up, repairing, and \nhelping my neighbors so that their homes can be lived in once again. I \nthink you should come out here and spend a few days in the stink and \nthe mud and the junk on the curbs and the streets. All we want is \nanswers. Why is this taking so long? Stop playing games with the \ndisaster bill and get it passed. We are tired of waiting for an issue \nthat should have been taken care of long ago.''\n  I mentioned earlier today of a call last evening when I was part of \nthe vigil last night from midnight until 3 in the morning, a call from \na man named Mark from Grand Forks, ND, whose wife is dying, whose home \nwas flooded, whose family was separated, and who now, like thousands of \nothers in Grand Forks, ND, waits for an answer. Mark is dealing with \nhis wife's illness, with a family that is separated, with a natural \ndisaster, and now he needs to deal with answers to the questions he \nhas. ``What about my future? What is going to happen to my community? \nHow can I put my family and my life back together again?'' And the \nanswers are in this piece of legislation.\n  We still have people here who, as of last night, are making the case \nthat this doesn't matter. ``Nothing is being held up. It doesn't \nmatter.'' FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, they say, has \nmoney in the pipeline. ``Money is flowing. What are people complaining \nabout?''\n  Anyone who asks that question has a responsibility to go to Grand \nForks, ND, and peek through the tent flap of a tent on the front of a \nyard of a home that is destroyed where the family is now living, or \nknock on the door of a camper trailer that is parked in the yard of a \nhome that is destroyed where a family is now living, or go to a shelter \nwhere a family now still lives, and ask them, ``What is the hurry? Why \nare you so anxious?'' Anyone who believes that there is money in the \npipeline to do that needs to go talk to those folks, has a \nresponsibility to go to talk to those folks, and then come back and \nstand on the floor of the Senate or the House and say, ``There is no \nemergency here.'' And, if they do that, then they will not be telling \nthe truth because they will have known better. They will have known \ndifferently.\n\n  This is urgent. The thousands of people this morning who woke up not \nin their own bed, not in their own homes, know it is urgent. They woke \nup somewhere else--another town, another home, living with a relative, \nin a shelter, in a motel, in a camper trailer, and, yes, a tent. They \nknow it is urgent. Yet, day after day we continue to hear people in and \naround this Capitol justifying the stalling on the disaster bill by \nsaying, ``Well, it is not urgent. There is nothing in this bill that \nwill provide urgently needed relief. This is for long-term relief.'' It \nis fundamentally false; wrong.\n  Will Rogers said--I quoted him the other day--about someone, ``You \nknow, it is not what he knows that bothers me so much. It is what he \nsays he knows for sure that just ain't so.'' We have people who \napparently say they know for sure this aid isn't urgent, and they ought \nto know it ain't so. If they do not know that, they have a \nresponsibility to become informed.\n  As long as I serve in this Congress I will never attach a \ncontroversial unrelated amendment to a disaster bill because it is \nunfair to do it. I will not do that. And I hope others will not do it \nin the future either.\n  In fact, I think we ought to change the rules of the Senate, and I \nwill intend to propose such a change. I expect it will be hard to get \nadopted. But I think we ought to change the rules of the Senate and say \nthat on bills that are disaster bills, or emergency bills, you ought \nnot be able to offer extraneous or unrelated or nongermane amendments. \nWill that be hard to get passed in this body? Of course, it will. But \nshouldn't there be some category of legislation that is an emergency \nthat represents a response to a disaster that at least ought to be held \naside and say, ``All right, this is different. This is urgent, and you \ndon't add extraneous controversial amendments to this''?\n  I think we ought to have a rule change to require that with respect \nto those select categories of legislation that represent urgent \ndisaster or urgent emergency disaster relief.\n  I hope maybe today, after now nearly 3 additional weeks of delay, \nthat we might be able to provide an answer to the victims of these \ndisasters and that the answer would be that the generous amount of \nrelief that has been worked on by both sides but now which has been \nlocked up by the maneuvering of some, that generous amount of relief \nwill now be made available to people to help them put their lives back \ntogether. If it is done now, if it is done in the next couple of hours, \nit can be signed into law this evening and the disaster aid will be \navailable immediately.\n  If it is not done today, will it be done tomorrow? If not tomorrow, \nwill it be next week, or next month? How long do disaster victims have \nto wait? How long do they have to wait and how many letters do we have \nto read? How many phone calls do we have to recount about people's \nlives which are being interrupted, families split, homes destroyed and \nlives in chaos because Congress has not done its job?\n  Let's hope this is resolved today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5493-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5494-S5496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL SELF-AUDIT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, my \ncolleague and friend, introduced S. 866, legislation that provides a \nnecessary Federal standard regarding voluntary environmental self-\nauditing for states. There are nearly two dozen States which are \nexperimenting with laws to encourage self-audits. These laws are aimed \nat increasing environmental protection and directing scarce enforcement \nresources toward the real bad actors. We need Federal legislation to \nmake these state laws work, and Senator Hutchison has a balanced, fair \napproach.\n  I want to take this opportunity today to share with my colleagues how \nthis legislative proposal will strengthen America's environmental \npolicies. I will join Senator Hutchison as an active cosponsor to S. \n866.\n  First, I would like to explain what voluntary environmental self-\nauditing is all about.\n  In the past 10 years, the number of environmental statutes and \nregulations that impose compliance obligations, and the corresponding \ncivil and criminal penalties and sanctions for violations, have \ndramatically increased. In response to these developments, more and \nmore companies are using environmental self-audit programs as a tool to \nensure compliance.\n  Generally, an environmental audit is a means of reviewing a business \nin order to get a snapshot of its overall compliance with environmental \nlaws and to troubleshoot for potential future problems. EPA defines an \naudit as ``a systematic, documented, periodic and objective review by \nregulated entities of facility operations and practices related to \nmeeting environmental requirements.'' Audits can include inspections of \nequipment to insure that permit requirements are being met; review of \nfuture and present risks of regulated and unregulated materials used at \nthe facility; and surveys of the day-to-day operation of environmental \nmanagement structure and resources. Some companies have compliance \nmanagement systems that include day-to-day, even shift-to-shift, \nvoluntary activities to assure compliance.\n  No State or Federal law requires companies to undertake comprehensive \nenvironmental self-auditing. This is just a good business practice \ninitiated by companies that are taking extra steps to be in full \ncompliance with environmental law.\n  There are no guidelines or standard practices--audits vary \nconsiderably because they must accommodate the individual needs of \ncompanies or specific facilities to be most effective. They are \ntypically much more extensive than an inspection by a State or Federal \nregulator because they are done more often and because companies simply \nknow much more about their operations and permit obligations than \nregulators do. A company conducting its own audit\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\ncan identify and correct a much wider range of potential environmental \nviolations.\n  Mr. President, doesn't this sounds like a great idea?\n  Unfortunately, many companies do not perform voluntary self-audits \nbecause the information contained in the audit documents can be \nobtained by Government regulators, prosecutors, citizens' groups, or \nprivate citizens and used to sue the company. Companies completing \nenvironmental audits develop documentation of their instances of \nnoncompliance or areas of potential concern. These documents, if made \npublic, are a roadmap for third parties or governments to sue even if \nthe problem has already been corrected and no environmental harm has \noccurred.\n  Remember, we have an incredibly complex compliance system. Last year \na survey conducted by Arthur Anderson and the National Law Journal \nfound that nearly 70 percent of 200 corporate attorneys interviewed \nsaid that they did not believe total compliance with the law was \nachievable. This is due to the complexity of the law, the varying \ninterpretations of the regulators and the ever-present role of human \nerror and the cost.\n  Because of this complexity, it is possible and logical that companies \nwhich take on the task of self-evaluation will find violations--and \nthat is what we want them to do. Find problems and fix them without \nwaiting a year for a Government inspection.\n  Companies are already vulnerable to extensive liability under \nenvironmental laws. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, for \nexample, the maximum civil penalty that may be assessed is now \n$25,000 per day per violation. EPA's fiscal year 1994 enforcement and \ncompliance assurance accomplishments report shows that 166 civil \njudicial penalties were brought in 1994 totaling $65.6 million. On \naverage, that is about $400,000 a case. There were 1,433 administrative \npenalty orders for the same year totaling $48 million.\n\n  Mr. President, that's a lot of money. A pretty powerful disincentive \nto self-auditing.\n  Yet, nearly two dozen states have recognized this disincentive to \nself-auditing and have enacted laws to fix the problem. These states \nand their citizens want more companies to conduct self-audits. \nMississippi is one of the States that has acted on this issue.\n  These State laws typically do three things: First, provide qualified \nevidentiary protection for internal company audit documents; second, \ngrant penalty immunity to companies that conduct audits and voluntarily \ndisclose all violations they discover in their audit; and third, \nrequire prompt cleanup of the violation.\n  In other words, the States are saying that responsible, self-auditing \ncompanies that find and report problems to State authorities are \nrewarded. The companies do not have to pay a fine and are protected \nfrom any court action on an internal company audit.\n  Mr. President, this is a fair deal. We get more environmental \nprotection--which should be the goal of environmental laws--not just \nfreedom from sanctions and penalties. Senator Hutchison's legislation \nbrings better environmental compliance with a voluntary flexible \ncomponent.\n  Mr. President, this is basic common sense--companies have an \nincentive to find and fix their problems right away. What could be \nbetter for the environment?\n  State officials also benefit because they can establish cooperative \nrelationships with companies instead of the current adversarial \nenforcement system. Taxpayers get a better return from their tax \ndollars because enforcement resources can be redirected toward the bad \nguys who are not following the law. And, most importantly, we all \nbenefit from greater compliance with our environmental laws.\n  Some will say that these State laws are about secrecy and letting \npolluters off the hook. Opponents say that these laws make it more \ndifficult to prosecute and that they will interfere with enforcement \nactions or compromise the public's right to know.\n  Mr. President, this is just not true. These laws protect only the \nvoluntary self-audit document. They do not protect any information \nrequired by law to be collected, developed, maintained, reported or \notherwise made available to a Government agency. The opponents are \nsaying that protection of the audit document will allow bad actors to \nhide violations and endanger human health. Of course, that is not true. \nAny action that causes an imminent threat is not protected and must be \nimmediately reported to authorities. Companies gain nothing from these \nlaws if they are using an audit for a fraudulent purpose, or if they \nfind a violation and don't fix it. If they're cheating, they're out.\n  These laws present a new way of doing business. No safeguards are \nremoved. The State legislature is just as eager as the Federal \nGovernment to protect its citizens. Senator Hutchison's legislation has \nthe same safeguards.\n  Twenty-one States think this is a better way to get things done. \nTwenty-five other State legislatures are considering this voluntary \nself-audit legislation. Let me give you those numbers again: 21 states \nhave enacted a voluntary audit law and 25 are considering one.\n  Mr. President, that is a grand total of 46 States. I'd say this is a \ndefinite trend. The Federal Government ought to open its eyes and join \nthe parade.\n  We need to enact similar legislation on the Federal level to \ncomplement and assist those States with a full and effective \nimplementation of this concept. That is what this bill is all about. No \nrollback of standards. No removal of any environmental law. Yes, a \ndifferent approach, but one already tested in States where 95 million \nAmericans are currently living. It is time for EPA to see the wisdom of \n95 million Americans.\n  Why not let the States continue to show us innovative ways to achieve \nenvironmental progress? I frequently ask that question. The answer is \nEPA wants to retain the right to enforce the law after it delegates \nprogram authority to a State. This means that without a Federal law \ngranting a qualified exception for voluntary self-audits, the EPA can \ntake separate enforcement actions--or overfile--regardless of any State \naction.\n  The sad consequence is that a company that wishes to take advantage \nof a State audit law is not protected from Federal enforcement \nactions--even though the Federal inspectors didn't find the problem and \nthe company has fixed it.\n\n  Why would a company voluntarily disclose violations to a State when \nthe Federal Government can come after them for the same thing?\n  EPA has been very clear about its intent to scrutinize companies in \nStates that have enacted laws and that are currently addressing audit \nbills in their legislatures. EPA has set up a task force to monitor the \napproval of State delegated programs under the Clean Air Act for States \nwith voluntary environmental audit statutes. The agency has indicated \nthat approval of certain State programs may be delayed or denied \nbecause of their State audit privilege statutes. EPA has used this \nthreat to withhold Federal program delegation in order to influence \npending State legislation. Does this sound like an agency whose charter \nis to clean up the environment or does this sound like a bureaucracy \nthat focuses on punishment first? Is this a constructive environmental \napproach?\n  Why--in the face of such Federal challenges--did the 21 States enact \nlegislation? Because 95 million citizens want a cleaner environment. \nThe States know it is the right thing to do. Americans want an approach \nthat cleans the environment first. That is also why 25 other States \nwant to consider alternatives. These States have shown great \nenvironmental courage.\n  I firmly believe that States can design and implement effective and \nsuccessful environmental laws. In fact, States have proven that the \nFederal Government does not always know best and does not always get \nthe job done.\n  I hope that EPA does not continue to minimize the independent \nsovereign rights of States to adopt and enforce environmental laws that \nprotect the environment and add to our quality of life. Perhaps EPA \nneeds to get a copy of the Constitution.\n  Full use of these State laws will never happen as long as EPA \ncontinues an adversarial approach. And Americans miss an opportunity to \nachieve creative and cost-effective solutions to environmental \nproblems.\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\n  Even the Clinton administration has recognized the value of promoting \nenvironmental self-auditing when it issued a policy statement in \nDecember of 1995. It was a good first step forward, but in 2 years, \nwe've seen only intimidation.\n  Basically, the administration policy says that if companies come \nforward and voluntarily disclose violations, then EPA will not \nprosecute them as aggressively as they could otherwise. Not a real \nbonus. No evidentiary protection, no protection against citizen suits, \nand it is only a policy, not a rule, so it does not have the force of \nlaw nor does it have any impact on what the Justice Department or the \nFBI can do. And this policy can and will vary from State to State and \ncompany to company.\n  It is now time for legislation. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has \naccepted the challenge and introduced a sound bill yesterday. This bill \nfully recognizes the sovereignty of the State. Mr. President, Senator \nHutchison's bill, S. 866, will encourage environmental self-auditing by \nsetting up incentives at the Federal level for those States with the \nprovision. Nothing more.\n  Americans get better environmental compliance. I urge my colleagues \nto give serious consideration to the proposal being advanced by Senator \nHutchison.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5494-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 30th \nanniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem and to congratulate the \npeople of Israel on their commitment to freedom.\n  Jerusalem, Mr. President, is a city unique in all the world. We know \nmuch of its 3,000 year history. We know that Jerusalem has been a great \ncity for many people; we know that it remains a holy city for people \nthroughout the world; we know that it is an inseparable part of the \nJewish state, a fundamental part of Jewish identity; and we know that \nit is the undivided capital of the State of Israel.\n  It was on the hill which we call the Temple Mount that overlooked the \nJerusalem of Abraham, where God called upon Abraham to bring his son to \nbe sacrificed; it was here that God made His covenant with man. \nJerusalem holds the remains of the first and second temples including \nthe Western Wall of the temple's courtyard, Judaism's holiest site. It \nis to Jerusalem that Jews everywhere in the world turn in prayer and, \nno matter where they live, they conclude their celebrations with the \nrefrain ``next year in Jerusalem.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to read from perhaps the most moving \ndescription of this great city delivered by one of Israel's greatest \nleaders and statesmen. In 1995, the late Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin \ndelivered the following remarks here in the U.S. Capitol:\n\n       Jerusalem is the heart of the Jewish people and a deep \n     source of our pride. On this festive occasion, thousands of \n     miles from home, here and now, we once again are raising \n     Jerusalem above our highest joy, just like our fathers and \n     our fathers' fathers did.\n       Jerusalem has a thousand faces--and each one of us has his \n     own Jerusalem.\n       My Jerusalem is Dr. Moshe Wallach of Germany, the doctor of \n     the sick of Israel and Jerusalem, who built Sha'arei Zedek \n     hospital and had his home in its courtyard so as to be close \n     to his patients day and night. I was born in his hospital . . \n     .\n       My Jerusalem is the focus of the Jewish people's yearnings, \n     the city of its visions, the cradle of its prayers. It is the \n     dream of the return to Zion. It is the name millions murmur, \n     even on their death bed. It is the place where eyes are \n     raised and prayers are uttered.\n       My Jerusalem is the jerrycan of water measured out to the \n     besieged in 1948, the faces of its anxious citizens quietly \n     waiting in line for bread, the sky whose blackness was torn \n     by flares.\n       My Jerusalem is Bab el-Wad--the road to the city--which \n     cries out, ``Remember our names forever.'' It is the ashen \n     faces of dead comrades from the War of Independence, and the \n     searing cold of the rusting armored cars among the pines on \n     the side of the road.\n       My Jerusalem is the great mountain, the military cemetery \n     on Mount Herzl, the city of silence whose earth holds the \n     treasured thousands of those who went to bitter battle--and \n     did not return.\n       My Jerusalem is the tears of the paratroopers at the \n     Western Wall in 1967 and the flag which once more waved above \n     the remnant of the Temple.\n       My Jerusalem is the changing colors of its walls, the \n     smells of its markets and the faces of the members of every \n     community and every faith, where all have freedom of thought \n     and freedom of worship in the city where holiness envelops \n     every stone, every word, every glance.\n       And my Jerusalem is the City of Peace, which will bear \n     great tidings to all faiths, to all nations, ``For the Torah \n     shall come forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from \n     Jerusalem . . . Peace be within thy walls and prosperity \n     within thy palaces.''\n       We differ in our opinions, left and right. We disagree on \n     the means and the objective. In Israel, we all agree on one \n     issue: the wholeness of Jerusalem, the continuation of its \n     existence as capital of the State of Israel. There are no \n     two Jerusalems. There is only one Jerusalem. For us, \n     Jerusalem is not subject to compromise, and there is no \n     peace without Jerusalem.\n       Jerusalem, which was destroyed eight times, where for years \n     we had no access to the remnants of our Temple, was ours, is \n     ours, and will be ours--forever.\n       ``Here tears do not weaken eyes,'' wrote the Jerusalem poet \n     Yehuda Amichai. ``They only polish and shine the hardness of \n     faces like stone.'' Jerusalem is that stone.\n\n  Mr. President, Jerusalem is more than the heart of the Jewish people. \nIt is sacred throughout the world. Jesus was crucified inside today's \ncity, and Mohammed was said to have ascended into Heaven from the \nTemple Mount. Mr. President, Jerusalem indeed is a great city; it is a \ncity of the world, a city revered by the world, and a city for the \nworld. Its freedom is invaluable.\n  Unfortunately, from 1948 to 1967, beginning with the war waged \nagainst the new State of Israel and ending with Israel's victory in the \nSix-Day War, Jerusalem was a divided city. During this time, Israelis \nof all faiths and Jews from around the world were prohibited from \nentering the eastern part of the city and from praying at the holy \nsites there. Jerusalem had lost its freedom, and the world had lost its \nJerusalem.\n  This week, Mr. President, marks the anniversary of the liberation of \nthe holy city and its return to freedom. That is why we are \ncongratulating the people of Jerusalem.\n  Today, Jerusalem is a city of growth, prosperity, and freedom. Upon \ntheir victory in 1967, those denied the city for so long did not deny \nit to the defeated. To this day, perhaps the most holy site for all \nthree major religions of the city remains housed in a Moslem mosque, \nthe Dome of the Rock. But it is a place which can be visited by anyone \nwho desires.\n  So, beyond honoring the freedom of this great city, I want to \ncongratulate the people of Jerusalem and of Israel for their commitment \nto religious freedom and the principle that religious faiths should not \npay the price of political disputes. The Jews of Israel know very well \nthe importance of religious freedom, and the pain of its denial.\n  Today, as we remember Jerusalem's proud and turbulent past, and honor \nits\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nfreedom-loving residents, we must appreciate the continuing threat to \nthe city's future.\n  Thirty years ago today, Mr. President, Israel was at war, fighting \nfor the freedom and indivisibility of Jerusalem. I submit that today, \nIsrael remains at war. We must remember, as the peace which seeks to \nend this war ebbs and flows, that many people in and around Israel are \ntrying to accomplish through other means what they failed to do in \n1967--push Israel into the Mediterranean Sea. In this environment, we \nmust not assume all parties are equally right and equally wrong. The \nmiddle of a dispute is usually not halfway in between the belligerents. \nTreating bombs in cafes and on buses as morally equivalent to \nbulldozers on deserted hilltops jeopardizes peace.\n  The Senate, on May 20, passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, \nmarking the anniversary of Jerusalem's reunification and congratulating \nthe people of Israel. The measure had 88 initial cosponsors and passed \nunanimously. This clear message cannot be misunderstood. There is only \none Jerusalem and it is the undivided capital of Israel. As the peace \nprocess continues there should be no doubt about where the U.S. Senate \nstands. The Senate strongly believes that Jerusalem must remain an \nundivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group \nare protected as they have been by Israel during the past 30 years and \ncalls upon the President and Secretary of State to publicly affirm as a \nmatter of United States policy that Jerusalem must remain the undivided \ncapital of the State of Israel.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate joins the people of \nIsrael as they celebrate the 30th anniversary of the reunification of \nJerusalem. The Six-Day War began after Egyptian President Gamal Abdel \nNasser, spurred on by the Soviet Union, conspired with Syria, Jordan, \nand Iraq to have the people of Israel ``thrown into the sea.'' Nasser \npersuaded U.N. Secretary General U Thant to withdraw peacekeeping \nforces from the Gaza strip which for 10 years had acted as a buffer \nbetween Israel and Egypt. The Egyptians began amassing troops in the \nSinai. Israel, surrounded by 250,000 Arab troops preparing for war, \nlaunched a devastating pre-preemptive strike on June 5.\n  The war was a significant event in Israeli history and resulted in \nthe reunification of Jerusalem, which before the war had been divided \nwith all access to the Old City and its holy sites denied to Jews.\n  I have been involved with this particular issue in some measure since \nmy tenure as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations in \n1975. By the early 1970's, a Soviet-led coalition wielded enormous \npower in the U.N. General Assembly and used it in an assault against \nthe democracies of the world. In that regard, I cite an editorial in \nthe New Republic which has said of the United Nations in that time that \n``During the Cold War, the United Nations became a chamber of hypocrisy \nand proxy aggression.''\n  Those who had failed to destroy Israel on the field of battle joined \nthose who wished to discredit all Western democratic governments in an \nunprecedented, sustained attack on the very right of a U.N. member \nstate to exist within the family of nations.\n  The efforts in the 1970's to delegitimize Israel came in many forms. \nNone more insidious than the twin campaigns to declare Zionism to be a \nform of racism and to deny Israel's ties to Jerusalem. Those who ranted \nagainst the ``racist Tel Aviv regime'' were spewing two ugly lies. Both \nhad at their heart a denial of Israel's right to exist.\n  The first lie, the infamous Resolution 3379, was finally repealed on \nDecember 16, 1991, after the cold war had ended and as the Soviet Union \nwas dissolving. The second we are still dealing with today.\n  That Jerusalem is, and should remain Israel's undivided capital would \nseem an unremarkable statement, but for the insidious campaign--begun \nin the 1970's--to delegitimize Israel by denying her ties to Jerusalem. \nFor far too long the United States acquiesced in this shameful lie by \nrefusing to locate our embassy in Israel's capital city. As long as \nIsrael's most important friend in the world refused to acknowledge that \nIsrael's capital city is its own, we lent credibility and dangerous \nstrength to the lie that Israel is somehow a misbegotten, illegitimate \nor transient state.\n  This suggestion is all the more untenable when you consider that no \nother people on this planet have been identified as closely with any \ncity as the people of Israel are with Jerusalem --a city which recently \ncelebrated the 3000th anniversary of King David declaring it his \ncapital. No Jewish religious ceremony is complete without mention of \nthe Holy City. And twice a year, at the conclusion of the Passover \nSeder and the Day of Atonement services, all assembled repeat one of \nmankind's shortest and oldest prayers, ``Next Year in Jerusalem.''\n  Throughout the centuries Jews kept this pledge, often sacrificing \ntheir very lives to travel to, and live in, their holiest city. It \nshould be noted that the first authoritative Turkish census of 1844 \nreported that Jews were by far the largest ethnic group in Jerusalem--\nlong before there was a West Jerusalem, or even any settlements outside \nthe ancient walled city.\n  When the modern State of Israel declared independence on May 14, \n1948, Jerusalem was the only logical choice for the new nation's \ncapital, even if it was only a portion of Jerusalem--the Jordanian Arab \nLegion having occupied the eastern half of the city and expelled the \nJewish population of the Old City. Jerusalem was sundered by barbed-\nwire and cinderblock and Israelis of all faiths and Jews of all \ncitizenship were barred from even visiting the section under Jordanian \noccupation.\n  The world was silent while the historic Jewish Quarter of the city \nwas sacked and razed to the ground, synagogues and schools were \ndestroyed, and 3,000 years of history were denied. This bizarre anomaly \nonly ended on June 5, 1967, when Israel faced renewed aggression from \nEgypt and Syria, both then close friends of, and dependents of the \nSoviet Union. As hostilities commenced, Israeli Prime Minister Levi \nEshkol sent a message to King Hussein of Jordan promising that, if \nJordan refrained from entering the war, Israel would not take action \nagainst it. Jordan, however, attacked Israel that same day. Within the \nweek, Israeli forces had captured all of Jerusalem, as well as other \nterritories west of the Jordan River. The City of David was once again \nunited, and has remained so since 1967. Under Israeli rule Jerusalem \nhas flourished as it did not under Jordanian occupation, and the \nreligious shrines of all faiths have been meticulously protected.\n\n  Having made the odious link between Zionism and racism, the Soviet \ninspired coalition now set its sights on the heart of Israel: \nJerusalem. The Seventh Conference of Heads of State of Government of \nNon-Aligned Countries, which convened in New Delhi, India, March 7 \nthrough 11, 1983, devoted several lengthy passages of its Final \nDeclaration to excoriating Israel and its ally, the United States. \nSpecial attention was devoted to the question of Jerusalem's status. \nAnd not just East Jerusalem as had become the practice of such fora.\n  I happened to be in New Delhi in the days before the summit began and \nwas shown a draft of the Final Declaration. The draft passage of Israel \nread: ``Jerusalem is part of the occupied Palestinian territory and \nIsrael should withdraw completely and unconditionally from it and \nrestore it to Arab sovereignty.''\n  While surely this can be read as a provocative statement that all of \nJerusalem is occupied Palestinian territory, when pressed on the point, \nmy Indian hosts assured me that by Jerusalem they really only meant \neast Jerusalem, which is to say the Old City, or perhaps the Arab \nsection. Hence, the significance of the revised final text of the \ndeclaration of some 101 nations.\n  This is what the nonaligned declared in that session in 1983:\n\n       West Jerusalem is part of the occupied Palestinian \n     territory and Israel should withdraw completely and \n     unconditionally from it and restore it to Arab sovereignty. \n     West Jerusalem!\n  The 101 nations of the Non-Aligned Movement declared that the Israeli \nParliament and government buildings, Yad Vashem, the Holocaust \nmemorial, the King David Hotel, the whole of the new city, did not \nbelong to Israel. The State of Israel is not a nation. It has no \ncapital, or so said the nonaligned.\n  What was the response from Washington to such polemics? Not a word.\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\n In effect, our silence could have been interpreted as implying that we \nhad no quarrel with those who state that Israel has no capital. And \nthus, that Israel is less than a sovereign nation.\n  It was at this point that I brought the issue to the Senate floor. On \nOctober 31, 1983, I introduced S. 2031 which required the relocation of \nour Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n  Official documents published by the United States Government at the \ntime, such as the State Department's ``Key Officers of Foreign Service \nPosts: Guide for Business Representatives,'' listed Jerusalem separate \nfrom Israel. The guide listed countries alphabetically, under each of \nwhich in subscript was enumerated the various diplomatic posts the \nUnited States Government maintained in that country.\n  There was Ireland, with the one post in Dublin; then came Israel, \nwith one diplomatic office listed, its address in Tel Aviv; then \ncuriously several pages later, after Japan, there was listed a \nConsulate General in a country called Jerusalem. Then came Jordan and \nKenya.\n  That was how the ``Key Officers of Foreign Service Posts'' was \norganized until the end of 1994, when Secretary Christopher published \nthe document with Jerusalem listed under the Israel heading. This is a \nwelcome change. That simple refusal by the United States Government to \nassociate our consulate in Jerusalem with the State of Israel carried \nmuch greater weight with the Non-Aligned countries than we realized.\n  They would not have acted as they had done in 1983 if they did not \nthink at some measure we were not in disagreement. Our documents have \nso implied.\n  While my legislation did not pass in 1983, the drive to clarify the \nstatus of Jerusalem began to gain momentum in the Senate in 1990 when I \nsubmitted Senate Concurrent Resolution 106, which states simply: \n``Jerusalem is and should remain the capital of the State of Israel.'' \nA simple declarative sentence which gained 85 cosponsors and was \nadopted unanimously by the Senate and by an overwhelming majority in \nthe House.\n  On November 8, 1995, the Dole-Moynihan Jerusalem Embassy Act became \nthe law of the United States. The law states, as a matter of United \nStates Government policy, that Jerusalem should be recognized as the \ncapital of the State of Israel, and should remain an undivided city in \nwhich the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected as \nthey are today.\n  In the winter of 1981, I wrote an article in Commentary entitled \n``Joining The Jackals'' in response to the Carter administration's \ndisastrous support for a resolution challenging Israel's rights in \nJerusalem. Sixteen years later, we find that the jackals are in \nretreat. Israelis and Palestinians are negotiating the details of their \nfuture. And the United States can make a simple but important \ncontribution to this process by unequivocally recognizing Israel's \nchosen capital.\n  The Senate has affirmed this simple proposition by unanimously \nadopting Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, on May 20, 1997, which \ncommemorates the reunification of Jerusalem and states that:\n\n       [The Senate] strongly believes that\n       Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights \n     of every ethnic and religious group are protected as they \n     have been by Israel during the past 30 years;\n       [and]\n       Calls upon the President and Secretary of State to publicly \n     affirm as a matter of United States policy that Jerusalem \n     must remain and undivided capital of the state of Israel.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their strong support of this \nmeasure, and again wish to congratulate our friends in Israel on this \nimportant occasion.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in \ncongratulating the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel on \nthe 30th anniversary of the reunification of their capital.\n  Christianity, Islam, and Judaism hold Jerusalem sacred, and the many \nholy sites of all faiths make a city a world spiritual and religious \ncenter. With the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967, Israel ensured the \nfreedom of worship for all faiths and access to holy places of all \nreligions with the enactment of the Protection of Holy Places Law, \n1967.\n  Today, Jerusalem is a mosaic of many cultures, religions, and \nnationalities, of peoples and neighborhoods, of old and new. It is a \nunion of contrasts with a unique character. Last year Israel celebrated \nthe Trimillennium of Jerusalem, the City of David. And for the past \n3,000 years there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the city. In \nfact, ever since King David made Jerusalem the capital of his kingdom, \nJerusalem has become a center of Jewish existence.\n  No other nation has ever made Jerusalem its capital in such an \nabsolute and binding fashion. The Temple was built in Jerusalem, and to \nit the religious made their pilgrimages. Chapters of the Bible were \nwritten within its walls, and there the prophets preached their \nprophesies. The city's ancient stones, imbued with millennia of \nhistory, and its numerous historical, sites, shrines, and places of \nworship attest to its meeting for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. \nSanctified by religion and tradition, by history and theology, by holy \nplaces and houses of worship, Jerusalem is a city revered by Jews, \nChristians, and Muslims. It reflects the fervor and piety of the three \nmajor monotheistic faiths, each of which is bound to Jerusalem by \nveneration and love.\n  The Jewish bond to Jerusalem was never broken. For three millennia, \nJerusalem has been the center of the Jewish faith, retaining its \nsymbolic value throughout the generations. The many Jews who had been \nexiled after the Roman conquest and scattered throughout the world \nnever forgot Jerusalem. Year after year they repeated ``Next year in \nJerusalem.'' Jerusalem became the symbol of the desire of Jews \neverywhere to return to their homeland. It was invoked by the prophets, \nenshrined in daily prayer, and sung by Hebrew poets in far-flung lands.\n  As a Christian, Jerusalem is a holy city for me. Jerusalem is the \nplace where Jesus lived, preached, died, and was resurrected. I went to \nJerusalem in 1994 and visited various holy sites including the Church \nof the Holy Sepulcher, the Garden of Gethsemane, and the Via Dolorosa. \nFor me there is something very special about this ancient city and I am \nglad I was able to visit these sites unencumbered, as are all persons.\n  For Islam, the prophet Mohammed was miraculously transported from \nMecca to Jerusalem, and it was from there that he made his ascent to \nheaven. The Dome of the Rock built in the seventh century, is built \nover the site of Mohammed's ascent.\n  Every year Jerusalem plays host to hundreds of thousands of Christian \npilgrims who come to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and pray at the \nshrines and churches throughout the city. Thousands of worshipers pray \nat the Mosques on the Temple Mount, with their numbers swelling into \nthe hundreds of thousands during Moslem holy month of Ramadan.\n  Jerusalem is a special city for me, my fellow Christians, Moslems, \nand Jews. For the United States, Jerusalem is the recognized undivided \ncapital of Israel, and the United States embassy will be established in \nthe city by 1999.\n  Mr. President, again, I want to congratulate the citizens of \nJerusalem and Israel on this special occasion. As I wish them all my \nbest for the next 3,000 years, I am reminded of Psalms 122:2-3.\n\n     Our feet stood within thy gate,\n     O Jerusalem,\n     Jerusalem built up,\n     a city knit together.\n\n  Congratulations, Jerusalem.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise as a cosponsor of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 21 and commend the people of Israel on the \n30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.\n  Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of Israel. For thousands \nof years the Jewish people prayed, ``next year in Jerusalem.'' This \nprayer helped to sustain Jews even through the darkest days of the \ndiaspora.\n  After Israeli independence, Jews were forced out of Jerusalem--where \nthey had lived for three millennia. The holy sites of Jerusalem were \nclosed to Christians and Jews. The Jewish quarter of the old city was \ndestroyed. But since Jerusalem was unified in 1967, it has been open to \nall religions for the first time in its history.\n  I have visited Israel with Jews who were there for the first time. \nWhen we\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\nvisited the Western Wall, I saw what it meant for them to touch the \nstones that their ancestors could only dream of. I saw that Jerusalem \nis not just a city or a capital. It is the religious and historic \nhomeland of the Jewish people.\n  Jerusalem is the capitol of Israel--though the world ignores this \nfact. Why is Israel the only nation that is not allowed to chose its \nown capital?\n  There is much talk about building in Jerusalem. Well, there is a \nbuilding project that I particularly look forward to. America will \nbuild its Embassy in Jerusalem by 1999. We should have moved our \nEmbassy long ago.\n  Mr. President, This year, as we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the \nunification of Jerusalem, let us mark this great event by reaffirming \nthat Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of the State of \nIsrael.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this past Saturday, June 7, marked the 30th \nanniversary of the reunification of the city of Jerusalem. Prior to \n1967, Jerusalem was a city divided, its center scarred by concrete and \nbarbed wire, with many of its residents displaced. Israel's recovery of \nJerusalem during the Six-Day War ended that ugly partition and restored \nthe ability of visitors and residents of all religions to worship \nfreely and visit important holy sites in Jerusalem.\n  For my part, I am convinced that Jerusalem should remain the unified \ncapital of the State of Israel. I have consistently supported measures \nbefore the Congress expressing opposition to the division of the holy \ncity.\n  The Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act, passed in 1995, definitively \nexpressed Congress' heartfelt belief that Jerusalem should not only \nremain the capital of the State of Israel, but that the United States \nshould recognize it as such.\n  Jerusalem occupies a central place in the Christian, Islamic, and \nJewish faiths and I believe it is crucial to each of these great \ntraditions that Jerusalem remain undivided and its holy sites open.\n  I urge that the President and the State Department declare their \nsupport for a free, united Jerusalem, and to avoid interfering in \nnegotiations between Israelis and Palestinians on the status of the \nholy city.\n  Mr. President, in these last 30 years, the holy city of Jerusalem has \nflourished, not just for Israel, but for all people. Nobody can claim \ncomplete ownership of one of the spiritual centers of the world. But we \ncan all congratulate the State of Israel on its excellent stewardship.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those \ncelebrating the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. The \nSenate has before it a resolution commemorating this occasion. Its \npassage will be an appropriate and fitting testimony to the courage of \nthose who reunited and reopened the city, and to the wisdom of those \nwho have maintained it that way for the last three decades.\n  Jerusalem is a city of faith. It is the spiritual home of Jews, \nChristians, and Muslims, and it is the sacred symbol and temporal \nmeeting place of their shared legacy and common humanity. Undivided \naccess to its holy sites is a promise made in the tumult of war and \nkept in the name of peace. Those who made it and those who keep it are \nrightly remembered by us today.\n  Jerusalem also is a national city. It is the undivided capital of \nIsrael--the political and cultural center of one of America's \nstaunchest, most important allies. The continued unity of Jerusalem \nunder Israel's flag is not an issue for debate. It is our best \nassurance that America's most cherished values, including the rule of \nlaw and basic human freedoms, will be preserved and protected in a \nregion critical to our own national interest.\n  Thirty years ago, the people of Israel reunified Jerusalem. But for \nmore than 3,000 years, Jerusalem has endured as the city on the hill. \nGeography and politics alone do not being to explain its significance. \nIt is a place where God touches us and unifies our histories; it is \nwhere the privilege and responsibility of Abraham's heritage becomes \nour own. Peace with justice in Jerusalem is a measure of our integrity \nas people of faith; and the best hope for peace with justice in \nJerusalem is continued undivided sovereignty.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution congratulating the \nresidents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel on the 30th anniversary \nof that city's reunification.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 30th \nanniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.\n  Jerusalem is and shall remain the undivided capital of the State of \nIsrael. The facts are simple: Jerusalem belongs to Israel for the \nsimple reason that for three millennia, it has been the spiritual, \nhistorical, cultural, and moral capital of the Jewish people. In \nrecognition of this fact, the relocation of our Embassy from Tel Aviv \nto Jerusalem should take place as called for in the Jerusalem Embassy \nRelocation Act of 1995.\n  Thirty years after reuniting the city after preempting another attack \nby her surrounding Arab neighbors, Israel has sought to make the city \nopen to people of all faiths and to make the holy sites available to \nall who come. The fact remains, that Jerusalem has never been the \ncapital of any nation but that of the Jews. That is the way it should \nremain.\n  Mr. President, Jerusalem has been central in the thoughts and minds \nof the Jewish people for 3,000 years. As the holy city, Jerusalem is \nthe spiritual and religious center of Judaism and is an indivisible \npart of the State of Israel.\n  While I understand that the present Middle East peace negotiations \nare both complicated and delicate, I do not want anyone to fall under \nthe impression that Jerusalem will belong to anyone other than Israel. \nIf the future of Jerusalem remains unclear in the minds of the \nPalestinians then they will increase their demands and this will \nfurther complicate the already tense negotiations.\n  Let the message be clear: A united Jerusalem is off limits to \nnegotiation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 21 of which I am a proud cosponsor. This \nresolution congratulates the residents of Jerusalem and the people of \nIsrael on the 30th anniversary of the reunification of that historic \ncity. This resolution also expresses our strong belief that Jerusalem \nmust remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and \nreligious group are protected as they have been by Israel during the \npast 30 years. Furthermore it calls upon the President and the \nSecretary of State to publicly affirm as a matter of United States \npolicy that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of the State of \nIsrael.\n  There has been a continuous Jewish presence in Jerusalem for three \nmillennia and a Jewish majority in the city for the past 150 years. \nJerusalem has been, throughout these years, the holiest of cities and \nthe focal point of Jewish devotion. Jerusalem remains a unique and \ncritically important city to the Jewish people. Jerusalem is also the \nonly city in the world which serves as the capital of the same country, \ninhabited by the same people, speaking the same language, and \nworshipping the same God as was the case 3,000 years ago.\n  During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Jewish people were driven out \nof the Old City of Jerusalem and denied access to holy sites in the \narea controlled by Jordan. For 19 years Israelis of all faiths and Jews \nfrom all around the world were prevented from visiting their holiest \nsites by the barbed wire which divided Jerusalem. Today we commemorate \n30 years of unrestricted access to these holy sites. Since the Israeli \nGovernment reunified Jerusalem under its control, the rights of all \nreligious and ethnic groups have been restored and vigilantly \nprotected.\n  The protection of the rights of every ethnic and religious group is \ncritical to the maintenance of peace in such a diverse and religiously \nsignificant region. We are here today to commend the Israeli people and \ntheir government for restoring full access for all people to their holy \nsites. Today we again lend our support to continued Israeli control of \na unified Jerusalem.\n  Support for a strong, independent, and undivided Israel is the \nkeystone of our policy in the Middle East. Israel is not only the sole \ndemocracy in the region, but also a country with which we share \ncultural and historical ties. Our continued support of Israel, and of \nJerusalem as its undivided capital, is especially important in this \ncrucial point in the peace process.\n\n[[Page S5500]]\n\n  We are here today in continuation of our previous policy initiatives \nregarding Israel and its control of Jerusalem. In 1990, the Congress \nadopted concurrent resolutions declaring that the Congress ``strongly \nbelieves that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the \nrights of every ethnic religious group are protected.'' In 1992, the \nCongress adopted resolutions to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the \nreunification of Jerusalem, additionally reaffirming congressional \nsentiment that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city.\n  Congress' most forceful and symbolically consequential actions in \nrecognition of the importance of a unified Jerusalem have been part of \nits systematic rebuke of its previous policy of maintaining the U.S. \nEmbassy in Tel Aviv. For some time the United States has conducted its \nofficial meetings and other business in the city of Jerusalem in de \nfacto recognition of its status as the capital of Israel. The Jerusalem \nEmbassy Act of 1995 stated as a matter of policy that Jerusalem should \nremain the undivided capital of Israel. Funds for the building of the \nU.S. Embassy in Jerusalem were recently appropriated in the fiscal year \n1998 appropriations bill, H.R. 1486.\n  As a Member of this Senate and a long-time supporter of Israel, I am \nproud to stand with many of my distinguished colleagues as a cosponsor \nof this important resolution.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 21, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the reunification \nof Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n  It is an honor to be a cosponsor of this resolution, as it was to be \na cosponsor of the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act. The 1995 act \ndeclared that the holy city should remain ``undivided'' and be \n``recognized as the capital of the State of Israel.''\n  Mr. President, for 3,000 years there has been a continuous Jewish \npresence in the city of Jerusalem. No other city on Earth is the \ncapital of the same country, inhabited by the same people, speaking the \nsame language and worshipping the same God, for a span of three \ncenturies as has been the case with Jerusalem.\n  In 1948, the Arab legion conquered East Jerusalem, including the Old \nCity, as part of the general Arab military offensive to prevent Israel \nfrom coming into being. Israel retained control over West Jerusalem. It \nis important to note, Mr. President, that when East Jerusalem was under \nArab or Muslim rule, it never served as a capital city for the rulers. \nBetween 1948 and 1967, when East Jerusalem was under Jordanian control, \nJordan's capital remained in Amman. I would also note that during this \ntime, the holy city was closed to other religions. Jews were prevented \nfrom visiting their holy places, all the synagogues in the Old City \nwere razed and Jewish burial places were desecrated.\n  In 1967, as Egypt and Syria moved again toward war against Israel, \nthe Israeli Government urged King Hussein of Jordan to sit out the \nfighting and promised that the territories he controlled would be left \nalone if he did so. The King failed to heed the warning. He attacked \nIsrael, and in the ensuing fighting lost East Jerusalem and the West \nBank.\n  When the holy city was reunified after the war, Israel, under Labor \nParty leadership at the time, declared that Jerusalem will remain \nundivided forever as Israel's capital and that all people will have \nfree access to their holy places. All people of all faiths are welcome \nto worship in the holy city. Former Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon \nPeres said it this way: ``Jerusalem is closed politically and open \nreligiously. This mean that it will remain unified, and only as \nIsrael's capital, not two capitals. It will remain under Israeli \nsovereignty.''\n  I agree with Shimon Peres. Jerusalem is, and should remain, a united \ncity--the capital of Israel. I urge the immediate adoption of this \nresolution. As the 1995 act did before, Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 \nwill send a principled and constructive signal to all the parties in \nthe Arab-Israeli negotiations that the United States recognizes \nJerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nobserving the 30th anniversary of the reunification of the city of \nJerusalem. Although the modern State of Israel was founded almost 50 \nyears ago, in 1948, the city of Jerusalem was at that time still \ndivided between Israel and Jordan, and its holy sites were not open to \nall religious groups. After Jerusalem became one again in 1967, these \nimportant historical and religious sites were opened to Christians, \nJews, Muslims, and all others who wished to worship or simply spend \nsome time in the Old City or at the Western Wall.\n  I have long supported an undivided Jerusalem in which the rights of \nevery ethnic and religious group will be protected and respected. \nJerusalem is not only the capital of Israel, but also the home of more \nthan 40 Christian denominations and the home of the Moslem religion. It \nis imperative that we work to preserve this city's unity and prevent \nany actions that would threaten this status. At the same time, we must \nensure that our efforts to maintain unity in the holy city do not \ndivide those working toward a lasting peace in the Middle East. \nJerusalem is holy to many people in many different ways, and its future \nhas understandably been a sensitive issue in the ongoing peace process. \nUnfortunately, some have used the issue of a unified Jerusalem to \ndivide those who share in the city's heritage. Our support today for \nunity in Jerusalem does not in any way detract from our support for \npeace in the Middle East. The peace process, with our unqualified \nsupport, must move forward.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I simply wish to restate my support for a \nunified Jerusalem that is open to all those who wish to visit its \nhistorical and spiritual sites. It is fitting that the Senate takes a \nmoment to reflect upon the importance of Jerusalem as a symbol to \npeople of diverse faiths and as a unified city open to all. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ncommemorate the 13th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem \nduring the Six-Day War. I congratulate the residents of Jerusalem and \nthe people of Israel on this important anniversary day.\n  On June 5, 1967, the Israelis responded to threats from their Arab \nneighbors and 6 days later the war ended with a reunified Jerusalem \nthat once again gave Jews access to the old city and its holy sites. \nSome called this unexpected price of war a miracle; it is indeed an \nissue of great importance for the Jewish people.\n  Jerusalem holds a special place in Jewish history. Since King David, \nJerusalem has been at the center of Jewish traditions and the very core \nof Jewish faith. The very city itself, not just the sites of religious \nsignificance, is considered hallowed by those of the Jewish faith. This \nissue has personal significance to me as well, as members of my own \nfamily live and worship in Jerusalem.\n  Jews have long been the majority of residents of Jerusalem. However, \nJerusalem is not only important for the Jewish faith, but for Islam and \nChristianity as well. I am a cosponsor of the sense-of-the-Congress \nresolution that recognizes the significance of a unified Jerusalem to \nthe people of Israel and reiterates the Senate's position that \nJerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights of every \nethnic and religious group are protected.\n  This resolution also calls on the President to publicly affirm as a \nmatter of United States policy that Jerusalem must remain the undivided \ncapital of Israel. Since coming to the Senate, I have supported \ninitiatives that recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. I also \nsupported the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act of 1995, \nlegislation that will move the United States Embassy in Israel to \nJerusalem. I will continue to work to ensure that never again will \naccess to the old city and its holy sites be denied to Jews or to \npersons of any faith.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues on this momentous day in \ncelebrating the triumph of Israel in the Six-Day War and the \nreunification of Jerusalem.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to \nthe nation of Israel and its courageous people on the 30th anniversary \nof the reunification of Jerusalem.\n  Today, this remarkable city, with its proud history in both the \nancient and the modern worlds, stands as a center\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\nof diverse religious and cultural interests. Three of the world's great \nreligions--Christianity, Islam, and Judaism--consider Jerusalem to be a \nholy city, and all three have holy sites in the city.\n  In 1967, following 20 years of division, Israel reunited Jerusalem \nduring the course of its heroic victory in the Six-Day War. As the \ncapital of Israel, Jerusalem today is a haven for persons of all ethnic \nand religious groups. As we join in commending Israel on this important \nanniversary, we also reaffirm our commitment to an undivided Jerusalem.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 30 years ago a singular, unexpected and \nstartling event reshaped the world. I am referring to the conclusion of \nthe Six-Day War of 1967, when the young Jewish state was faced with the \namassed forces of the Arab world, bent on its destruction, but \nprevailed against all odds and concluded the short but bloody war with \nthe victorious forces of Israel reclaiming and reuniting the holy city \nof Jerusalem.\n  It was the first time since the fall of Jerusalem in 70 C.E. that the \ncity was entirely in Jewish hands. One of the accounts of the first \nparatroopers and soldiers to reach the wall spoke of Gen. Shlomo Goren, \nthen the chief rabbi of the Israeli Army, who raced to join the first \nto reach the wall. Last week's Jerusalem Post recounted that he was \narmed only with a Bible and a shofar, and that as they ran through the \nnarrow streets of Old Jerusalem\n\n       Goren did not stop blowing the shofar and reciting prayers. \n     His enthusiasm infected the soldiers, and from every \n     direction came cries of ``Amen!'' The paratroopers burst out \n     in song.\n\n  The Jewish author Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote movingly of this \npivotal event:\n\n       In its solitude the Wall was forced into the role of an \n     unreachable tombstone for the nameless dead. Suddenly the \n     Wall, tired of tears and lamentations, became homesick for \n     song. ``O Come, let us sing to the Lord, let us chant in joy \n     to the rock of our salvation!'' (Psalm 95:1) It will be \n     called the Rejoicing Wall.\n\n  It was the first time since the partition of Jerusalem that Jews \ncould pray at the Western Wall. In fact, after the Israeli paratroopers \nand soldiers liberated the city, many flocked to the wall even before \nthe mines left by the Jordanians had been removed. A few days later, \nthe headline of the Jerusalem Post read: ``200,000 at Western Wall in \nfirst pilgrimage since Dispersion''.\n  Heschel wrote:\n\n       July, 1967 * * * I have discovered a new land. Israel is \n     not the same as before. There is great astonishment in the \n     souls. It is as if the prophets had risen from their graves. \n     Their words ring in a new way. Jerusalem is everywhere, she \n     hovers over the whole country. There is a new radiance, a new \n     awe.\n\n  Mr. President, the conclusion of this war had profound geopolitical \nconsequences--for the Mideast, and for the world, as the superpowers \nresponded to the consequences of the defeat of the Arab armies. The \nSoviets increased their support to the Arab regimes intent on revenge, \nincluding the virulently anti-Israel governments of Saddam Hussein and \nHafez Assad who came to power over the next couple of years. The United \nStates, quick to recognize Israel's declaration of independence almost \n20 years before, stood by our Democratic friend, as we would during the \nYom Kippur War 6 years later, and as we have ever since.\n  But there was consequences even more profound than the geopolitics. \nThe city of David was in Jewish hands. Whereas the Jewish graves and \nsynagogues had been desecrated since the partitioning in 1948, Israel \nopened the city to the faithful of the three monotheistic religions. \nThe Muslim leaders retained control of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of \nthe Rock. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Christians have joined \nJews since then in pilgrimages to holy Jerusalem. Jerusalem today is a \ncity for all faithful.\n  It is also, as so befits the sadness of this bloody 20th century, the \ncenter of unresolved political disputes.\n  Mr. President, if you look back at the history of the 1967 war, you \nsee that among the Israeli leadership, the possibility of exchanging \nland for a permanent peace was being considered within days after the \nSix-Day war. This was a radical notion in that part of the world--and \nthe years it took before the Sinai was returned was a necessary period \nwhen facing hostile regimes on every border of a narrow state. But \nIsrael has always demonstrated its willnessness--in fact, its \ninsistence--on cohabiting in the region, and cooperating to do so--as \nlong as its sovereignty and right to exist are recognized. These \nnotions were at the heart of an unformulated peace process then as they \nare in a more formal peace process now.\n  It is up to the democratically elected government of Israel to \ndetermine the direction and content of that process today, as it is up \nto Israel's Arab neighbors to accept the reality of the Jewish state.\n  But one issue has been left more muddled than it should be: the \nstatus of Jerusalem. This issue has been debated on this floor for over \na decade. I believe that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, and I have \njoined many colleagues in expressing that it should be the policy of \nthe United States to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of \nIsrael, and to cease the artificial posturing that has kept our Embassy \nin Tel Aviv. This is what we declared when we passed the Jerusalem \nEmbassy Act of 1995, and what we reiterated in our recent resolution, \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 21, congratulating the residents of \nJerusalem on the 30th anniversary of reunification. With these acts, \nCongress recognized a geopolitical reality. There are times when doing \nso can enhance the management of peace, by declaring, once and for all, \nwhat are the feasible parameters of a negotiated peace. These acts of \nCongress were such times. If the peace process continues, it will \nprogress more certainly on solid ground. I continue to encourage the \nadministration to join us in correcting a diplomatic anomaly that we \nhave visited on our closest ally in the Middle East for too long.\n  Mr. President, I offer my deepest congratulations to the residents of \nJerusalem, to the citizens of Israel, and to all who appreciate the \npeace and openness that has reigned over that city since it was \nreunited 30 years ago.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 30th \nanniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem and support the \nresolution offered by my distinguished colleagues from New York and \nFlorida in marking this auspicious occasion. Psalm 122 admonishes us to \n``pray for the peace of Jerusalem.'' This biblical verse is as apt now, \non the 30th anniversary of the Holy City's reunification, as it was \n3,000, years ago.\n  Jerusalem knew little peace in the 19 years before 1967. The end of \nIsrael's War of Independence left an obscene no-man's land of barbed \nwire, tank traps, sniper posts, and minefields. Israel's former \nadversary left almost no vestige of Jewish history in the historic old \ncity untouched, including the destruction of 58 synagogues; Jewish \ngravestones from the Mount of Olives were used to build roads and \nlatrines for occupying troops.\n  Mr. President, Israel's foes had as much regard for the rights of \nreligious pilgrims as they did for religious sites: Jews could not \nvisit the Western Wall, and Israeli Muslims were denied access to the \nDome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa Mosque. During the occupation, the \nChristian population of Jerusalem declined from 25,000 to 10,000.\n  On the morning of June 7, 1967, our entire world changed. Israeli \ncommandos stormed through St. Stephen's Gate on the northeast side of \nthe old city walls and took control over the old city and its \ncenterpiece, the Temple Mount. They discovered that occupying troops \nhad used the Temple Mount area, including the Dome of the Rock and the \nAl Aqsa mosque, as a huge ammunition dump. Mr. President, what might \nhave happened if the ammunition would have exploded, destroying the \nTemple Mount and perhaps the nearby Church of the Holy Sepulcher? How \ngreat would our spiritual loss have been?\n  For the first time since the Romans leveled the city in AD 70, Jews \ncontrolled the Western Wall--the surviving remnant of Herod's Temple.\n  Mr. President, shortly after the end of the Six Day War, Israel did \nsomething astonishing for a victorious power. Israeli officials assured \nArab leaders that the Muslims would keep control of the Islamic holy \nplaces on the Temple Mount. That inspired decision began Jerusalem on \nthe road to reunification and began to heal the wounds of centuries.\n  Mr. President, I traveled to Israel with my father when I was 21 and \nsaw\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\na city transformed from that which had seen pain and anguish for \nthousands of years. Where barbed wire and armed soldiers had once stood \nwas a magnificent area of trees and grass that now surrounds the \nrenovated walls of the old city. I saw a rebuilt Jewish Quarter in the \nold city. But Mr. President, most importantly, I saw for myself that \nfree and open access to their holy places for people of all faiths was \nnot merely the goal in Jerusalem, it was the rule.\n  The city's parks were revitalized. Schools and museums and hospitals \nsprang up. Music and poetry once again rose into Israel's evening sky. \nThe people came together as artists, architects, lawyers, and \ntheologians in an effort that resulted in a city that no longer just \nsurvived but lived and breathed. The Talmud proclaims that ``of the 10 \nmeasures of beauty that came down to the world, Jerusalem took nine.'' \nMr. President, for the first time since those prophetic words were \nfirst formed, those ``measures of beauty'' saw the light of day.\n  Mr. President, the question that those brave, industrious people \ntried to answer is one that we still ask today: How can Jerusalem, \nwhich means ``city of peace,'' an ancient symbol of humanity's \naspirations for redemption, become a living city that does not betray \nthe promise of its name? An answer tragically eludes us, still today, \n30 years after Jerusalem's reunification.\n  The United States Congress has a long-standing commitment to a united \nJerusalem governed by Israel. Seven years ago, Congress declared that \nJerusalem ``must remain an undivided city'' and the Jerusalem Embassy \nAct of 1995 unequivocally stated that Jerusalem should remain the \nundivided capital of Israel as a matter of U.S. policy. The resolution \nintroduced by my friends Senator Moynihan and Senator Mack clearly \nexpresses our conviction that it should be so.\n  Mr. President, it is said that ``one prayer in Jerusalem is worth \n40,000 elsewhere.'' This resolution offers the voice of Congress to \nthose voices coming from all over our Nation and the world praying for \npeace and prosperity for this most special city of all cities on this \ntruly important day.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5496-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AUTHORITY FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN UNTIL 5 P.M.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of \n2 p.m., the Labor Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nS. 419, a bill to prevent birth defects by developing and implementing \nnew prevention and surveillance strategies and the Senate now proceed \nto its immediate consideration under the following limitation: one \nsubstitute amendment be in order to be offered by Senator Bond; that no \nother amendments be in order to the bill; and that there be 30 minutes \nequally divided for debate, with Senator Bond in control of 15 minutes \nand the ranking member in control of 15 minutes. Further, following the \ndisposition of the amendment and the expiration or yielding back of \ntime, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nmajority leader propounded a similar unanimous-consent request \nyesterday. As he recalls, I noted that we have not seen the amendment \nproposed by Senator Bond, nor has this legislation had the opportunity \nto be the subject of hearings or markup in the committee. Most \nimportantly, however, since we still have not been able to resolve the \nmatter pertaining to disaster relief, I am compelled to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard by the Chair. The majority \nleader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5502-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5502-S5503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS--SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL AND \n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of \n2:05 p.m., the Senate begin 3 hours 55 minutes for debate only, to be \ndivided equally between the two leaders or their designees, for \ndiscussions with respect to the supplemental appropriations bill, and \nthat there be no motions in order during the approximately 4 hours of \ndebate, other than a motion to adjourn by the majority leader or his \ndesignee.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that it not be in order for the Chair \nto entertain any unanimous-consent requests with respect to \nconsideration of any supplemental appropriations bill during the 4-hour \nperiod described above.\n  And, finally, I ask unanimous consent that the Armed Services \nCommittee be permitted to meet during the session of the Senate today, \nWednesday, June 11.\n  In support of that unanimous-consent request, before the Chair puts \nthe request, I would just like to observe that I know there are \nSenators who would like to be heard on this issue, on the supplemental \nappropriations bill, about what is in it, the importance of it, how it \ncan be resolved, comments on language that is included, a whole variety \nof statements that I am sure Senators would like to make to show their \ninterest in and their suggestions as to how we deal with the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. So I think to have 4 hours of debate \nmakes good sense for the Senate to be able to hear what Senators have \nto say.\n  I also indicate to our colleagues that there are a lot of discussions \nunderway, a lot of meetings underway. Today, we have been in direct \ncontact with the White House on how some of these issues can be \nresolved. I have had conversations with Senator Daschle. We are \ncommunicating with the House leadership to see exactly how they plan to \nproceed and when that would be. I understand perhaps there is a meeting \nright now at the White House on some of the provisions of this issue. \nSo I think and I hope that we are making some progress and that we can \nfind some way to bring this issue to fruition in the next few hours. \nHopefully, we can have some action on it before we go out this week.\n  But I think while we are doing that, we should be doing the business \nof the Senate, having hearings or markups in committees, particularly \nthe Armed Services Committee, which is working on the defense \nauthorization bill which we hope to have up next week in the Senate, \nand also so that we can continue our efforts to come to an agreement on \nhow we deal with the supplemental appropriations, the Government \nshutdown provision language, the census language, to try to see how we \ncan work out an agreement and what that language might be. It is very \nimportant we have an opportunity to do that this very afternoon. That \nis why I make the request. I urge it be considered and that it not be \nobjected to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I concur with the distinguished majority leader about \nthe efforts now underway and his hope and expectation that at some \npoint these efforts could lead to further success in resolving the \nimpasse that we have faced now for some time. I appreciate his \nleadership and his personal involvement in making that effort.\n  I also have to note that there are many on our side of the aisle who \nhave indicated strong objections to committees meeting during such \ntime, so as not to lose the focus that we currently have. There are \nthose who are involved in these efforts who need to be at these \ncommittee markups who would otherwise be occupied if they are prevented \nfrom participating in the discussions involving the disaster assistance \nlegislation.\n  I would amend the unanimous-consent request propounded by the \nmajority leader simply to suggest and propose a unanimous-consent \nagreement that would allow debate on the floor on\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nthe supplemental, with debate equally divided with no further consent \nrequests, presuming Senator Dorgan, of course, has had his opportunity \nto make a request, but that there be no committee meetings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, was there an objection to my request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair heard objection early on.\n  Mr. LOTT. And you added a request of your own. Let me make sure I \nunderstand what it is. First, you are objecting to committee meetings, \nbut you are asking consent that we take up what?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That we have, as you suggested, debate on the Senate \nfloor on the supplemental divided evenly for the next 4 hours, as the \nmajority leader suggested.\n  Mr. LOTT. What supplemental is that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It would be the subject of the debate as you have \nproposed, as the majority leader has proposed. You had asked unanimous \nconsent that there be debate only equally divided between the two \nleaders for discussions with respect to the supplemental appropriations \nbill. I am not suggesting we change that. I am simply saying let's keep \nour focus on that, and I would not object to a request that involved a \ndiscussion as the majority leader has proposed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe I would object to that, but I have \na counterproposal maybe we could consider. I do want to note also that \nthe Finance Committee has requested consent to meet this afternoon, \nalso to begin the process of markup on the reconciliation bill, which \nis required under the budget agreement. I believe it is going to be \npretty bipartisan in its makeup, in terms of the spending provisions or \nthe restraint on spending, whichever the case may be. And in order to \nhave this legislation completed in the Finance Committee by, I believe \nit is the 18th of this month, we need to have them meeting.\n  But I ask unanimous consent, sort of in the vein of what Senator \nDaschle was talking about, that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 18, H.R. 581; and further, no amendments \nbe in order, with the exception of one substitute amendment to be \noffered by the majority leader or his designee; that there be 1 hour \ntotal for debate on the bill and the amendment, to be equally divided \nin the usual form; and finally, that following the expiration or \nyielding back of time and the disposition of the substitute amendment, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed immediately to \nvote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair heard objection to the unanimous-\nconsent request by the minority leader. We now have before us a \nunanimous-consent request by the majority leader. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority leader \nif he could share a copy of the substitute amendment referred to in the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't have one now, but I believe that during this time, \nwhile we are debating the issue, we could develop one and, as a matter \nof fact, I believe there is a meeting at the White House right now that \nwould be the subject of this substitute and one we could agree on.\n  Or I could do it this way. What I suggested yesterday, and where I \nthink we actually should go, is a bill that provides the actual \nemergency disaster funds and the funds for DOD, but not the language \nand not the supplemental, just what has been referred to as a narrow \ndisaster and emergency funding bill only, and the amount I am thinking \nabout would be in the range of $3.9 billion. That way, we would get \nthis issue resolved quickly while we continue to work on such things as \nthe census language, where we hope and think maybe we can come to some \nagreement. We get this thing done; we get it done now.\n  The House traditionally, as you very well know, is very sensitive \nabout us acting before they do, but we could go ahead and have debate \non this and take some action and hold it at the desk. I think this is \none way to deal with this emergency. How would the Senator react to \nthat?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I reiterated, again, this morning to the \ndistinguished majority leader, I am more than happy to look at the \nlanguage that he suggests. I think there may be a way to accommodate \njust the emergency and all related legislative proposals in the \nsupplemental dedicated to dealing with the disasters throughout the \ncountry, emergency or whatever related matters those may be.\n  Obviously, we would have to see the language before we agreed to any \nkind of procedural commitment that would allow consideration of this \nyet unseen proposal.\n  So we would not be in a position right now, as the majority leader \ncertainly understands, to agree to a unanimous-consent proposal until \nwe have had the opportunity to see the language. But I think the \nmajority leader is on the right track. And if that will break the \nimpasse, I am willing to look at it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the Democratic leader's comments on that. I \nhope that if we cannot find some other way to resolve the disagreements \nbetween now and 2 o'clock tomorrow, that he and I will consult maybe \nabout the idea of doing just this tomorrow. And I do not want in any \nway to dampen the efforts that are underway to come to a broader total \nagreement. But in order to get this emergency addressed this week--\nhopefully within the next 24 hours--I think this is the way that we \nwant to consider doing it.\n  I hope you will think about that between now and tomorrow and let us \nlook at that as a possibility of what we might do at 2 o'clock tomorrow \nif something else has not already been worked out.\n  I again thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. President, in view of the objection and the interests that we \nhave, the committees meetings, the Finance Committee, the Armed \nServices Committee, the urgency of the work they are doing, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5502-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 109\n\n       Whereas, To ensure the prudent use of tax dollars \n     designated for disaster assistance, the federal Flood \n     Disaster Protection Act of 1973 mandates the purchase of \n     flood insurance as a condition of receipt of federal or \n     federally related financial assistance for the acquisition or \n     construction of buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas \n     (SFHAs); and\n       Whereas, the Act prohibits federal agencies such as the \n     Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration, \n     the Small Business Administration, and any federally \n     regulated lending institution from making or guaranteeing a \n     loan for a building in an SFHA unless flood insurance has \n     been purchased; additionally, it is standard practice for \n     most mortgage companies to require flood insurance on \n     property in designated flood zones as a condition of a loan; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), \n     the entity responsible for designating and mapping flood risk \n     zones, uses several criteria to establish floodplain \n     classifications, including a community's historical flood and \n     hydrology data, flood control measures, existing and planned \n     development, and topography; and\n       Whereas, For many communities in Texas, the flood insurance \n     requirement is determined using maps that may have been drawn \n     as far back as the 1970s or early 1980s; these dated flood \n     maps do not accurately reflect changes in population, \n     development, or flood control or storm sewer improvements \n     that a community may have implemented to reduce the risk \n     of flooding; and\n       Whereas, A glaring example of this problem is the City of \n     Laredo, where residents and business owners are required to \n     purchase flood insurance based on FEMA-designated flood zone \n     maps drawn in 1982; and\n       Whereas, During the past decade, the City of Laredo has \n     constructed numerous concrete channels to divert flood waters \n     and has made storm sewer improvements to help reduce the risk \n     of flood; these projects have been carried out to accommodate \n     the rapid population growth in the city, which has tripled in \n     size over the last 15 years; and\n       Whereas, The result of federally mandated flood insurance \n     requirements based on outdated maps has created a windfall \n     for insurance companies, which are collecting millions of \n     dollars in flood insurance from people who no longer live in \n     flood zones: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 75th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby urge the Congress of the United States to request that \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency update community \n     flood maps every 10 years; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and president of the senate of the United States Congress, \n     and to all members of the Texas delegation to the congress \n     with the request that it be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-133.

and\n       Whereas the State of Oregon has authorized and allowed for \n     the acquisition of the right to the use of water for \n     beneficial purposes and any person may perfect such water \n     right as a vested property right under Oregon law; and\n       Whereas chapter 228, Oregon Laws 1905, specifically \n     authorized appropriation of water for use in projects \n     authorized under the Federal Reclamation Act of 1902; and\n       Whereas chapter 5, Oregon Laws 1905, specifically \n     authorized the use of the bed of the Upper Klamath Lake for \n     the storage of water for reclamation and irrigation use and \n     for no other purpose; and\n       Whereas the Klamath Project was authorized and constructed \n     pursuant to the laws of the states of Oregon and California \n     and the United States; and\n       Whereas pioneers, settlers, homesteaders and veterans of \n     two world wars, by their industry and commitment, have made \n     the farmland in the Klamath Project enormously productive and \n     a valued part of the economy and culture of the states of \n     Oregon and California; and\n       Whereas water has been appropriated to beneficial use \n     within the Klamath Project in Oregon and California for \n     irrigation of approximately 230,000 acres; and\n       Whereas irrigators within the Klamath Project have acquired \n     rights to the use of waters of the Klamath River for \n     irrigation, and these rights are recognized and confirmed in \n     the Klamath River Basin Compact, ratified by the states of \n     Oregon and California and consented to by Act of Congress in \n     1957; and\n       Whereas the State of Oregon has the legal authority to \n     quantify and regulate rights to the use of water in Oregon; \n     and\n       Whereas the State of Oregon has undertaken to adjudicate \n     certain rights to the use of the Klamath River and its \n     tributaries; and\n       Whereas the United States Court of Appeals has confirmed, \n     over the objection of the United States Department of the \n     Interior, that the State of Oregon has the right and \n     responsibility to determine and administer the rights of \n     claimants to the use of the Klamath River and its \n     tributaries; and\n       Whereas the United States Department of the Interior has \n     directed and proposes to direct the operation of Klamath \n     Project facilities to allocate water to purposes other than \n     irrigation, including instream purposes and instream uses in \n     California; and\n       Whereas the Department of the Interior has used and \n     proposes to use the bed of Upper Klamath Lake for the storage \n     of water for purposes other than irrigation, in contravention \n     of the limited authority granted by the State of Oregon; and\n       Whereas the Department of the Interior purports to have the \n     authority to administratively determine and allocate the \n     water of Oregon and to allocate water away from authorized \n     Klamath Project irrigation uses; and\n       Whereas the position of the State of Oregon is that the \n     Department of the Interior lacks authority to allocate water \n     or reallocate Klamath Project water supplies and the \n     administration of water must proceed in a manner consistent \n     with Oregon's system for the administration of water \n     rights; and\n       Whereas the Department of the Interior has failed and \n     refused to address legitimate, fair and fundamental questions \n     concerning its authority and actions; and\n       Whereas the Department of the Interior has failed and \n     refused to protect the rights of the water users in the \n     Klamath Project vis a vis the thousands of junior users in \n     the Klamath watershed, and has instead proposed only to \n     reallocate water used in the Klamath Project to other users \n     and uses; and\n       Whereas the actions of the Department of the Interior have \n     resulted in division, distrust and anger; and\n       Whereas it is desirable and in the interests of the State \n     of Oregon that the rights and interests of the Klamath \n     Project irrigators and Oregon's system for the allocation and \n     administration of water rights be respected; now, therefore,\n       Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of Oregon:\n       (1) The President and the Congress of the United States are \n     respectfully urged to:\n       (a) Act to ensure the protection and respect for the State \n     of Oregon's authority to allocate water and to determine and \n     administer rights to the use of water;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 94\n\n       Whereas, The American people have been threatened by \n     terrorists' actions against citizens, government, and private \n     property, with many of these terrorist activities being \n     carried out with explosive materials; and\n       Whereas, In passing the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \n     Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No. 104-132), the United States \n     Congress closed several loopholes in the effective \n     administration of justice against terrorist activities; in \n     particular, mandating that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n     and Firearms (BATF) conduct a study on the feasibility of \n     tagging, or rendering inert, several products related to the \n     production of explosive materials; and\n       Whereas, The same act of congress also required the use of \n     detection agents in plastic explosives, increased penalties \n     for conspiracies involving the use of explosives, and \n     provided assistance to law enforcement personnel to combat \n     the threat of terrorism both domestically and abroad; and\n       Whereas, The Legislature of the State of Texas is aware of \n     the research and implementation efforts of other countries \n     that may provide useful information to protect lives and \n     property through the careful and successful use of taggants; \n     and\n       Whereas, The BATF is being assisted in its effort to study \n     the technical options and feasibility by the National \n     Research Council (NRC), and to provide this assistance, the \n     NRC has established a ``Committee on Marking, Rendering \n     Inert, and Licensing of Explosive Materials''; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 75th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby commend the United States Congress for recognizing the \n     threat to public health and security from the misuse of \n     explosives; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislature pledge its full support to \n     the efforts now underway by the BATF and the NRC to study the \n     economic, practical, and technical feasibility of tagging, or \n     otherwise rendering inert, explosive materials; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the legislature strongly support the active \n     participation of stakeholder interests, including \n     representatives of affected manufacturers and law enforcement \n     personnel, in the conduct of the BATF and NRC studies; and, \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislature urge the participants of the \n     NRC study to carefully consider the experiences of other \n     countries and how those experiences may relate to the NRC \n     study; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislature looks forward to the results \n     of the BATF and NRC studies, both the interim report, which \n     is due April 1997, and the final report, which is due \n     February 1998, to advise the State of Texas in establishing \n     reasonable and effective controls on explosive materials and \n     thereby contribute to the enhanced protection of all Texans; \n     and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-135. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 32\n\n       Whereas, The south bank of the Red River constitutes the \n     boundary between the states of Texas and Oklahoma; and\n       Whereas, The exact determination of where the south bank of \n     the Red River is located is extremely difficult to ascertain \n     and subject to widely divergent opinion; and\n       Whereas, The south bank of the Red River is not a permanent \n     location, but is constantly changing; and\n       Whereas, The federal government claims ownership of the \n     south half of the Red River within a 116-mile stretch between \n     the 98th Meridian and the mouth of the North Fork of the Red \n     River; and\n       Whereas, The Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes claim \n     entitlement to 62\\1/2\\ percent of the revenues derived from \n     oil and gas production from these lands; and\n       Whereas, The changing location of the south bank and the \n     difficulty in determining its location at any given time have \n     created problems in the enforcement of laws, collection of \n     taxes, economic development, and the establishment of \n     property ownership; and\n       Whereas, It is to the mutual advantage of the states of \n     Texas and Oklahoma to agree on and establish a practicable \n     boundary between both states; and\n       Whereas, By House Concurrent Resolution 128, Acts of the \n     74th Legislature, the Texas Red River Boundary Commission was \n     created; and\n       Whereas, The term of the commission expires on June 30, \n     1998; and\n       Whereas, The states of Texas and Oklahoma are working \n     together to adopt a boundary compact to present to their \n     respective legislatures; and\n       Whereas, If the Texas Red River Boundary Commission is \n     unable to reach a boundary agreement with the Oklahoma Red \n     River Boundary Commission on or before June 30, 1998, the \n     work of the commission will be lost; and\n       Whereas, It is to the benefit of the citizens of Texas to \n     extend the term of the Texas commission and enable it to \n     continue its work toward a joint boundary resolution; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the 75th Legislature of the State of Texas, \n     That the term of the Red River Boundary Commission is hereby \n     extended to June 30, 2000; commission members, not to exceed \n     17 in number, shall be appointed by the governor; the \n     commissioners shall be representative of private property \n     owners, local government elected officials, mineral \n     interests, and the general public; such members shall serve \n     without compensation, except for reasonable travel \n     reimbursement; staffing for this commission shall be provided \n     by the General Land Office, the Office of the Attorney \n     General, and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation \n     Commission; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the chairman shall be appointed by the \n     governor; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That it shall be the duty of the commission to \n     confer and act in conjunction with the representatives \n     appointed on behalf of the State of Oklahoma for the \n     following purposes:\n       (1) to initially make a joint investigation at the joint \n     expense of the two states as to the appropriate method of \n     establishing a practicable location of the common boundary \n     between the two states with respect to the Red River;\n       (2) to investigate, negotiate, and report as to the \n     necessity and advisability of a compact between the two \n     states defining and locating a practicable, identifiable \n     state line;\n       (3) to hold such hearings and conferences in either of the \n     two states as may be required and to take such action, either \n     separately or in cooperation with the State of Oklahoma or \n     the United States, or both, as may be necessary or convenient \n     to accomplish the purposes of this resolution; and\n       (4) to report to the governor and the Legislature of the \n     State of Texas annually no later than January 15 of each year \n     its findings and recommendations concerning joint action by \n     the State of Texas and the State of Oklahoma; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Red River Boundary Commission shall \n     terminate on June 30, 2000; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislature hereby respectfully request \n     the president and the Congress of the United States to meet \n     and confer with the commission and the representatives of the \n     State of Oklahoma and to assist in carrying out the purposes \n     of this resolution;

and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and president of the senate of the United States Congress and \n     to all members of the Texas delegation to the congress with \n     the request that it be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-136. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Labor and Human Resources.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 61\n\n       Whereas, in the years since science discovered the harmful \n     effects of chlorofluoro- carbons on the earth's protective \n     ozone layer, the United States and other industrial nations \n     have implemented numerous changes to reduce the release of \n     certain chemicals into the air. An international agreement, \n     the Montreal Protocol, has put in place requirements that \n     will have far-reaching health benefits. Alternate processes \n     and materials are now used instead of CFCs routinely by all \n     Americans; and\n       Whereas, in addition to the industrial and refrigeration \n     uses of CFCs, the chemicals are invaluable to millions of \n     people for their medical applications. An exception to the \n     ban on CFCs was made for their essential uses in \n     pharmaceuticals. For the 30 million Americans with various \n     respiratory conditions, including asthma and cystic fibrosis, \n     CFCs are essential to metered dose inhalers (MDI), a vital \n     component of treatment. In recognition of the life-saving \n     work that MDIs have made possible over the past forty years, \n     provisions have been made through the Montreal Protocol and \n     the FDA to phase in restrictions for CFCs in MDIs; and\n       Whereas, the current plan is for all CFCs to be prohibited \n     from MDIs one year after a single non-CFC MDI is available. \n     This proposal, if put in place without amendment, holds many \n     perils for sufferers of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary \n     disease, and cystic fibrosis; and\n       Whereas, as alternatives to CFCs in MDIs are developed, it \n     is necessary to acknowledge that the success of inhalers in \n     delivering medications is enhanced by the fact that there are \n     several options available to patients.

Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82, 81 L.Ed.2d 71, 104 S.Ct. 2237 \n     (1984), the United States Supreme Court determined that the \n     state's regulation could not be given effect; while the court \n     found evidence of a clearly defined federal policy imposing \n     primary manufacture requirements as to timber taken from \n     federal land in Alaska, it determined that the existing \n     Congressional sanction reached only to activities on federal \n     land and concluded that the state's assertion of \n     Congressional authorization by silence to allow a state to \n     regulate similar activities on nonfederal land could not be \n     inferred; and\n       Whereas since the Wunnicke decision, the Congress has, in \n     the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of \n     1990, extended an existing ban on unprocessed log exports \n     from federal land in the 11 contiguous Western states to \n     cover timber harvested from nonfederal sources in those \n     states; the extension of the ban on unprocessed log exports \n     in those states collectively does not affect Alaska; and\n       Whereas the principal purposes, stated or assumed, in the \n     1990 Congressional Act for extending the ban on unprocessed \n     log exports in the contiguous Western states--the efficient \n     use and effective conservation of forests and forest \n     resources, the avoidance of a shortfall in unprocessed timber \n     in the marketplace, and concern for development of a rational \n     log export policy as a national matter--are equally valid \n     with respect to the significant timber resources held by this \n     state, its political subdivisions, and its public university; \n     and\n       Whereas the state cannot act to regulate, restrict, or \n     prohibit the export of unprocessed logs harvested from land \n     of the state, its political subdivisions, and the University \n     of Alaska without a legislative expression demonstrating \n     Congressional intent that is unmistakably clear;\n       Be it resolved, That the Legislature of the State of Alaska \n     urges the United States Congress to give an affirmative \n     expression of approval to a policy authorizing the state to \n     regulate, restrict, or prohibit the export of unprocessed \n     logs harvested from its land and from the land of its \n     political subdivisions and the University of Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5505-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 417.

A bill to promote online commerce and communications, to \nprotect consumers and service providers from the misuse of computer \nfacilities by others sending bulk unsolicited electronic mail over such \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n             the ELECTRONIC MAILBOX PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nElectronic Mailbox Protection Act of 1997, in the hopes of addressing \nan increasingly serious threat to online commerce and personal privacy \nrights--the distribution of unsolicited, bulk e-mail by unidentifiable \nsenders.\n  It is an unfortunate side effect of the burgeoning and exciting world \nof online communication and commerce that more and more individuals are \nfinding their electronic mailboxes filled to the cyber-brim with \nunsolicited messages. And many Internet service providers are facing \nslowdowns or even breakdowns of their systems due to uncontrollable and \nunaccountable senders of unidentifiable and unsolicited bulk e-mail.\n  Mr. President, some have suggested that we simply ban all unsolicited \ne-mail. But some people do want to receive these unsolicited messages, \nespecially when they are tailored to their personal interests. And \nlegitimate businesses and organizations are increasingly using \nunsolicited e-mail to recruit new customers, new members, or even \nfinancial assistance.\n  However, many people do not wish to receive unsolicited e-mail at \nall. And many new businesses are less than fully legitimate--all too \nfrequently, unsolicited e-mail arrives with no return address, and no \nmeans of opting-out of future mailings. In fact, it is precisely \nbecause many bulk e-mailers know that their activities are going to \nmeet massive opposition that they disguise their identities or alter \ntheir return addresses.\n  Newly developed software and increasingly brazen cyber-promoters have \nonly exacerbated the problem. In some cases, these messages have slowed \ndown or even crippled Internet service through local or national \nInternet service providers.\n  Many of these new cyber-promoters collect millions of addresses from \nservice providers without consent, mail to those who have already \nexpressed a desire to be kept off bulk e-mail lists, or purposefully \ndisguise their identity or return address. They refuse to yield to \npublic pressure, private suit or any other citizen action, and the more \ndestructive of their tactics must be addressed before the situation \noverwhelms the Internet and paralyzes legitimate online commerce--\nsomething must be done.\n  As a result, I have been working for some time now with privacy \ngroups, marketers, online service providers, and others to develop \nstrong but reasonable legislation to put a stop to the most destructive \ne-mail practices, while protecting the first amendment rights of all \nwho wish to send legitimate e-mail of any kind.\n  Mr. President, I have long been concerned about excessive--indeed \nany--Government regulation of the Internet. Many of the best qualities \nof American life are represented and enhanced by the Internet--the \nworld's most democratic medium--and I do not wish to stifle speech or \ninhibit the freedom of commerce or expression. However, the problem of \nunaccountable junk e-mailers will not go away, and if we do not address \nthis problem with legislation we risk the destruction of all legitimate \nexpression and commerce on the information superhighway.\n\n  After a long back and forth process with a wide variety of interests, \nI believe we are all finally in agreement that the bill I introduce \ntoday represents the strongest and most balanced approach to this \ngrowing problem. Specifically, my bill includes the following key \nprovisions.\n  First, and most simply, my bill will prohibit anyone from sending e-\nmail to a person who has asked not to receive such mail--either prior \nto receiving the first message or in response to an unsolicited message \nthat made its way into the recipients mailbox. Mr. President, this \nprovision requires no more than common courtesy and proper business \nsense. But unfortunately, this provision is sorely needed by the \nthousands--even millions--of recipients of repetitive and unsolicited \ne-mail.\n  And the bill also contains a pro-active provision which effectively \ndefines prior notice as including either direct notice or notice \nthrough a standard method adopted by an Internet standard setting body, \nlike the Internet Engineering Task Force. In other words, we allow the \nIETF or another community-recognized organization to discuss, develop, \nand adopt a method of preemptively informing all senders that certain \nrecipients do not want to receive any unsolicited electronic mail. This \ncould take the form of an opt-out system, an opt-in system, or even \nsome sort of address labeling standard--whatever the Internet community \nchooses to adopt. But once the standard is in place, my bill will \nrequire that senders comply with that standard. We have given the \nInternet community the tools to enforce their own pro-active steps, and \nI believe this achieves a proper balance between Government action and \nself-regulation. As much as is possible, Congress should avoid \ndictating the details of Internet architecture.\n  Second, my bill will prohibit sending unsolicited e-mail from an \nunregistered, illegitimate, or fictitious Internet domain for the \npurpose of preventing an easy reply. Such tactics have become \nincreasingly common in recent months, because the less responsible \nmarketers know--they just know--that many of the recipients of their \nunsolicited junk will be unhappy and wish to respond. Rather than act \nresponsibly and respond to complaints as they come in, these fly-by-\nnight marketers prefer to make it impossible to respond. We have all \nheard from constituents who are simply fed up with these practices, and \nthis bill will empower our constituents to do something about it.\n  Third, my bill will prohibit the use of procedures designed to defeat \nor circumvent mail filtering tools. Consumers and service providers are \ngetting better at using mail filters to block out unwanted mail. But \nthese filtering programs, still in relative infancy, are no match for \ncyber-promoters with sophisticated techniques and all the time in the \nworld to work on skirting the filters and making it into your mailbox.\n  Next, my bill will prohibit anyone from using a computer program to \nharvest, or gather, a large number of e-mail addresses for the purpose \nof sending unsolicited e-mail to those addresses or selling the list to \nother senders of unsolicited e-mail--if such activity would be against \nthe policy of the computer service from which the addresses are \ncollected. In other words, if America Online or AT or Panix or Erols \nhave policies against using a computer to harvest addresses of their \nsubscribers, cyber-promoters would have to comply.\n\n  My bill also puts a stop to so-called hit and run spamming, which \noccurs when someone gets access to a temporary e-mail account, sends \nout thousands of unsolicited messages, and then\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\nabandons the account and leaves the service provider to clean up the \nmess. Under my bill, registering an Internet domain or e-mail account \nfor the purpose of sending unsolicited e-mail and avoiding replies \nwould be prohibited.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my bill directs the FTC to pay close \nattention over the next 18 months to the affects that this bill has on \nthe junk e-mail problem. At the end of that time, the FTC will submit a \nreport to Congress detailing its findings, and we can determine whether \nor not new action is necessary.\n  And what will happen to those who break the rules we intend to set \ndown in law? Well, there are two possibilities. First, there is a \n$5,000 civil penalty for each violation, to be imposed by the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  But more importantly, this bill empowers the individual recipient or \nservice provider suffering the effects of a violation of this bill to \nsue for damages. These damages range from $500 for simple violations \nall the way up to $5,000 for particularly egregious or willful abuses. \nAnd if we think about the possibilities for class action suits, we can \nquickly see the deterrent effect of these provisions.\n  Mr. President, this bill will not prevent all unsolicited e-mail. \nLegitimate marketers, nonprofit organizations and others will still be \nable to send unsolicited e-mail, even in bulk. However, this \nlegislation will make the senders of the e-mail accountable to the \nservice providers and to the e-mail recipients. No longer will brazen \npromoters be able to disguise their identity and hide behind \ntechnology--from now on, they will be accountable for what they send \nand punished if their tactics are of the kind that merit such action.\n  Put simply, Mr. President, my bill will empower consumers and \nInternet service providers alike to block, filter, reply to, or prevent \nunwanted and unsolicited electronic mail.\n  We all recognize that we should not lightly enter into Internet \nregulation. But some practices are simply too destructive to ignore, \nand certain types of unsolicited e-mail must be stopped.\n  I hope you will join me in working to pass this fair but strong bill \nto protect individual privacy, preserve freedom of expression, and \nallow legitimate commerce on the Internet to flourish. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Mailbox \n     Protection Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Internet has increasingly become a critical mode of \n     global communication and now presents unprecedented \n     opportunities for the development and growth of global \n     commerce and an integrated worldwide economy.\n       (2) In order for global commerce on the Internet to reach \n     its full potential, individuals and entities using the \n     Internet and other online services should be prevented from \n     engaging in activities that prevent other users and Internet \n     service providers from having a reasonably predictable, \n     efficient, and economical online experience.\n       (3) Unsolicited electronic mail can be an important \n     mechanism through which commercial vendors, nonprofit \n     organizations, and other providers of services recruit \n     members, advertise, and attract customers in the online \n     environment.\n       (4) The receipt of unsolicited electronic mail may result \n     in undue monetary costs to recipients who cannot refuse to \n     accept such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such \n     mail, or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and \n     discarding such mail, or for both.\n       (5) Unsolicited electronic mail sent in bulk may impose \n     significant monetary costs on the Internet service providers, \n     businesses, and educational and non-profit institutions that \n     carry and receive such mail, as there is a finite volume of \n     mail that such providers, businesses, and institutions can \n     handle at any one point in time. The sending of such mail is \n     increasingly and negatively affecting the quality of service \n     provided to customers of Internet service providers.\n       (6) While many senders of bulk unsolicited electronic mail \n     provide simple and reliable ways for recipients to reject (or \n     ``opt-out'' of) receipt of unsolicited electronic mail from \n     such senders in the future, other senders provide no such \n     ``opt-out'' mechanism, or refuse to honor the requests of \n     recipients not to receive electronic mail from such senders \n     in the future, or both.\n       (7) An increasing number of senders of bulk unsolicited \n     electronic mail purposefully disguise the source of such mail \n     so as to prevent recipients from responding to such mail \n     quickly and easily.\n       (8) Many senders of unsolicited electronic mail collect (or \n     ``harvest'') electronic mail addresses of potential \n     recipients without the knowledge of their intended recipients \n     and in violation of the rules or terms of service of the fora \n     from which such addresses are collected.\n       (9) Because recipients of unsolicited electronic mail are \n     unable to avoid the receipt of such mail through reasonable \n     means, such mail may threaten the privacy of recipients. This \n     privacy threat is enhanced for recipients whose electronic \n     mail software or server alerts them to new mail as it \n     arrives, as unsolicited electronic mail thereby disrupts the \n     normal operation of the recipient's computer.\n       (10) In legislating against certain abuses on the Internet, \n     Congress and the States should be very careful to avoid \n     infringing in any way upon constitutionally protected rights, \n     including the rights of assembly, free speech, and privacy.\n       (11) In order to realize the full potential for online \n     electronic commerce, senders of bulk unsolicited electronic \n     mail should be required to abide by the requests of \n     electronic mail recipients, Internet service providers, \n     businesses, and educational and non-profit institutions to \n     cease sending such mail to such recipients, providers, \n     businesses, and educational and non-profit institutions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Bulk unsolicited electronic mail message.--The term \n     ``bulk unsolicited electronic mail message'' means any \n     substantially identical unsolicited electronic mail message \n     with 25 or more intended recipients.\n       (2) Electronic mail address.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``electronic mail address'' means \n     a destination (commonly expressed as a string of characters) \n     to which electronic mail can be sent or delivered.\n       (B) Inclusion.--In the case of the Internet, the term \n     ``electronic mail address'' may include an electronic mail \n     address consisting of a user name or mailbox (commonly \n     referred to as the ``local part'') and a reference to an \n     Internet domain (commonly referred to as the ``domain \n     part'').\n       (3) Initiates the transmission.--The term ``initiates the \n     transmission'', in the case an electronic mail message, \n     refers to the action of the original sender of the message \n     and not to any intervening computer service that may handle \n     or retransmit the message, unless the intervening computer \n     service retransmits the message with an intent to engage in \n     activities prohibited by this Act.\n       (4) Interactive computer service.--The term ``interactive \n     computer service'' has the meaning given that term in section \n     230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     230(e)(2)).\n       (5) Internet.--The term ``Internet'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 230(e)(1) of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(e)(1)).\n       (6) Internet domain.--The term ``Internet domain'' refers \n     to a specific computer system (commonly referred to as a \n     ``host'') or collection of computer systems attached to or \n     able to be referenced from the Internet which are assigned a \n     specific reference point on the Internet (commonly referred \n     to as the ``Internet domain name'') and registered with an \n     organization recognized by the computer industry as a \n     registrant of Internet domains.\n       (7) Listserver.--The term ``listserver'' refers to a \n     computer program that provides electronic mailing list \n     management functions, including functions that allow \n     individuals to subscribe and unsubscribe to and from \n     electronic mailing lists.\n       (8) Mail filtering tool.--The term ``mail filtering tool'' \n     means any computer program, procedure, or mechanism used by \n     an individual recipient or interactive computer service to \n     block, return, reroute, or otherwise screen or sort incoming \n     electronic mail messages.\n       (9) Server.--The term ``server'' refers to any computer \n     that provides support or services of any kind, including \n     electronic mailboxes, to other computers (commonly referred \n     to as ``clients'').\n       (10) Unsolicited electronic mail message.--The term \n     ``unsolicited electronic mail message'' means any electronic \n     mail other than electronic mail sent by persons to others \n     with whom they have a prior relationship, including a prior \n     business relationship, or mail sent by a source to recipients \n     where such recipients, or someone authorized by them, have at \n     any time affirmatively requested to receive communications \n     from that source.\n\n     SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This provisions of this Act shall take effect 45 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 876. A bill to establish a nonpartisan commission on Federal \nelection campaign practices and provide that the recommendations of the \ncommission be given expedited consideration by Congress; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                      the claremont commission act\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction \nof the Claremont Commission Act, which I am introducing, along with \nSenators Bob Smith, Torricelli, and Johnson.\n  We chose this day because it is the anniversary of the historic event \nthat prompted the introduction of this legislation. Two years ago on \nthis very day, a concerned citizen from Newport, NH, Mr. Frank \nMcConnell, stood up at a town meeting in Claremont, NH, and asked an \ninsightful and thought-provoking question of Speaker Gingrich and \nPresident Clinton: What are they going to do about reforming our \ncampaign financing system? The two leaders, who were attending the \nmeeting, promised to create a bipartisan commission to study campaign \nfinance reform and then shook hands on the agreement. That handshake \nwas a famous and short-lived moment of solidarity and bipartisanship. \nAt this time, sadly, no such commission has been created.\n  The bill that I introduce today is a renewed effort to keep the \npromise made on that famous day 2 years ago. The Claremont Commission \nAct was introduced in a bipartisan manner to create an objective \ncommission to look at the issues surrounding the reform of our Nation's \ncampaign finance system. This legislation directs the commission to \ntake important goals into consideration when making recommendations to \nthe Congress with regard to reform legislation. These goals include: \nlimiting the influence of money in Federal elections; increasing voter \nparticipation, creating a more equitable electoral system for both \nchallengers and incumbents; and removing the negative aspects of \nfinancing of Federal elections. I believe that these are important \ngoals to consider when Congress moves to make actual changes to our \ncampaign financing laws.\n  The Claremont Commission Act specifically asks the commission to \nconsider and respond to more than 14 questions regarding the most \nimportant issues surrounding the campaign finance reform debate. I am \nespecially pleased that the issues of soft money contributions, \nindependent expenditures, and the role of unions will be addressed. In \nparticular, the role of unions and their use of mandatory union dues to \nmake donations to political campaigns is of concern to me. The \ncommission will address the serious issues surrounding how unions \nfinance their political activities, as well as the considerable \ninfluence that these organizations wield over the outcome of elections. \nI am pleased that the creation of this commission can begin to address \nconcerns, as well as other Members of Congress' questions regarding \nsoft money contributions and independent expenditures.\n  The political infighting that has occurred over the years regarding \nthe financing of our Federal elections will not cease unless a middle \nground can be established. I believe that the Claremont Commission Act, \nby establishing a mechanism for a dispassionate analysis by a group of \nexperts, can provide that middle ground. Hopefully, this bill will \nallow us to address the concerns of all Americans who have a growing \nsense of cynicism over our ability to resolve important campaign \nfinancing problems.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to take a serious look at this \nlegislation and consider the merits of commissioning a bipartisan \nrecommendation regarding campaign finance reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (by request):\n  S. 877. A bill to disestablish the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration Corps of Commissioned Officers; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n   NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION CORPS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the administration, today I \nam introducing legislation to disestablish the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration Corps. This legislation is long overdue on \nthe part of the administration, and I am pleased to be able to initiate \na possible resolution on this issue.\n  In 1807, an organization known as the Coast Survey was established; \nthis organization would later become NOAA. The Survey was responsible \nfor charting the U.S. coastline, and its civilian employees were often \naugmented with military personnel. This interaction\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\nbetween the Survey and the military continued, and, during World Wars I \nand II, members of the Survey served to defend our Nation. At the end \nof World War II, these members retained their military rank and \ncompensation but returned to civilian duties as the NOAA Corps. Today, \nthe corps numbers approximately 300 officers.\n  The corps operates the NOAA Fleet, flies the agency's hurricane \nresearch planes, and conducts a variety of activities essential for \nmanaging the Nation's natural resources. This bill seeks to maintain \nthese services while improving the cost-effectiveness of the program. \nUnder this legislation, civilian service positions would be created \nequivalent to existing NOAA Corps positions. Those officers with less \nthan 15 years service would be eligible for these new civilian \npositions, while those with more than 15 years of service would be \nretired. Retired officers would still have an opportunity to compete \nfor additional NOAA positions, as determined by the Under Secretary. \nThe entire corps retirement program would be transferred to the \nDepartment of the Navy under this proposal.\n  Disestablishment of the corps has been recommended by the Vice \nPresident's National Performance Review, the Government Accounting \nOffice, and the inspector general of the Department of Commerce. The \nGAO estimates that this bill would save $5 million over a 10-year \nperiod.\n  I am concerned that the NOAA Corps officers be treated fairly, and I \nunderstand that several of my colleagues have additional concerns about \nthe impacts of this legislation. I look forward to addressing these \nissues through the committee process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n\n  S. 879. A bill to provide for home and community-based services for \nindividuals with disabilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n        LONG-TERM CARE REFORM AND DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce S. 879, the \nLong-Term Care Reform and Deficit Reduction Act of 1997, legislation to \nreform fundamentally the way we provide long-term care in this country.\n  This legislation gives States the flexibility to establish a system \nof consumer-oriented, consumer-directed home and community-based long-\nterm care services for individuals with disabilities of any age. It \ndoes so while reducing the deficit by $30.4 billion over the next 5 \nyears, and $145.7 billion over the next 10 years with the potential for \neven greater savings.\n  Mr. President, the bill is based on Wisconsin's home and community-\nbased long-term care program, the Community Options Program, called \nCOP, which has been a national model of reform. COP was the keystone of \nWisconsin's long-term care reforms that have saved Wisconsin taxpayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  The legislation is also similar, in large part, to the excellent \nbipartisan long-term care proposals developed by the Senate Committee \non Labor and Human Resources as well as the Senate Committee on Finance \nduring the 103d Congress, which in turn stemmed from the long-term care \nreforms included in President Clinton's health care reform proposal. \nUnlike so many other aspects of health care reform, the long-term care \nprovisions that came out of the two Senate committees, that were \nincluded in the Mitchell compromise measure, and that were part of the \nproposals produced by the standing committees in the other body, \nreceived bipartisan support. It is somewhat remarkable that when there \nwas so much controversy over so many issues relating to health care \nreform that there was so much agreement over the need to include long-\nterm care reform.\n  Mr. President, the success of the Wisconsin program upon which this \nmeasure is based stems in large part from its flexibility, a \nflexibility that benefits both individual consumers of long-term care \nas well as local administrators.\n  This legislation reflects that same kind of flexibility. First and \nforemost, it does so by not creating a new, unfunded mandate. This \nprogram is entirely optional for States, and beyond four core \nservices--assessment, care planning, personal assistance, and case \nmanagement--those States choosing to participate will be free to decide \nwhat additional services, if any, they want to offer. States would be \nable but not required to offer such things as homemaker services, home \nmodifications, respite, assistive devices, adult day care, supported \nemployment, home health care, or any other service that would help keep \na disabled individual at home or in the community.\n\n  Equally important, the measure provides both some initial funding, \nand the ability of States to recapture the bulk of the savings they can \ngenerate within the current long-term care system. The bill directs the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to submit to Congress a proposal \nby which States could retain, in this new more flexible program, 75 \npercent of the Federal Medicaid long-term care savings they are able to \ngenerate. This not only provides a direct incentive for States to \nproduce Medicaid savings, it also directly links the future of this \nreform to its ability to deliver results.\n  The legislation also creates a small hospital link pilot program \nbased on our experiences in Wisconsin where such an initiative has \nhelped direct individuals needing long-term care services out of \nhospitals, and back to their own homes and communities. The hospital \ndischarge is a critical point of embarkation into the long-term care \nsystem for many, and this program helps ensure that those who leave a \nhospital in need of long-term care can receive needed services where \nthey prefer them--in their own homes.\n  Mr. President, though I am convinced that long-term care reform can \nresult in substantial savings to taxpayers--and this has been our \nexperience in Wisconsin--this measure does not depend on hypothetical \nsavings for funding. This measure includes funding provisions \nconsisting of specific savings within the health care system. Those \nsavings include extending and making permanent the Medicare secondary \npayer provisions; establishing a prospective payment system under \nMedicare for nursing homes; eliminating the technical errors in the \nreimbursement of certain outpatient hospital services, known as the \nformula-driven overpayments; and, reforming the way Medicare risk \ncontractors are reimbursed.\n  Mr. President, this last provision, fixing the payment system for \nMedicare HMO's, deserves special notice. The current system of \nreimbursement is flawed, and results in grossly inequitable \ndistribution of costs and benefits within Medicare. Because the risk \ncontract reimbursement formula is driven by the average fee-for-service \ncosts in an area, Medicare beneficiaries in States like Wisconsin, \nwhere Medicare's standard fee-for-service costs are kept low, are \npunished. By contrast, areas with higher costs, including costs driven \nby unnecessary utilization and even waste, fraud, and abuse, are \nrewarded with generous benefit packages and little or no copayments.\n  This system of incentives is backward, and I am pleased to include a \nproposal to bring some sense and equity to Medicare's reimbursement of \nrisk contracts as part of this measure.\n  Mr. President, the offsetting reductions in this measure produce \nsavings of $34.1 billion over 5 years, and $166.2 billion over 10 \nyears. Altogether, including the long-term care reforms and grants to \nStates, the bill produces net deficit reduction of $30.4 billion over 5 \nyears, and $145.7 billion over 10 years.\n  This must be the approach we adopt, even for those proposals which \nexperience shows will result in savings. By including funding \nprovisions in this long-term care reform measure, we ensure that any \nadditional savings produced by these reforms will only further reduce \nthe budget deficit.\n  And there is strong evidence that there will be additional savings, \nas we have seen in Wisconsin. Between 1980 and 1993, while the rest of \nthe country experienced increased Medicaid nursing home use of 35 \npercent, thanks to Wisconsin's long-term care reforms, Medicaid nursing \nhome bed use actually dropped 16 percent in the State, saving Wisconsin \ntaxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, aside from the immediate benefits of reducing the \nbudget deficit, we need long-term care reform in its own right.\n  While the population of those needing long-term care is growing much\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\nfaster than those providing indirect support as taxpayers, informal \ncare, which is largely provided by families, has been stretched to the \nlimit by the economics of health care and the increasing age of the \ncaregivers themselves.\n  The default system of formal long-term care, currently funded through \nthe Medicaid Program, requires that individuals impoverish themselves \nbefore they can receive needed care, and it largely limits care to \nexpensive institutional settings.\n  Failure to reform long-term care will inevitably lead to increased \nuse of the Medicaid system--the most expensive long-term care \nalternative for taxpayers, and the least desirable for consumers.\n  Mr. President, there are few statistical forecasts as accurate as \nthose dealing with our population, and estimates show that the \npopulation needing long-term care will explode during the next few \ndecades. The elderly are the fastest growing segment of our population, \nwith those over age 85--individuals most in need of long-term care--the \nfastest growing segment of the elderly. The over-85 population will \ntriple in size between 1980 and 2030, and will be nearly seven times \nlarger in 2050 than in 1980.\n  The growth in the population of elderly needing some assistance is \nexpected to be equally dramatic. Activities of daily living, or ADL's, \nare a common measure of need for long-term care services. These \nactivities include eating, transferring in and out of bed, toileting, \ndressing, and bathing. In 1988, approximately 6.9 million elderly could \nnot perform all of these activities. By 2000, this population is \nexpected to increase to 9 million, and by 2040 to 18 million.\n\n  Mr. President, that we have been able to stave off a long-term care \ncrisis to date is due in large part to the direct caregiving provided \nby millions of families for their elderly and disabled family members. \nBut here also we see that the demographic changes of the next several \ndecades will result in increased strain on the current system.\n  While the number of people in need of care is increasing rapidly, the \npopulation supporting those individuals, either through direct \ncaregiving, or indirectly through their taxes, is growing much more \nslowly, and thus is shrinking in comparison.\n  In 1900, there were about 7 elderly individuals for every 100 people \nof working age. As of 1990, the ratio was about 20 elderly for every \n100, by 2020 the ratio will be 29 per 100, and after that it will rise \nto 38 per 100 by 2030.\n  These population differences will be further aggravated by the \nchanging nature of the family and the work force. As the Alzheimer's \nAssociation has noted, smaller families, delayed childbearing, more \nwomen in the work force, higher divorce rates, and increased mobility \nall mean there will be fewer primary caregivers available, and far less \ninformal support for those who do continue to provide care to family \nmembers in need of long-term care services.\n  Mr. President, while some elderly are relatively well off, thanks in \npart to programs like Social Security and Medicare that have kept many \nout of poverty, it is also true that too many seniors still find \nthemselves living near or below the poverty line. This is especially \ntrue for those needing long-term care, who, on average, are poorer than \nthose who do not need long-term care. In 1990, about 27 percent of \npeople needing help with some activity of daily living survived on \nincomes below the poverty level, compared with 17 percent of all older \npeople. About half of impaired elderly have income under 150 percent of \npoverty, compared with 35 percent of all elderly, and, according to \nFamilies USA, while 20 percent of the population as a whole had annual \nfamily income under $15,685 in 1992, nearly half of the disabled \npopulation had income under that level.\n  Further aggravating the problem is that informal family member \ncaregivers are getting older. These caregivers are already an average \nof 57, with 36 percent of caregivers 65 or older. As the population \nages, so will the average age of caregivers, and as the population of \ncaregivers increases, their ability to provide adequate informal care \ndiminishes.\n  Mr. President, all in all our country faces a rapidly growing \npopulation needing long-term care services, a population which is \ndisproportionately poor. At the same time, the group of family \ncaregivers, that has kept most of the population needing long-term care \nout of Government programs like Medicaid, is shrinking relative to \nthose in need of services, and is becoming progressively older.\n  The inescapable result of these trends is substantial pressure on \nGovernment provided long-term care services--services that are \ninadequate in several fundamental ways.\n  First, with some exceptions, the current system fails to build \neffectively on the informal care provided by families.\n  Mr. President, most people with disabilities, even with severe \ndisabilities, rely on care in their home from family and friends. The \nAlzheimer's Association estimates that families provide between 80 and \n90 percent of all care at home, willingly and without pay. The \nassociation estimates that this informal off-budget care would cost $54 \nbillion to replace.\n  This last figure can be only an estimate, not because it doesn't \nfairly represent the services currently being provided by family \nmembers, but because comparable services are largely unavailable from \nthe long-term care system. The variety of home- and community-based \nservices provided by family members simply do not exist in many areas.\n  Mr. President, the prevalence of family-provided caregiving affirms \nthat, in reforming our long-term care system, it is vital that we build \non top of the existing informal care that is being provided, not try to \nsubstitute for that care by imposing a new system. The goal of long-\nterm care reform is first to enable family caregivers to continue to \nprovide the care they currently give and that their family members \nprefer.\n  Mr. President, another weakness of the current long-term care system \nis the lack of a home and community service capacity. This is due in \npart to the inadequacies of the Medicaid Program. Enacted in 1965, \nMedicaid was primarily a response to the acute care needs of the poor. \nThough Congress did not envision Medicaid as a long-term care program, \nit quickly became the primary source of Government funds for long-term \ncare services.\n  For many years, those long-term services provided under Medicaid were \nalmost exclusively institutionally based. Not until institutional \nservices, such as nursing homes, had become well established were \ncommunity- and home-based services funded.\n  The result of the head start given institutional long-term care \nservices has been a continuing bias toward institutions in our long-\nterm care programs. The rate of nursing home use by the elderly since \nthe advent of Medicare and Medicaid has doubled, while the community \nand home-based alternatives to institutional care are considered \nexceptions to institutional care. A State must get a waiver from the \nFederal Government in order to qualify for community and home-based \nnonmedical service alternatives under Medicaid and, in many cases, an \nindividual must otherwise be headed to an institution in order to \nqualify for those Medicaid funded community and home-based alternative \nprograms.\n  More significantly, there remains an absolute entitlement to \ninstitutional care that does not exist for the home and community-based \nwaiver alternatives.\n  Mr. President, many families have been able to provide long-term care \nservices themselves to their elderly and disabled family members, but \nthe lack of even partial support services makes it increasingly \ndifficult for families to choose to keep their family members at home.\n  According to a 1991 Alzheimer's Association study, the family \ncaregiving alternative to Government funded long-term care is likely to \ndisappear not because of the increasing impairment of the long-term \ncare consumer, but because of the physical, emotional, or financial \nexhaustion of the caregiver:\n\n       Family caregivers suffer more stress-related illness, \n     resulting from exhaustion, lowered immune functions, and \n     injuries, than the general population . . . Depression among \n     caregivers of the frail elderly is as high as 43 to 46 \n     percent, nearly three times the norm. . . . The likelihood of \n     health problems is heightened by the relatively high age of \n     caregivers: the average is 57. Thirty-six percent of \n     caregivers are 65 or older.\n\n  Mr. President, the impact on the economy of the family caregiver is \nalso\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\nsignificant. Beyond the obvious strain on the personal economy of those \nfamilies with members needing long-term care services, there is also a \nsignificant effect on employers.\n  One-quarter of American workers over the age of 30 care for an \nelderly parent, and this percentage is expected to increase with 40 \npercent of workers expecting to be caring for aging parents in the next \n5 years.\n  These are impressive statistics when one considers that caregivers \nreport missing a week and a half of work each year in order to provide \ncare, and nearly one-third of working caregivers have either quit their \njob or reduced their work hours because of their caregiving \nresponsibilities.\n\n  For those working 20 hours or fewer a week, over half have reduced \ntheir work hours because of caregiving responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, long-term care is very much a woman's issue. Women \nlive longer than men, and make up a greater portion of the population \nneeding care. And women are much more likely to be the family member \nthat is providing care to a loved one who needs long-term care. One in \nfive women have a parent living in their home, and nearly half of adult \ndaughters who are caregivers are unemployed. Over a quarter of these \nwomen said they either quit their jobs or retired early just to provide \ncare for an older person.\n  In addition to the impact on caregivers as employees, workers, and \nfamily breadwinners, there is also a measurable impact on their \npersonal health. As the Alzheimer's Association study noted, caregivers \nare more likely to be in poor health than the general population, and \nare three times more likely to suffer from depression, a condition that \nraises the risk of other ailments such as exhaustion, lowered immune \nfunction, stress-related illness, and injury related to their \ncaregiving responsibilities.\n  Compounding both the work-related and health-related problems, the \nburden of this kind of caregiving can increase over time. The \nAlzheimer's Association study noted that unlike caring for a child, \nwhich diminishes over time as the child matures and becomes more \nindependent, caregiving responsibilities for an aging parent often \nincrease as they become more dependent and require more care.\n  Mr. President, failure to reform long-term care will also lead to \ncost shifting and will undermine our efforts both to contain acute care \ncosts and further reduce the deficit.\n  Thanks in large part to the lack of universal coverage and the \nattendant shared responsibility, the health care system has become \nexpert at shifting costs. Federal and State policymakers, in attempting \nto control costs, have often only created bigger incentives to shift \ncosts as they try to clamp down in one area only to see utilization \njump in another. All too often, no real savings are achieved in the \nend.\n  This was seen, for example, when the Federal Government changed \nseveral aspects of Medicare reimbursements. Patients were discharged \nfrom hospitals quicker and sicker than they had been before with a \nresulting increase in utilization in other areas, including long-term \ncare services such as skilled nursing facilities.\n  This example is particularly appropriate. As efforts are made to \nlimit costs in the acute care system, it is precisely this kind of \nshifting, from the acute care side to the long-term care side, that \nwill occur unless long-term care reforms are pursued.\n  A grandmother who is discharged from a hospital by an HMO seeking to \nlower its costs, may have little alternative but to enter a nursing \nhome. Long-term care reform could provide her family with sufficient \nadditional supports to be able to care for that grandmother in her own \nhome, and at significantly lower cost to the family and the system as a \nwhole.\n  But, Mr. President, as important as it is to gain control of our \nhealth care costs, long-term care reform is needed first and foremost \nas a matter of humanity.\n  In my own State of Wisconsin, long-term care has been the focus of \nsignificant reforms since the early 1980's.\n  One long-term care administrator, Chuck McLaughlin of Black River \nFalls, WI, testified before a field hearing of the Senate Aging \nCommittee in the 103d Congress that prior to those reforms, he saw an \nalmost complete absence of community or home-based long-term care \nservices for people in need of support.\n  This was especially visible for older disabled individuals. Except \nfor those seniors with sufficient resources to create their own system \nof in-home supports, he saw many forced to enter nursing homes who \nwould have liked to have remained in their own home or community.\n  McLaughlin noted that though some eventually adjusted to leaving \ntheir home and entering the nursing home, others never did.\n\n       I saw people who simply willed their own death because they \n     saw no reason to continue living. These were people who were \n     literally torn from familiar places and familiar people. \n     People who had lost the continuity of their lives and the \n     history that so richly made them into who they were now. \n     People who had nurtured and sustained their communities which \n     in turn provided them with positive status in that community. \n     These people were truly uprooted and adrift in an alien \n     environment lacking familiar sights, sounds, and smells. Many \n     of them simply chose not to live any longer. While the \n     medical care they received was excellent, they were more than \n     just their physical bodies. Modern medicine has no treatment \n     for a broken spirit.\n\n  Mr. President, for many, the current long-term care system continues \nto be so inflexible as to be inhumane.\n  Mr. President, there are many reasons for pursuing long-term care \nreform--certainly more than are addressed here. But the one which may \nbe the most meaningful for those actually needing long-term care is the \nability to make their own choice about what kinds of services they will \nreceive. In particular, this will mean the chance to remain as \nindependent as possible, living at home or in the community or, if they \nchoose, in an institution.\n  Survey after survey reveal the overwhelming preference for home-based \ncare, and these findings are consistent with the anecdotal evidence \navailable from just about every family facing some kind of long-term \ncare need.\n  Ann Hauser, a 74-year-old woman who retired after 30 years as a ward \nclerk in a Milwaukee hospital, offered testimony at a May 9, 1994, \nfield hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging that is typical \nof what many have said over the years.\n  Now living at home with help from Wisconsin's home and community-\nbased long-term care program, the Community Options Program [COP], Ms. \nHauser related a number of problems she had experienced while in \ndifferent nursing homes.\n\n       While at this nursing home and the others, I was to \n     continue on IV antibiotics and needed some, but not total \n     assistance for chair transfers. Before much time had passed, \n     I was assisted in moving around so seldom that I lost muscle \n     tone. Within 5 months, I became bedridden. The Heuer lift \n     became a cop-out, and I learned that I was better to refuse \n     it so that I would keep the use of some of my muscles. The \n     less active I became, the more depressed I became. I was \n     going downhill fast.\n       How could I be happy in places that allowed the aides to \n     switch the TV station on my television to their favorite soap \n     operas (when I don't even like shows like that)? Furthermore, \n     when I would remind them that I was at their mercy to finish \n     my bed bath as they stopped to watch just one more minute, \n     they would take away my remote control while I shivered and \n     waited.\n\n  The particulars of Ms. Hauser's experience are less important than \nthe overall loss of control and independence that she experienced, \nsomething that is common for many in nursing homes. As Ms. Hauser \nnoted:\n\n       How could I thrive in an environment that counted on my \n     remaining inactive when I had been so active until now?\n\n  Dorothy Freund also gave testimony at the May 9 field hearing. At the \ntime, she was a nursing home resident. Ms. Freund, who received her \nB.A. from Ohio State University, majored in English, and later received \nan additional degree from Maclean College of Drama, Speech, and Voice \nin Chicago.\n  After a brief stay in a hospital for treatment to her ankle, she came \nto a nursing home for further treatment. She gave up her apartment, \nbecause it was not designed for maneuvering in a wheelchair, and she \nhas been on the COP waiting list for a year and a half.\n  Ms. Freund testified that she enjoys helping people, and this was \nobvious to those at the hearing as she related her efforts to tutor a \nnursing assistant who had worked at the nursing home. The aide decided \nthat she would like to become a nurse, to get her LPN, but\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\nneeded to get her high school diploma. Ms. Freund helped her with \nEnglish, geometry, government, and geography, and, thanks in large part \nto Ms. Freund's efforts, the nursing assistant did receive her high \nschool diploma.\n  Ms. Freund spoke about her experience and her thoughts on living in a \nnursing home:\n\n       Then why not stay at the nursing home and help others in \n     the same way? It is not an atmosphere of peace and quiet for \n     any length of time. I'm not deprecating the nursing home and \n     its quality of care. They are always looking for ways to \n     improve situations and to solve problems that arise. Nor am I \n     downgrading those who are trying their best to give that \n     care. But when the shouting, moaning, screaming, and babbling \n     all go on at the same time it can be bedlam. It may erupt at \n     any moment. . . . The frustrations of being stuffed in a \n     nursing home, the struggle to ride out the storms, and keep \n     one's head above the turbulent waters, can seem overwhelming \n     when there's not even a gleam at the end of the tunnel. But I \n     just can't resign myself to a life of Bingo and Roll-a-ball. \n     ``Don't give up; there must be a way,'' I keep telling \n     myself.\n\n  Ms. Freund's testimony, again, is typical of the experiences of many \nneeding long-term care. And it bears emphasizing that the desire to \nlive in one's own home, and to be able to function as independently as \npossible, exists despite the high quality of care that is provided in \nmost nursing homes.\n  Mr. President, this should come as no surprise in a society that \nvalues independence so highly. We cannot expect an individual's value \nsystem to change the instant they require some long-term care, though \nthis is precisely how our current long-term care system is structured.\n\n  If for no other reason, we need to reform our long-term care system \nto reflect the values we cherish as a nation, to live, as we wish, \nindependently, in our own homes and communities.\n  Mr. President, during the debate over comprehensive health care \nreform in the 103d Congress, I issued a report reviewing the long-term \ncare provisions in President Clinton's health care reform legislation \nand offering some modifications to those provisions based on our \nexperience in Wisconsin. In that report, I noted that Chuck \nMcLaughlin's eloquent comments on the importance of community were not \nonly relevant, even central, to the discussion of long-term care, but \nthat community must also be the focus of our efforts in many other \nareas of our lives as Americans and citizens of the world.\n  More often than not, the critical problems we face stem from a \nfailure of community or a lack of adequate community-based supports--\nfor example jobs and economic development, housing, crime, and \neducation. These and other important issues are usually confronted by \npolicymakers at a distance--from Washington, DC or from State \ncapitals--essentially from the top down.\n  Too often we have tried to solve these challenges, including the \nchallenge of long-term care, by imposing a superior vision from above. \nThis approach has led to inflexible systems that cannot react to \nindividual needs, but rather end up trying to fit the problem to their \nown structure.\n  This fundamental weakness is often enough to undermine even the \nsometimes huge amounts of money that we send along to implement the \nproblem solving. It also limits the kinds of creative approaches those \nwho are ``on the ground'' may see as useful and necessary.\n  Mr. President, just as we have a need to reinvent government to \nrespond more efficiently to our country's needs and our national \ndeficit, we need also to reinvent community to allow flexible \napproaches to problems, and to allow those in the community to exercise \ntheir judgment as to how best to solve problems.\n  A great strength of the Wisconsin long-term care reforms, and \nespecially the home and community-based benefit on which this \nlegislation is based, is that it is focused on the needs of the \nindividual. Eligibility is based on disability, not age, and services \nare centered around the particular needs of an individual rather than \nthe perceived needs of a group.\n\n  The approach this legislation takes is not only appropriate, but \nintegral to the nature of long-term care.\n  Mr. President, the population needing long-term care services is a \ndiverse group with widely differing needs.\n  Of the many misconceptions about long-term care, and about programs \nproviding long-term care services, the most common may be that long-\nterm care is purely an elderly issue. Though it is true that the \nelderly make up the largest part of the population needing long-term \ncare services, long-term care is an issue facing millions of younger \nAmericans. Approximately 1 million children have severe disabilities \nthat require long-term care services.\n  Beyond the wide difference in the ages of those needing long-term \ncare services, there is a diversity of needs, including the needs of \nthe caregiving family members who may need a variety of different long-\nterm care services.\n  From individuals with cerebral palsy to families that have a loved \none afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, however well intentioned, no \none set of services will address the individual needs of long-term care \nconsumers.\n  Rather than trying to fit all of those needing long-term care \nservices into one set of services, this legislation lets case managers, \nworking with long-term care consumers and their families, determine \njust what services are needed and preferred.\n  Mr. President, the failure to enact comprehensive reform will not \ninterrupt my own efforts to advocate and push individual reforms that \nrespond to the needs of people and that can help save our health care \nsystem money.\n  In home and community-based long-term care reform, we can achieve \nboth.\n  For taxpayers in Wisconsin, COP has saved hundreds of millions of \ndollars that would otherwise have been spent on more expensive \ninstitutional care.\n  At the same time, COP has provided an alternative that allows the \nconsumer to participate in determining the plan of care and in the \nexecution of that plan.\n  But, Mr. President, at the Federal level we are behind Wisconsin and \nother States in reforming long-term care. Despite the creation of \ncommunity-based Medicaid waiver programs, consumers are, for the most \npart, faced with few alternatives. This proposal will begin to provide \nthe flexibility State government needs to provide consumer-oriented and \nconsumer-directed services.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the measure, \nfollowed by the complete text of the legislation, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 879\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STATE PLANS.\n\n       (a) Plan Requirements.--In order to be approved under \n     subsection (b), a State plan for home and community-based \n     services for individuals with disabilities must meet the \n     following requirements:\n       (1) State maintenance of effort.--\n       (A) In general.--A State plan under this title shall \n     provide that the State will, during any fiscal year that the \n     State is furnishing services under this title, make \n     expenditures of State funds in an amount equal to the State \n     maintenance of effort amount for the year determined under \n     subparagraph (B) for furnishing the services described in \n     subparagraph (C) under the State plan under this title or \n     under the State plan under title XIX of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.).\n       (B) State maintenance of effort amount.--\n       (i) In general.--The maintenance of effort amount for a \n     State for a fiscal year is an amount equal to--\n\n       (I) for fiscal year 1999, the base amount for the State (as \n     determined under clause (ii)) updated through the midpoint of \n     fiscal year 1999 by the estimated percentage change in the \n     index described in clause (iii) during the period beginning \n     on October 1, 1997, and ending at that midpoint; and\n       (II) for succeeding fiscal years, an amount equal to the \n     amount determined under this clause for the previous fiscal \n     year updated through the midpoint of the year by the \n     estimated percentage change in the index described in clause \n     (iii) during the 12-month period ending at that midpoint, \n     with appropriate adjustments to reflect previous \n     underestimations or overestimations under this clause in the \n     projected percentage change in such index.\n\n       (ii) State base amount.--The base amount for a State is an \n     amount equal to the total expenditures from State funds made \n     under the State plan under title XIX of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) during fiscal year 1997 with \n     respect to medical assistance consisting of the services \n     described in subparagraph (C).\n       (iii) Index described.--For purposes of clause (i), the \n     Secretary shall develop an index that reflects the projected \n     increases in spending for services under subparagraph (C), \n     adjusted for differences among the States.\n       (C) Medicaid services described.--The services described in \n     this subparagraph are the following:\n       (i) Personal care services (as described in section \n     1905(a)(24) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396d(a)(24))).\n       (ii) Home or community-based services furnished under a \n     waiver granted under subsection (c), (d), or (e) of section \n     1915 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396n).\n       (iii) Home and community care furnished to functionally \n     disabled elderly individuals under section 1929 of such Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396t).\n       (iv) Community supported living arrangements services under \n     section 1930 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396u).\n       (v) Services furnished in a hospital, nursing facility, \n     intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, or \n     other institutional setting specified by the Secretary.\n       (2) Eligibility.--\n       (A) In general.--Within the amounts provided by the State \n     and under section 108 for such plan, the plan shall provide \n     that services under the plan will be available to individuals \n     with disabilities (as defined in section 103(a)) in the \n     State.\n       (B) Initial screening.--The plan shall provide a process \n     for the initial screening of an individual who appears to \n     have some reasonable likelihood of being an individual with \n     disabilities. Any such process shall require the provision of \n     assistance to individuals who wish to apply but whose \n     disability limits their ability to apply.

COST CENTERS FOR NURSING FACILITY PAYMENT.\n\n       (a) Payment Rates.--Consistent with the objectives \n     described in section 202 of this title, the Secretary shall \n     determine payment rates for nursing facilities using the \n     following cost/service groupings:\n       (1) The nursing service cost center shall include salaries \n     and wages for the Director of Nursing, quality assurance \n     nurses, registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, nurse \n     aides (including wages related to initial and ongoing nurse \n     aid training and other ongoing or periodic training costs \n     incurred by nursing personnel), contract nursing, fringe \n     benefits and payroll taxes associated therewith, medical \n     records, and nursing supplies.\n       (2) The administrative and general cost center shall \n     include all expenses (including salaries, benefits, and other \n     costs) related to administration, plant operation, \n     maintenance and repair, housekeeping, dietary (excluding raw \n     food), central services and supply (excluding medical or \n     nursing supplies), laundry, and social services, excluding \n     overhead allocations to ancillary services.\n       (3) Ancillary services that are paid on a fee-for-service \n     basis shall include physical therapy, occupational therapy, \n     speech therapy, respiratory therapy, and hyperalimentation. \n     The fee-for-service ancillary service payments under part A \n     of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et \n     seq.) shall not affect the reimbursement of ancillary \n     services under part B of title XVIII of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395j et seq.).\n       (4) The cost center for selected ancillary services and \n     other costs shall include drugs, raw food, IV therapy, x-ray \n     services, laboratory services, property tax, property \n     insurance, and all other costs not included in the other 4 \n     cost-of-service groupings.\n       (5) The property cost center shall include depreciation on \n     the buildings and fixed equipment, major movable equipment, \n     motor vehicles, land improvements, amortization of leasehold \n     improvements, lease acquisition costs, capital leases, \n     interest on capital indebtedness, mortgage interest, lease \n     costs, and equipment rental expense.\n       (b) Per Diem Rate.--The Secretary shall pay nursing \n     facilities a prospective, facility-specific, per diem rate \n     based on the sum of the per diem rates established for the \n     nursing service, administrative and general, and property \n     cost centers.\n       (c) Facility-Specific Prospective Rate.--The Secretary \n     shall pay nursing facilities a facility-specific prospective \n     rate for each unit of the fee-for-service ancillary services \n     as determined in accordance with section 210 of this title.\n       (d) Reimbursement for Selective Ancillary Services.--\n     Nursing facilities shall be reimbursed by the Secretary for \n     selected ancillary services and other costs on a \n     retrospective basis in accordance with section 211 of this \n     title.\n\n     SEC. 207. RESIDENT ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--In order to be eligible for payments under \n     this title, a nursing facility shall perform a resident \n     assessment in accordance with section 1819(b)(3) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i-3(b)(3)) within 14 days \n     of admission of the resident and at such other times as \n     required by that section.\n       (b) Resident Class.--The resident assessment shall be used \n     to determine the resident class of each resident in the \n     nursing facility for purposes of determining the per diem \n     rate for the nursing service cost center in accordance with \n     section 208 of this title.\n\n     SEC. 208. THE PER DIEM RATE FOR NURSING SERVICE COSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Nursing service cost center rate.--The Secretary shall \n     calculate the nursing service cost center rate using a \n     prospective, facility-specific per diem rate based on the \n     nursing facility's case-mix weight and nursing service costs \n     during the base year.\n       (2) Case-mix weight.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the \n     case-mix weight of a nursing facility shall be obtained by \n     multiplying the number of resident days in each resident \n     class at a nursing facility during the base year by the \n     relative weight assigned to each resident class in the \n     appropriate geographic region. Once this calculation is \n     performed for each resident class in the nursing facility, \n     the sum of these products shall constitute the case-mix \n     weight for the nursing facility.\n       (3) Facility nursing unit value.--A facility nursing unit \n     value for the nursing facility for the base year shall be \n     obtained by dividing the nursing service costs for the base \n     year, which shall be indexed forward from the midpoint of the \n     base period to the midpoint of the rate period using the DRI \n     McGraw-Hill HCFA Nursing Home Without Capital Market Basket, \n     by the case-mix weight of the nursing facility for the base \n     year.\n       (4) Facility-specific nursing services price.--A facility-\n     specific nursing services price for each resident class shall \n     be obtained my multiplying the lower of the indexed facility \n     unit value of the nursing facility during the base year or \n     the geographic ceiling, as determined in accordance with \n     subsection (b), by the relative weight of the resident class.\n       (5) Patient classifications.--For patient classifications \n     associated with the use of complex medical equipment and \n     other specialized, noncustomary equipment (particularly \n     subacute classifications), the Secretary shall provide for a \n     daily allowance for such equipment based upon the amortized \n     value of such equipment over the life of the equipment.\n       (6) Selected resident classifications.--For selected \n     resident classifications (particularly subacute \n     classifications) requiring additional or specialized medical \n     administrative staff, the Secretary shall provide for a daily \n     allowance to cover these costs.\n       (7) Designation of certain resident classes.--The Secretary \n     shall designate certain resident classes, such as subacute \n     resident classes, as requiring heavy care. An acuity payment \n     of 3 percent of the facility-specific nursing services price \n     shall be added to the facility-specific price for each \n     resident that the Secretary has designated as requiring heavy \n     care.\n       (8) Per diem rate.--The per diem rate for the nursing \n     service cost center for each resident in a resident class \n     shall constitute the facility-specific price, plus the acuity \n     payment where appropriate.\n       (9) Per diem rate rebased annually.--The Secretary shall \n     annually rebate the per diem rate for the nursing service \n     cost center, including the facility-specific price and the \n     acuity payment.\n       (10) Payment.--To determine the payment amount to a nursing \n     facility for the nursing service cost center, the Secretary \n     shall multiply the per diem rate (including the acuity \n     payment) for a resident class by the number of resident days \n     for each resident class based on aggregated resident invoices \n     which each nursing facility shall submit on a monthly basis.\n       (b) Geographic Ceiling.--\n       (1) Facility unit value.--The facility unit value \n     identified in subsection (a)(3) shall be subjected to \n     geographic ceilings established for the geographic regions \n     designated by the Secretary in section 205 of this title.\n       (2) Determination.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall determine the \n     geographic ceiling by creating an array of indexed facility \n     unit values in a geographic region from lowest to highest. \n     Based on this array, the Secretary shall identify a fixed \n     proportion between the indexed facility unit value of the \n     nursing facility which contained the medianth resident day in \n     the array (except as provided in subsection (b)(4) of this \n     section) and the indexed facility unit value of the nursing \n     facility which contained the 95th percentile resident day in \n     that array during the first year of operation of the \n     Prospective Payment System for nursing facilities. The fixed \n     proportion shall remain the same in subsequent years.\n       (B) Subsequent years.--To obtain the geographic ceiling on \n     the indexed facility unit value for nursing facilities in a \n     geographic region in each subsequent year, the fixed \n     proportion identified pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be \n     multiplied by the indexed facility unit value of the nursing \n     facility which contained the medianth resident day in the \n     array of facility unit values for the geographic region \n     during the base year.\n       (3) Exclusions from determination.--For purposes of \n     determining the geographic ceiling for a nursing service cost \n     center, the Secretary shall exclude low volume and new \n     nursing facilities (as defined in section 214 of this title).\n       (c) Exceptions to Geographic Ceiling.--The Secretary shall \n     establish by regulation procedures for allowing exceptions to \n     the geographic ceiling imposed on a nursing service cost \n     center. The procedure shall permit exceptions based on the \n     following factors:\n       (1) Local supply or labor shortages which substantially \n     increase costs to specific nursing facilities.\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\n       (2) Higher per resident day usage of contract nursing \n     personnel, if utilization of contract nursing personnel is \n     warranted by local circumstances and the provider has taken \n     all reasonable measures to minimize contract personnel \n     expense.\n       (3) Extraordinarily low proportion of distinct part nursing \n     facilities in a geographic region resulting in a geographic \n     ceiling that unfairly restricts the reimbursement of distinct \n     part facilities.\n       (4) Regulatory changes that increase costs to only a subset \n     of the nursing facility industry.\n       (5) The offering of a new institutional health service or \n     treatment program by a nursing facility (in order to account \n     for initial startup costs).\n       (6) Disproportionate usage of part-time employees, where \n     adequate numbers of full-time employees cannot reasonably be \n     obtained.\n       (7) Other cost producing factors specified by the Secretary \n     in regulations that are specific to a subset of facilities in \n     a geographic region (except case-mix variation).\n\n     SEC. 209. THE PER DIEM RATE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL \n                   COSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Payment.--The Secretary shall make payments for the \n     administrative and general cost center by using a facility-\n     specific, prospective, per diem rate.\n       (2) Standards for per diem rate.--The Secretary shall \n     assign a per diem rate to a nursing facility by applying 2 \n     standards that is calculated as follows:\n       (A) Standard a.--The Secretary shall determine a Standard A \n     for each geographic region by creating an array of indexed \n     nursing facility administrative and general per diem costs \n     from lowest to highest. The Secretary shall then identify a \n     fixed proportion by dividing the indexed administrative and \n     general per diem costs of the nursing facility that contains \n     the medianth resident day of the array (except as provided in \n     subsection (a)(4)) into the indexed administrative and \n     general per diem costs of the nursing facility that contains \n     the 75th percentile resident day in that array. Standard A \n     for each base year shall constitute the product of this fixed \n     proportion and the administrative and general indexed per \n     diem costs of the nursing facility that contains the medianth \n     resident day in the array of such costs during the base year.\n       (B) Standard b.--The Secretary shall determine a Standard B \n     for each geographic region by using the same calculation as \n     in subparagraph (A) except that the fixed proportion shall \n     use the indexed administrative and general costs of the \n     nursing facility containing the 85th percentile, rather than \n     the 75th percentile, resident day in the array of such costs.\n       (3) Geographic regions.--The Secretary shall use the \n     geographic regions identified in section 205(c) of this title \n     for purposes of determining Standards A and B.\n       (4) Exclusion.--The Secretary shall exclude low volume and \n     new nursing facilities (as defined in section 214 of this \n     title) for purposes of determining Standard A and Standard B.\n       (5) Per diem rate.--To determine a nursing facility's per \n     diem rate for the administrative and general cost center, \n     Standards A and B shall be applied to a nursing facility's \n     administrative and general per diem costs, indexed forward \n     using the DRI McGraw-Hill HCFA Nursing Home Without Capital \n     Market Basket, as follows:\n       (A) Each nursing facility having indexed costs which are \n     below the median shall be assigned a rate equal to their \n     individual indexed costs plus an ``efficiency incentive'' \n     equal to \\1/2\\ of the difference between the median and \n     Standard A.\n       (B) Each nursing facility having indexed costs which are \n     below Standard A but are equal to or exceed the median shall \n     be assigned a per diem rate equal to their individual indexed \n     costs plus an ``efficiency incentive'' equal to \\1/2\\ of the \n     difference between the nursing facility's indexed costs and \n     Standard A.\n       (C) Each nursing facility having indexed costs which are \n     between Standard A and Standard B shall be assigned a rate \n     equal to Standard A plus \\1/2\\ of the difference between the \n     nursing facility's indexed costs and Standard A.\n       (D) Each nursing facility having indexed costs which exceed \n     Standard B shall be assigned a rate as if their costs equaled \n     Standard B. These nursing facilities shall be assigned a per \n     diem rate equal to Standard A plus \\1/2\\ of the difference \n     between Standard A and Standard B.\n       (E) For purposes of subparagraphs (A) through (D), the \n     median represents the indexed administrative and general per \n     diem costs of a nursing facility that contains the medianth \n     resident day in the array of such costs during the base year \n     in the geographic region.\n       (b) Rebasing.--Not less than annually, the Secretary shall \n     rebase the payment rates for administrative and general \n     costs.\n\n     SEC. 210. PAYMENT FOR FEE-FOR-SERVICE ANCILLARY SERVICES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall make payments for the \n     ancillary services described in section 206(a)(3) on a \n     prospective fee-for-service basis.\n       (b) Payment Methodology.--The Secretary shall identify the \n     fee for each of the fee-for-service ancillary services for a \n     particular nursing facility by dividing the nursing \n     facility's reasonable costs, including overhead allocated \n     through the cost finding process, of providing each \n     particular service, indexed forward using the DRI McGraw-Hill \n     HCFA Nursing Home Without Capital Market Basket, by the units \n     of the particular service provided by the nursing facility \n     during the cost year.\n       (c) Computation Period.--The fee for each of the fee-for-\n     service ancillary services shall be calculated by the \n     Secretary under this title at least once a year for each \n     facility and ancillary service.\n\n     SEC. 211. REIMBURSEMENT OF SELECTED ANCILLARY SERVICES AND \n                   OTHER COSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Reimbursement of selected ancillary \n     services and other costs identified in section 206(a)(4) of \n     this title shall be reimbursed by the Secretary on a \n     retrospective basis as pass-through costs, including overhead \n     allocated through the cost-finding process.\n       (b) Charge-Based Interim Rates.--The Secretary shall set \n     charge-based interim rates for selected ancillary services \n     and other costs for each nursing facility providing such \n     services. Any overpayments or underpayments resulting from \n     the difference between the interim and final settlement rates \n     shall be either refunded by the nursing facility or paid to \n     the nursing facility following submission of a timely filed \n     medicare cost report.\n\n     SEC. 212. PER DIEM PAYMENT FOR PROPERTY COSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall make a per diem \n     payment for property costs based on a gross rental system. \n     The amount of the payment shall be determined as follows:\n       (1) Building and fixed equipment value.--In the case of a \n     new facility in any geographic region, the cost for building \n     and fixed equipment used in determining the gross rental \n     shall be equivalent to the median cost of home construction \n     in the region (as measured by RS Means). Such cost shall then \n     be multiplied by the factor 1.2 to account for land and the \n     value of movable equipment. The resulting value shall be \n     indexed each year using the RS Means Construction Cost Index.\n       (2) Age.--\n       (A) In general.--The gross rental system establishes a \n     facility's value based on its age. The older the facility, \n     the less its value. Additions, replacements, and renovations \n     shall be recognized by lowering the age of the facility and, \n     thus, increasing the facility's value. Existing facilities, 1 \n     year or older, shall be valued at the new bed value less 2 \n     percent per year according to the ``age'' of the facility. \n     Facilities shall not be depreciated to an amount less than 50 \n     percent of the new construction bed value.\n       (B) Addition of beds.--The addition of beds shall require a \n     computation by the Secretary of the weighted average age of \n     the facility based on the construction dates of the original \n     facility and the additions.\n       (C) Replacement of beds.--The replacement of existing beds \n     shall result in an adjustment to the age of the facility. A \n     weighted average age shall be calculated by the Secretary \n     according to the year of initial construction and the year of \n     bed replacement. If a facility has a series of additions or \n     replacements, the Secretary shall assume that the oldest beds \n     are the ones being replaced when computing the average \n     facility age.\n       (D) Renovations or major improvements.--Renovations or \n     major improvements shall be calculated by the Secretary as a \n     bed replacement, except that the value of the bed prior to \n     renovation shall be taken into consideration. To qualify as a \n     bed replacement, the bed being renovated must be at least 10 \n     years old and the renovation or improvements cost must be \n     equal to or greater than the difference between the existing \n     bed value and the value of a new bed. To determine the new \n     adjusted facility age, the number of renovated beds assigned \n     a ``new'' age is determined by dividing the total cost of \n     renovation by the difference between the existing bed value \n     and the value of the new bed.\n       (E) Startup of gross rental system.--To start up the fair \n     rental system, each facility's bed values shall be determined \n     by the Secretary based on the age of the facility. The \n     determination shall include setting a value for the original \n     beds with adjustments for any additions, bed replacements, \n     and major renovations. For determination of bed values for \n     use in determining the initial rate, the procedures described \n     above for determining the values of original beds, additions, \n     and replacements shall be used.\n       (3) Total current value.--The Secretary shall multiply the \n     per bed value by the number of beds in the facility to \n     estimate the facility's total current value.\n       (4) Rental factor.--The Secretary shall apply a rental \n     factor to the facility's total current value to estimate its \n     annual gross rental value. The Secretary shall determine the \n     rental factor by using the Treasury Bond Composite Yield \n     (greater than 10 years) as published in the Federal Reserve \n     Bulletin plus a risk premium. A risk premium in the amount of \n     3 percentage points shall be added to the Treasury Yield. The \n     rental factor is multiplied by the facility's total value, as \n     determined in paragraph (3), to determine the annual gross \n     rental value.\n       (5) Per diem property payment.--The annual gross rental \n     value shall be divided by the Secretary by 90 percent of the \n     facility's annual licensed bed days during the cost report \n     period to arrive at the per diem property payment.\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\n       (6) Per resident day rental rate.--The per resident day \n     rental rate for a newly constructed facility during its first \n     year of operation shall be based on the total annual rental \n     divided by the greater of 50 percent of available resident \n     days or actual annualized resident days up to 90 percent of \n     annual licensed bed days during the first year of operation.\n       (b) Facilities in operation prior to the effective date of \n     this Act shall receive the per resident day rental or actual \n     costs, as determined in accordance with HCFA-Pub. 15, \n     whichever is greater, except that a nursing facility shall be \n     reimbursed the per resident day rental on and after the \n     earliest of the following dates:\n       (1) the date upon which the nursing facility changes \n     ownership;\n       (2) the date the nursing facility accepts the per resident \n     day rental; or\n       (3) the date of the renegotiation of the lease for the land \n     or buildings, not including the exercise of optional \n     extensions specifically included in the original lease \n     agreement or valid extensions thereof.\n\n     SEC. 213.

States would be given greater flexibility \n     and an enhanced federal match relative to the current \n     Medicaid program.\n\n                              Eligibility\n\n       Those meeting any of the following criteria would be \n     eligible for the program:\n       Individuals requiring assistance, supervision or cuing with \n     three or more activities of daily living.\n       Individuals with severe mental retardation.\n       Individuals with severe cognitive or mental impairment.\n       Children under 6, with severe disabilities.\n       In addition, States could set aside funds for individuals \n     who may not meet any one of the above criteria, but who have \n     a disability of comparable level of severity.\n\n                                Services\n\n       States participating in the program would be required to \n     provide assessment, plan of care, personal assistance, and \n     case management services. Beyond that, States may also offer \n     any other service that would help keep a disabled individual \n     at home or in the community. (Such services might include \n     homemaker services, home modifications, respite, assistive \n     devices, adult day care, habilitation/rehabilitation, \n     supported employment, home health care, etc.)\n\n                               Financing\n\n       States choosing to participate in the program would receive \n     capped grants, and would match the Federal funding with State \n     funding. The State match rate would be 15% lower than their \n     current Medicaid State match rate.\n       States would be allowed to charge copayments and establish \n     deductibles for services based on income, except that no such \n     payments could be charged to individuals with income below \n     150% of poverty.\n       Total grant funding of the Federal share of the long-term \n     care grants would be $3.75 billion over 5 years, and $20.5 \n     billion over 10 years.\n       In addition to the specific grants outlined in the new \n     version, the measure also includes a directive to the \n     Secretary of HHS to submit a proposal to Congress whereby \n     States can retain 75% of the Federal Medicaid long-term care \n     savings they achieve through this program (e.g., reduced \n     institutional utilization).\n\n                           Offsetting Savings\n\n       Extend Medicare Secondary Payer Program--savings of $7.2 \n     billion over 5 years, and $18.1 billion over 10 years.\n       Eliminate Formula-Driven Overpayments--savings of $9.1 \n     billion over 5 years, and $30.1 billion over 10 years.\n       Establish Prospective Payment System for Skilled Nursing \n     Facilities--savings of $7.7 billion over 5 years, and $24.5 \n     billion over 10 years.\n       Reform Medicare HMO Reimbursement Formula--savings of $10.1 \n     billion over 5 years, and $93.5 billion over 10 years.\n       Total offsets: $34.1 billion over 5 years, and $166.2 \n     billion over 10 years.\n       Net deficit reduction: $30.4 billion over 5 years, and \n     $145.7 billion over 10 years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 880.

A bill to provide for a land exchange involving the Warner \nCanyon Ski Area and other land in the State of Oregon; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          THE WARNER CANYON SKI HILL LAND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nauthorizing an exchange of lands between the U.S. Forest Service, the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Lake County, OR. I believe that \nthis exchange project is a win-win proposition for both the Federal \nGovernment and Lake County.\n  Under my bill, the U.S. Forest Service will deed about 290 acres of \nnational forest land, comprising the Warner Canyon ski hill, to Lake \nCounty. In exchange, Lake County will deed roughly 320 acres of land \nwithin the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge to the Federal \nGovernment. The refuge is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService.\n  The specific acreage offered by the county will be determined upon a \nspecific appraisal of all the lands in order to provide for an equal \nvalue land trade.\n  While there is a commonly held notion that western ski areas resemble \nOregon's Mt. Bachelor or Colorado's Vail, the fact is that there are \nmany dozens of very small, financially marginal ski hills in the \nbackyards of many small western towns. Warner Canyon is one of them.\n  The Warner Canyon ski hill has been operated by the nonprofit Fremont \nHighlanders Ski Club since 1938. It's one of America's last nonprofit \nski hills. It has one lift--a T bar. It has 780 vertical feet of \nskiing. The ski area is about 5 miles from the town of Lakeview, which \nhas a population of roughly 2,500.\n  The people of Lakeview believe that this legislation is necessary to \nkeep the ski area viable. The Federal requirements for managing ski \nareas are more in tune with the Vails than the Warner Canyons. I'm told \nthat under county ownership the liability expense alone should be \nreduced tenfold. The forest supervisor tells us that it costs the \nForest Service about $10,000 per year to administer the ski area \npermit, yet the area generates just more than $400 per year in ski fee \nrevenues to the U.S. Treasury.\n  I also want to emphasize the benefits of this bill to the Hart \nMountain Antelope Refuge. As my colleagues well understand, too many of \nour national wildlife refuges contain private land inholdings over \nwhich the Federal Government has essentially no control. These lands \ncan be sold or developed at any time. If Lake County were ever strapped \nfor cash, it would certainly be their prerogative to sell these parcels \nto the highest bidder. With this acquisition we move closer to the \npermanent protection of this important Oregon wildlife refuge.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Gordon Smith.\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be printed in \nthe Record the bill and my statement, a document from the Lake County \nBoard of Commissioners entitled ``Reasons to support Warner Canyon Ski \nHill Ownership Transfer,'' and letters of support from the Fremont \nHighlanders Ski Club, Inc., and the Lake County Chamber of Commerce.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Fremont Highlanders have \n     operated this ski area for over 50 years. However, increasing \n     regulations, fees, and insurance costs have severely impacted \n     our ability to operate. We believe the land trade will reduce \n     our costs of operating our ski area and will allow us to \n     better serve our communities recreational interests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Michael Sabin,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      Lake County,\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                       Lakeview, OR, June 6, 1997.\n     Bob Pardue,\n     Chairman, Lake County Commissioners,\n     Courthouse, Lakeview, OR.\n       Dear Bob. On behalf of the Lake County Chamber of Commerce \n     Board of Directors, we would like to congratulate you on your \n     recent decision to make a land trade with the Fremont \n     National Forest, regarding the Warner Canyon Ski Area.\n       Maintaining the level of operation, to provide a quality \n     skiing experience for recreational skiers in Southeast \n     Oregon, has been a difficult challenge for the Fremont \n     Highlanders Ski Club. Liability Insurance has been a real \n     obstacle, as well as sporadic snow conditions. Thanks to \n     Collins McDonald Trust Fund, as well as other generous Lake \n     County businesses and citizens, we have been able to \n     financially survive.\n       Three years ago the chamber received a grant to promote \n     winter recreation in Lake County. The success of Warner \n     Canyon Ski Area is an important component to that promotion, \n     which impacts the local economy during the usual slow months.\n       We are very supportive of this trade and look forward to \n     many successful ski seasons in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Barb Gover,\n                        Director, Lake County Chamber of Commerce.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 882. A bill to improve academic and social outcomes for students \nby providing productive activities during after school hours; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           the after school education and safety act of 1997\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the After School \nEducation and Safety Act of 1997. This bill creates after school \nenrichment programs for kindergarten, elementary, and secondary school-\naged students. Today's youth face far greater social risks than did \ntheir parents and grandparents. According to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, youth between the ages of 12 and 17 are most at risk of \ncommitting violent acts and being victims of violent crimes between 3 \np.m. and 6 p.m.--a time when they are not in school.\n  My bill will help schools expand their capacity to address the needs \nof school-aged children between these critical hours. Since juvenile \ncrime peeks at the close of the schoolday--we need to give children a \nsafe and supervised place where they can use those hours to their best \nadvantage. Education is a key component of success. This bill seeks to \nincrease the academic success of students while working to improve \ntheir intellectual, social, physical, and cultural skills. For older \nstudents, programs will be available to prepare them for work force \nparticipation.\n  Schools receiving grants under the act must provide at least two of \nthe following programs: Mentoring, academic assistance, recreational \nactivities, or technology training. It is critical that we work with \nour Nation's children during their school years to create strong \nfoundations in academics, technology, and other fields which will carry \nthem into adulthood.\n  Schools will be able to work within their communities to design \nprograms that meet the needs of the area. Activities authorized by the \nbill are to take place in a school building or another public facility \ndesignated by the school.\n  Mr. President, the best investment we can make in this country is in \nour children. I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and join \nme in making after school a safe time for our Nation's children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be included \nin the Record.\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 882\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today's youth face far greater social risks than did \n     their parents and grandparents.\n       (2) Students spend more of their waking hours alone, \n     without supervision, companionship, or activity than the \n     students spend in school.\n       (3) Law enforcement statistics show that youth who are ages \n     12 through 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and \n     being victims of violent acts between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.\n       (4) Greater numbers of students are failing in school and \n     the consequences of academic failure are more dire in 1997 \n     than ever before.\n\n     SEC. 4. GOALS.\n\n       The goals of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To increase the academic success of students.\n       (2) To improve the intellectual, social, physical, and \n     cultural skills of students.\n       (3) To promote safe and healthy environments for students.\n       (4) To prepare students for workforce participation.\n       (5) To provide alternatives to drug, alcohol, tobacco, and \n     gang activity.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage savings and investment through individual retirement \naccounts, to provide pension security, portability, and simplification, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         the retirement income security and savings act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to rise to introduce \nthe Retirement Income, Security, and Savings Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents the culmination of literally \nmonths of work by the Republican Retirement Security Task Force, which \nI chair. It embodies a collection of policies which would, if enacted, \ndo a tremendous amount for a critical national need--to increase \nretirement saving and ultimately, therefore, retirement income for all \nAmericans.\n  It has become almost axiomatic to state that America is in dire need \nof a qualitative increase in its level of retirement saving. None of \nthe three legs of the metaphorical retirement stool--Social Security, \nemployer-provided pensions, and individual saving--are saving an \nadequate amount for 21st century retirement needs. Social Security is \nnot really a savings program at all, but is rather funded on a pay-as-\nyou-go basis, the surplus loaned to the Government, to be paid back \nfrom general revenues at a future date. Employer-provided pensions only \nreach half of the working population, and there are problems of \nunderfunding facing even the portion that are covered. And, as a \ngeneral rule, only a few Americans are putting away sufficient saving \non their own initiative to meet their future retirement income needs.\n  I would like to take a few moments to describe the current details \nwith respect to retirement income in America, and then how our package \naddresses those needs. Only then, I believe, can my colleagues fully \nappreciate the quality and importance of the policy recommendations \nthat we are making.\n  The typical retired American today receives retirement income from a \nvariety of sources. On average, 41.7 percent comes from Social \nSecurity, 20.5 percent from asset income, 20.1 percent from pensions, \n14.8 percent is annually earned, and the remaining 3 percent comes from \na variety of other sources, including welfare programs such as SSI and \nunemployment compensation.\n  I would stress that this is only an average picture. The reality \nvaries greatly from American to American. We need to look at the oldest \nof Americans to see the future of an aging nation. Americans currently \n80 and older receive 52.6 percent of their income from Social Security, \nwhereas their pensions provide proportionally less--down to 15.3 \npercent. And, of course, they are less able to earn money at this age, \nthus earnings make up only 3.9 percent of their income.\n\n  I describe this situation because it dramatizes our future. Americans \ncontinue to have longer and longer life expectancies. The population \naged 80 and older is growing faster than any other age group, \nproportionally. This are group currently receives inadequate pension \nand individual savings income, and has needed to rely more heavily on \nSocial Security. The plain fact is that as America grows older, this \ngroup of Americans simply must have access to more in the areas of \npension coverage and personal savings if they are to maintain a \ndignified standard of living.\n  The current national picture is also not equitable with regard to the \ntreatment of women. Currently, women are almost twice as likely as men \nto live in poverty in their retirement years--a 15.7 percent poverty \nrate versus an 8.9 percent poverty rate for men. For women who are \nwidowed or divorced, the picture is worse still--widows suffer a \npoverty rate of 21.5 percent, divorcees 29.1 percent. Thus, the task \nforce placed high priority on including provisions designed to help \nwomen generate saving in their own name.\n  Also of note are the discrepancies in income sources between high-\nincome\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nand low-income Americans. Among elderly Americans in the lowest \nquintile, Social Security constitutes 82.6 percent of their income. \nTheir next biggest source is public assistance--SSI, unemployment \ncompensation, and other such sources--which make up 9.1 percent of \ntheir income stream. Thus, poorest Americans would benefit the most \nfrom expansions of existing pension coverage.\n  Mr. President, it is, therefore, essential that this Nation pursue \npolicies that increase pension and individual savings in the private \nsector. One added reason for this is the plight of Social Security. \nThus far, Congress has not been willing to address Social Security's \nenormous unfunded liability. Under current practices, we will continue \nto pour the annual Social Security surplus into current Government \nconsumption. We have no method to pay for Social Security's trillions \nin unfunded liability other than the promise of future Government \ntaxation.\n  Although few are willing to admit it, it is clear from the \nprojections that Social Security in the 21st century will not be able \nto deliver as large a share of the income of retired Americans as it \ndoes today. That is simply not possible when the projected worker-to-\ncollector ratios for the program will hit only 2 to 1 within a \ngeneration. When the program is brought into balance, as it must be, \nwhat will happen to the millions of Americans who rely on Social \nSecurity for the majority of their retirement income? The answer, Mr. \nPresident, depends on how successful we are in providing for retirement \nincome via other means.\n  Our task force approached these problems in as objective a fashion as \nwe could. We decided early on that the problem was one of inadequate \nsaving, instead of one of inadequate regulation, or inequitable \ndistribution. Indeed, many existing regulations and distribution \nrequirements have actually worked against the aim of expanded pension \ncoverage, because they deter employers from providing it. The result is \nthat many small business owners do not believe that they can afford to \noffer pension coverage. Mr. President, we must begin to make it \neasier--in fact, we must begin to make it attractive--for employers to \noffer pensions.\n  There is a single common theme that runs through the Republican \napproach to retirement security: Retirement income comes from \nretirement saving. It comes from nowhere else. Everything in our \npackage aims at generating additional retirement saving in a reasonably \ndirect way. Government must do more to encourage saving, and in many \nways this is best done by doing less to discourage it. We have produced \na package that would make it easier for additional retirement saving to \noccur, by facilitating saving via a broad variety of measures.\n  That is not to say that we did not identify areas of the law where \nthere were simply technical adjustments to be made. Often there are \nabsurd regulatory inconsistencies in our pension structures. We \npenalize employers who do not properly fund pension plans, but on the \nother hand, we prevent others from funding the full amount of \nliabilities that they know are coming. Or we will treat employer \ncontributions one way, but the contributions of the self-employed \nanother way. There is a host of confusing, sometimes inconsistent, \nregulations in effect. We did our best to identify and to rectify such \nproblems and inconsistencies in existing law.\n\n  This package seeks to increase saving through individual savings \nincentives, through employer funding of pension plans, through \nsimplification, through expanded portability, through defined \ncontribution plans, and through defined benefit plans. We attempted to \nincrease savings on every front. We cast our net wide. Thus, we have a \npackage that is a veritable smorgasbord of reforms, more than Congress \ncould possibly enact this year. But we have produced a host of \nproposals that are each candidates for at least partial inclusion in \nbudget reconciliation, and I believe that Congress would do well to \nfavorably consider them.\n  Because we attempted to approach our task with this specific policy \nobjective in mind--increasing savings--we did not set ourselves up to \noppose every idea that originated in another place. The centerpiece \nproposals of our package--full IRA deductibility for every American, \nthe WISE women's equity package, and the new SAFE defined benefit \nplan--are not included in the package of pension proposals offered by \nthe minority party. But we did not reject some good technical \ncorrections merely because they have appeared in the work of others. I \nbelieve that there is a basis for Congress to review the proposals \noffered separately by Republicans, and by Democrats, and to pursue many \ninitiatives on which there is a broad area of common ground.\n  I would like to thank Majority Leader Lott for convening the task \nforce and for selecting me to be its chairman. I also wish to thank \nSenator Larry Craig for his helpful coordination of the various \nRepublican task force efforts. I wish to thank each of the members of \nthe Senate Republican Retirement Security Task Force--Senators Bond, \nCollins, Hutchison, Jeffords, Murkowski, Roberts, Santorum, Faircloth--\nbut most especially Finance Committee Chairman Senator William Roth, \nwhose work was absolutely instrumental to this drafting effort. I would \nlike to single out Doug Fisher of Senator Roth's staff for the \ntechnical advice and assistance that he provided to me and to my staff \nat every stage of this process.\n  It would be appropriate at this point to say a word of appreciation \nto Senator Graham of Florida as well, for his parallel work in \nfashioning a bipartisan package of pension reforms that I understand \nwill be introduced later this week. Our Republican task force has \ncommunicated in open and good faith with his bipartisan group, and \nthere have been times when we have found ourselves working on \noverlapping ground. Senator Graham and his staff have made important \nand original contributions to a bipartisan effort to promote retirement \nsecurity, and I believe that we can work with Senator Graham and others \nin this coalition, throughout the reconciliation process and beyond, to \npursue reforms of common interest.\n  Let me now turn to the specific provisions of our legislation.\n  Title I would establish a fully deductible IRA for every American. \nThe IRA is becoming a cornerstone of national retirement policy, and \nthe Federal Government should not deter anyone from participating by \nlimiting or eliminating the tax deductibility of the option. We endorse \nthe Roth/Breaux schedule of phasing out the limits on IRA deductibility \nby 2001, and of indexing the contribution limits for inflation. We \nwould also create the option of the back-loaded IRA--in which \ncontributions are taxed when they are made, instead of upon \nwithdrawal--in order to mitigate the revenue implications in the near-\nterm. Stimulating personal saving--making it attractive for every \nAmerican to adopt the habit of contributing to an IRA each year--is an \nimportant first step toward meeting tomorrow's retirement income needs.\n  Title II is the WISE bill introduced earlier this year. Already this \nimportant piece of legislation has 25 co-sponsors. These women's equity \ninitiatives include a strengthening of the homemaker IRA, permitting a \nhomemaker to make a fully deductible IRA contribution, regardless of \nwhether his or her spouse receives an employer-provided pension. In \naddition, we would permit individuals who take maternity or paternity \nleave to make catch-up contributions to their 401-(k) or similar plans \nfor the time missed from work. And--the most creative part of our \nlegislation--we would permit individuals who are absent from pension \nplan participation for an extended period to raise a child--to make \nadditional contributions upon return, and to catch up for up to 18 \nyears of absence.\n  The WISE legislation is extremely popular, and I do not need \nto describe it at length here. However, I would say that it recognizes \nan important principle too frequently unrecognized in our pension law: \nThat individuals do not have the same opportunities to save at every \nstage of their lives. Frequently, the financial pressures of raising a \nchild prevent parents from attending to their own retirement saving. \nWISE attempts to give some flexibility, to permit individuals to put \naway more money when, at last, they have the surplus income to do so.\n\n  Title III of our bill is targeted at expanding pension coverage in \nsmall\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\nbusiness. This, Mr. President, is a title of our legislation that is \njust as vital as the first two, for a number of important reasons. \nFirst, it is those individuals who work for small businesses who are \nmost likely to lack pension coverage. Second, we felt it was very \nimportant in this legislation to do something to make defined benefit \nplans more attractive to employers. The task force concluded that \nremoving impediments to defined contribution saving was extremely \nimportant, but we could not stop there: We needed to pursue parallel \nmethods with respect to establishing pension coverage for individuals \nwho do not have discretionary income to put into retirement savings.\n  Title III of our legislation begins with the SAFE plan--a fully \nportable, fully funded, defined benefit plan designed for small \nbusiness. This legislation attempts to make defined benefit plans a \nmore realistic option for small businesses, just as the SIMPLE plan did \nlast year for defined contribution plans. Because SAFE is a method of \ncreating a defined benefit plan without running into the problems with \nfunding and complex regulation that have deterred small businesses from \noffering other defined benefit plans, it is good for employers. And \nbecause it offers a defined benefit funded by the employer, rather than \ndependent upon employee contributions, it is good for lower income \nemployees.\n  In essence, the way SAFE works is this: An employer can choose to \nestablish a SAFE plan that accrues at either a 1-percent, a 2-percent, \nor a 3-percent rate. What this means is that for every year the \nemployee works, they get either 1 percent, 2 percent, or 3 percent of \ntheir salary as their defined benefit upon retirement. If, for example, \nthe employee works for 25 years in a plan that accrues at 3 percent, \nthen their retirement benefit will be 75 percent of working income. \nEveryone in the plan accrues at the same rate. So the employer can make \na choice: If they fund at the lower rate--say, 1 percent--then they \nwill diminish the size of their own pension benefits as well as that of \ntheir employees. By treating all employees equally, across the board, \nSAFE bypasses the need for complex nondiscrimination requirements. Fair \ntreatment is assured by the basic construction of the plan.\n\n  SAFE plans are fully funded by the employer. The employer must fund \nthe benefits such that, when a 5 percent interest rate is assumed, \nenough will be present at time of retirement to pay the defined \nbenefit. If the employer is able to do better, in managing the plan, \nthen that 5 percent interest rate, then the extra goes back into the \npension benefits. Annually, the plan is monitored to ensure that the \nemployer has kept pace with that 5 percent rate. If not, then the \nemployer must make a makeup contribution at year's end. So, in all \nevents, the pension benefits are protected. It is annually assured that \nthe promised benefits are fully funded, and it is also possible that \nthe beneficiary will receive more. Moreover, because each individual's \npension benefit is fully funded in advance by a defined amount, it is \nfully portable--the benefit can travel with the employee easily when \nthey switch jobs.\n  The SAFE plan gives a small business owner the opportunity to create \na simple defined benefit plan that has the potential to provide large \npension benefits--for both the employees and the employer. Because of \nthat potential and its resulting incentive, and because of the \nprotection from messy discrimination rules, SAFE plans will be an \nattractive alternative for small businesses. And by creating this \nalternative, we increase the opportunities for lower income individuals \nto receive defined benefit pension coverage that they might not be able \nto fund via a defined contribution system.\n  It will take too much of the Senate's time to list every aspect of \nour comprehensive legislation, but I invite Senators to review this and \nother provisions we have created to make pensions more attractive to \nsmall business owners in title III of the bill.\n  Title IV contains assorted measures to ensure pension portability. \nThis is essential in a mobile society such as ours, in which pension \ncoverage is lowest among short-tenured young workers, moving from job \nto job. We do not generate retirement saving if these pension benefits \nsimply turn into a cash-out every time one changes jobs. Our \nlegislation would protect plans that accept rollovers from \ndisqualification, and also specifically facilitate rollovers between a \nlarge variety of plans--government plans, nonprofit plans, and others.\n\n  Title V of the legislation deals with pension security. We felt it \nwas important to highlight our finding that pension managers have an \nobligation to comply with the intent of ERISA, which directs that they \nmanage these plans with an eye solely toward maximizing the \naccumulation of pension assets, not pursuing an external purpose, \nwhether social, political, or any other. Accordingly, we would \neliminate the promotion of the Department of Labor's Economically \nTargeted Investments Program. The last thing that we want, Mr. \npresident, is for pension managers to feel pressured into investing in \nany vehicles that they do not believe meet the best interests of future \npension beneficiaries. To the extent that these economically targeted \ninvestments produce healthy, sound investments, they do not need \npromotion by the Department of Labor. To the extent that they do not, \npension managers should not invest in them.\n  Also in title V, Mr. President, is an important provision that \ngradually increases the current limitation on full employer funding of \npension liabilities. Right now, employers may fund for no more than 150 \npercent of current liability, even when they may know that future \nliabilities are accruing and must be funded. This is short-sighted \npolicy by the Federal Government, undertaken solely to protect the \nFederal balance sheet, by limiting the tax deductibility of pension \ncontributions. I would argue that this existing policy, in the long \nrun, does not even protect the Federal balance sheet, because \nultimately, these liabilities must be funded, and the deduction \ntherefore taken. It is better to permit employers to invest the money \nnow, and to let that investment compound to meet future liabilities, \nrather than to forbid them from doing so, and thereby force them to \nmake a larger contribution later--and then claim an even larger \ndeduction. We must take a far-sighted approach to funding pensions, and \nnot discourage proper pension funding simply because we are looking at \na short-term budget window here in the Federal Government. Our \nprovision would gradually increase the 150 percent limit, by 5 percent \nevery 2 years.\n  Finally, title VI deals with another vital area of pension reform--\npension simplification. In this title, Mr. President, Senators will \nfind a host of changes that eliminate existing inconsistencies within \nlaw and regulation, as well as facilitating the use of electronic \ntechnology to replace cumbersome paperwork. I would draw the attention \nof the Senate to one particular provision here that would exempt \nGovernment plans from existing nondiscrimination rules. These \nnondiscrimination rules, Mr. President, were not designed for \nGovernment plans, and it has proved very vexatious to determine how to \napply them in cases when the employer is a government body. I believe \nthat many Senators have probably heard from administrators of State \ngovernment retirement plans regarding the need to make this exemption \npermanent, and our bill would do so. This is one provision, Mr. \nPresident, that I believe we should seek to include in budget \nreconciliation this year.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to introduce this legislation. Tax law \nin this area is complicated and dry--I have become too familiar with \nthat these last months--but it is imperative that we shoulder the \nburden of reforming it to make it work more simply, and more \neffectively, to encourage greater retirement income saving. I have \nworked long and hard to create this legislation, and I believe that it \nrepresents a good comprehensive effort to enhance the future retirement \nsecurity of millions of Americans. I thank the rest of the task force, \nand the majority leader, for this opportunity to lead in this important \nwork, and I commend this legislation to the Senate for its favorable \nconsideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n           By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n             Bryan, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n             Chafee):\n  S. 885. A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit \nfees charged by financial institutions for\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\nthe use of automatic teller machines, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  the fair atm fees for consumers act\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kerry as my \nprimary cosponsor to reintroduce legislation to protect consumers from \nexcessive and redundant fees imposed by automated teller machine [ATM] \noperators. I am also pleased that Senators Boxer, Bryan, Moseley-Braun, \nMurray, and Chafee have chosen to join with me once again in \ncosponsoring this important initiative.\n  Mr. President, last year, I introduced legislation to eliminate ATM \nfees. At that time, some of my colleagues argued that consumers could \nalways choose to go to an ATM that does not double-charge. I predicted \nthen that if we permit this practice, eventually every bank will \ndouble-charge consumers would have no choice but to pay through the \nnose.\n  Last fall, I asked the General Accounting Office to examine ATM fees. \nI want to know how many banks are double charging and how much \nconsumers are being forced to pay.\n  This morning the Banking Committee heard GAO's results. Their results \ndetail the spread of the anticonsumer, anticompetitive, and anti-free-\nmarket practice--double ATM fees.\n  In a nutshell, this abusive practice is spreading like wildfire and \nconsumers across the country are getting burned. When I received the \nGAO report, I was shocked to find that, in just over a year, the number \nof ATM's that double charge consumers has risen 320 percent since the \nend of 1995. That means that consumers have less and less of a choice \nwhen they need to use an ATM.\n  The GAO study also reveals that 54 percent of the ATM's in the United \nStates are now double-charging. Soon consumers will have nowhere to \nturn. For that reason, I am reintroducing my bill, the Fair ATM Fees \nfor Consumers Act.\n  Until April of last year, most consumers paid a fee, usually about \n$1, to their own bank each time they used another bank's ATM. This fee \nwas intended to cover the cost of the transaction. Now, in addition to \nthat fee, the ATM operator may charge these consumers a second fee. \nThis second fee can run as high as $3 per transaction. Many consumers \nare forced to pay a total of $3 or more just to take $20 of their own \nmoney out of the bank. That's outrageous.\n  Double-charging was prohibited in most of the country until April 1, \n1996, when Visa and MasterCard, which operate the two largest ATM \nnetworks, endorsed this practice. When the Banking Committee held a \nhearing on double ATM charges last summer Visa and MasterCard refused \nto appear. I intend to hold further hearings on this issue and I fully \nexpect Visa and MasterCard to testify as to why they suddenly permitted \nthis double charge which hurts consumers and community banks.\n  Recent estimates show that the average consumer is paying a whopping \n$155 per year to use automated teller machines or ATM's. The average \nfamily will pay several times that amount. That's outrageous. The banks \nare making windfall profits from working people.\n  A transaction conducted at an ATM costs about 25 cents while the same \ntransaction conducted by a teller in a bank branch costs well over a \ndollar. Realizing this, banks strongly encouraged their customers to \nuse ATM's. ATM's appeared everywhere as banks cut bank on branches and \nteller service. ATM networks were formed when individual banks joined \ntogether and agreed to let each other's customers use any ATM in the \nnetwork without paying any extra charges.\n  Now, banks are suddenly claiming that ATM's are no longer cost \neffective. They have decided to soak consumers with multiple fees every \ntime they need to take money out of their accounts.\n  Banks report record profits in part by slapping customers and \nnoncustomers with ever-increasing convenience fees. In many cases, \nconsumers are forced to pay multiple fees for a single ATM transaction. \nImagine, working men and women are paying two separate fees for the \nprivilege of getting their own money.\n  This is a windfall for the banks. The consumer receives no additional \nbenefit and the bank provides no additional service. A recent study by \nthe U.S. Public Interest Research Group [U.S. PIRG] reported that banks \nwill profit $1.9 billion from ATM surcharges alone this year. This \ndouble charge is a free lunch for the banks and consumers are footing \nthe bill. I am not opposed to banks making a profit, but double ATM \nfees unfairly exploit the consumer.\n  Banks argue that consumers have the freedom to go to an ATM that \ndoesn't double-charge. But working people on their lunch hours, or late \nat night, have no time to hunt for a free ATM when they need cash. As \nthe GAO reported, those free ATM's are getting very hard to find.\n  The people who are getting hit the hardest are the ones who can least \nafford it. While many Americans can simply choose to avoid extra fees \nby taking $100 or $200 every time they go to an ATM, many families \nstruggling to make ends meet don't have that option. Senior citizens on \nfixed incomes and students with little money to space are being forced \nto pay $2 or $3 just to take out $20. A $3 fee on a $200 withdrawal is \na nuisance, but taking a $3 bite out of a $20 withdrawal is outrageous.\n  Mr. President, double-charging is a monopolistic practice that \neliminates competition and distorts the free market. Banks are using \ndouble ATM fees to squeeze small competitors out of business. Community \nbanks, thrifts, and credit unions have customers who depend on access \nto other institutions' ATM's. These customers now pay twice whenever \nthey use an ATM. Large banks with many ATM's are exploiting this \nsituation to lure away small bank customers. Eventually, small banks \nwill not be able to survive. That's not competition, that's a monopoly.\n  When ATM's were first introduced, banks claimed that these machines \nwould give consumers more choices and greater convenience. ATM's were \nsupposed to reduce costs and the savings could be passed on to \nconsumers. Today, when bank profits are at record highs, it is \nastonishing that banks cannot resist the temptation to squeeze \nconsumers a little harder by doubling ATM fees,\n  I look forward to holding additional hearings on ATM fees during this \nCongress to provide opponents and proponents of the bill, including \nrepresentatives of various States that are attempting to enact bans, an \nopportunity to participate in this debate.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, in introducing the Fair ATM Fees for \nConsumers Act of 1997.\n  Today, in the Banking Committee, representatives of the U.S. General \nAccounting Office discussed the findings\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\nof their report on the growth of ATM surcharges. It is a fascinating \nreport, and I recommend our colleagues take a look at it. I will \nhighlight some of the findings, especially as they pertain to my home \nState.\n  I will tell you, Mr. President, it is not often in the Banking \nCommittee that passions run this high on a financial services issue. I \nhave heard from officials of large banks who tell me that prohibiting \nATM surcharges is tantamount to nationalizing our banking industry.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that it is the business of the U.S. \nSenate to set prices and fees at banks and other financial \ninstitutions. I am a great believer in the free market--not the Federal \nGovernment--dictating fee structures. But there is a general sense of \nfairness that is being violated in this surcharge.\n  When a depositor opens an account, he or she knows the fees \nassociated with transactions. It is current federal law--found in \nstatutes like the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Truth-in-Savings \nAct, and the Truth-in-Lending Act--that mandates fees to be disclosed \nto the consumer. So, when we open a bank account, we know how much each \ntransaction will cost.\n  But now, with this new surcharge, we are left in the dark. In the \nabsence of disclosure law dealing with surcharges, we don't find out, \nin many cases, how much it will cost to use an ATM machine not \nassociated with our particular bank until our statement appears in the \nmail, long after the ATM transaction is completed.\n  That is bad for consumers and it is bad precedent. And, as the GAO \nreport testifies, the trend is not favorable. Historic mergers, \nconsolidations, and acquisitions have taken place in the financial \nservice industry. Bank lobby hours have been curtailed so drastically, \nand so many human tellers replaced by machines, that we are forced to \nuse ATM's. This is the undeniable direction of the industry.\n  Mr. President, some of the biggest banks argue that ATM fees are an \noutgrowth of the convenience consumers derive from using ATM's. But I \nsuspect that other forces are at play. Commercial banks posted record \nprofits last year, surpassing the previous record-breaking year. This \nnew fee is not needed to ensure that banks are profitable.\n  Mr. President, last year, a constituent of mine from Dorchester, MA, \ntestified before the Banking Committee on this issue. He owns a \nprofitable bank with one ATM machine. He runs the bank well and serves \nthe community. But his small bank is no match for far bigger \ncompetitors. He contends that these surcharges are designed by the big \nbanks to draw customers away from community banks. This may not be an \nissue of establishing prices and fees; this has all the coloration of \nan antitrust issue. I want to set the marker down clearly--the Congress \nneeds to do a better job in monitoring and preventing the trend of \nconsolidation from running the smaller banks out of business.\n  In Massachusetts, the two largest banks own more than 62 percent of \nthe ATM's in the Commonwealth. The GAO report tells us that, \nnationally, one-third of all ATM's are owned by large banks. So, \nMassachusetts has double the national concentration. And that is a \ncritical measure, Mr. President. The GAO report found that ATM \nsurcharges are more prevalent among larger banks, 98 percent of which \nown ATM's. Fifty-four percent of large institutions assessed a \nsurcharge as opposed to 32 percent of smaller institutions. That is the \nstatic measure, which is significant enough, but the trend is even more \ndisturbing. The number of ATM's assessing a surcharge has risen 320 \npercent in the past 13 months. The highest surcharge found was $3 and \nthe average surcharge is $1.14, up from 99 cents last year.\n  I will say that I appreciate the fact that BankBoston--one of the two \nlarge banks in Massachusetts--does not impose surcharges at all. I also \nknow that the Massachusetts Bankers Association is grappling with this \nissue, trying to find some accommodation, and I am willing to listen to \nits arguments on this issue. My mind is certainly open to alternatives \nto the current draft of our legislation. But, Mr. President, I must say \nthat the findings of the GAO report do little to dissuade me that we \nmust move forward to prohibit these surcharges.\n  I thank my friend, the chairman of the Banking Committee, for his \nleadership.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate my \ncolleague, the Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, for his \nleadership on this bill, the Fair ATM Fees for Consumers Act.\n  Few Americans will quarrel with the issue this bill addresses: \nsurcharging, or double charging consumers for a single ATM transaction, \nis unfair and unnecessary.\n  Many banks charge their customers for using foreign ATM's--those \nATM's not owned by the customer's bank. These fees are disclosed to the \ncustomer in advance, allowing consumers to shop for and choose banks \nthat offer the best package of services at the best price.\n  I don't have a problem with that kind of fee. Customers have that \ninformation well in advance, and at a time they can use it. If the \nservices offered by banks fail to meet the customer's satisfaction, \ncustomers can take their business elsewhere.\n  Surcharging, however, undermines all that. Last April, the major \ncomputer networks allowed ATM owners to begin charging fees to \ncustomers using foreign ATM's. From that day, the floodgates opened, \nand now customers nationwide are being charged twice for the same \ntransaction--first by their own institution, and by the institution \nowning the ATM machine.\n  These costs are spreading. According to a recent General Accounting \nOffice report commissioned by the Senator from New York, ATM surcharges \nhave ballooned 320 percent since 1995.\n  One example of the surcharge boom is in my hometown of Chicago. \nEarlier this month, First Chicago NBD instituted surcharges, affecting \n710 ATM's in the area. That decision, coupled with the 1,550 ATM's in \nthe region already levying surcharges, now means that more than half of \nthe 4,400 ATM's in the Chicago area have a surcharge.\n  Mr. President, if current trends continue, few ATM's will remain that \nhave no surcharge, and consumers, despite surcharge warnings posted on \nthe computer screen or on the machine, will truly have no alternative \nbut to be charged twice for the same transaction.\n  I am aware that there are some costs to convenience. There are more \nthan 122,000 ATM's around the Nation, almost 5 times the number in \nplace a decade ago. Americans used ATM machines more than 9 billion \ntimes last year, accessing their bank accounts and other financial \nservices 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I know there are costs \nassociated with deploying these new machines, handling increased \ntransactions, and other maintenance and safety issues.\n  It should not be forgotten, however, that banks moved customers to \nATM's because, compared to teller transactions, ATM's were cheaper. \nAccording to a Mentis Corp. study, an ATM cash withdrawal from an in-\nbranch ATM costs an average of 22 to 28 cents, while the cost of a \nteller transaction is 90 cents to $1.15. And in some cases, banks \ncharge customers for completing transactions with a teller if those \ntransactions could have been completed at an ATM.\n  Certainly ATM's are a convenience for customers, but the truth is \nthat banks have deployed more ATM's because it means lower costs to \nbanks.\n  I remember when banks paid their customers for the use of their \nmoney. Today, however, it's increasingly expensive for the average \nworking family to manage even a simple banking account. Americans who \nmake timely credit card payments, or no payments at all, face higher \nfees. Americans who avoid special banking services are considered \nunprofitable customers, and face higher fees.\n  Now, with ATM surcharges, Americans are discovering that they must \npay banks an additional $155 each year simply to access their own \nmoney.\n  The market is out of whack. The pubic knows this is unfair, and their \nvisceral reaction is a response to market excess.\n  I am hopeful that the financial industry will take the necessary \nsteps to remedy this problem. Otherwise, the Government has a duty to \ncorrect the abuse of double and triple charging\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\npeople for accessing their own hard-earned dollars.\n  It is time to stop nickel and diming the American pocket. That's why \nI'm pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I urge its swift \napproval by the U.S. Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 886. A bill to reform the health care liability system and improve \nhealth care quality through the establishment of quality assurance \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n   THE HEALTH CARE LIABILITY REFORM AND QUALITY ASSURANCE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Health \nCare Liability Reform and Quality Assurance Act of 1997. This is \nvirtually the same legislation as S. 454 that I introduced in the last \nCongress with Senators Lieberman and Kassebaum. That bill was reported \nout of the Labor Committee and received the support of 53 Senators when \nit was added as an amendment to the product liability legislation. \nUltimately, however, the amendment was withdrawn under the threat of a \nfilibuster. I am very happy to, once again, be joining with Senator \nLieberman in this effort.\n  Health care liability is one issue on which there has been some \nbipartisan consensus about the need to make significant changes. This \nbill which I am introducing today with the cosponsorship and assistance \nof Senator Lieberman represents this bipartisan effort.\n  The purpose of our bill is to promote patient safety, compensate \nthose who suffer injuries fully and fairly, without enriching lawyers \nand bureaucrats, make health care more accessible, gain some cost \ncontainment in health care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship \nand encourage medical innovation. Our present system, unfortunately, \ndoes none of the above.\n  First of all, patients don't get compensated. The Rand Corp. has \nreported that only 43 cents of every dollar spent in the liability \nsystem goes to the injured party. That means lawyers, experts, and \ncourt fees eat up a significant percentage of every dollar spent in the \nliability system.\n  Second, the prohibitive cost of liability insurance means some \ndoctors won't provide care to those in our society who need it most. \nHalf-a-million rural women can't get an obstetrician to deliver their \nbabies. This problem, however, is not limited to rural areas. High \nmalpractice premiums force doctors to avoid the practice of medicine in \nurban areas as well, making it more difficult for minority communities \nto get necessary care.\n  Third, companies that invent new products are discouraged under the \ncurrent system from putting them on the market. Medical device \nmanufacturers are finding it more difficult to get raw materials to \nproduce life saving devices because of the risk of lawsuits.\n  Fourth, doctors are less likely to explore risky treatment because of \nthe proliferation of lawsuits. A doctor has a better than 1 in 3 chance \nof being sued during his practice years. And the likelihood of suit has \nnothing to do with whether the doctor was negligent. The General \nAccounting Office reports that almost 60 percent of all suits are \ndismissed without a verdict or even a settlement.\n  So, something is very wrong with our liability system, and our bill \nwill help solve the problem. I have included a summary of the bill's \nprovisions, and I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nand the summary be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that health care liability will get full \nconsideration and action in this Congress. It is very important that we \ntackle this issue, and I look forward to prompt action.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--The civil \n     justice system of the United States is a costly and \n     inefficient mechanism for resolving claims of health care \n     liability and compensating injured patients and the problems \n     associated with the current system are having an adverse \n     impact on the availability of, and access to, health care \n     services and the cost of health care in the United States.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--The health care and \n     insurance industries are industries affecting interstate \n     commerce and the health care liability litigation systems \n     existing throughout the United States affect interstate \n     commerce by contributing to the high cost of health care and \n     premiums for health care liability insurance purchased by \n     participants in the health care system.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--The health care liability \n     litigation systems existing throughout the United States have \n     a significant effect on the amount, distribution, and use of \n     Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide such individuals with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reform that is designed to--\n       (1) ensure that individuals with meritorious health care \n     injury claims receive fair and adequate compensation;\n       (2) improve the availability of health care service in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services; and\n       (3) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of the \n     current health care liability system of the United States to \n     resolve disputes over, and provide compensation for, health \n     care liability by reducing uncertainty and unpredictability \n     in the amount of compensation provided to injured \n     individuals.\n\n     SEC. 102. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this subtitle:\n       (1) Claimant.--The term ``claimant'' means any person who \n     commences a health care liability action, and any person on \n     whose behalf such an action is commenced, including the \n     decedent in the case of an action brought through or on \n     behalf of an estate.\n       (2) Clear and convincing evidence.--The term ``clear and \n     convincing evidence'' means that measure or degree of proof \n     that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm \n     belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations \n     sought to be established, except that such measure or degree \n     of proof is more than that required under preponderance of \n     the evidence, but less than that required for proof beyond a \n     reasonable doubt.\n       (3) Collateral source rule.--The term ``collateral source \n     rule'' means a rule, either statutorily established or \n     established at common law, that prevents the introduction of \n     evidence regarding collateral source benefits or that \n     prohibits the deduction of collateral source benefits from an \n     award of damages in a health care liability action.\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\n       (4) Contingency fee.--The term ``contingency fee'' means \n     any fee for professional legal services which is, in whole or \n     in part, contingent upon the recovery of any amount of \n     damages, whether through judgment or settlement.\n       (5) Economic losses.--The term ``economic losses'' means \n     objectively verifiable monetary losses incurred as a result \n     of the provision of (or failure to provide or pay for) health \n     care services or the use of a medical product, including past \n     and future medical expenses, loss of past and future \n     earnings, cost of obtaining replacement services in the home \n     (including child care, transportation, food preparation, and \n     household care), cost of making reasonable accommodations to \n     a personal residence, loss of employment, and loss of \n     business or employment opportunities.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.\n\n       A health care liability action that is subject to this Act \n     may not be initiated unless a complaint with respect to such \n     action is filed within the 2-year period beginning on the \n     date on which the claimant discovered or, in the exercise of \n     reasonable care, should have discovered the injury and its \n     cause, except that such an action relating to a claimant \n     under legal disability may be filed within 2 years after the \n     date on which the disability ceases. If the commencement of a \n     health care liability action is stayed or enjoined, the \n     running of the statute of limitations under this section \n     shall be suspended for the period of the stay or injunction.\n\n     SEC. 105. REFORM OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--With respect to a health care liability \n     action, an award for punitive damages may only be made, if \n     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if it is proven by \n     clear and convincing evidence that the defendant--\n       (1) intended to injure the claimant for a reason unrelated \n     to the provision of health care services;\n       (2) understood the claimant was substantially certain to \n     suffer unnecessary injury, and in providing or failing to \n     provide health care services, the defendant deliberately \n     failed to avoid such injury; or\n       (3) acted with a conscious, flagrant disregard of a \n     substantial and unjustifiable risk of unnecessary injury \n     which the defendant failed to avoid in a manner which \n     constitutes a gross deviation from the normal standard of \n     conduct in such circumstances.\n       (b) Punitive Damages Not Permitted.--Notwithstanding the \n     provisions of subsection (a), punitive damages may not be \n     awarded against a defendant with respect to any health care \n     liability action if no judgment for compensatory damages, \n     including nominal damages (under $500), is rendered against \n     the defendant.\n       (c) Procedure for Determining Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--In any health care liability action \n     subject to this subtitle in which punitive damages are \n     recoverable, the trier of fact shall determine, concurrent \n     with all other issues presented in such action, whether such \n     damages shall be allowed. If the trier of fact determines \n     that such damages are allowed, a separate proceeding shall be \n     conducted by the court to determine the amount of such \n     damages to be awarded.\n       (2) Separate proceeding.--At a separate proceeding to \n     determine the amount of punitive damages to be awarded under \n     paragraph (1), the court shall consider the following:\n       (A) The severity of the harm caused by the conduct of the \n     defendant.\n       (B) The duration of the conduct or any concealment of such \n     conduct by the defendant.\n       (C) The profitability of the conduct of the defendant.\n       (D) The number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by the \n     defendant of the kind\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\n     causing the harm complained of by the claimant.\n       (E) The total deterrent effect of other damages and \n     punishment imposed upon the defendant as a result of the \n     misconduct, including compensatory, exemplary and punitive \n     damage awards to individuals in situations similar to those \n     of the claimant and the severity of any criminal or \n     administrative penalties, or civil fines, to which the \n     defendant has been or may be subjected.\n       (3) Determination.--At the conclusion of a separate \n     proceeding under paragraph (1), the court shall determine the \n     amount of punitive damages to be awarded with respect to the \n     health care liability action involved and shall enter \n     judgment for that amount. The court shall clearly state its \n     reasons for setting the amount of such award in findings of \n     fact and conclusions of law, demonstrating consideration of \n     each of the factors described in paragraph (2).\n       (d) Limitation Amount.--The amount of damages that may be \n     awarded as punitive damages in any health care liability \n     action shall not exceed 3 times the amount awarded to the \n     claimant for the economic injury on which such claim is \n     based, or $250,000, whichever is greater. This subsection \n     shall be applied by the court and shall not be disclosed to \n     the jury.\n       (e) Restrictions Permitted.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to imply a right to seek punitive damages where \n     none exists under Federal or State law.\n\n     SEC. 106. PERIODIC PAYMENTS.\n\n       With respect to a health care liability action, if the \n     award of future damages exceeds $100,000, the adjudicating \n     body shall, at the request of either party, enter a judgment \n     ordering that future damages be paid on a periodic basis in \n     accordance with the guidelines contained in the Uniform \n     Periodic Payments of Judgments Act, as promulgated by the \n     National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in \n     July of 1990. The adjudicating body may waive the \n     requirements of this section if such body determines that \n     such a waiver is in the interests of justice.\n\n     SEC. 107. SCOPE OF LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--With respect to punitive and noneconomic \n     damages, the liability of each defendant in a health care \n     liability action shall be several only and may not be joint. \n     Such a defendant shall be liable only for the amount of \n     punitive or noneconomic damages allocated to the defendant in \n     direct proportion to such defendant's percentage of fault or \n     responsibility for the injury suffered by the claimant.\n       (b) Determination of Percentage of Liability.--With respect \n     to punitive or noneconomic damages, the trier of fact in a \n     health care liability action shall determine the extent of \n     each party's fault or responsibility for injury suffered by \n     the claimant, and shall assign a percentage of responsibility \n     for such injury to each such party.\n\n     SEC. 108. MANDATORY OFFSETS FOR DAMAGES PAID BY A COLLATERAL \n                   SOURCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--With respect to a health care liability \n     action, the total amount of damages received by an individual \n     under such action shall be reduced, in accordance with \n     subsection (b), by any other payment that has been, or will \n     be, made to an individual to compensate such individual for \n     the injury that was the subject of such action.\n       (b) Amount of Reduction.--The amount by which an award of \n     damages to an individual for an injury shall be reduced under \n     subsection (a) shall be--\n       (1) the total amount of any payments (other than such \n     award) that have been made or that will be made to such \n     individual to pay costs of or compensate such individual for \n     the injury that was the subject of the action; minus\n       (2) the amount paid by such individual (or by the spouse, \n     parent, or legal guardian of such individual) to secure the \n     payments described in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Determination of Amounts From Collateral Services.--The \n     reductions required under subsection (b) shall be determined \n     by the court in a pretrial proceeding. At the subsequent \n     trial--\n       (1) no evidence shall be admitted as to the amount of any \n     charge, payments, or damage for which a claimant--\n       (A) has received payment from a collateral source or the \n     obligation for which has been assured by a third party; or\n       (B) is, or with reasonable certainty, will be eligible to \n     receive payment from a collateral source of the obligation \n     which will, with reasonable certainty be assumed by a third \n     party; and\n       (2) the jury, if any, shall be advised that--\n       (A) except for damages as to which the court permits the \n     introduction of evidence, the claimant's medical expenses and \n     lost income have been or will be paid by a collateral source \n     or third party; and\n       (B) the claimant shall receive no award for any damages \n     that have been or will be paid by a collateral source or \n     third party.\n\n     SEC. 109. TREATMENT OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND OTHER COSTS.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Amount of Contingency Fees.--An attorney \n     who represents, on a contingency fee basis, a claimant in a \n     health care liability action may not charge, demand, receive, \n     or collect for services rendered in connection with such \n     action in excess of the following amount recovered by \n     judgment or settlement under such action:\n       (1) 33\\1/3\\ percent of the first $150,000 (or portion \n     thereof) recovered, based on after-tax recovery, plus\n       (2) 25 percent of any amount in excess of $150,000 \n     recovered, based on after-tax recovery.\n       (b) Calculation of Periodic Payments.--In the event that a \n     judgment or settlement includes periodic or future payments \n     of damages, the amount recovered for purposes of computing \n     the limitation on the contingency fee under subsection (a) \n     shall be based on the cost of the annuity or trust \n     established to make the payments. In any case in which an \n     annuity or trust is not established to make such payments, \n     such amount shall be based on the present value of the \n     payments.\n\n     SEC. 110. OBSTETRIC CASES.\n\n       With respect to a health care liability action relating to \n     services provided during labor or the delivery of a baby, if \n     the health care professional against whom the action is \n     brought did not previously treat the pregnant woman for the \n     pregnancy, the trier of fact may not find that the defendant \n     committed malpractice and may not assess damages against the \n     health care professional unless the malpractice is proven by \n     clear and convincing evidence.\n\n     SEC. 111. STATE-BASED ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n                   MECHANISMS.\n\n       (a) Establishment by States.--Each State is encouraged to \n     establish or maintain alternative dispute resolution \n     mechanisms that promote the resolution of health care \n     liability claims in a manner that--\n       (1) is affordable for the parties involved in the claims;\n       (2) provides for the timely resolution of claims; and\n       (3) provides the parties with convenient access to the \n     dispute resolution process.\n       (b) Guidelines.--The Attorney General, in consultation with \n     the Secretary and the Administrative Conference of the United \n     States, shall develop guidelines with respect to alternative \n     dispute resolution mechanisms that may be established by \n     States for the resolution of health care liability claims. \n     Such guidelines shall include procedures with respect to the \n     following methods of alternative dispute resolution:\n       (1) Arbitration.--The use of arbitration, a nonjury \n     adversarial dispute resolution process which may, subject to \n     subsection (c), result in a final decision as to facts, law, \n     liability or damages. The parties may elect binding \n     arbitration.\n       (2) Mediation.--The use of mediation, a settlement process \n     coordinated by a neutral third party without the ultimate \n     rendering of a formal opinion as to factual or legal \n     findings.\n       (3) Early neutral evaluation.--The use of early neutral \n     evaluation, in which the parties make a presentation to a \n     neutral attorney or other neutral evaluator for an assessment \n     of the merits, to encourage settlement. If the parties do not \n     settle as a result of assessment and proceed to trial, the \n     neutral evaluator's opinion shall be kept confidential.\n       (4) Early offer and recovery mechanism.--The use of early \n     offer and recovery mechanisms under which a health care \n     provider, health care organization, or any other alleged \n     responsible defendant may offer to compensate a claimant for \n     his or her reasonable economic damages, including future \n     economic damages, less amounts available from collateral \n     sources.\n       (5) No fault.--The use of a no-fault statute under which \n     certain health care liability actions are barred and \n     claimants are compensated for injuries through their health \n     plans or through other appropriate mechanisms.\n       (c) Further Redress.--\n       (1) In general.--The extent to which any party may seek \n     further redress (subsequent to a decision of an alternative \n     dispute resolution method) concerning a health care liability \n     claim in a Federal or State court shall be dependent upon the \n     methods of alternative dispute resolution adopted by the \n     State.\n       (2) Claimant.--With respect to further redress described in \n     paragraph (1), if the party initiating such court action is \n     the claimant and the claimant receives a level of damages \n     that is at least 25 percent less under the decision of the \n     court than under the State alternative dispute resolution \n     method, such party shall bear the reasonable costs, including \n     legal fees, incurred in the court action by the other party \n     or parties to such action.\n       (3) Provider or other defendant.--With respect to further \n     redress described in paragraph (1), if the party initiating a \n     court action is the health care professional, health care \n     provider health plan, or other defendant in a health care \n     liability action and the health care professional, health \n     care provider, health plan or other defendant is found liable \n     for a level of damages that is at least 25 percent more under \n     the decision of the court than under the State alternative \n     dispute resolution method, such party shall bear the \n     reasonable costs, including legal fees, incurred in the court \n     action by the other party or parties to such action.\n       (d) Technical Assistance and Evaluations.--\n       (1) Technical assistance.--The Attorney General may provide \n     States with technical assistance in establishing or \n     maintaining alternative dispute resolution mechanisms under \n     this section.\n       (2) Evaluations.--The Attorney General, in consultation \n     with the Secretary and the Administrative Conference of the \n     United States, shall monitor and evaluate the effectiveness \n     of State alternative dispute resolution mechanisms \n     established or maintained under this section.\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\n     SEC. 112. REQUIREMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF MERIT.\n\n       (a) Requiring Submission With Complaint.--Except as \n     provided in subsection (b) and subject to the penalties of \n     subsection (d), no health care liability action may be \n     brought by any individual unless, at the time the individual \n     commences such action, the individual or the individual's \n     attorney submits an affidavit declaring that--\n       (1) the individual (or the individual's attorney) has \n     consulted and reviewed the facts of the claim with a \n     qualified specialist (as defined in subsection (c));\n       (2) the individual or the individual's attorney has \n     obtained a written report by a qualified specialist that \n     clearly identifies the individual and that includes the \n     specialist's determination that, based upon a review of the \n     available medical record and other relevant material, a \n     reasonable medical interpretation of the facts supports a \n     finding that the claim against the defendant is meritorious \n     and based on good cause; and\n       (3) on the basis of the qualified specialist's review and \n     consultation, the individual, and if represented, the \n     individual's attorney, have concluded that the claim is \n     meritorious and based on good cause.\n       (b) Extension in Certain Instances.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), subsection (a) \n     shall not apply with respect to an individual who brings a \n     health care liability action without submitting an affidavit \n     described in such subsection if--\n       (A) despite good faith efforts, the individual is unable to \n     obtain the written report before the expiration of the \n     applicable statute of limitations;\n       (B) despite good faith efforts, at the time the individual \n     commences the action, the individual has been unable to \n     obtain medical records or other information necessary, \n     pursuant to any applicable law, to prepare the written report \n     requested; or\n       (C) the court of competent jurisdiction determines that the \n     affidavit requirement shall be extended upon a showing of \n     good cause.\n       (2) Deadline for submission where extension applies.--In \n     the case of an individual who brings an action to which \n     paragraph (1) applies, the action shall be dismissed unless \n     the individual submits the affidavit described in subsection \n     (a) not later than--\n       (A) in the case of an action to which subparagraph (A) of \n     paragraph (1) applies, 90 days after commencing the action; \n     or\n       (B) in the case of an action to which subparagraph (B) of \n     paragraph (1) applies, 90 days after obtaining the \n     information described in such subparagraph or when good cause \n     for an extension no longer exists.\n       (c) Qualified Specialist Defined.--\n       (1) In general.--As used in subsection (a), the term \n     ``qualified specialist'' means, with respect to a health care \n     liability action, a health care professional who has \n     expertise in the same or substantially similar area of \n     practice to that involved in the action.\n       (2) Evidence of expertise.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     evidence of required expertise may include evidence that the \n     individual--\n       (A) practices (or has practiced) or teaches (or has taught) \n     in the same or substantially similar area of health care or \n     medicine to that involved in the action; or\n       (B) is otherwise qualified by experience or demonstrated \n     competence in the relevant practice area.\n       (d) Sanctions for Submitting False Affidavit.--Upon the \n     motion of any party or on its own initiative, the court in a \n     health care liability action may impose a sanction on a \n     party, the party's attorney, or both, for--\n       (1) any knowingly false statement made in an affidavit \n     described in subsection (a);\n       (2) making any false representations in order to obtain a \n     qualified specialist's report; or\n       (3) failing to have the qualified specialist's written \n     report in his or her custody and control;\n\n     and may require that the sanctioned party reimburse the other \n     party to the action for costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n               Subtitle B--Biomaterials Access Assurance\n\n     SEC. 121. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 122. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 123.

or\n       (ii) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending that \n     the defendant is not a seller, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a seller under \n     section 125(c).\n       (4) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss.--\n       (A) In general.--The court shall rule on a motion to \n     dismiss filed under subsection (a) solely on the basis of the \n     pleadings of the parties made pursuant to this section and \n     any affidavits submitted by the parties pursuant to this \n     section.\n       (B) Motion for summary judgment.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, if the court determines that the pleadings \n     and affidavits made by parties pursuant to this section raise \n     genuine issues as concerning material facts with respect to a \n     motion concerning contractual requirements and \n     specifications, the court may deem the motion to dismiss to \n     be a motion for summary judgment made pursuant to subsection \n     (d).\n       (d) Summary Judgment.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Basis for entry of judgment.--A biomaterials supplier \n     shall be entitled to entry of judgment without trial if the \n     court finds there is no genuine issue as concerning any \n     material fact for each applicable element set forth in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 125(d).\n       (B) Issues of material fact.--With respect to a finding \n     made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a \n     genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence \n     submitted by claimant would be sufficient to allow a \n     reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the \n     jury found the evidence to be credible.\n       (2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for \n     summary judgment.--If, under applicable rules, the court \n     permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary \n     judgment made pursuant to this subsection, such discovery \n     shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine \n     issue of material fact exists as to the applicable elements \n     set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 125(d).\n       (3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier.--A \n     biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in \n     connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary \n     judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section \n     125(d) or the failure to establish the applicable elements of \n     section 125(d) solely to the extent permitted by the \n     applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against \n     nonparties.\n       (e) Stay Pending Petition for Declaration.--If a claimant \n     has filed a petition for a declaration pursuant to section \n     125(b)(3)(A) with respect to a defendant, and the Secretary \n     has not issued a final decision on the petition, the court \n     shall stay all proceedings with respect to that defendant \n     until such time as the Secretary has issued a final decision \n     on the petition.\n       (f) Manufacturer Conduct of Proceeding.--The manufacturer \n     of an implant that is the subject of an action covered under \n     this subtitle shall be permitted to file and conduct a \n     proceeding on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal \n     filed by a biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under \n     this section if the manufacturer and any other defendant in \n     such action enter into a valid and applicable contractual \n     agreement under which the manufacturer agrees to bear the \n     cost of such proceeding or to conduct such proceeding.\n       (g) Attorney Fees.--The court shall require the claimant to \n     compensate the biomaterials supplier (or a manufacturer \n     appearing in lieu of a supplier pursuant to subsection (f)) \n     for attorney fees and costs, if--\n       (1) the claimant named or joined the biomaterials supplier; \n     and\n       (2) the court found the claim against the biomaterials \n     supplier to be without merit and frivolous.\n\n     SEC. 127. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This subtitle shall apply to all civil actions covered \n     under this subtitle that are commenced on or after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, including any such action with \n     respect to which the harm asserted in the action or the \n     conduct that caused the harm occurred before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n                       Subtitle C--Applicability\n\n     SEC. 131. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This title shall apply to all civil actions covered under \n     this title that are commenced\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\n     on or after the date of enactment of this Act, including any \n     such action with respect to which the harm asserted in the \n     action or the conduct that caused the injury occurred before \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       TITLE II--PROTECTION OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS\n\n     SEC. 201. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR STATE HEALTH CARE QUALITY \n                   ASSURANCE AND ACCESS ACTIVITIES.\n\n       Each State shall require that not less than 50 percent of \n     all awards of punitive damages resulting from all health care \n     liability actions in that State, if punitive damages are \n     otherwise permitted by applicable law, be used for activities \n     relating to--\n       (1) the licensing, investigating, disciplining, and \n     certification of health care professionals in the State; and\n       (2) the reduction of malpractice-related costs for health \n     care providers volunteering to provide health care services \n     in medically underserved areas.\n\n     SEC. 202.

Such guidelines shall be modified \n     periodically when determined appropriate by the \n     Administrator. Such guidelines shall be advisory in nature \n     and not binding.\n       (c) Reports.--\n       (1) Initial report.--Not later than 6 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall prepare and \n     submit to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Commerce of the House of \n     Representatives, a report that contains--\n       (A) data concerning the availability of information \n     relating to risk management, quality assessment, patient \n     safety, and patient satisfaction;\n       (B) an estimation of the degree of consensus concerning the \n     accuracy and content of the information available under \n     subparagraph (A);\n       (C) a summary of the best practices used in the public and \n     private sectors for disseminating information to consumers; \n     and\n       (D) an evaluation of the National Practitioner Data Bank \n     (as established under the Health Quality Improvement Act of \n     1986), for reliability and validity of the data and the \n     effectiveness of the Data Bank in assisting hospitals and \n     medical groups in overseeing the quality of practitioners.\n       (2) Interim report.--Not later than 1 year after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall prepare and \n     submit to the Committees referred to in paragraph (1) a \n     report, based on the results of the advisory panel survey \n     conducted under subsection (a)(3), concerning--\n       (A) the consensus of indicators of patient safety and risk;\n       (B) an assessment of the consumer perspective on health \n     care quality that includes an examination of--\n       (i) the information most often requested by consumers;\n       (ii) the types of technical quality information that \n     consumers find compelling;\n       (iii) the amount of information that consumers consider to \n     be sufficient and the amount of such information considered \n     overwhelming; and\n       (iv) the manner in which such information should be \n     presented;\n\n     and recommendations for increasing the awareness of consumers \n     concerning such information;\n       (C) proposed methods, building on existing data gathering \n     and dissemination systems, for ensuring that such data is \n     available and accessible to consumers, employers, hospitals, \n     and patients;\n       (D) the existence of legal, regulatory, and practical \n     obstacles to making such data available and accessible to \n     consumers;\n       (E) privacy or proprietary issues involving the \n     dissemination of such data;\n       (F) an assessment of the appropriateness of collecting such \n     data at the Federal or State level;\n       (G) an evaluation of the value of permitting consumers to \n     have access to information contained in the National \n     Practitioner Data Bank and recommendations to improve the \n     reliability and validity of the information; and\n       (H) the reliability and validity of data collected by the \n     State medical boards and recommendations for developing \n     investigation protocols.\n       (3) Annual report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the submission of the report under paragraph (2), and each \n     year thereafter, the Administrator shall prepare and submit \n     to the Committees referred to in paragraph (1) a report \n     concerning the progress of the advisory panel in the \n     development of a consensus with respect to the findings of \n     the panel and in the development and modification of the \n     guidelines required under subsection (b).\n       (4) Termination.--The advisory panel shall terminate on the \n     date that is 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                        TITLE III--SEVERABILITY\n\n     SEC. 301. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of the provisions of such to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Health Care Liability Reform and Quality Assurance Act of 1997\n\n                       TITLE I--LIABILITY REFORM\n\n\n                subtitle A--health care liability reform\n\n     1. Scope\n       The bill: Applies to any action, filed in federal or state \n     court, against a health care provider, professional, payor, \n     hmo, insurance company or any other defendant (except in \n     cases based on vaccine-related injuries);\n       Preempts state law to the extent it is inconsistent with \n     the provisions herein; no preemption for state laws which \n     provide, among other things: a. additional defenses; b. \n     greater limitations on attorneys' fees; c. greater \n     restrictions on punitive or non-economic damages; d. maximum \n     limit on the total damages.\n       Does not create federal jurisdiction for health care \n     liability actions.\n     2. Uniform statute of limitations\n       Cases could be filed two years from the date that the \n     injury was discovered or should have been discovered, except \n     that any person under a legal disability may file within two \n     years after the disability ceases.\n     3. Limit on punitive damages\n       Punitive damages will be awarded if it is proven by clear \n     and convincing evidence that the defendant: a. intended to \n     injure; b. understood claimant was substantially certain to \n     suffer unnecessary injury and deliberately failed to avoid \n     injury; or c. acted with conscious disregard of substantial \n     and unjustifiable risk which defendant failed to avoid in a \n     way which constitutes a gross deviation from the normal \n     standard of conduct.\n       No punitive damages where compensatory damages of less than \n     $500 are awarded.\n       Trier of fact determines if punitive damages are allowed. \n     If so, then a separate proceeding is conducted by the court.\n       In determining the amount, court must consider only: a. \n     severity of harm; b. duration of defendant's conduct and any \n     concealment; c. profitability of defendant's conduct; d. \n     number of products sold/procedures rendered which caused \n     similar harm; e. similar awards of punitive damages in \n     similar circumstances; f. criminal penalties imposed on \n     defendant; g. civil fines imposed.\n       No award may exceed the greater of 3 times the amount of \n     economic damages or $250,000.\n     4. Periodic payment of future damages\n       No more than $100,000 of future damages may be required to \n     be paid in one single payment. The court will determine the \n     schedule for payments, based on projection of future losses \n     and reduced to present value. This requirement may be waived, \n     in the interests of justice.\n     5. Several, not joint, liability\n       A defendant would be liable only for the amount of non-\n     economic and punitive damages allocated to defendant's direct \n     proportion of fault or responsibility. The trier of fact \n     determines percentage of responsibility of each defendant.\n     6. Collateral source\n       Total damages must be reduced by payments from other \n     sources to compensate individuals for injury that is the \n     subject of the health care liability action. The offset is \n     reduced by any amount paid by the injured party (or family \n     member) to secure the payment. The reductions must be \n     determined by the judge in a pretrial proceeding.\n     7. Attorneys' fees\n       This section limits attorney contingent fees to 33\\1/3\\% of \n     the first $150,000 and 25% of any amount in excess of \n     $150,000.\n     8. Obstetric cases\n       This section precludes a malpractice award against a health \n     care professional relating to\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\n     delivery of a baby, if the health care professional did not \n     previously treat the woman during the pregnancy, unless \n     malpractice is proven by clear and convincing evidence.\n     9. State-based alternative dispute resolution\n       Prior to the filing, or immediately following the filing of \n     the action, the parties are encouraged to participate in a \n     state administered alternative dispute resolution system.\n       The Attorney General will develop adr methods for use by \n     the states, including arbitration, mediation, early neutral \n     evaluation, early offer and recovery. The parties may elect \n     binding arbitration.\n     10. Certificate of merit\n       The certificate of merit provision requires that, prior to \n     bringing a lawsuit, an individual (or his or her attorney) \n     must submit an affidavit declaring that a qualified \n     specialist reviewed the facts and concluded that the claim is \n     meritorious.\n       A qualified specialist means a health care professional \n     with expertise (the specialist practices or teaches or has \n     experience or demonstrated competence) in the same or \n     substantially similar area of practice as that involved in \n     the case.\n       A court may impose sanctions for the submission of a false \n     affidavit.\n\n\n                Subtitle B--Biomaterial Access Assurance\n\n     1. Summary\n       The Biomaterial Access Assurance Act would allow suppliers \n     of the raw materials (biomaterial) used to make medical \n     implants, to obtain dismissal, without extensive discovery or \n     other legal costs, in certain tort suits in which plaintiffs \n     allege harm from a finished medical implant.\n\n           TITLE II--PROTECTION OF PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\n     1. Quality assurance\n       The quality assurance section requires each state to \n     establish a health care quality assurance program and fund, \n     approved by the Secretary of HHS. It also allocates 50% of \n     all punitive damage awards to be transferred to the fund for \n     the purpose of licensing and certifying health professionals, \n     implementing programs, including programs to reduce \n     malpractice costs for volunteers serving under served areas.\n     2. Risk management programs\n       Finally, professionals and providers must participate in a \n     risk management program to prevent and provide early warning \n     of practices which may result in injuries. Insurers also must \n     establish risk management programs and require participation, \n     once every 3 years, as a condition of maintaining insurance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 887. A bill to establish in the National Park Service the National \nUnderground Railroad Network to Freedom Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    the national underground railroad network to freedom act of 1997\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the \nopportunity today to introduce the National Underground Railroad \nNetwork to Freedom Act of 1997.\n  The Underground Railroad, as my colleagues know, was among the most \nsuccessful efforts in history in helping to undermine and destroy the \ninstitution of slavery in the United States. Beginning during the \ncolonial period, this clandestine resistance movement reached its peak \nin the 19th century, helping hundreds of thousands of African-Americans \nflee servitude in the South and begin new lives in the North, and in \nCanada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\n  Despite its historical significance, the Underground Railroad has not \nbeen officially recognized in any fashion. Consequently, in 1990, my \ndistinguished former colleague, Senator Paul Simon, and former \nCongressman Pete Kostmayer of Pennsylvania, introduced legislation \ndirecting the National Park Service to explore and study options for \ncommemorating the Underground Railroad. Congress passed that \nlegislation later that year, and the National Park Service went to work \ngathering information on the routes and sites used by the Underground \nRailroad.\n  That study, completed in 1996, found that the Underground Railroad \nstory was of national significance. The study documented over 380 \nsites, including 27 national park units, national historic landmarks, \nroutes, privately owned buildings, and churches associated with this \nresistance movement. The study also found that many of these sites were \nin imminent danger of being lost or destroyed, and that despite a \ntremendous amount of interest in the Underground Railroad, little \norganized coordination and communication existed among interested \nindividuals and organizations. The study reached a final recommendation \nthat the U.S. Congress should authorize and fund a national initiative \nto support, preserve, and commemorate the sites and routes associated \nwith the Underground Railroad.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, will enact many of \nthe findings of that National Park Service study into law. Our bill, \nthe National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act, will create \nwithin the National Park Service a nationwide network of historic \nbuildings, routes, programs, projects, and museums that have \ncertifiable thematic connections to the Underground Railroad. The bill \nwill also allow the National Park Service to produce and disseminate \neducational and informational materials on the Underground Railroad, \nand enter into cooperative agreements with Federal agencies, State and \nlocal government, and historical societies to provide technical \nassistance and coordination among network participants. Participation \nin the network by private property owners is purely voluntary.\n  This bill does not create a new park unit in the traditional sense. \nIn order to ensure the maximum safety and secrecy of its activities, \nthe Underground Railroad was an amorphous and loosely organized system. \nNo single site or route, therefore, completely characterizes the \nUnderground Railroad, making it unfeasible that these sites could have \nboundaries and be operated as a traditional national park. Instead, it \nis the intent of this bill to create a network of cooperative \npartnerships, identified by an official or unifying symbol or device, \nat a limited annual operating cost.\n  Mr. President, we will never know how many individuals were freed \nfrom servitude, or how many Americans, black and white, women and men, \nmayors, ministers, businessmen, housewives, or former slaves endangered \nor sacrificed their lives in the defense of the belief that no \nAmerican, and no human, should be bought, traded, or sold.\n  That's why I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass the Underground \nRailroad Network to Freedom Act. This bill grants Federal recognition \nto the Underground Railroad as a significant aspect of American \nhistory. This bill helps to preserve the structures and artifacts of an \norganized resistance movement for freedom. And finally, and most \nimportant, this bill commemorates those Americans whose efforts helped \ndestroy the ugly legacy of slavery in this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Underground \n     Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Underground Railroad, which flourished from the end \n     of the 18th century to the end of the Civil War, was 1 of the \n     most significant expressions of the American civil rights \n     movement during its evolution over more than 3 centuries;\n       (2) the Underground Railroad bridged the divides of race, \n     religion, sectional differences, and nationality, spanned \n     State lines and international borders, and joined the \n     American ideals of liberty and freedom expressed in the \n     Declaration of Independence and the Constitution to the \n     extraordinary actions of ordinary men and women working in \n     common purpose to free a people;\n       (3) pursuant to title VI of Public Law 101-628 (16 U.S.C. \n     1a-5 note; 104 Stat. 4495), the Underground Railroad Advisory \n     Committee conducted a study of the appropriate means of \n     establishing an enduring national commemorative Underground \n     Railroad program of education, example, reflection, and \n     reconciliation;\n       (4) the Underground Railroad Advisory Committee found \n     that--\n       (A) although a few elements of the Underground Railroad \n     story are represented in existing National Park Service units \n     and other sites, many sites are in imminent danger of being \n     lost or destroyed, and many important resource types are not \n     adequately represented and protected;\n       (B) there are many important sites that have high potential \n     for preservation and visitor use in 29 States, the District \n     of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands;\n       (C) no single site or route completely reflects and \n     characterizes the Underground\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\n     Railroad, since the Underground Railroad's story and \n     associated resources involve networks and regions of the \n     country rather than individual sites and trails; and\n       (D) establishment of a variety of partnerships between the \n     Federal Government and other levels of government and the \n     private sector would be most appropriate for the protection \n     and interpretation of the Underground Railroad;\n       (5) the National Park Service can play a vital role in \n     facilitating the national commemoration of the Underground \n     Railroad; and\n       (6) the story and significance of the Underground Railroad \n     can best engage the American people through a national \n     program of the National Park Service that links historic \n     buildings, structures, and sites, routes, geographic areas, \n     and corridors, interpretive centers, museums, and \n     institutions, and programs, activities, community \n     projects, exhibits, and multimedia materials, in a manner \n     that is both unified and flexible.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize the importance of--\n       (A) the Underground Railroad;\n       (B) the sacrifices made by slaves who used the Underground \n     Railroad in search of freedom from tyranny and oppression; \n     and\n       (C) the sacrifices made by the people who helped those \n     slaves; and\n       (2) to authorize the National Park Service to coordinate \n     and facilitate--\n       (A) Federal and non-Federal activities to commemorate, \n     honor, and interpret the history of the Underground Railroad;\n       (B) the Underground Railroad's significance as a crucial \n     element in the evolution of the national civil rights \n     movement; and\n       (C) the Underground Railroad's relevance in fostering a \n     spirit of racial harmony and national reconciliation.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL UNDERGROUND RAILROAD NETWORK TO FREEDOM \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior (referred to \n     in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall establish in the \n     National Park Service a program to be known as the ``National \n     Underground Railroad Network to Freedom'' (referred to in \n     this Act as the ``National Network''). Under the program, the \n     Secretary shall--\n       (1) produce and disseminate appropriate educational \n     materials, such as handbooks, maps, interpretive guides, or \n     electronic information;\n       (2) enter into appropriate cooperative agreements and \n     memoranda of understanding to provide technical assistance \n     under subsection (c); and\n       (3) create and adopt an official and uniform symbol or \n     device for the National Network and issue regulations for use \n     of the symbol or device.\n       (b) Elements.--The National Network shall include--\n       (1) any unit or program of the National Park Service \n     determined by the Secretary to pertain to the Underground \n     Railroad;\n       (2) any other Federal, State, local, or privately owned \n     property pertaining to the Underground Railroad that has a \n     verifiable connection to the Underground Railroad and that is \n     included on, or determined by the Secretary to be eligible \n     for inclusion on, the National Register of Historic Places;\n       (3) any other governmental or nongovernmental facility or \n     program of an educational, research, or interpretive nature \n     that is directly related to the Underground Railroad.\n       (c) Cooperative Agreements and memoranda of \n     Understanding.--To achieve the purposes of this Act and to \n     ensure effective coordination of the Federal and non-Federal \n     elements of the National Network referred to in subsection \n     (b) with National Park Service units and programs, the \n     Secretary may enter into a cooperative agreement or \n     memorandum of understanding with, and provide technical \n     assistance to--\n       (1) the head of another Federal agency, a State, a \n     locality, a regional governmental body, or a private entity; \n     or\n       (2) in cooperation with the Secretary of State, the \n     Government of Canada, Mexico, or any appropriate country in \n     the Caribbean.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this Act--\n       (1) $500,000 for fiscal year 1998; and\n       (2) $1,000,000 for each fiscal year thereafter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

     \n\n[Page S5542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           MEDICARE AND THE ADJUSTED AVERAGE PER CAPITA COST\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, during the Budget Committee's debate \non the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution, I joined with my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden to introduce a Sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nregarding the Medicare reimbursement rate for health plans. In fact, \nmost of my colleagues on the Budget Committee cosponsored this \namendment, and I was pleased to see it incorporated into the final \nbudget resolution passed by the Senate.\n  Reforming the way Medicare determines the reimbursement rate for \nmanaged care plans is critical to provide Medicare equity in States \nlike my home State of Minnesota--especially for those citizens in rural \ncommunities in my State and throughout the country.\n  Mr. President, there are three points I would like to emphasize.\n  First, the Medicare reimbursement rate is unfair. While every \nAmerican pays the same 2.9-percent payroll tax to the Medicare trust \nfund, Minnesotans find themselves with the second-lowest reimbursement \nrates in the Nation. Every single county in Minnesota falls below the \nnational average in terms of Medicare reimbursement. In fact, Minnesota \nis not alone in this category. There are 16 States in which every \ncounty is below the national average--Iowa, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, \nMontana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, \nSouth Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and \nWyoming. Clearly, Mr. President, having this many States without a \nsingle county at the national average indicates something is wrong with \nthe system.\n  Second, the Medicare reimbursement formula discourages quality health \ncare. Minnesota has consistently been recognized throughout the Nation, \nand perhaps the world, as one of the most innovative, efficient, cost, \nand quality-conscious States in terms of health care. Yet, these same \ntraits--which should be encouraged, not discouraged--have skewed the \nMedicare formula against our providers and beneficiaries. We are being \npenalized for our success, while those less efficient States benefit--\nand have no incentive to move in our direction.\n  Mr. President, I think it is clear to everyone that efficient health \ncare markets have reduced overutilization, eliminated unneeded hospital \nbeds, and aimed for the highest quality service at the lowest price. \nUrban areas that are efficient in delivering health care--like \nMinneapolis, MN--decrease overutilization in the fee-for-service \ncategory of Medicare. This reduces the adjusted average per capita cost \n[AAPCC] which makes it difficult for health plans to remain competitive \ndue to the lower payment.\n  Third, the Medicare reimbursement formula discriminates against \nseniors who live in rural communities. These rural Americans already \nface fewer health care options than those living in urban centers. \nBecause of the lower reimbursement rates health plans receive, there is \nno incentive for them to offer their services--let alone provide extra \nbenefits many seniors in other States receive at no added cost. That \nmeans even fewer choices for the senior citizens living in rural \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. President, no one would suggest that we take away the extra \nbenefits seniors receive in other States; indeed, we should encourage \nhealth plans to do what they can to provide these benefits, while at \nthe same time focusing on the need to become more efficient and cost-\neffective. However, what we are saying is that senior citizens living \nin rural America should at the very least have the opportunity to make \nthese same choices in their health care plan.\n  I'd like to conclude by offering an example of how the disparity in \npayment affects the benefits of two seniors living in different States.\n  A Medicare beneficiary living in Blue Earth County, MN, who would \nlike to enroll in a health plan would have none offered at the \nreimbursement rate of $302 a month. Not one health plan is willing to \noffer even basic Medicare coverage at this rate. He or she would have \nno choice but to enroll in the fee-for-service plan and incur higher \nout-of-pocket expenses.\n  However, this same beneficiary's brother, sister or cousin living in \nLos Angeles County, CA would have their choice of 15 health plans \noffering full Medicare coverage and in addition, receive a $1,500 \nprescription drug benefit, $150 credit for hearing aids, and dental \ncoverage. Why do they have these choices? Because their health plans \nare reimbursed $519 a month and can afford to offer the extra benefits. \nThis disparity is not fair--and it must be fixed.\n  Mr. President, while I am pleased the Senate has gone on record in \nsupport of my sense-of-the-Senate amendment included in the budget \nresolution, we need to move forward in changing the system. As we begin \nconsideration of the reconciliation bills, I ask all my colleagues to \nexamine this issue carefully and restore some equity in this outdated \nformula.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5542-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5542-S5544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF CNA INSURANCE CO.\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of CNA Insurance Co., whose headquarters are located in the \ncity of Chicago in my home State of Illinois.\n  CNA is one of the Nation's largest insurance companies. It employs \nover 20,000 people nationwide, 6,000 of whom live and work in Illinois. \nIt has offices in more than 100 cities and is represented by nearly \n80,000 independent insurance agents across the country.\n  CNA has always prided itself on being an innovator in the insurance \nindustry.\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\n When women began to enter the work force in the early 1900's, CNA was \namong the first to offer them accident and health coverage. CNA also \nmet the concerns of farmers by developing a new product specifically \ntailored to their accident and health needs. CNA was one of the first \ncompanies to offer worker's compensation coverage and was one of the \nfirst to provide retirement income annuities for senior citizens before \nthe establishment of Social Security.\n  CNA has also played a behind-the-scenes role in some of our Nation's \nmost memorable events. CNA insured Presidential candidates Adlai \nStevenson and Dwight Eisenhower against accidents during their \ncampaigns in 1952 and insured President John F. Kennedy's inaugural \nfestivities. It also insured the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium performance \nfor the Ed Sullivan Show and the Apollo 16 astronauts' 1972 flight to \nthe moon.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a more detailed \nhistory of CNA that was recently prepared by the company and I would \nlike to congratulate CNA for 100 years of insuring America. I hope that \nduring the next 100 years, CNA continues its record of success and \nremains a leader in the insurance industry.\n  The material follows:\n\n           A Tribute to CNA in Celebration of Its Centennial\n\n                  CNA Stands for Commitment, 1897-1997\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       CNA, one of the country's largest commercial insurance \n     groups, is celebrating one hundred years of commitment and \n     service to the American people both at home and abroad. Since \n     1897, whenever America has sought a sense of security, CNA \n     has been there, anticipating that need and forging its \n     reputation as an industry innovator. Railroad workers, \n     teachers, movie stars, athletes, even U.S. Presidents have \n     depended on CNA's protection against both expected risks and \n     unforeseen dangers.\n       Since its modest beginnings in Detroit, Michigan, with \n     $100,000 in capital stock and a $60,000 surplus, CNA has \n     become one of the largest property/casualty insurers in the \n     nation, with over $60 billion in assets. Originally operating \n     out of a two-room office with 15 employees, CNA today \n     occupies some 400 office sites in over 100 cities and employs \n     over 20,000 people nationwide. Now headquartered in Chicago, \n     CNA directly employs more than 6,000 people in Illinois \n     alone. Almost 80,000 agents currently represent CNA \n     throughout the United States, testament to the company's \n     successful alliance with independent agents.\n       CNA's exemplary accomplishment--a century culminating in \n     financial stability and preeminence in the industry--attests \n     to its history of astute leadership, integrity and commitment \n     to quality service.\n\n\n                              the founding\n\n       Collins Hubbard, CNA's founder, set the course of \n     perceptive leadership that has guided CNA to the top of the \n     insurance industry. Calling together several of his \n     colleagues, Hubbard proposed a company that would insure \n     America's working class against unexpected disasters. The \n     Continental Assurance Company of North America, as CNA was \n     then known, provided coverage with an innovative twist: both \n     accident and health insurance, at a time when most of its \n     contemporaries offered only accident coverage.\n       Focusing on railroad workers as its initial customer base, \n     CNA became the largest insurer in Michigan within two years \n     of its founding. Despite its rapid growth, the fledgling \n     company faced intense competition from other insurance \n     companies. In light of this, the company underwent two major \n     changes. First, it changed its name to the more forceful and \n     representative, Continental Casualty Company. Then, in \n     September 1900, the company merged with Metropolitan Accident \n     Company, a Chicago insurer, and moved its headquarters to \n     Chicago. This strategy catapulted the combined companies to \n     fifth among the nation's accident insurers.\n\n\n                     cna becomes an industry leader\n\n       Early in the 20th century, CNA distinguished itself as a \n     leader in the insurance industry by demonstrating the \n     capacity for discerning new markets and developing innovative \n     products. When women began to enter the work force, CNA was \n     among the first to provide them with accident and health \n     coverage. As agricultural production expanded, CNA devised \n     new products specifically geared to farmers' accident and \n     health concerns.\n       CNA reinforced its position at the forefront of the \n     industry in 1910 by expanding beyond accident and health into \n     different lines of insurance such as liability, auto \n     insurance and burglary. In 1911, the company entered the life \n     insurance field by forming the Continental Assurance Company. \n     In 1915, CNA began offering workers' compensation coverage as \n     factories employed more people to increase output for the \n     World War I effort.\n       Policies combining multiple lines of insurance proved \n     successful, particularly as automobiles--and accidents \n     involving automobiles--became commonplace. Motorist coverage \n     insured both the driver and any persons injured or property \n     damage.\n       The growth of an affluent American middle-class meant \n     increased incidents of theft. Property owners' concerns were \n     met by CNA's wide range of burglary insurance--protecting \n     against bank robberies, home break-ins and safe deposit box \n     theft.\n\n\n                        groups and associations\n\n       By the early 1920s, the flourishing company was operating \n     in every state and territory of the United States, as well as \n     every province in Canada. That decade also marked the \n     beginning of CNA's pioneering relationship with associations, \n     a relationship that has lasted until the present day and has \n     played a significant role in CNA's rise to the upper echelon \n     of insurance companies.\n       CNA is credited with the first teachers association group \n     policy, written for the Cleveland Teachers Association in \n     1921. CNA insured the American Society of Civil engineers in \n     1945, becoming the first insurer to successfully install a \n     group plan for a nationwide association. Teaming up with the \n     American Camping Association in the 1950s, CNA initiated an \n     educational campaign to promote camp safety and insure \n     campers. Camp insurance led to the formation of ``PONY,'' \n     Protect Our Nation's Youth, a youth program offering medical \n     expense reimbursement from kindergarten through college.\n       CNA has also demonstrated unwavering commitment to the \n     nation's retirement-age population. In the 1930s, before \n     compulsory Social Security, the company was among the first \n     to offer retirement income annuities. by 1955, CNA had \n     developed the first group health plan for those over 65. \n     Originally conceived as a group medical insurance plan for \n     retired teachers associations, the plan evolved into ``Golden \n     65'', a policy offered directly to the individual. After the \n     implementation of Medicare in the summer of 1965, CNA \n     redesigned Golden 65 to complement the Medicare plan, while \n     other insurers exited the over-65 health insurance field.\n\n\n                    Dependability In Times of Crisis\n\n       Dependability in times of crisis is a CNA hallmark. The \n     company refused to exit the field of polio insurance at a \n     time when the nation was literally crippled by the rampant, \n     dreaded disease. CNA introduced its polio coverage the year \n     of the worse polio outbreak in two decades. It continued to \n     provide comprehensive and affordable polio coverage for the \n     duration of the epidemic.\n       The company's willingness to take on the challenge of even \n     the most unusual coverage request has marked its true \n     American spirit--bold, enterprising and innovative. Where \n     other companies see uninsurable risks, CNA sees \n     possibiities--a company trait that has ensured its success \n     and longevity in the insurance business. CNA has staunchly \n     stood behind Americans in all manner of pursuits and \n     ventures, these past 100 years.\n       CNA insured presidential hopefuls Adlai Stevenson and \n     Dwight Eisenhower against accidents during their campaign \n     trips in 1952. When John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as the \n     nation's 35th president, CNA provided liability coverage for \n     the ceremonial activities. In 1965, President Lyndon B. \n     Johnson asked CNA to write the bond for the train that stood \n     waiting in case emergency evacuation was necessary during \n     Martin Luther King's civil rights protest march to \n     Montgomery, Alabama. The 1968 Democratic Convention in \n     Chicago was covered by CNA's liability insurance.\n       A special CNA reinsurance policy covered the cancellation \n     or postponement of the 1965 Shea Stadium performance of the \n     Beatles for the Ed Sullivan show. The Apollo 16 astronauts \n     were insured in case of accidental death on their 1972 flight \n     to the moon.\n       Little League teams around the country have enjoyed CNA \n     protection since 1948, as have Indianapolis 500 drivers, pit \n     crews and race officials. The American athletes competing in \n     the 1952 Helsinki Olympic games were insured by CNA. Water \n     events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics were covered by MOAC, \n     CNA's marine unit.\n\n\n                       CNA Cares About Community\n\n       CNA's commitment to its employees, its clients, and the \n     American people extends far beyond insurance. The company \n     encourages and subsidizes both employees and CNA leadership \n     in community projects. In the 1920's, the company sought to \n     enrich the lives of its employees through its Continental \n     Welfare Association which offered disability pensions, life \n     insurance and retirement pensions.\n       Later, during World War II, the employees reached out to \n     help in the war effort. CNA employees organized their own \n     chapter of the Red Cross, calling it the Continental Red \n     Cross. By the midpoint of the war, Continental employees had \n     invested $232,418 in war bonds.\n       Today, in more peaceful times, CNA and its employees have \n     dedicated time and resources toward the education of the \n     nation's youth. In the early 1980's, CNA sponsored Illinois' \n     first math contest. With the Chicago Urban League, the \n     Chicago Board of Education, and the Illinois Council of \n     Teachers of Mathematics CNA developed MATHCOUNTS, a model \n     math tutorial program. The program quickly garnered \n     nationwide attention. By 1984, MATHCOUNTS had evolved into \n     the country's first nationwide math contest boasting as \n     cosponsors the National Society of Professional Engineers, \n     the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the National \n     Aeronautics and Space\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\n     Administration, and the U.S. Department of Education.\n       CNA's investment in the nation's future--its children--is \n     evident in CNA's involvement with the Leadership for Quality \n     Education, a coalition of business and civil leaders working \n     to improve the Chicago school system. OUt of this, CNA \n     created Project Participate, providing paid time off, \n     resources and training to employees wishing to run for \n     Chicago's Local School Councils. CNA has also adopted \n     Chicago's Mark Skinner School as part of the Chicago Board of \n     Education's Adopt-A-School Program.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       CNA stands for a century of commitment, stability and \n     financial strength. Entering the final years of the 10th \n     century, the company prepared for the 21st century in typical \n     CNA fashion--it acquired the Continental Insurance Company in \n     1995. This merger, the most significant property/casualty \n     insurance merger in the last 25 years, expanded CNA's scope--\n     elevating its presence worldwide, adding new specialty \n     operations and pooling the considerable talent and resources \n     of both companies.\n       As the new millennium approaches, unfathomable leaps in \n     technology, social transformations and economic upheaval are \n     as much a source of apprehension today as in 1897. CNA saw \n     the birth of a new century that brought with it several wars, \n     a severe economic depression, fantastic advances in modes of \n     travel and communication, social change and natural \n     disasters. It has met the challenges of the past 100 years \n     and stands poised for another century, confident of its \n     continued success based on its core values: commitment, \n     stability and financial strength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5542-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF KAREN E. WETTERHAHN, PH.D.\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the memory of the late Dr. Karen E. Wetterhahn of Lyme, NH. \nKaren was an Albert Bradley third century professor in the sciences at \nDartmouth College, who died of mercury poisoning on June 8 while \nworking on the cutting edge of the scientific and academic communities.\n  Karen, a research chemist of international reputation, spanned the \nfields of inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical toxicology. \nSometime last year while working with dimethyl mercury, she came in \ncontact with and received mercury poisoning during her studies of \nmercury toxicity. A dedicated member of the Dartmouth community, her \nwork involved understanding how elevated levels of the elements known \nas heavy metals, which include chromium, lead, and arsenic, interfere \nwith the processes of cell metabolism and the transfer of genetic \ninformation.\n  Karen not only shaped the work inside her laboratory but in the \nclassroom as well. Dr. Wetterhahn helped to develop curriculum in the \nlife science area know as structural biology, which studies the \nstructure of biologically active molecules such as DNA, RNA, and \nproteins to learn how they function.\n  She was born in Plattsburgh, NY, in 1948 and graduated from St. \nMary's High School in Champlain, NY. Karen graduated magna cum laude at \nSt. Lawrence University where she earned her bachelor's degree. She \nreceived her doctorate from Columbia University in 1975, where she won \nthe prestigious Hammett Award in chemistry. Karen was also a National \nInstitutes of Health trainee at the Institute of Cancer Research, \nColumbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, also in 1975. \nOne year later she joined the faculty of Dartmouth College, in Hanover, \nNH.\n  Karen also had an instrumental role in making Dartmouth's sciences \nand administration more representative of the changing faces in the \ncollege community. While in Hanover, she co-founded Dartmouth's women \nin science project, which was aimed at increasing the number of women \nmajoring and taking courses in the sciences.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Wetterhahn worked to make the world a better \nplace, and she will be truly missed by all of us who knew and worked \nwith her. Researchers like the late Karen Wetterhahn are important to \nthe future of New Hampshire and the future of this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5544-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF BOB BELLACK AND RON HEUMILLER'S ASSISTANCE DURING THE \n                       NATURAL DISASTERS OF 1997\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \ntoday to recognize the important work of two McCook County Highway \nDepartment employees, Bob Bellack and Ron Heumiller, in ongoing \ndisaster recovery efforts in South Dakota.\n  Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South \nDakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold \ntemperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane \ncleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead \nlivestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As \nif surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents \nof the Upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother \nNature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. Record levels on the \nBig Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of \nWatertown, SD, to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the \ncity without sewer and water for 3 weeks. The city of Bruce, SD was \ncompletely underwater when record low temperatures turned swollen \nstreams into sheets of ice.\n  At the height of the snowstorms in South Dakota, Bob Bellack and Ron \nHeumiller drove snowplows at 3 to 4 miles per hour and in zero \nvisibility to open roads for rescue and emergency medical crews. Wind \ngusts of 40 miles per hour dropped the temperature to nearly 70 degrees \nbelow zero as the medical crews followed Bob and Ron for 263 miles to \nrescue families without heat and stranded motorists from all over the \ncounty.\n  While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction \nwrought by this year's snowstorms and floods, I have been heartened to \nwitness firsthand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together \nwithin their community to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from \nvicious winter weather and rising flood waters. The selfless actions of \nBob Bellack and Ron Heumiller illustrate the resolve within South \nDakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble.\n  Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair \nour impacted communities. Bob Bellack, Ron Heumiller, and the \nindividuals at the McCook County Highway Department illustrate how the \nactions of a community can bring some relief to the victims of this \nnatural disaster, and I ask you to join me in thanking them for their \nselfless efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5544-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5544-S5545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF LORI RUSSELL AND BARB NAVRISKY'S ASSISTANCE DURING THE \n                             FLOODS OF 1997\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

The devastation was \nastounding; an entire city underwater and a fire that gutted a majority \nof Grand Forks' downtown. Residents of both cities recently were \nallowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and \ndifficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning.\n  Barb Navrisky lived through the 1972 flash flood that killed hundreds \nof people in Rapid City, SD. She knows what her North Dakota neighbors \nare currently experiencing. Lori Russell knows the devastation all too \nwell. Her parents, Eman and Leona Hejlik, live\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\nin Grand Forks and lost their home in the flood. That's why both Barb \nand Lori mobilized the city of Box Elder, SD and collected clothing, \ncleaning supplies, food, and toys for flood victims in Grand Forks. \nLori and Barb's relief effort included the mayor of Box Elder, Dave \nKinser, raising $200 in donations for a Grand Forks resident who lost \neverything.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \ntoday to recognize the important work of Emm Bauman and Rapid City's \nBeta Sigma Phi chapters in ongoing flood recovery efforts in the \nDakotas.\n  Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South \nDakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold \ntemperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane \ncleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead \nlivestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As \nif surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents \nof the Upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother \nNature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood. Record levels on the \nBig Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5,000 residents of \nWatertown, SD, to evacuate their homes and left over one-third of the \ncity without sewer and water for 3 weeks. The city of Bruce, SD, was \ncompletely underwater when record low temperatures turned swollen \nstreams into sheets of ice.\n  The 50,000 residents of Grand Forks, ND and 10,000 residents of East \nGrand Forks, MN were forced to leave their homes and businesses as the \nRed River overwhelmed their cities in April. The devastation was \nastounding; an entire city underwater and a fire that gutted a majority \nof Grand Forks' downtown. Residents of both cities recently were \nallowed to return to what is left of their homes, and the long and \ndifficult process of rebuilding shattered lives is just beginning.\n  Emm Bauman initiated a series of coffee parties in Aberdeen 25 years \nago that raised $5,000 for victims of the flash flood that killed \nhundreds of people in Rapid City, SD. Each participant paid a minimum \nof $1 and then hosted a smaller party of her own until there was no one \nleft to host. Once again, Emm mobilized fellow members of Betta Sigma \nPhi to host a series of Friendship Vanishing Coffee Parties in hopes of \nraising another $5,000 for Grand Forks flood victims. The money will \nhelp families who lost everything in the devastating floods rebuild \ntheir lives.\n  While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction \nwrought by this year's floods, I have been heartened to witness first-\nhand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their \ncommunity to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from rising flood \nwaters. The selfless actions of people like Emm Bauman and members of \nBeta Sigma Phi illustrate the resolve within South Dakotans to help our \nneighbors in times of trouble.\n  Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair \nGrand Forks and other impacted communities. Emm Bauman and the members \nof Betta Sigma Phi illustrate how individuals can bring some relief to \nthe victims of this natural disaster, and I ask you to join me in \nthanking them for their selfless efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5546-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5546-S5547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BIRTH DEFECTS PREVENTION ACT\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, vitamin supplements containing the B \nvitamin folic acid, have been proven to prevent common and disabling \nbirth defects, including spina bifida and anencephaly, if taken daily \nbefore and in the early days after conception. This vitamin could \nprevent six to nine cases of these birth defects per day, saving $245 \nmillion per year in the United States.\n  On June 10, 1997, the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation \nreleased a new nationwide survey which shows that while more American \nwomen of childbearing age have heard of folic acid, the proportion of \nwomen actually taking a multivitamin on a daily basis remains low. Only \n32 percent of women ages 18 to 45 take a daily multivitamin containing \nfolic acid.\n  Awareness of folic acid jumped 14 percentages points over the 2-year \nperiod, from 52 percent of women in 1995 to 66 percent in 1997. \nHowever, women under age 25 are the least likely to consume vitamins \ndaily, with only 23 percent reporting that they do so, and this age \ngroup accounts for 39 percent of all births in the United States. It is \nbecause of these statistics that I encourage my colleagues to vote for \nS. 419, the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997.\n  This legislation would establish a national birth defects \nsurveillance, research, and prevention system. This\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\nsystem would include research projects for the prevention of neural \ntube defects, one-half of which could be prevented if women of child \nbearing age consumed a small amount of folic acid daily. In addition, \nthis legislation would set up public education programs to teach more \nwomen about the importance of folic acid to the health of their \nchildren.\n  And so together with the March of Dimes I encourage my colleagues to \npass this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5546-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, our Nation benefits when \nevery citizen has the opportunity to contribute to the best of his or \nher ability to the economy, to the society, and to the country. \nDiscrimination, in any form, prevents the utilization of all available \ntalents and makes our future less bright than it could be--less bright \nthan it should be. It is for this reason that I join my colleagues, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Lieberman, in \ncosponsoring the Employment Non-Discrimination Act [ENDA].\n  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act prohibits employment \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation. It creates no special \nrights, or quotas, it merely ensures that gay and lesbian Americans \nhave the same rights as every other American in the workplace.\n  Employment discrimination impedes economic competitiveness, \nfrustrates fairness, and obstructs opportunity.\n  Employment discrimination impedes economic competitiveness for \nAmerica's businesses. Our work force is what makes America strong. \nDiscrimination only serves to lessen that strength. Many companies have \nalready adopted their own antidiscrimination policies, recognizing the \nnegative impact discrimination can have on their continuing \ncompetitiveness. These businesses understand that there is no place for \ndiscrimination as we transition into the 21st century's global \nworkplace.\n  Unfortunately, not all businesses understand this yet, and in 39 \nStates, employment discrimination based on sexual orientation is still \nlegal. There are many documented cases highlighting the fact that \ndiscrimination in the workplace still occurs. Without national \nlegislation to protect all Americans, cases of discrimination against \ngay men and lesbian women will continue to occur unchallenged and \nbusinesses, and thus our national economy, will continue to suffer.\n\n  Employment discrimination is fundamentally unfair. Each of us should \nbe allowed to fully participate in society, regardless of our gender, \nrace, or sexual orientation. ENDA prohibits giving preferential \ntreatment to any individual based on sexual orientation. Employers may \nnot provide special treatment to gay men, lesbians, or heterosexuals. \nThe bill provides that an employer may not use the fact of an \nindividual's sexual orientation as the basis for positive or negative \naction against that individual in employment opportunities. Americans \nshould not be promoted, nor should they be held back, by conditions \nthat have nothing to do with merit, or talents and abilities.\n  Employment discrimination obstructs opportunity for America's \nworkers. If there is any objective that should command complete \nAmerican consensus, it is ensuring that every American has the chance \nto succeed--and that, in the final analysis, is what this bill is \nabout. No issue is more critical to our country, and nothing makes a \nbigger difference in a person's life than opening up opportunities.\n  The basic principle we should keep in mind is that every American \nmust have the opportunity to advance as far in their field as their \nhard work will take them. That is the American way. Gay and lesbian \nAmericans should not have to face discrimination in the workplace, \nshould not face dismissal, be denied promotions, or experience \nharassment, simply because of their sexual orientation.\n  In endorsing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in the 104th \nCongress the American Bar Association wrote:\n\n       Over the years, and with some struggle, this nation has \n     extended employment discrimination protection to individuals \n     on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, age, \n     and disability. ENDA takes the next necessary step by \n     extending this same basic protection to another group that \n     has been vilified and victimized--gay men, lesbians, and \n     bisexuals. All workers, regardless of their sexual \n     orientation, are entitled to be judged on the strength of the \n     work they do; they should not be deprived of their livelihood \n     because of the prejudice of others.\n\n  This is an eloquent statement of one of the fundamental tenets of the \nUnited States of America--equal opportunity for all. This Nation was \nfounded by people fleeing prejudice and discrimination. ENDA continues \nthat legacy.\n  As a matter of fundamental fairness and because all workers should be \nentitled to legal protection and opportunity in the work force, I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5547-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO ATLAS ADVANCED PYROTECHNICS, RECENT WINNER OF THE NATIONAL \n     PARK SERVICE'S 1997 INDEPENDENCE DAY AERIAL FIREWORKS DISPLAY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Atlas Advanced Pyrotechnics, the Granite State's largest \npyrotechnics design firm, on winning the National Park Service's 1997 \nIndependence Day aerial fireworks display, to be held July 4 by the \nWashington Monument in Washington, DC.\n  Atlas Advanced Pyrotechnics is well known in the New Hampshire \ncommunity for some of their spectacular shows like the annual Rock 101 \nSkyshow and Jaffery's Festival of Fireworks. Atlas won the North \nAmerican Pyrotechnics Competition in 1994 and was the United States \nrepresentative at the 1995 Benson and Hedges International Pyrotechnics \nCompetition in Montreal, Canada.\n  Atlas will light the sky over the Nation's Capital with more than \n3,000 shells in 20 minutes. The entire show will be digitally \nsynchronized to patriotic music of Copeland, Gershwin, Bernstein, and \nEubie Blake.\n  In addition to this year's fireworks display on the Mall in \nWashington DC, the National Park Service has also awarded Atlas the \nprestigious Harper's Ferry Historical Park display on June 28, at \nHarper's Ferry, WV.\n  I commend Atlas for their hard work and dedication that has earned \nthem such prestigious awards. I applaud the people of Atlas for their \naccomplishments in bringing joy to the American public. I wish them a \nvery happy Fourth of July.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5547-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5547-S5548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty [CTBT]. Along with many of my colleagues, \nI call upon the Senate to ratify this important treaty which will help \nto prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, improve the \nenvironment in which we live, save billions of dollars, and enhance the \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  The CTBT prohibits all nuclear test explosions worldwide. The treaty \nestablishes an international agency to coordinate nuclear policy and \nverify test ban compliance through an International Monitoring System, \nonsite inspections, consultation and clarification, and confidence-\nbuilding measures. The treaty is quite simple, really, and it is \nsomething that Americans have wanted for a long time.\n  ``The conclusion of such a treaty * * * would check the spiraling \narms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place nuclear \npowers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the great \nhazards which man faces * * * the further spread of nuclear arms. It \nwould increase our security; it would decrease the prospects of war. \nSurely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady \npursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort \nnor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible \nsafeguards.''\n  Those words, so appropriate today, were spoken 34 years ago by \nPresident John F. Kennedy, in an historic speech at American \nUniversity. In that speech, the President announced the beginning of \nhigh-level discussions among the United States, the Union of Soviet \nSocialist Republics, and the United Kingdom regarding ``a comprehensive \ntest ban treaty.'' Even then,\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\nlong before the demise of the Soviet Union rendered the United States \nthe sole remaining superpower, President Kennedy and many others \nrecognized the dangers inherent in nuclear testing, and the many \nbenefits of a test ban.\n  A test ban will curb the spread of nuclear weapons, helping to keep \nthem out of the hands of rogue states and terrorists. A test ban will \nmean that children do not have to grow up in areas contaminated by \nnuclear explosions. A test ban will mean that money spent on \nmaintaining test sites and running tests--hundreds of millions of \ndollars a year in the United States alone--could be spent on education, \nhealth, and other priorities of the American people. In short, a \nnuclear test ban will enhance the military, political, and economic \nsecurity of our Nation. That's why President Clinton has signed and 158 \ncountries in the United Nations have endorsed the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty. That is also why 80 percent of Americans are calling upon \nus to ratify it.\n  When President Kennedy began test ban negotiations 34 years ago, he \nwas realistic about the challenges in negotiating with the Soviet \nUnion. He said, ``Our hopes must be tempered with the caution of \nhistory, but with our hopes go the hopes of all mankind.'' Today, Mr. \nPresident, history and hope are on our side. Now is the time to \nconclude the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Now is our chance to \nfulfill the hopes of all mankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5547-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MICHIGAN'S 1997 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute of seven \ntruly exceptional educational institutions in my State of Michigan. On \nFriday, May 23, the U.S. Department of Education announced the \nrecipients of the 1997 Blue Ribbon School Awards. It gives me great \npleasure to recognize today before my colleagues each of these schools \nand commend them on this prestigious award.\n  To be named a blue ribbon school is no small achievement; it requires \nthe successful passage of a rigorous nomination and screen process. The \nDepartment of Education review panel evaluates as conditions of \neffective schooling the following: leadership; teaching environment; \ncurriculum and instruction; student environment; parent and community \nsupport; and organizational vitality. The review panel also considers \nobjective indicators of success, such as: Student performance on \nmeasures of achievement; daily student and teacher attendance rates; \nstudents' postgraduation pursuits; school, staff, and student awards; \nand high student retention-graduation rates.\n  Obviously, those select few schools afforded the status of Blue \nRibbon Awards are more than deserving of the national attention that \naccompanies such an honor. I would like to take a moment to \nindividually recognize each of the Michigan elementary and middle \nschools, and the dedicated principals under whose leadership these \nschools have thrived, for entry into the Congressional Record.\n  Anna M. Joyce Elementary School, Detroit, MI, Mr. Leslie Brown, \nprincipal.\n  Brace-Lederle Elementary School, Southfield, MI, Dr. Bobbie K. \nHentrel, principal.\n  Grand View Elementary School, Grandville, MI, Mr. Rich Doyle, \nprincipal.\n  Lincoln Park Elementary School, Norton Shores, MI, Ms. Tresea Goff, \nprincipal.\n  Pine Tree Elementary School, Lake Orion, MI, Mrs. Beverly Tepper, \nprincipal.\n  Roguewood School, Rockford, MI, Mrs. Sharon Bennett, principal.\n  Troy Union Elementary School, Troy, MI, Dr. Ronald J.

On behalf of all my fellow Senators I extend to the staff, \nstudents, and parents of each of these communities my most sincere \ncongratulations and best wishes for the even brighter future that \nawaits them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5548-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ESTATE TAX LAWS MUST BE REFORMED\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want Congress to act decisively \nto stop our estate tax laws from hindering the transfer of family \nbusinesses and family farms and ranches to the next generation. These \nfamily enterprises are the major creators of new wealth and new jobs in \nthis country. Yet in far too many cases, our estate tax laws force the \nchildren and grandchildren who inherit a modestly sized family business \nto sell it, or a large part of it, to pay off huge estate taxes. I want \nour tax laws to assist the transfer of family enterprises so they can \ncontinue to generate jobs and new wealth. Instead our estate tax laws \nnow hinder that transfer.\n  I've authored legislation in several Congresses to allow family \nfarms, ranches, and other small family businesses to be passed along to \nthe next generation without being loaded up with massive estate tax \ndebt. The legislation I've introduced in this Congress increases the \nunified estate and gift tax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million. In \naddition, it provides a new $1 million exclusion for family business \nassets. Together, my proposals would allow a family business, valued up \nto $2 million, to be passed to the children and grandchildren to \noperate without any estate tax liability.\n  A number of my colleagues in the Senate share my concerns about \nestate taxes. In fact, I worked with a core group of Senators, \nincluding Senators Grassley, Lott, Nickles, and Baucus for several \nmonths this spring to develop a comprehensive, bipartisan estate tax \nrelief bill. This effort led to the introduction of a bipartisan bill, \ncalled the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997 (S. \n479), which includes a number of important provisions including \nproposals to increase the unified estate and gift tax exemption and to \ntarget additional support for family-owned and operated businesses. \nMost of the changes recommended in this legislation are long- overdue, \nand I will work with my colleagues to include them in revenue \nlegislation this Congress.\n  I have decided to add my name as a cosponsor of S. 479 because I \nsupport the primary thrust and goals of this initiative. I want to send \na reminder to those calling for tax cuts that estate tax relief for \nfamily businesses is not a partisan issue. It is important for the \nsurvival of our Nation's family businesses, and it should be included \nin the balanced budget tax relief package now being drafted in \nCongress.\n  Although I am adding my name as a cosponsor to signal a bipartisan \ndesire to pass some estate tax relief, I do want to see one provision \nof this bill changed. The cut in the estate tax rate for estates in the \n$2.5 million to $11 million range is, I believe, excessive. I would \nprefer to use the money available for estate tax reduction for a larger \nexemption at the bottom rather than additional tax breaks at the top.\n  But I hope that when estate tax relief is enacted that the work we \nhave done together will contribute to helping family businesses and \nfamily farms and ranches to be passed on to the children who will \ncontinue to operate them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5548-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5548-S5549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THANKING THE LANGUAGE SERVICES SECTION OF THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH \n        SERVICE FOR ITS SUPPORT TO THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE\n\n   Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the \nlanguage services section of the Congressional Research Service for its \nsupport to the Senate Banking Committee in our inquiry into the \ndisposition of heirless assets in Swiss banks, before, during, and \nafter World War II. During the course of our inquiry thousands of pages \nof documentation have been examined as we have tried to establish the \nultimate disposition of assets which were deposited in Swiss banks by \nHolocaust victims prior to World War II.\n  Hundreds of pages of these historical documents were written in \nvarious languages which dealt with extremely technical matters. It was \nimperative that the Banking Committee obtain accurate translations for \nthese documents. The language services section never let us down.\n  I would especially like to recognize David Skelly who provided \ntranslation support in the German and French languages. Mr. Skelly \nworked with my\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\nstaff on a daily basis and his efforts were truly noteworthy.\n  On many occasions we contacted Mr. Skelly and solicited his \ntranslation assistance on an immediate basis. Mr. Skelly never \ncomplained. He never said, ``I can't do this. You're asking too much.'' \nHe said simply, ``How soon do you need it?'' and ``OK. I'll get right \non it.''\n  On one particular instance Mrs. Deanna Hammond, Mr. Skelly's \nsupervisor and another true professional in that office, contacted Mr. \nSkelly at home on his own time and read him a very technical document \nin German which he translated. Mrs. Hammond typed up the English \ntranslation and we had it in our hands 2 hours after sending in our \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, this is the type of dedicated service which Government \nemployees all too often perform, and no one hears anything about it. \nYou certainly won't hear it from anyone in the language service \nsection. This is all in a day's work for them. This is a group of \npeople who take their commitment to the Congress and the American \npeople very seriously. And they deliver.\n  I consider the language services section to be an indispensable \noffice within the Congressional Research Service which provides a truly \nunique service to the Congress. I congratulate all of the workers there \non their fine work and extend to them my thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5548-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMERICA'S FREEMASONRY AND FLAG DAY\n\n   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as our Nation prepares to \ncelebrate Flag Day on the 14th of this month, I rise to pay tribute to \nover 1 million men who belong to the largest and oldest fraternal \norganization in the world, America's Freemasonry. Since the Continental \nCongress adopted the Stars and Stripes as our Nation's flag on June 14, \n1777, Masons have given this beloved symbol their staunch support.\n  It is nearly 48 years since President Harry S. Truman signed an act \nof Congress recognizing Flag Day as a national holiday. Truman's \ncontribution as a Mason follows the efforts of other great Masonic \nnational leaders. Adm. John Paul Jones flew Old Glory at Quiberon Bay, \nFrance on February 13, 1778, in the first recognition of the United \nStates by a foreign nation. Nearly 200 years later, Astronaut Edwin \n``Buzz'' Aldrin traveled with an American flag to the Moon. With their \ndistinguished moral code and immutable patriotism, these and other \nMasons, including Francis Scott Key, helped to advance the flag as a \ntrue symbol of our Nation.\n  Senator Robert C. Winthrop (1809-1894) of Massachusetts once said, \n``Our flag is our national ensign, pure and simple, behold it! Listen \nto it! Every star has a tongue, every stripe is articulate.'' Indeed, \nwith the constant help of America's Freemasonry, the U.S. flag has been \nseen in every corner of the world and has been recognized as an emblem \nof our continued democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/11/senate-section/article/S5549-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
