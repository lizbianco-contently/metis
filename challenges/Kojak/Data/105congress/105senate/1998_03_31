Mr. President, I would like to take just a few moments, no \nmore than 5 minutes, if that is acceptable, to speak about the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. President, just a couple of weeks ago I was privileged to chair a \ncongressional symposium on the question of child care and parenting \nheld by the Subcommittee on Children and Families. The purpose was to \nexamine many of the issues surrounding the whole question of child care \nand the needs of America's working families.\n  We tried to do what very few policymakers do these days. Instead of \nstarting with an assumption that a certain program and place ought to \njust be expanded, we went back to the basics, back to fundamentals. We \nasked the questions: What do the experts think is best for children? \nWhat do families think is best for them? What do they think they need? \nPolitics aside, special interests aside and, in the best of all worlds, \nif we were starting over, where would we start?\n  What we learned from that symposium, convening experts from all \nacross the political spectrum, different philosophies represented, but \nexperts in the field, including mothers who have spent a great deal of \ntime raising their families and studying these issues is that families \nwant more time with their children, not less time. They want Government \nto allow them to keep more of their hard-earned dollars so that they \nhave more choices in terms of how they spend those dollars, rather than \ndeciding here that we are just simply going to spend more money on new \nprograms or new bureaucracies.\n  We learned that they want to rely less on child care, to have more \nflexible work hours, comptime and other profamily benefits that many \nFederal employees currently enjoy. We learned what children have is \nwhat Dr. Stanley Greenspan calls ``irreducible needs.'' He indicated \nthe studies have shown there is a significant concern that our society \n``has begun to advocate out-of-home care as the desired option rather \nthan as a backup system for those who need it.''\n  According to experts like Jay Belsky of Penn State University, \nprolonged exposure to out-of-home care can have very serious results on \nlong-term child development, because it impacts adversely on the way a \nchild relates and bonds with his mother. It appears to have a negative \nimpact on maternal sensitivity to the child, which is critical, as \nthese experts have said, to child development.\n  These are facts, Dr. Belsky said, that are overwhelming and should \nnot be dismissed. He said they--this early interaction and bonding \nbetween mother and child--are as profound as the effects of child care \non cognitive and social development.\n  We have invested very heavily in the question of child care, but we \nought to be wary of proposals which fail to address the needs and \ndesires of a majority of American children and American families. So \ninstead of choosing to promote a continuation of the current system, we \nought to look at what these experts are telling us and at least try to \nfind a way to balance what we do to provide incentives for parents who \noften, at considerable financial sacrifice, choose to stay home with \ntheir children, particularly in the early months and early years.\n\n  We need to talk about positive family-friendly policies, extended job \nleaves, part-time work, flextime, comptime, job sharing, \ntelecommunicating and other corporate policies which allow families to \nhave more time with children, not less time with children.\n  We ought to encourage ways in which we can increase parental \ninvolvement through tax fairness. Anybody who studies the Tax Code \nknows it is the families raising children that are most discriminated \nagainst in our Tax Code. We have often allowed more tax credits, as a \nformer Representative used to say, for breeding racehorses than for \nraising children, because we penalize families that choose to stay home \nwith their children by narrowly linking tax benefits to day care \nexpenses. The dependent-care tax credit says that the more time you \nspend away from your children, the more time in out-of-home care, the \ngreater the expense, the greater the credit.\n  The Sessions amendment, which I am here to advocate support for and \nvote for, is a good first step, hopefully the beginning of an extensive \ncongressional recognition of the importance of at-home care.\n  We do need a strong, quality child care program for parents who work \nout of the home. We need to make sure that it is available to parents, \nbut we also need to make sure that what is available to parents is \nmaximum choices in terms of how they determine the best way to raise \ntheir children. They need to be treated equally, and the experts tell \nus that they need to be treated equally because ultimately this is the \nbest for children. We recognize that not every working family can \nafford a stay-at-home parent, but we also recognize and need to \nunderstand that what the experts are telling us is that this is the \npreferred option, this is the option for which we ought to be providing \nincentives.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment before us today is a way that we \nas a body can recognize that fact and we can endorse, so that in our \ndebates about how we expand the Tax Code, in our debates about how we \naddress work policies, in our process of determining what is best for \nchildren, we will focus on what is best for children and look at the \nbalance that is necessary to address those families that want a parent \nto stay at home and take care of their children, primarily because that \nis what is best for children. If we are talking about cognitive \ndevelopment, if we are talking about social development, we are talking \nabout uniting parents and children at the earliest stages of their \nlives.\n  There is no child care provider who can provide what a motivated \nmother and informed mother can provide for their child. There is no \nchild care provider who can provide the love and nurturing necessary \nfor the development of that child, and we need to have incentives built \ninto our law that don't discriminate against but actually encourage and \nenhance that selection.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment of Senator \nSessions that we will shortly be voting on and trust that it will \nreceive an overwhelming bipartisan encouragement and affirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Coats, I was very \nhopeful that in spite of your schedule you would have time to speak \nhere this morning. Your staff spoke to us about it. I am very pleased \nyou did that.\n\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for providing the \ntime.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The reason I am is because I really believe when it \ncomes to this issue, while there are many people involved and many \npeople who work on the issue, I listened tentatively to the Senator's \nobservations and his rationale, his common sense applied to it, and I \nthink he articulated the very best American approach to this.\n  While we may not be able to get policy adopted that accomplishes \nthat--it is always difficult--I compliment the\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\nSenator from Indiana because, indeed, I think what he said today and \nwhat he said before is right for the country and right for our children \nand right for the American system of work, people working to get ahead \nand people who want to take care of their children instead of going to \nwork for part of their lives. I really commend him for that.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, even though it is 5 minutes of 10 and \nthe order said we will start debating the Sessions amendment at 10, I \nask unanimous consent that, since we already discussed it, we start the \ndiscussion now and it be equally divided over the next 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will now resume consideration of \nthe Sessions amendment No. 2166, on which there shall be 30 minutes of \ndebate equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note the presence of the sponsor of the amendment, \nSenator Sessions, on the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am one of the cosponsors of the amendment. \nI yield myself 5 minutes for comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to make sure that he does speak, \nbut time is controlled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The sponsor is on the floor, and he controls the time. \nWill Senator Sessions designate that to me for now to try to use our \ntime?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased for Senator Enzi to have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of the Sessions \nsense-of-the-Congress amendment No. 2166. I firmly believe that the at-\nhome parents who forgo a second income so that one parent can raise \ntheir children do deserve some formal recognition by their Federal \nGovernment. That is a tough decision for parents to make, but it is one \nthat is being made every day, and it is making a difference to kids. \nAll this sense-of-the-Congress amendment does is to give some extra \nemphasis to say to parents, if you are making this decision, consider \nit carefully, consider having one of the parents forgo their income and \nstay at home and make a better life for the kids. The purpose of it \nisn't to make anybody feel guilty. The purpose of it is simply to make \nsure that when we are building basic policy, that basic policy includes \nfamilies and basic policy includes an emphasis on families, and basic \npolicy makes it possible, in any way that we can do it, of keeping \nparents with their kids.\n\n  All forms of day care touch on one of our Nation's most important \nresources--our children. If Congress is serious about addressing day \ncare, then we must do so in a fairminded way and not exclude at-home \ncare from the debate. It is unfortunate that at-home care has not \nreceived its day in the spotlight. There are more families that fit \nthis mold than I think many of us are aware.\n  We have an opportunity through this body to change that and should \nchange it in any way we can. Conditions are difficult for two-income \nfamilies. It is even harder for single working moms to raise children. \nFew would argue differently.\n  To be fair, however, we must not imply that families who choose to \nkeep one parent at home with their children are not making any \nsacrifices. They are sacrificing, too. For years, the subtext of \nFederal family policy is that everyone should work and that the burden \nof accommodation should be on those parents who choose to stay at home \nto raise their children. But if the debate revolves around the quality \nof care our children receive, we must modify existing Federal policy \nand end this senseless discrimination.\n  If we are really concerned about the quality of care for our \nchildren, then single-income families should be formally recognized. \nAmerica's tax burden has grown so large in many instances that a second \nparent has to work just to pay the family's tax burden.\n  A 1993 survey found that more than 50 percent of working women would \nstay at home if money were not an issue. These parents should not be \ndiscriminated against by their own Federal Government simply because \nthey sacrifice greater financial gain for their children.\n  The financial penalty inherent in having one parent stay at home to \nraise their children is large indeed. I do not believe that a majority \nof single-income families pursue such an arrangement because they can \neasily afford it. They do it because they believe it is best for their \nkids. They do it as a conscious decision. It should not be the work of \nthis body to second-guess their judgments and their values.\n  Parents who decide to forgo a second income so that one parent might \nbe at home during their children's formative years incur quite an \nexpense, as several Members of my own staff can attest. And I am proud \nof them for the sacrifices that they are making. But I do not think it \nis fair, when we talk about Federal policy, that we should build a \nspecial policy that discriminates against them. We should be \nencouraging that kind of behavior.\n  It is quite clear that at-home care is beneficial to our Nation's \nkids. If this viable alternative is excluded from debate, then the \nmessage this body sends about the quality of care for America's \nchildren is shortsighted, at best. This amendment is geared to provide \nthe recognition that at-home care and the parents who utilize it \ndeserve some recognition.\n  This amendment is supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. That \nis how families are, and it should pass unanimously. I encourage all \nMembers of the Senate to read this amendment, cosponsor it, and vote in \nfavor of its passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with \nthe comments of my friend from Wyoming and as a strong supporter of the \nSessions amendment, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, on the importance \nof at-home parents and the Government role in child care.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of this amendment and thank Senator Sessions, \nthe Senator from Alabama, for his leadership in this area. The Clinton \nchild care policy is always a direct or indirect subsidy to the \nmarketplace day care industry. The President only seeks to help a small \nportion of working parents, ruling out those who wish to stay at home \nand take care of a child and those who do not want to use the \nmarketplace day care.\n  Government policy ought not to discriminate against the best form of \nchild care--where a child is taken care of by his or her parents or \nfamily. I believe that the Federal Government should subsidize the \nfamily, just as it subsidizes the workplace, giving money back to the \nfamily. The family can make the best choices in child care. At best, \nPresident Clinton's day care policy is only a subsidy of another \nworkplace, the institutionalized day care industry.\n  Mr. President, I will soon be introducing legislation to change the \nTax Code to put stay-at-home parents on at least an equal footing with \ntwo-income families. My legislation will increase the current $500 per \nchild tax credit to $1,500 per child for children up to 6 years of age. \nThis credit would replace the current dependent-care tax credit with \nreal money that directly benefits families and restores equality and \nfairness in child care.\n\n  I think this is an important piece of legislation, Mr. President. And \nif, in fact, we go forward in this session of Congress and the \nPresident's idea comes forward--an idea that costs roughly $20 \nbillion--then I suggest my bill ought to replace it. My bill ought to \nreplace it because it does not discriminate between stay-at-home \nparents or those who choose to work. It affects each of them equally, \nbecause they all have children and needs with respect to those \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I thank again Senator Sessions for bringing this \nimportant issue to the floor as part of the budget resolution. I urge \nevery Senator to strongly support his amendment. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am very proud of the excellent \ncomments that have been made by a group of distinguished Senators today \nregarding this amendment. It is not an itty-bitty matter; it is a very \nserious matter. And it reflects a reevaluation by this body of the \npriorities we are placing on helping families raise children. It \nreflects a change in what we have been doing, because we have been, in \nfact, subsidizing one form of child care, a form of child care used by \nonly a few American families, and have been taxing all the other \nAmerican families to support that one form, which is institutional \npublic day care essentially. And I do not believe that is good policy.\n  As Senator Coats mentioned earlier, mothers want, if they are given a \nchoice, to be at home with their children, for the most part, during \ntheir formative years. We know that. Scientists and people also, who \nhave studied this, have concluded that it is better for them to be at \nhome, when they can. So we need to subsidize and support equally all \nforms of child care, if we do so, and we ought to do it in a way that \nallows parents the choices that they prefer.\n  All right. Let me just mention, first, the background on which we are \noperating. This is from the census report, the last census report. This \nis titled: ``Patterns of Child Rearing for Children Under Age 5.''\n  The mother is not employed; the care is by the mother in the home--\nalmost 50 percent; 48 percent of mothers with children under age 5 \nraise them in their home. The President's proposal in current law \nprovides no benefit for those families--zero--even though they may be \ngiving up substantial income because the mother has been in the \nworkplace before and chooses to stay at home because they believe, \nafter prayerful thought and concern in the family, that this is the \nbest way to raise their children. We ought to affirm that. We ought not \nto penalize that by taxing the decision to support this decision.\n  The mother is employed, and the child is in a group day care \npreschool program--16 percent. That is what we have been subsidizing. \nThat is the group we have been subsidizing. You have the mother who is \nworking, but the child is taken care of by a nonrelative, somebody in \nthe home. Maybe it is a nanny who comes and stays in their home and \ntakes care of the children because parents feel, where possible, they \nwould like their children to grow up in their home and have the \nstability and the confidence that comes from that kind of environment. \nAnd 11 percent do that. They get no benefits under this proposal.\n\n  The mother is employed and the care is by a relative, an aunt, a \nmother, a grandmother or sister. They are taken care of. That is 13 \npercent. They have no benefit under the current law or the President's \nproposal.\n  The mother is employed--employed--and the care is by the father or \nthe mother--12 percent.\n  For all of these, only this group gets compensation. That is not good \npolicy. This Congress, this Government in America ought to adopt public \npolicy that in fact encourages our highest and best choices. We ought \nto do that, and I think we can do that.\n  Now, to point out the unfairness of it, look at this chart. This is \nwhere a husband and a wife are employed, both of them employed, one may \nnot be full time. Their average income is $57,000.\n  Where there is a dual-earner family, both husband and wife work and \nare employed full time, their average salary is $64,000.\n  But where you have a single earner, a husband is employed and the \nwife not employed, and the husband may not be employed full time--and \nmany do not have full-time jobs; they cannot get them--their average \nincome is $38,000.\n  Where the husband is employed and the wife is not employed, the \nhusband is employed full time, the average income is $42,000.\n  You see the difference. We are subsidizing this choice. We are not \nsubsidizing this choice where parents stay at home. That is not good \npublic policy, and I think we need to change it.\n  I congratulate Senator Smith, who just spoke, because he is asking us \nto consider what we are going to do to eliminate this imbalance. I \nthink he has thought the matter through, and he has come up with some \nconclusions that he has put in legislation to which this body needs to \ngive serious thought.\n  Of course, this resolution basically does not suggest a solution to \nthe problem. It just says we are going to set a policy here to change \nthe way we have been doing business. I think we ought to affirm parents \nwho, after prayerful, careful, serious thought among themselves, \nconclude that it is best for their children to forgo a second income \nand stay at home. I think we ought to affirm that with public policy.\n  Finally--I know my time is about up--this is a matter of \nsignificance. I have been delighted to see Senators calling our office \nthe last 2 days wanting to sign on as cosponsors of this amendment. \nWhile I was on the floor yesterday, three Senators asked me could they \njoin as a cosponsor of this amendment. It has broad bipartisan \nsupport--Democrats and Republicans. I hope we have a unanimous vote on \nthis issue.\n  But what I want to say is this: Do not sign on as a cosponsor, do not \nvote for this resolution, if you are not prepared to back it up by \nvotes on the floor when we start setting tax policy and we start \nappropriating funds. If you are not prepared to support this \nphilosophy, do not sign on because that is what erodes public \nconfidence in America.\n\n  We talk a good game, but when the chips are down we often find \nreasons not to follow through on our commitments. I believe this is \ngood public policy. I believe it is a resolution that sets the tone for \nthis Congress. The House has passed a similar resolution, 419-0. I \nthink that says something. I believe this body will be virtually \nunanimous, if not unanimous. After that, we are going to have to talk \nwith Senator Smith and other Members of this body to figure out a way \nto implement that policy.\n  It is a challenge to all the committees that are going to be dealing \nwith these issues. They are going to have to reflect this view. I hope \nthat they will. If they don't, we need to stand up and say we are not \ngoing to pass or support legislation that is not consistent with this \nresolution that treats all parents equally.\n  Mr. President, thank you for the time.\n  I thank my fellow Senators for their support for this resolution. I \nbelieve it is a great step forward in improving child care and \ndevelopment in America. Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to applaud the Senator from \nAlabama for focusing attention on the important concerns of stay-at-\nhome parents. I have said repeatedly, and continue to believe, that the \nbest child care providers, particularly in the earliest months and \nyears, are parents. Clearly, where both parents must work, we should \ntry to help them provide the best possible care of their children. \nHowever, we should also help parents who make the difficult decision to \nforego a second income so that one parent can stay at home to care for \na child.\n  That is the reason why I introduced legislation, S. 1610, the Child \nCare ACCESS Act, that will, for the first time, extend the Dependent \nCare Tax Credit to parents who stay at home to care for their young \nchildren. In fact, this piece of legislation, co-sponsored by 26 of my \nDemocratic colleagues, does more for stay-at-home parents than any \nother proposal that has been introduced. Only this legislation would \nextend this important financial assistance to stay-at-home parents \nearning less than $30,000. For such families, the financial sacrifice \nof forgoing a second income is severe. They certainly deserve as much, \nif not more, support in staying home to care for their children as \nfamilies earning more than $30,000.\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about helping parents who want to be \nhome with their children, we should also promptly enact an expansion of \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. I have introduced legislation \nwhich would extend the benefits of the Family and Medical Leave Act to \nallow an additional 13 million parents to stay at home for up to 12 \nweeks to care for a newborn or sick child without fear of job loss.\n  I think we would all agree that we must support all parents --mothers \nand\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\nfathers--in the decisions they make, whether it is to work in the paid \nlabor force, to stay home with their children, or do some of each. \nIndeed, many parents move in and out of the labor force at different \npoints in their children's lives--depending on the ages and needs of \ntheir children and their financial situations. All families deserve our \nhelp in raising the next generation of Americans. We must invest in our \nfuture if that future is to hold promise for our children, for our \nfamilies, and for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. With regard to the amendment we have been discussing \nthis morning and the fact that families are choosing to give up a \nsecond income in order that they may have a parent stay home with their \nchildren in the early, formative years, I want to share a few thoughts \nwith this body.\n  As I traveled my State last month and I discussed this issue, time \nand time again families would come up to me after my remarks and say, \n``Thank you for saying that. We made that exact decision in our family. \nMy wife had worked, and she decided she wanted to stay home with the \nchildren while they are young. It costs us a lot of money. We don't \nregret it. We are glad you have considered us raising children and you \nbelieve we ought to have a fair shake in that regard.''\n  My wife taught school for 4 years. When we had children, we made a \ndecision she would cease teaching. I was able to have a decent income \nand take care of the family. We were not rich, but that was a decision \nwe made, and we were very glad we did that. In fact, we probably would \nnot have qualified for benefits under this program because this would \nbe a program favoring lower income people.\n  Additionally, I wanted to share some numbers with the Members of this \nbody. According to the most recently available data from the Census \nBureau, a dramatically different picture is showing up than the one \nmany would project. The facts show that although day care use did \nincrease rapidly through the 1980's, the increase in the use of day \ncare has come to a halt. The percentage of children under age 5 with \nemployed mothers nearly doubled from the mid-1970's through 1998, but \nin subsequent years maternal employment remained fixed. In 1994, the \nlast year recorded by the Census, the percentage of preschool children \nwith employed mothers was still 52 percent, the same as it was in 1998.\n\n  My personal observations of the people I associate with, that my \nchildren have gone to school with, are that people are questioning the \nmentality that it is always best for both parents to work, and they are \nmaking different decisions. It is time for us to have Government policy \nthat reflects that. I am very pleased with the bipartisan support this \namendment is receiving. I think it reflects a serious reevaluation on \nbehalf of this Congress on how to spend money in aid of children. I \nsolicit the support of all Senators for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want to clarify exactly where we are, what the \nschedule calls for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is voting on Sessions amendment No. \n2166 at 10:30. The remaining time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am pleased to support the amendment that the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama offers, because I think we all share \nthe view that if a parent can stay at home--mother can stay at home, \ntypically--then that is the best way to go and there ought not to be \nany discrimination against that kind of a policy or program. But people \nare forced, because of the pressure on incomes, to often look for the \nsecond or even the third job in the household.\n  As we examine the programs that will promote the parents at home, I \nthink we have to consider this amendment as an indication of where we \nall stand. The amendment, as I see it, simply affirms the view that \nfamilies should not be punished for their child care choice. There is \nno better babysitter, no better caregiver, than the mother of the \nchild. I don't think anyone will disagree with that.\n  Democrats are proud of our long record of helping families with a \nstay-at-home parent to make ends meet. When you got to a particular \nvintage, kind of like mine--advanced middle-age, I think we call it--it \nwas typical, regardless of the difficulty that existed financially in \nthe household; somehow or other it all came together.\n  My mother was widowed when she was 36. I had already enlisted in the \nArmy. I had a little sister at home. Mom managed to take care of my \nsister, get a modest allotment from my military pay, and at the same \ntime have a job. She made all those arrangements, and my sister was \nnever neglected and grew up a happy, fulfilled person, as did my mother \nand I. But things are different now. We live in a pressure-cooker world \nwhere people just can't seem to get by unless there are multiple jobs \nin the household. For the middle-income family, it is not atypical.\n  So Democrats, maybe we kind of harken back to a different day and say \nthose were the proper kinds of functions to be going on in the \nhousehold. Things were modest, but people accepted their fate and tried \nto work their way out of it. In 1993, what we tried to do was to \nestablish the opportunity for a family to take care of their kids. We \nsecured an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, giving a refund \nto those people who just didn't make enough to care for their families. \nIn 1996, we secured an increase in the minimum wage. Last year, we won \nthe $500-per-child tax credit.\n\n  Now, all of these initiatives put more money in the pockets of \nAmerican workers, and I, as a Democrat, and those of us who are \nDemocrats were happy to see that. This is not to suggest that many of \nour Republican friends were not happy, but it put a Democratic stamp on \nthese programs. I am sure, again, many of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle support it. These things have made a real difference. \nAlso, the Family and Medical Leave Act, signed into law by President \nClinton, has given parents the flexibility to take time off to care for \na newborn or a sick child. When it comes to helping working moms, I \nthink we are all on the same page.\n  Once again, I commend Senator Sessions for offering this amendment. I \nam pleased to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I express my appreciation to the Senator from New \nJersey for his support.\n  I add as original cosponsors of this legislation the names of \nSenators Roth and Kay Bailey Hutchison, who have asked to be \ncosponsors. I ask unanimous consent they be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I wonder, Senator Lautenberg, if I could offer \nthree amendments now--not speaking to them, but allowing them to be \nread.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have no objection to the Senator from Oregon \noffering his amendments, but we are on a 10:30 schedule and I think it \nis important we preserve that schedule.\n  I am happy to yield the floor to the Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2179\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2179.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section, and renumber the remaining sections accordingly:\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) financing for Social Security Old Age, Survivors, and \n     Disability Insurance (OASDI) is provided primarily by taxes \n     levied on wages and net self-employment income. The level of \n     these tax rates is set permanently in the law at the rate \n     payable today;\n       (2) more than ninety-five percent of the work force--an \n     estimated 148.2 million workers in 1998--is required to pay \n     Social Security taxes;\n       (3) Social Security taxes are paid both by employees and \n     employers and the self-employed on earnings up to a maximum \n     amount of $68,400 in 1998, the amount increasing at the same \n     rate as average earnings in the economy;\n       (4) the Social Security tax was first levied in 1937 at a \n     rate of 1% on earnings up to $3,000 per year;\n       (5) the rate in 1998 has risen to 6.2 perecent--an increase \n     of 620 percent, and a majority of American families pay more \n     in Social Security taxes than income taxes;\n       (6) in his State of the Union message on January 27, 1998, \n     President Clinton called on Congress to ``save Social \n     Security first'' and to ``reserve one hundred percent of the \n     surplus, that is any penny of the surplus, until we have \n     taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social \n     Security system for the twenty-first century.''\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that when the \n     Congress moves to work in a bipartisan way on specific \n     legislation to reform the Social Security system, it will not \n     consider increasing Social Security tax rates on American \n     workers, beyond the permanent levels set in current law nor \n     increase the maximum earnings subject to Social Security \n     taxation beyond those prescribed by the wage indexing rules \n     of current law.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Briefly, Mr. President, this amendment is a very \nsimple sense of the Senate on Social Security that says that when we \nact to save Social Security, we will not be doing so by increasing \nSocial Security taxes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2180\n\n (Purpose: To clarify Federal law with respect to the use of marijuana)\n\n  Mr SMITH of Oregon.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.    . GENERAL PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF MARIJUANA FOR \n                   MEDICINAL PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that no funds appropriated by Congress \n     should be used to provide, procure, furnish, fund or support, \n     or to compel any individual, institution or government entity \n     to provide, procure, furnish, fund or support, any item, \n     good, benefit, program or service, for the purpose of the use \n     of marijuana for medicinal purposes.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Briefly, Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment on an issue that has become of great concern to me and \nto many in my State, the legalization of marijuana for medical use. I \nwill speak to this later.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2181\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning increases in \n                    the prices of tobacco products)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I send an additional amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2181.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 53, strike lines 1 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PRICE INCREASE ON TOBACCO \n                   PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the use of tobacco products by children and teenagers \n     has become a public health epidemic and according to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than \n     16,000,000 of our Nation's children today will become regular \n     smokers;\n       (2) of the 16,000,000 children who become regular smokers, \n     approximately one-third or 5,000,000 children will die of \n     tobacco-related illness;\n       (3) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     that tobacco use costs medicare approximately $10,000,000,000 \n     per year, and the total economic cost of tobacco in health-\n     related costs is more than $100,000,000,000 per year; and\n       (4) the public health community recognizes that by \n     increasing the cost of tobacco products by $1.50 per pack, \n     the rate of tobacco use among children and teenagers will be \n     reduced.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that, if \n     comprehensive tobacco legislation requires an increase in the \n     price of cigarettes, any such revenue should be used to \n     restore solvency to the medicare program under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Briefly, this amendment is a sense of the Senate \nregarding the use of tobacco revenue to restore the solvency of the \nMedicare Program, an amendment similar to the one that Senator \nLautenberg introduced in the Budget Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2166\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING A PATIENT'S BILL OF \n                   RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) patients lack reliable information about health plans \n     and the quality of care that health plans provide;\n       (2) experts agree that the quality of health care can be \n     substantially improved, resulting in less illness and less \n     premature death;\n       (3) some managed care plans have created obstacles for \n     patients who need to see specialists on an ongoing basis and \n     have required that women get permission from their primary \n     care physician before seeing a gynecologist;\n       (4) a majority of consumers believe that health plans \n     compromise their quality of care to save money;\n       (5) Federal preemption under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 prevents States from enforcing \n     protections for the 125,000,000 workers and their families \n     receiving health insurance through employment-based group \n     health plans; and\n       (6) the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and \n     Quality in the Health Care Industry has unanimously \n     recommended a patient bill of rights to protect patients \n     against abuses by health plan and health insurance issuers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense Senate that the \n     assumptions underlying this resolution provide for the \n     enactment of legislation to establish a patient's bill of \n     rights for participants in health plans, and that legislation \n     should include--\n       (1) a guarantee of access to covered services, including \n     needed emergency care, specialty care, obstetrical and \n     gynecological care for women, and prescription drugs;\n       (2) provisions to ensure that the special needs of women \n     are met, including protecting women against ``drive-through \n     mastectomies'';\n       (3) provisions to ensure that the special needs of children \n     are met, including access to pediatric specialists and \n     centers of pediatric excellence;\n       (4) provisions to ensure that the special needs of \n     individuals with disabilities and the chronically ill are \n     met, including the possibility of standing referrals to \n     specialists or the ability to have a specialist act as a \n     primary care provider;\n       (5) a procedure to hold health plans accountable for their \n     decisions and to provide for the appeal of a decision of a \n     health plan to deny care to an independent, impartial \n     reviewer;\n       (6) measures to protect the integrity of the physician-\n     patient relationship, including a ban on ``gag clauses'' and \n     a ban on improper incentive arrangements; and\n       (7) measures to provide greater information about health \n     plans to patients and to improve the quality of care.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2184\n\n (Purpose: To increase Function 500 discretionary budget authority and \n  outlays to support innovative education reform efforts in urban and \n                        rural school districts)\n\n       On page 16, line 9, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 10, increase the amount by $10,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 13, increase the amount by $318,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 14, increase the amount by $146,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 17, increase the amount by $386,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 18, increase the amount by $276,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 21, increase the amount by $359,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 22, increase the amount by $358,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 25, increase the amount by $272,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 1, increase the amount by $359,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, strike ``-$300,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$500,000,000.''\n       On page 25, line 9, strike ``-$1,900,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$1,910,000,000.''\n       On page 25, line 12, strike ``-$1,200,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$1,518,000,000.''\n       On page 25, line 13, strike ``-$4,600,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$4,746,000,000.''\n       On page 25, line 16, strike ``-$2,700,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$3,086,000,000.''\n       On page 25, line 17, strike ``-$3,000,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$3,276,000,000.''\n       On page 25, line 20, strike ``-$3,800,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$4,159,000,000.''\n       On page 25, line 21, strike ``-$7,000,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$7,358,000,000.''\n       On page 25, line 24, strike ``-$5,400,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$5,672,000,000.''\n       On page 25, line 25, strike ``-$5,000,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-$5,359,000,000.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2185\n\n(Purpose: Expressing the sense of Congress regarding additional budget \n      authority for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I ask that the three amendments be \nsequenced after amendments to be offered by Senators Hollings, \nLautenberg and Daschle, and that they alternate with Republican \namendments, in whatever form----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I object. I thought your request was that you send \nthem to the desk and that they be sequenced as the leadership is \nsequencing in a manner we consider to be fair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is exactly what I am requesting.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2165\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Murray amendment No. 2165.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are about to consider, I believe, one \nof the most important amendments that this body faces. It has to do \nwith public education and the direction that this Congress, this \nSenate, this budget is going in that will affect the lives of thousands \nof students and their families and their neighborhoods and communities \nacross this country.\n  Mr. President, I believe one of the main principles that this country \nwas founded on was that of education, public education, the ability for \nevery child in this country, no matter who they are, where they come \nfrom, what their financial background is, to have a strong education, \nan education that will allow them to learn how to read, how to write, \nhow to participate in a democracy, and how to be a contributing citizen \nto our economy once they have reached the adult age.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very shocking that this budget which \nsits before us and the policies we are about to put in place say to \nstudents and their parents across this country that education is no \nlonger a top priority in this country. I think that is a terrible \nmessage and one that we have to change with this budget today. Now is \nthe time.\n  Mr. President, it is amazing to me that in the fiscal year 1998 \nbudget, the entire budget--look at this chart--2 percent of our entire \nFederal budget goes to education. Yet, when you ask parents and \nfamilies and people across this country whether or not we are spending \nenough on education, only 9 percent of this country think we are \nspending too much; only 26 percent think we are spending the right \namount; and 58 percent of the people in this country believe we are \nspending too little on education. Mr. President, I could not agree \nmore.\n\n  Two percent of our budget is not enough. It is not enough funds for \nour children, and it is the wrong message in this country, where we \nbelieve that democracy will survive if every one of our children has \nthe access they need to a quality education--be it public or private. \nBut in particular, in terms of what we spend here in the Nation's \nCapital for students across this country, it is far too little.\n  The amendment that we now have before us simply establishes a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for class size improvement, especially in \nthe early grades. It was used as an offset for any available mandatory \nsavings or revenues, with the exception of tobacco revenues. What this \namendment does is put in place a placeholder, if you will, in the \nbudget so when this Congress begins to listen to parents and students \nand families and teachers and communities across this country, we will \nhave a placeholder in the budget that we can at our discretion put \navailable funds into to make sure that we address the issue of class \nsize.\n  I know that class size reduction makes a difference. Every parent in \nthis country knows that, every teacher knows that, businesses know \nthat, and communities know that. And throughout this morning's debate, \nI will talk about what parents say, what students say, and what \nteachers say, because I believe if we begin to fundamentally address \nthe issue of class size and the\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\ntremendous loads in our classrooms today, we will begin to address the \ncritical need of education and make a tremendous difference for our \ncountry in the future.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I will yield such time as he may need to \nSenator Wellstone to speak on behalf of this amendment, and then I will \ngo into detail about my amendment and what I want to do in this budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. First of all, let me thank Senator \nMurray for her leadership. Senator Murray has an unusual background. \nShe comes to the U.S. Senate having been a teacher.\n  Mr. President, if I might ask the Senator, what level did she teach? \nI believe it was elementary school or preschool.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I taught at the community college level, \nparent education, and I taught preschool, 4- and 5-year-olds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Washington really \nbrings to this debate her own life experience, both at the higher \neducation level, training other men and women to be teachers, and also \nherself having taught really at the critical age, in the very early \nyears of a child's education. We don't have that many Senators with \nthis background. I think all of us are lucky that the State of \nWashington has sent Senator Murray here to the U.S. Senate. Quite often \nwhen we get into these discussions, they are very abstract and very \ntheoretical and all about strategy. But Senator Murray has really lived \nthis debate. She brings, I think, a special expertise and a special \npassion. I wish more Senators, as we get into this debate, could draw \nfrom the same kind of background.\n\n  Mr. President, I did not teach at the elementary school level or \nearly childhood development; I was a college teacher. But in the last 7 \nyears I tried my very best to be in schools around the country, but in \nthe main in Minnesota. I think I have been in a school probably about \nevery 2 weeks. What I try to do is turn these assemblies or classes--\nand there can be anywhere from 100 or 200 to 1,000 students and \nteachers and support staff in town meetings like all of us have in our \nStates. I say to the students, look, it is kind of like everybody is \ntalking about you but very few people are talking to you or with you. \nGive me your best wisdom as to what would make for the best education \nreform. What makes for a good education from your point of view? I say \nto my colleague from Washington, by coming to the floor with this \namendment, she is right on target. Students talk about smaller class \nsize everywhere I go.\n  Now, I personally think--and my colleague from Washington mentioned \nthis--that especially at the elementary school level, small class sizes \nreally make a huge difference. I think actually as you look at from K \nthrough 12--actually, I argue, after that, in colleges and universities \nas well--smaller class sizes make a huge difference. With a smaller \nclass size, we have an opportunity to get to know our teachers, they \nsay, to have more rapport with teachers. Our teachers can give us more \nspecial attention. We have an opportunity to have teachers that can \nfire our imagination, teachers that are really free to teach. And \nteachers say it as well.\n  So let me just be clear with colleagues. I remember when I first came \nhere--and I haven't changed my view at all, I say to my colleague from \nWashington--I was debating with a good friend, Senator Hatch from Utah. \nI said to the Senator from Utah, ``I just feel that this debate is \nahead of the story.'' When you can come to the floor, or any Senator \ncan come to the floor, and say we have made the commitment to public \neducation--we made the commitment to smaller class size; we made the \ncommitment to making sure that children, by kindergarten, come ready to \nlearn; made the commitment by way of equity financing to schools in \ndistricts where people don't have all the financial resources, don't \nhave the good facilities and the textbooks, the buildings are in \ndisrepair; we made the commitment to summer institutes for teachers to \nmeet other teachers and get renewed and fired up about teaching--we \nhave made all those commitments, and it still isn't working, then I say \nlet's consider something else.\n  But we have an amendment on the floor that Senator Murray has now \nintroduced, based upon her own life's work, upon what people in \ncommunities around the country tell us is important for their children, \ntell us what is important to them--that is to get some additional \nFederal resources back at the school district level to reduce class \nsizes, so all of our children have an opportunity to do well in school, \nall of our children have an opportunity to reach their full potential. \nNo one amendment, no one expenditure of money accomplishes this goal.\n  I say to my colleague from Washington that I thank her for being out \nhere on the floor with this amendment, because this is a concrete step \nthat can make a very positive difference in the improvement of the \nlives of children in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Washington. I speak in strong \nfavor of her amendment. The resolution offers a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund for class size improvement. Specifically, it states that if funds \nbecome available, budget levels may be adjusted for legislation to \nimprove, or in effect lower, class size for students, especially in the \nearliest grades.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, for being the \nleader on this issue of class size for public schools. She and I share \nthe same commitment to public education and believe strongly that the \nFederal Government has a limited but very important role in supporting \npublic education.\n  Today's resolution, Mr. President, is very important because it \ndemonstrates a commitment by the U.S. Senate to dedicate available \nFederal funds to reduce class size in the earliest grades.\n  Parents, teachers and school administrators are increasingly aware of \nthe very positive impact smaller class size can have on student \nachievement. It is about time that the Senate goes on record in support \nof smaller classes for our public school children in the earliest \ngrades.\n  The positive impact of smaller classes came to my attention in my \nState of Wisconsin, and that is because Wisconsin, as is often the case \nin public education, has been a leader on this issue. In 1995, the \nWisconsin State Legislature created the successful pilot program called \nthe Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program, known as the \nSAGE program.\n  Wisconsin's SAGE program has demonstrated again and again what we \nreally know instinctively: Students in smaller classes benefit from \nmore attention from teachers, and teachers with fewer students will \nhave more time and energy to devote to their jobs.\n  A December 1997 study found that the first-graders participating in \nthe Wisconsin SAGE program scored higher on standardized tests than \nother students in comparison schools.\n  It is my hope that the SAGE program and this budget resolution \noffered by the Senator from Washington reinforce what should be good \ncommon sense. If you have smaller classes, children will get more \nattention from teachers, and it stands to reason that more attention \nwill translate into greater learning.\n  In supporting this resolution, Mr. President, I want to clearly state \nthat I believe there is a great national purpose in trying to reduce \nclass sizes for children in the earliest grades. However, I do not \nsupport a national mandate for smaller classes. Instead, I support \nsmaller classes as a national goal that would be primarily controlled \nby the local government and local school boards and the administrators.\n  Additionally, I want to be sure that any distribution formula for the \nfunds that would become available to reduce class size should give \ncredit to States, like my State of Wisconsin, which have already \ninvested substantial resources in this effort.\n  Finally, I want to again stress the importance of this resolution \nbeing deficit neutral. The Senator from Washington has been sensitive \nto that. The resolution is deficit neutral. The days of deficit \nspending and borrowing from Social Security have to be over.\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\n  To conclude, Mr. President, I think this resolution takes a very \npositive step toward helping school districts reduce class size as a \npart of an overall effort to improve education and ensure that our \nchildren have the best chance to excel and reach their full potential. \nLet me finally thank the Senator from Washington again. I have heard \nher speak both publicly and privately on this issue of class size. She \nspeaks with experience, but she also speaks with great feeling and \neloquence on this subject. She knows what she is talking about, and she \nis a great force in the Senate and in the Congress on this issue.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Minnesota and \nWisconsin for their support of this issue, for their understanding of \nthis issue, for their backing and their commitment to making sure that \nwe set as a priority in this country the issue of education and, most \ncritically, the issue of class size across this country.\n  Mr. President, I came to the Senate 5 years ago. And I was frustrated \nwhen I came, and I felt that leaders in Washington, DC, were not really \ndealing with the issues that I talked about and I worried about at home \nat my kitchen table every night 2,500 miles away in the State of \nWashington.\n  I have to say that over the past 5 years we have begun to make \nprogress and talk about the real issues that everyday families talk \nabout at their kitchen tables every night. Certainly we have finally \nbalanced the budget and stopped deficit spending, something that \nfamilies worry about. But, more importantly, we have faced issues such \nas family medical leave that allows parents to take time off from their \njobs to take care of a sick child. We have put 100,000 police officers \non the streets because many families across this country at their \nkitchen tables worry about the safety of their families on a daily \nbasis. We have addressed some of those critical issues and much more.\n  But today on the floor of the Senate, I can say with certainty that \nthis Congress, under this proposed budget, is badly missing the mark \nwhen it comes to addressing the most important concern that every \nparent faces today and every family talks about at their kitchen table \nat night. Families ask: Will my child get a good education? Will my \nchild get the attention they deserve? Will they be safe? Will they be \ntaught the skills they need to get a job in tomorrow's economy? Those \nare the kitchen table conversations that worry every single family in \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you today I feel absolutely confident that \nI can speak to this issue with a lot of background and understanding. I \ncame to the Senate with a daughter who was in 7th grade and a son who \nwas in 10th grade. They both have spent their entire K-12 years in \npublic education. I am a product of public education.\n  Today my daughter is a senior in high school, and she is my best \nadviser about what is happening in our public education system. And \nwhat they say to me--what my daughter and my son say to me--is, it is \ndifficult to learn the skills that they need when they are in crowded \nclassrooms. They do not get the attention they need in math or science \nor English, and they tell me that there is what they call ``hall rage'' \nin our classrooms because of crowded classrooms with a lot of kids in \nour classrooms. It tends to generate a lot of frustration and rage \namong our children, and safety is a concern.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Wellstone said, I come here as an educator. \nI am a former community college instructor. I taught parent education, \nand I also taught preschool. I had in my class twenty-four 4- and 5-\nyear-olds. I know what a difference it makes when you reduce the number \nof children that are in a classroom.\n  When I had 18 children in my classroom, I could take the individual \ntime that I needed to work with these young children to help them get a \ngrasp on the alphabet, to begin to learn to spell their names, to \nunderstand the world around them, to sit down in groups with other \nchildren and learn how to ``get along'' --a skill too many kids do not \nhave today. I know what happened the next year when I had 24 children \nin my class--much less individual attention; it became no longer \nteaching, it became crowd control.\n  I know as a teacher that reducing class size, particularly in the \nyoung grades, will make a difference for children across this country.\n  I also come here with experience being a school board member. I have \nmanaged budgets at the school district level. I know how tough those \ndecisions are. I know how difficult it is to meet the demands that \neveryday school districts have. As a school board director in a \nsuburban district, I was frustrated with the lack of funding that we \ngot. We were frustrated with the lack of priority that education had at \nthe Federal level, and we were constantly frustrated that we could not \ndo the right thing.\n  I can tell you, as a schoolboard member who has managed thousands of \ndollars in education funding at the local level, this amendment, this \ngoal, this direction for our country, is badly needed.\n  I also come here as a former State senator. I served on the budget-\nwriting committee in my State senate. I know what a priority education \nis for our States, and I know how difficult it is for them to address \nthis issue. My State of Washington has the fourth worst class size in \nthe Nation.\n\n  If my State and other States across this country were told that this \nwas a national priority and one that they would not just be told is a \npriority they have to do, but one that they got a jump-start with from \nthe Federal level, it would make it easier for them and a priority for \nthem to do what we are asking them to do and what they know they need \nto do.\n  I come here today as a budget writer in the U.S. Senate. I have \nserved on the national budget-writing committee for 5 years. I have \nworked diligently to reduce the deficit and to make sure that we put \nour priorities in place. That is why, when I look at the budget that is \non the floor today, I say the priorities are not in the right place. My \namendment simply puts aside a reserve fund so that when this Congress \nbegins to do what parents are asking them to do across this country, \nand to make this a national priority, we have in place a deficit-\nneutral account that we can begin to put funds in so that we can \naddress this absolutely critical issue.\n  I have told you what my personal experience is. You have heard from \nseveral of my colleagues. But most importantly, studies back up what I \nhave just told you. A 1989 study of the Tennessee STAR Program, which \ncompared the performance of students in grades K through 3 in small and \nregular-sized classes, found that students in small classes--13 to 17 \nstudents--significantly outperformed other students in math and reading \nevery year at all grade levels across geographic areas.\n  Mr. President, I have heard a number of my colleagues come to the \nfloor and worry and fret over the fact that students are not graduating \nfrom high school with the skills they need to get into the job market. \nClass size makes a difference in their ability to get these skills. The \nstudies show it. The followup study of the STAR Program in 1995 found \nthat students in small classes in grades K through 3 continued to \noutperform their peers at least through grade 8 with achievement \nadvantages, especially large for minority students. Class size \nreduction makes a difference. How long are we going to ignore these \nstudies on the floor of the Senate? How long are we going to say no, \nnot here?\n  Other State and local studies have since found that students in \nsmaller classes outperform their peers in reading and math, they \nperform as well or better than students in magnet or voucher schools, \nand that gains are especially significant among African American males. \nThe studies back up what my experience shows, and the studies back up \nwhat every single Senator and Congressman says that they have as a goal \ntoday, which is to improve math and science and reading skills across \nthis country.\n  But we do not just have to listen to what the studies say; we should \nlisten to what parents say. When any parent is sitting there the \nafternoon that their child comes home from their very first day of \nschool in September, there are two questions that every single parent \nin every household across this country asks their child on that first\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\nday of school when they come home. They say: ``Who is your teacher? How \nmany students are in your classroom?'' Who is your teacher? Universal \nquestions in every home across this country. Why? Because parents know \nthat who that teacher is and the quality of that teacher is critical to \ntheir child's learning for the next entire 9 months:\n\n  ``How many children are in your classroom?'' Every single parent \nintuitively knows that their child will get a better education the \nsmaller the class size. And I can tell you, when that student answers, \n``35 children, 40 children,'' that parent feels, ``This is not going to \nbe a great year.'' Parents know that the skills their child needs to \nsucceed will be better learned in a smaller class size. And that is why \nthey ask on the first day of school, ``How many students are in your \nclassroom?''\n  Parents today are also concerned about children's safety. No \nsurprise. And I can tell you as a teacher, and I know that every parent \nknows, that if a teacher has the ability to listen to their children, \nto work with their children, to prepare their children, and to really \nget to know those young people in their classrooms, their safety will \nbe much, much better. And discipline will be much less of a problem, \nbecause that teacher has time to work with those tough kids that are in \ntheir classes today.\n  But, we have heard what parents say. We know what the studies say. \nWhat are teachers saying? I have taken some time over the last few \nweeks to ask teachers what they said about class size. These are the \npeople, the professionals that are in our classrooms every day with our \nyoung people.\n  Here is what some teachers have said to me: This ``is the most \nimportant improvement we can make. A working condition that in many \nways is [far] more important [to me] than salary. If teachers feel like \nthey are making progress, other complaints seem minimal. If teachers \nfeel behind, at a loss, and overwhelmed by large classes, any other \nproblems loom large.''\n  ``It's not only important for classroom management, but also for time \nspent evaluating each student's work, and time for individual attention \nwith each student.''\n  One teacher told me: ``The difference between teaching a class of 31 \nhigh school students and teaching 28 is the difference between lion-\ntaming and teaching.''\n  Mr. President, students and teachers and parents know that class size \nreduction makes a difference.\n  I also have a young group of students that I work with in my home \nState. They are called my Student Advisory Youth Involvement Team. I go \nto them on a regular basis, and I tell them, as young people under the \nage of 18, that their voice is important here in the Nation's Capital \nand their priorities are important as well. And I ask them how they \nfeel about different issues that are coming before the Senate.\n  I took some time to talk to some of those young students over the \npast several weeks about class size and what is happening in their \nschools and what could make a difference. Christopher Shim, who is a \n17-year-old from Mercer High School, said, ``In elementary school, I \nactually felt I was pretty lucky. I was able to get personal time with \nthe teacher, even though we had 30-35 students in my elementary \nclassrooms.'' He continued, ``In high school, I have 40 people in my \ncalculus class. This means any time I have a question, there are 10 \npeople in line.''\n  Mr. President, we stand out here on the floor of the Senate and we \ntalk about how important it is for our young people to get math and \nscience skills, and yet here is a student who says when he needs help \nwith a question in calculus, there are 10 people consistently in line. \nSmaller class sizes make a difference.\n\n  I had another student who said to me, ``In [my] high school civics \nclass, there is only one teacher teaching two classes of 40 students \neach. It's harder to get through the curriculum and get answers to your \nquestions.''\n  Mr. President, consistently students gave me comments. And I will be \nreading more of them throughout the debate. But one after the other, \nwhat these young people--who are in the classrooms today, where the \nstress is on them to get the good grades, to go on to college, to get a \ngood job--what they told me consistently was that they felt that \nreducing class size was important.\n  Are we going to listen to parents? Are we going to listen to \nteachers? Are we going to listen to the young people themselves? Are we \ngoing to listen to the thousands of families across our communities \ntoday who know this makes a difference, who say to their child when \nthey come home, ``How many kids are in your classroom?'' because they \nknow? Are we going to listen to the studies? Are we going to say it is \nthe right thing to do to make this a national priority? Or today on the \nfloor of the Senate, are we going to say no? Are we going to say that 2 \npercent is enough? Are we going to say that education is no longer a \npriority of this Government?\n  I have heard too many people say, ``Leave it to the local school \nboards. Leave it to the States. It should not be a national priority.'' \nI could not disagree more. We cannot pass the buck any longer. Making \nsure that every one of our children gets a good education is a priority \nfor every adult in this country, whether they are a parent, a community \nleader, a State leader, or a national leader. It is our responsibility \nto set the priorities within this budget. My amendment allows us to do \nthat as the debate progresses across the rest of this year.\n  Mr. President, as you know, I feel strongly about this, and I know \nthere are a number of my colleagues who are here today who support this \nas well.\n  I yield to the Democratic ranking member at this time for a \nstatement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will try not to take more than 5 minutes, but I \nappreciate having 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I rise in support of the Murray amendment because it \nvery simply focuses on a problem that is of critical importance. It \nestablishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to help reduce class sizes. \nI have to commend the Senator from Washington because her focus on \nchildren extends to the whole range, from nutrition, health, education, \nand child care. She is right, in my view, to bring this amendment up \nbefore the Senate, and now before the American people.\n  What she is saying is young people need more attention from their \nteachers and thus the class size reduction is a perfect avenue toward \ngetting them more attention. The capacity for the child to learn \nincreases when class sizes are smaller.\n  Once again, I commend our friend and colleague from Washington. She \nis one among several of our colleagues who call education focus of \ntheir agenda. The reserve fund would allow the Congress to help the \nStates and local educational agencies recruit, train, and hire the \n100,000 additional teachers by the year 2005. These teachers would \nreduce class sizes in grades 1 to 3 to an average of 18 students per \nclassroom. Mr. President, this is a very important initiative and \ndeserves our support.\n  I will now speak for a moment about a personal experience. I grew up \nin what is now one of America's poorest cities, an industrial city, in \nNew Jersey. The city is called Paterson, NJ. I was born there. I and a \ncouple of my business associates decided to try to help out because of \nour good fortune and our interest in what was taking place within that \nold favorite city of ours. We provided a program for extending free \ntuition--we paid for it--for students who, from the sixth grade, our \ntargeted grade, went on to pass their high school requirements and we \nwould pay for their education in college. I thought it was a pretty \nsignificant inducement. We had academic counselors that worked with \nthese students. Then-Vice President Quayle was very kind, spending 45 \nminutes with these youngsters. It was a real treat for them. We took \nthem on various trips and tried to help them along.\n  I am ashamed to say, pained to say, really, that the program did not \ndo a lot of good. We are reexamining why. The principal thing that \njumped out at us was that the sixth grade was too late to start, too \nlate to make a difference with these youngsters.\n  When examined it further, we look to the earliest grades, grades 1, \n2, and 3. We found that those early learning experiences matter most. \nSo I think that this amendment helps us to concentrate on putting our \nresources where they will do the most good. It is\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\ncritical to get the kids off on a good start at that tender age. That \nis why President Clinton proposed this major national effort to limit \nclass sizes in the early grades. That is why the proposal enjoys such \nstrong support among the American people.\n  Unfortunately, the budget now before the Senate rejects this \nproposal. Frankly, I believe it is one of the major shortcomings of the \nresolution. Senator Murray offered this amendment in the Budget \nCommittee's markup, but it was defeated on a straight party line. I \nhope today's vote will be different. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment and, once again, commend the distinguished Senator from \nWashington for her leadership on this issue. Since coming to the \nSenate, she has been an outspoken advocate for education, for our \nchildren in all aspects. I know she speaks not just for America's \nparents, grandparents, but families all across our country in urging \nthis Nation to make education our top priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY Mr. President, the Republican budget is anti-education It \nsets up too many roadblocks to a brighter future for the nation's \nchildren We should be doing more, not less, to improve the nation's \npublic schools.\n  The budget should reflect our true national priorities The American \npeople give top priority to education, and Congress should too But, the \nRepublican education budget goes against what the American people want \nby cutting education funding.\n  Republicans say that they are pro-education But, there is a massive \ndisparity between their rhetoric and the reality of their budget Our \nRepublican colleagues say that they support education and children But \ntheir current tax proposal and their current budget proposal make it \nvery clear that they are no friends of public education\n  If Republicans were friends of public schools, they would not divert \n$1.6 billion of scarce resources to private schools.\n  They would not cut education by $400 million next year, and prohibit \nfunding for any new programs.\n  They would not ignore the pressing need to repair our crumbling \nschools--to train more teachers, to reduce class sizes, to provide more \nafter-school programs to keep children off the streets, away from drugs \nand guns, and out of trouble.\n  They would not propose tax breaks that benefit wealthy families who \nsend their children to private schools.\n  There are many good ideas to improve education that deserve support \nWe need to increase our investment in public schools We need to raise \nacademic standards We need to modernize school buildings We need to \nreduce class size We need to support more teachers and better training \nfor current teachers We need to expand after-school programs.\n  Students deserve modern schools with world-class teachers But too \nmany students in too many schools in too many communities across the \ncountry fail to achieve that standard The latest international survey \nof math and science achievement confirms the urgent need to raise \nstandards of performance for schools, teachers, and students alike It \nis shameful that America's twelfth graders ranked among the lowest of \nthe 22 nations participating in this international survey of math and \nscience.\n  Schools across the nation face serious problems of overcrowding \nAntiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay, and are not \nequipped to handle the needs of modern education.\n  Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the nation's \nschools are learning in substandard buildings Half the schools have at \nleast one unsatisfactory environmental condition It will take over $100 \nbillion to repair existing facilities nationwide.\n  America's children are learning in overcrowded classrooms This year, \nK-12 enrollment reached an all-time high, and it will continue to grow \nover the next 7 years Communities will need to build 6,000 new public \nschools to maintain current class size Due to overcrowding, schools are \nusing trailers for classrooms and teaching students in hallways, \nclosets, and bathrooms Overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and \ndecrease student morale.\n  In Springfield, Massachusetts, student enrollment has increased by \nover 1,500 students, or 6 percent, in the last two years, forcing \nteachers to hold classes in storage rooms, large closets and basements.\n  In addition, too many schools are already understaffed During the \nnext decade, rising student enrollments and massive teacher retirements \nmean that the nation will need to hire 2 million new teachers Between \n1995 and 1997, student enrollment in Massachusetts rose by 28,000 \nstudents, causing a shortage of 1,600 teachers--without including \nteacher retirements.\n  The teacher shortage has forced many school districts to hire \nuncertified teachers, and ask certified teachers to teach outside their \narea of expertise Each year, more than 50,000 under-prepared teachers \nenter the classroom One in four new teachers does not fully meet state \ncertification requirements Twelve percent of new teachers have had no \nteacher training at all Students in inner-city schools have only a 50% \nchance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher In \nMassachusetts, 30% of teachers in high-poverty schools do not even have \na minor degree in their field.\n  Incredibly, the Republican budget ignores these pressing needs The \nRepublican plan cuts funding for education It refuses to provide key \nnew investments to improve public education If their anti-education \nplan is passed, schools and students will get even less help next year \nthan they are getting this year, just when they need help the most.\n  The Republican budget cuts discretionary funding by $1.6 billion \nbelow the President's budget It cuts funding for education and Head \nStart by $1 billion below the level needed to maintain current services \nIn fact, it cuts education and Head Start funding by $400 million below \nlast year And to make matters worse, the Republican budget prohibits \nfunding for new education programs.\n  It denies 3.7 million students the opportunity to benefit from \nsmaller class sizes.\n  It denies 900,000 disadvantaged students the extra help they need to \nimprove their reading and math skills.\n  It denies 400,000 students the opportunity to attend after-school \nprograms.\n  It denies 6,500 middle schools serving 5 million students extra help \nto ensure that they are safe and drug free.\n  It denies 1 million students in failing schools the opportunity to \nbenefit from innovative reforms.\n  It denies 3.9 million needy college students an increase in their \nPell grants.\n  The Republican anti-education budget does nothing to help recruit and \ntrain qualified teachers.\n  It does nothing to improve failing schools by creating Education \nOpportunity Zones.\n  It does nothing to help disadvantaged students attend college and \ngraduate from college.\n  It does nothing to increase funding for Title I to improve students' \nmath and reading skills.\n  It does nothing to increase funding for Pell grants.\n  The challenge in education is clear. We must do all we can to improve \nteaching and learning for all students across the nation.\n  That's why I strongly support the amendment by Senator Murray to \nreduce class size in grades K-3 across the country. A necessary \nfoundation for success in school is a qualified teacher in every \nclassroom, to make sure that young children receive the individual \nattention they need. That's why it is so important that we help bring \n100,000 new qualified teachers into the public schools and reduce class \nsize in the elementary grades.\n  Research has shown that students attending small classes in the early \ngrades make more rapid progress than students in larger classes. The \nbenefits are greatest for low-achieving, minority, and low-income \nchildren. Smaller classes also enable teachers to identify and work \neffectively with students who have learning disabilities, and reduce \nthe need for special education in later grades.\n  A national study of 10,000 fourth graders in 203 school districts \nacross the country and 10,000 eighth graders in 182 school districts \nacross the country found that students in small classes performed \nbetter than students in large classes for both grade levels.\n  Gains were larger for fourth graders than eighth graders. Gains were \nlargest\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\nof all for inner-city students in small classes--they were likely to \nadvance 75 percent more quickly than students in large classes.\n  Another significant analysis called Project STAR studied 7,000 \nstudents in grades K to 3 in 80 schools in Tennessee. Again, students \nin small classes performed better than students in large classes in \neach grade from kindergarten through third grade. And the gains were \nlarger for minority students.\n  We also know that overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and \ndecrease student morale.\n  Many states and communities are considering proposals to reduce class \nsize. But you can't reduce class size without the ability to hire \nadditional qualified teachers to fill the additional classrooms. The \nfederal government should lend a helping hand.\n  This year, California Governor Wilson proposed to spend $1.5 billion \nto reduce fourth-grade classes to 20 students or less, after having \nreduced class sizes for students in grades K-3 last year.\n  In Pennsylvania, a recent report by the bipartisan legislative \ncommission on urban school restructuring recommended capping class \nsizes in kindergarten through grade 3 in urban districts at 20 students \nper teacher.\n  In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program \nis helping to reduce class size in grades K-3 in low-income \ncommunities.\n  In Flint, Michigan, efforts over the last three years to reduce class \nsize in grades K-3 have led to a 44% increase in reading scores and an \n18% increase in math scores.\n  Congress can do more to encourage all of these state and local \nefforts across the country. We can help lead the way in reducing class \nsize. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Murray's amendment and to \nincrease our investment in education. The nation's children deserve our \nsupport.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Senator \nMurray's amendment today to create a reserve fund for adding 100,000 \npublic school teachers and to reduce class sizes in the early grades to \n18 students per classroom.\n\n\n                  california's schools are overwhelmed\n\n  I come from the State that has some of the largest class sizes in the \nNation in our public schools. In 1994, California's schools averaged \nabout 30 students per class, the highest in the country. In 1995-1996, \nwhen the average pupil teacher ratio for all grades, elementary and \nsecondary in the Nation was 17.3 students per teacher, in California, \nit was 24.0.\n  In the 1993-1994 school year, in elementary schools, California had \n29.4 students per class while the U.S. average was 24.1. For secondary \nschools in 1993-1994, the average California classroom had 29.7 \nstudents while the average U.S. classroom had 23.6 students, according \nto the National Center for Educational Statistics.\n  When one computes total teaching staff per pupil, again, California's \nnumber are substantially higher than national rates, says NCES. In \n1995-1996, California's pupil-teacher ratio was 24.0, compared to the \nU.S. average of 17.3 pupils per teacher. The 1997 estimate likewise has \nCalifornia exceeding national rates: California, 22.7 students per \nteacher; U.S. 17.0 students per teacher.\n  Today, many classes have 40 or more students per teacher. Our \nstudents and teachers are crammed into every available closet, \ncafeteria and temporary building available. At John Muir Elementary \nSchool in San Bruno, one class spent much of the year on the stage of \nthe school's multipurpose room as it waited for portable rooms to \narrive. Los Angeles Unified School District has 560,000 seats for \n681,000 students.\n  To add to the problem, California will have a school enrollment rate \nbetween 1997 and 2007 of 15.7 percent, triple the national rate of 4.1 \npercent. We will have the largest enrollment increase of all states \nduring the next ten years. By 2007, our enrollment will have increased \nby 35.3 percent. To put it another way, California needs to build seven \nnew classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the \nsurge in student enrollment.\n  The California Department of Education says that we need to add about \n327 schools over the next three years, just to keep pace with the \nprojected growth. But these phenomenal construction rates will only \nmaintain current use. They do not begin to relieve overcrowding, our \ncurrent large class sizes.\n  Fortunately, California has embarked on an effort to reduce class \nsize, providing state funds to local school districts to hire more \nteachers for grades K through 3. The goal is to cut class sizes from \n28.6 students to no more than 20 students in grades K through 3. \nCalifornia is spending $2.5 billion over two years to cut class size \nand the annual cost of this reform will be about $1.5 billion. \nCalifornia has created at least 17,000 new classes and over half of the \nState's 1.9 million eligible students are now in classes of 20 or fewer \nstudents. A similar federal effort, like President Clinton's initiative \nand Senator Murray's amendment, can complement California's effort.\n\n\n                    smaller classes improve learning\n\n  Studies show that student achievement improves when class sizes are \nreduced.\n  California's education reforms relied on a Tennessee study called \nProject STAR, in which 6,500 kindergartners were put in 330 classes of \ndifferent sizes. The students stayed in small classes for four years \nand then returned to larger ones in the fourth grade. The test scores \nand behavior of students in the small classes were better than those of \nchildren in the larger classes. A similar 1997 study by Rand found that \nsmaller classes benefit students from low-income families the most.\n\n  Sandy Sutton, a teacher in Los Angeles's Hancock Park Elementary \nSchool, used to have 32 students in her second grade class. In the fall \nof 1997, she had 20. She says she can spend more time on individualized \nreading instruction with each student. She can now more readily draw \nout shy children and more easily identify slow readers early in the \nschool year.\n  The November 25, 1997, Sacramento Bee reported that when teachers in \nthe San Juan Unified School Districts started spending more time with \nstudents, test scores rose and discipline problems and suspensions \ndropped. A San Juan teacher, Ralphene Lee, said, ``This is the most \nwonderful thing that has happened in education in my lifetime.''\n  Other teachers say that students in smaller classes pay better \nattention, ask more questions and have fewer discipline problems.\n  A San Diego initiative to bring down class sizes found that smaller \nclasses mean better classroom management; more individual instruction; \nmore contact with parents; more time for team teaching; more diverse \ninstructional methods; and a higher morale.\n  Smaller classes make a difference.\n\n\n                 smaller classes require good teachers\n\n  Class sizes cannot be reduced without hiring more teachers. And these \nteachers must be trained and credentialed teachers.\n  California has 21,000 teachers on emergency credentials. \nUnfortunately, in California nearly 22,000 of the 240,000 public school \nteachers in California are not fully credentialed or have not passed a \nbasic skills test. Half of California's math and science teachers did \nnot minor in those subjects in college, yet they are teaching. The \nOctober 13, 1997, U.S. New and World Report reported that in Los \nAngeles, ``new teachers have included Nordstrom clerks, a former clown, \nand several chiropractors.''\n  California will need up to 300,000 new teachers in the next decade \nbecause of our escalating enrollment. A 1996 analysis by Policy \nAnalysis for California Education found that my state could only expect \nabout 9,000 new credentialed teachers per year in current trends \ncontinue.\n  Without good teachers, no plan, however visionary or revolutionary, \ncan improve student learning. But sadly, a November 1997 report card by \nthe National Commission on Teaching and America's Future ranked \nCalifornia near the bottom of states in the quality of our public \nschool teaching force because we have some of the highest proportions \nof uncertified or undertrained teachers, particularly in math and \nscience. The Commission defined ``well-qualified'' as a teacher with \nfull certification and a major in their assigned field. By this \nmeasure, only 65 percent of the state's teachers meet the standard. \nNationally, that figure is\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\n72 percent. In California, 46 percent of high school math teaches did \nnot minor in math. The national average is 28 percent.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  There is hardly a more worthy endeavor than strengthening our \nschools' ability to better educate our children. The Murray amendment \nbefore us today can make an important contribution in partnership with \nstate and local efforts by providing extra resources to reduce class \nsizes and hire more teachers.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield such time as she may consume to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Just to put in context what this debate is and is \nnot about in regard to Senator Murray's amendment, and there will, of \ncourse, be other amendments on education seeking to bring this issue to \nthe attention of the American people, and hopefully to give us an \nopportunity to actually legislate.\n  The issue here starts from the fact that as we went into the budget \nnegotiations, the Republican majority cut $1.6 billion from the \nPresident's request for elementary and secondary education. \nUnfortunately, this has become not only a partisan debate among and \nbetween the parties here in the Senate but it really is a debate that, \nin my opinion, is kind of like trying to find out who to blame for the \nfact that elementary and secondary education is not receiving the kind \nof support nationally it ought to receive.\n  My mother used to have an expression, ``When you point a finger at \nsomebody, you have three pointing back at yourself.'' I think nothing \ndescribes this debate around education as much as that expression. The \nfact is that there is an awful lot of finger-pointing going on in \nregard to education--whose responsibility it is, whose fault it is, who \nshould do what, instead of a sense that the real answer here lies in \nour ability as a nation to come together, to work together, to \ncooperate, to collaborate, to form partnerships to address an issue \nthat is in our national interests.\n  There is no question that education is a core value for our country. \nIt correlates with opportunity, opportunity not just for individuals \nbut for America as a whole. That notion of opportunity, I think, goes \nto the heart of what it is about to be an American. Frankly, the rungs \nof opportunity are crafted in the classroom. Public education has made \nthis the greatest country in the world, and if we don't engage in this \ntogether to work out the challenges to public education, we will see \nthat American dream erode in our lifetime. I do not think that is \nsomething any American parent wants to see. I think that every parent, \nevery citizen, wants to see us engage, regarding this issue, in ways \nthat serve the public interests and in ways that do justice and honor \nto our generation's stewardship of this great country. That is the core \nissue, I think, in all of this debate and in what it is we are debating \nwith regard to Senator Murray's amendment, as well as others.\n  First, I will for a moment sketch out in terms of the dollar value of \nan education, first to individuals. There is no question; studies have \nshown us that high school graduates earn 46 percent more every year \nthan those who do not graduate, that college graduates earn 155 percent \nmore every year than those who do not complete high school, and over \nthe course of a lifetime the most educated Americans will earn five \ntimes as much as the least educated Americans. So education correlates \ndirectly to an individual's well-being. In fact, it correlates to \nalmost every indicia of economic and social well-being. Educational \nattainment can be tied directly to income, to health, to the likelihood \nof being on welfare, to the likelihood of being incarcerated, and even \nto the likelihood of an individual voting and participating in our \ndemocracy.\n\n  Education, however, is more than a tool just to lift people out of \npoverty or to give them a better standard of living. It is the engine \nthat will drive America's economy into the 21st century. In a Wall \nStreet Journal survey last year of leading U.S. economists, 43 percent \nof them said that the single most important thing we can do to increase \nour long-term economic growth would be to invest more in education, \nresearch, and development. Nothing else came close to the indicia of \nwhat will help our economy do well. One economist said, ``One of the \nfew things that economists will agree upon is the fact that economic \ngrowth is very strongly dependent on our own abilities.''\n  In a recent study by the Manufacturing Institute, the conclusion was \nreached that increasing the education level of workers by 1 year raises \nthe productivity level in manufacturing by 8.5 percent. So making \ncertain that we invest in education is something that we ought to do \nnot just for the children who will be benefited but for our country and \nfor the economy as a whole.\n  There are those who say that is fine, that is all well and good, but \nin any event it is not our job to do. In fact, this $1.6 billion cut, \nas Senator Murray pointed out, means we will spend in this budget, this \n1998 budget, a full 2 percent on education; 2 percent is the Federal \ncontribution out of this budget to education. That is so because a \nnumber of people argue that it is not the Federal Government's job to \nbe involved with financially supporting elementary and secondary \neducation. They point the finger and say it is somebody else's job.\n  Let's take a look at who else's job it might be. Some of our \ncolleagues say the economy is doing so well, the States should do it, \nthat the States are now in a position to supplement what they spend on \neducation because they have surpluses accumulating in their economy. \nWell, the truth is that even if the States were to stretch out, to use \nall of their surplus, that would not be enough money to provide the \nsupport to rebuild crumbling schools, to reduce class size, to give \nteachers the tools they need, to give children what they need to \nactually be able to get the kind of world-class economy that I believe \nwe have to provide for every American child.\n  All but two of the States had at least some surplus at the end of \nfiscal year 1997, ranging from a $3.2 billion surplus in Alaska to a \n$32 million surplus in Alabama. My own State of Illinois ended 1997 \nwith an $806 million surplus. Of course, the sum total of all the \nStates' surpluses at the end of fiscal year 1997 was $28.2 billion.\n  In addition--and this is not on the class size debate but efforts \nwith regard to rebuilding the schools--the General Accounting Office \ntells us that just to bring the schools in this country up to code we \nhave to spend $112 billion. Well, you don't have to have a whole lot of \neducation to do the math on that one. If all the surpluses taken \ntogether are $28.2 billion, that doesn't begin to even address the \nissue of funding $112 billion worth of need just to get the facilities \nup to code. So if you are talking again about reducing class size, as \nwell as fixing crumbling schools and the other things that the schools \nwill need, the $28 billion surpluses of the States will not do it.\n\n  Assuming that every State were to maintain its past effort, and in \naddition spend every penny of its surplus on schools, they would still \nbe left with a huge amount of needs, $153 billion worth of needs in \nterms of school construction, and again the costs of reducing class \nsize.\n  Then there are those who say, OK, it is not just the State's job. In \nany event, it is not just the State's job to do this. It is really a \nmatter of each community weighing in and fixing up their schools. That \ntranslates into an argument that the full costs of education or the \nbulk of the cost of education ought to come out of the property taxes.\n  I don't know if you noticed, but the property tax is a singularly \ninelastic tax--without doubt, the worst place to try to fund a school \nsystem. And what we have seen over time is that the property tax has \nbeen inadequate to fund education. In fact, it has given rise to what \nJonathan Kozol referred to as ``Savage Inequalities.'' That is to say, \nin the communities where the demographics support an easily tapped \nproperty tax, where there are nuclear power plants or shopping centers, \nthose communities can afford to support their schools with relatively \nlittle effort from individual taxpayers, whereas other school districts \nwhere there are a number of retirees or poor people have a harder time \nsupporting their schools. So relying on the property tax alone, or \nlargely relying on the property taxes, is one of the reasons why we\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\nhave such a patchwork in terms of the quality of schools in this \ncountry. There is no coherence. There is no systematic support for \neducation from the local property tax. So we have a situation where the \nlocal property tax is stretched beyond what it can bear in terms of \nproviding for education. The States are doing an inadequate job in \nsupport of education, and this budget gives us all of a 2 percent \nFederal contribution to that challenge. Small wonder, Mr. President, \nthat the United States is beginning to lose ground worldwide in \neducation.\n  Just a couple weeks ago we had a report on the performance of \nstudents in this country on math and science exams. It should have been \na wake-up call to everybody when we found that the U.S. students, in \nsome categories--in physics--came in dead last, dead last. We came in \nbelow Slovenia on mathematics. We are doing poorly on all of these \nindicia of international measurements of competency in the schools.\n  Given this patchwork quilt, given the results of the finger-pointing, \nsmall wonder that our kids are not doing as well as they should or that \nthey could. Let me make a point about that. I think the point has to be \nmade that our children, American kids, are just as capable as kids \nanywhere in the world of learning, if they are given an opportunity.\n  They are as capable of doing as much as any other community on this \nplanet, if given the opportunity. The direction that we take, the \ndecisions we make in this Senate will in large part determine what \ndirection we take to get there, to get to the point of giving them an \nopportunity. Will we support a partnership in which we come together at \nthe Federal, the State, and the local level? Or will we take the \nposition that everybody have at it and do the best job you can, \nwherever you are, and make educational opportunity an accident of \ngeography and an accident of someone's situation in life, whether their \nparents were born wealthy. I don't believe we can afford to waste a \nsingle mind, to waste a single child's talent. We have a responsibility \nas Americans to come together as parents and stop this finger pointing, \nstop this blame game and put this argument aside and recognize that it \nis in our national security interest that we give every child the \nability to be educated to the maximum extent of his or her ability.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray for her activity on the \nBudget Committee in this regard, for her advocacy for children. She has \nbeen an advocate across the board on a variety of issues. I submit that \nthere is no issue on which advocacy can be more important than the \ndirection we take in education in this country.\n  I believe the bottom-line question here is whether or not we are \nprepared to face the fact that we cannot go it alone, we cannot point \nfingers, and we cannot allow for a child's educational opportunities to \ndepend on the accident of where they were born. We have a \nresponsibility to come together as Americans to make certain that all \nlevels of government contribute to the maximum extent we can so that \nlocal governments, parents, communities, people at the local level can \nprovide the children who live there with the best possible opportunity.\n  We can do better than 2 percent. I submit that we ought to restore \nthe $1.6 billion the President proposed, restore that to the budget and \nhave a debate on how we send that out to the States. We ought to be \nable to send it to the States and the school districts without a whole \nlot of strings or bureaucracy. Nobody is hiring $1.6 billion worth of \nnew bureaucrats. We are talking about sending money directly to benefit \nthe schools. I believe we have not only an opportunity to do that, but \nan obligation to do it. The opportunity is with us because we have a \nbalanced budget. After decades of wallowing in red ink, we have a \nbudget surplus--or at least we are on a glidepath from deficit \nterritory. It seems to me, if we are going to look at the priorities of \nthis country, no priority comes higher than providing for education, no \npriority comes higher than providing States and local communities with \nthe support they need to give our children a chance.\n  Therefore, I commend Senator Murray.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nputting in perspective what we are talking about today. The students in \nmy classroom weren't Republican, Democrat, or Independent. They didn't \nsay, oh, this is a local issue; oh, this is a State issue, those \nFederal people should not be involved. They looked around in their \nclassroom and said: How many kids are in here with me? Do I get time \nwith my teacher; do I get personal attention?\n  As my colleague from Illinois notes, there is no silver bullet to \nmaking education better across this country. But we have to put our \nefforts in places where we know they make a difference. My colleague \nfrom Illinois has addressed tirelessly the issue of crumbling schools \nacross the country. And the issue of safety and the ability to learn, \nand the issue of class size, again, where school buildings simply can't \nexpand, where our children are in unsafe situations. If together we \naddress the crumbling schools, and class size, and if we train our \nteachers with the skills they need to teach effectively in our \nclassrooms today and tomorrow, we will turn public education around.\n  I know my colleague from Illinois has heard as much as I have from \nall those politicians and leaders who are saying public education has \nfailed. I don't believe public education has failed. I believe we have \nfailed public education. We have a responsibility to turn it around \nright now, today, in the Senate. I thank my colleague from Illinois. I \nyield to her.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I wanted to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Washington. Every politician who runs for office \nruns on an education platform. I don't know a Governor in this country \nwho hasn't run on an education platform. I don't know a Senator in this \ncountry who hasn't run on an education platform. Somewhere out there, \nthere is probably a coroner and a dogcatcher who will run on an \neducation platform. And yet education doesn't have the financial \nsupport at any level that it needs to have. That should be evident in \nhow we are coming in on these international tests and exams. The \nresponse that I see from all too many of my colleagues is to say, as \nthe Senator so eloquently put it, public education has failed, let's \nrun away from it. The old runaway response is not a response, because \nwe can't afford to triage, to waste a single child.\n  Again, I commend my colleague for requiring some of us to put our \nmoney where our mouths are, that we really support education and begin \nto vote for education and fund education and to put real meat on the \nbone of our commitment to public education.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague. I absolutely agree. I believe we \nare at a fundamental crossroads in this country, where we are going to \ndecide now, today, whether we are going to go down a narrow path of \njust letting a few kids succeed in education across this country, with \nvouchers, block grants, and eliminating the Federal role altogether; or \nwe can collectively say, no, not in my country, not in my home, not in \nmy community, not in my State.\n  In this country, where we believe that public education is critical \nfor every student, we want to go down the road that makes a difference. \nBy making sure our crumbling schools are fixed, making sure that there \nare teachers who are well-trained, and making sure there is a number of \nstudents in a classroom that allows them to learn those math skills and \nEnglish skills they so desperately need in today's and tomorrow's \neconomy. I look forward to working with my colleague to make sure we go \ndown the right road and not the wrong road. We will find out today what \nthe Senate says.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague for yielding me this time. Senator \nMoseley-Braun had to leave the floor, but her leadership on the \ncrumbling schools initiative has just been incredible. She is the one \nwho called our attention to the fact that if our kids are going to \nlearn, they have to have decent schoolbuildings. I was saying the other \nday we want our kids to learn about gravity by reading about it in\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\nthe science book, not by having the ceiling falling on them while \nsitting in the classroom.\n  I say to my colleague, Senator Patty Murray, how much I have enjoyed \nserving with her in the Senate and, beyond that, serving with her on \nthe Budget Committee, because the two of us believe very strongly, as \ndo a number of Democratic colleagues. If everybody is saying children \nare our priority, education is a priority, and everyone is saying this \nis so important, then it's time they voted with us and did something \nabout it.\n  When my colleague offered her amendment on children in the committee, \nsuddenly our Republican colleagues were not there. I am hoping they are \nhaving second thoughts and that when we get to the vote on her \namendment, they will come here and support it. We need bipartisanship \non this issue.\n  Now, I think it's interesting, as we look back on the Federal role in \neducation, to recognize the President who, in my opinion, did more for \nthe Federal role in education than anyone else, in terms of winning \npublic approval for it, and that was President Dwight D. Eisenhower. \nSenator Murray is a little younger than I am, and I think about that \nnow and then, but I well remember when the Russians launched the \nSputnik and the Americans sat back and said: How could this be? We were \nthe ones who had the educated work force. We were the ones who had the \nnew technology. How could it be that they could get ahead of us in this \nway? Dwight Eisenhower came forward, a Republican President with broad \nbipartisan support, and said the following: ``The education of our \nchildren is just as important to our national security as the size of \nour military budget.'' He pushed for the National Defense Education \nAct.\n\n  I say to my colleague, we are following in those footsteps with a \nseries of amendments we will be offering--Senator Murray on class size, \nSenator Moseley-Braun on crumbling schools, myself on after school, and \nSenator Dodd on child care. We are following in the footsteps of a \nRepublican President, who recognized in the 1950s that we have to do \nsomething about education.\n  Now, in terms of my colleague's amendment, I am very proud to support \nit. I want to say a thank you not only to her, which I have done, but \nto our President, because our President shared with us his vision of \n100,000 new teachers in schools, and everybody sat back and said that \nis a goal we ought to attain. At least the vast majority of the \nAmerican people--and we will find out if it is a majority of this \nbody--said yes. This is the same President who had the goal of putting \n100,000 police on the street. If you put 100,000 police on the street, \nwhich I have strongly supported--what happened in California is that we \nhave a 20 percent reduction in crime because we have community police. \nIf you listen to those community police, let me tell you what they will \nsay. I have had many townhall meetings throughout my State. They say to \nme: ``Senator, we have to prevent a lot of these problems before they \nstart.'' Yes, we can help. But the fact is, once a child gets into the \njuvenile justice system, sometimes we can't turn them around. So we do \nneed to give our children something to say yes to. And law enforcement \nlooks at these measures--in my State at least--with great support.\n  I have an after-school bill that I will be offering. We know that, in \nCalifornia, when we give the kids something to say yes to in after-\nschool programs--we give mentoring, tutoring, help with homework, and \nwe bring in business and they learn on computers--their performance has \ngone up 75 percent in Sacramento's START program and in L.A.'s BEST. \nThere has been a 75 percent increase in performance. Now, we can't \nexpect that for every child, but this is the experience that we are \nhaving.\n  I submit to my colleague that when you put a child in a smaller class \nwhere that child doesn't get lost in the shuffle, where that child gets \nthe individual attention from the teachers, from the teacher's aide, it \nmakes an enormous difference. I sometimes think a lot of our kids' \nproblems are overlooked because the teachers cannot possibly, if they \nhave a class of 40 children, pick up every nuance and problem a child \nis having in learning or in their social behavior. That issue has come \nto the floor lately.\n  I say to my friend in closing that, in California, in a bipartisan \nway, the Governor, the superintendent of public instruction, from \ndifferent parties, all agreed that we should lower class sizes in the \nlower grades. We do not have the official studies because this is a new \nprogram. But the reports that are coming back are extraordinary. The \nstories we are hearing from the children, from the parents, from the \nteachers, from the principal, from our Governor, who is a Republican, \nfrom our superintendent of public instruction, who is a Democrat, all \nof what we are hearing is positive. It's not really rocket science to \nfigure out that, if you can spend more time with each child, you are \ngoing to have a better result.\n  So, again, I say to my colleague how much I enjoy working with her. \nShe has put children first from the moment she came on to the Senate \nfloor. It has been a breath of fresh air for all of us. I really look \nforward to helping her with this amendment. If we do not succeed today, \nif the other side puts up procedural hurdles and tells us you need 60 \nvotes, I hope you will keep bringing this issue back again and again \nand again--for one reason: The parents want it, the children need it, \nand America supports it.\n\n  I thank my colleague and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague for her tremendous leadership on \nthis issue. There is nobody from the other side on the floor here. If \nthey can find the chairman, we would like to find out what their intent \nis on this vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have concurred with the minority \nregarding an agenda from now until some time after 4 o'clock this \nafternoon. And I would like to propose it by way of a consent decree \nwhich I understand is satisfactory to the other side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following be the sequence of \namendments debated between now and 4 p.m. today, and that a vote occur \non or in relation to the Murray amendment at 2:20 p.m., with the time \nprior to 2:20--5 minutes--to be equally divided between Senator Murray \nand Senator Domenici or his designee. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the Gregg amendment No. 2167, and the Dodd amendment No. 2173--\nthat votes occur on or in relation to the remaining above listed \namendments beginning at 4 p.m., with 2 minutes of debate between each \nvote for an explanation, and with no second-degree amendments in order \nprior to the votes at 4 p.m.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I apologize to the Senate for the lack of business in \nthe last few moments. We had some amendments that we had to clarify \nwith sponsors. So let me continue and make sure we are clear on the \nunanimous consent that I have proposed. Let me start over since none of \nit had been granted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be the \nsequence of amendments debated between now and 4 p.m. today, and that a \nvote occur on or in relation to the Murray amendment at 2:20 p.m. with \nthe time prior to 2:20 being equally divided between Senator Murray and \nSenator Domenici or his designee; that regarding the Gregg amendment, \nNo. 2168, and the Dodd amendment, No. 2173, votes occur on or in \nrelation to those amendments beginning at 4 p.m., with 2 minutes of \ndebate between each vote for explanations, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote at 4 p.m.\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Are we scheduled to go in recess \nat 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we will recess for \nthe caucus luncheons at 12:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say we now have a starting list of about 12 \namendments. When we start at 2:15, I will make sure everybody knows \nwhat they are. We are asking that we sequence them in some way so we \nknow where we are going. Frankly, I think either we are going to have \nto be relieved of some time on the resolution or we are going to stay \nin tonight and use some time because we really have to finish this this \nweek.\n  Mr. President, let me use the remaining time that I have, with \nSenator Murray having half of the 5 minutes, to debate her amendment \nprior to the vote.\n  First, let me say I understand the sincerity and the genuine concern \nthat the distinguished Senator who proposes this amendment has \nexpressed here on the floor, and that she genuinely and generally \nexpresses with reference to education. But I think it is very \ninteresting; we all want to educate our children, but it seems that we \nare having a little trouble with math, mathematics, adding and \nsubtracting, right here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I have read and reread the amendment of the distinguished Senator, \nand I cannot find any way that it truly means anything with reference \nto classroom size. A reserve fund is set up and there is nothing in it, \nzero. There are no dollars, there are no taxes, there are no statements \nthat we should cut certain programs. As a matter of fact, this \namendment says at sometime in the future we sure hope Congress will \nfind a way to cut spending someplace, perhaps cut a mandatory program, \nthat is an entitlement, someplace; or perhaps increase taxes sometime. \nThen it says: Put those in this reserve fund, this box, and we will \nspend it for reducing classroom sizes.\n  That is very interesting. If somebody thinks he or she is going to \ntell the American people that Senators who vote against this measure \nvoted against a reduction in classroom size, then just take it from me, \nwe will put an ad right up under that that says, ``The program had no \nmoney in it, no way to pay for it, did not have enough courage to say \nwhat program you would cut or which taxes you would raise. It just \nsaid, I am for--and I want--and I hope--and I wish--and it would be \ngreat if we have--a reserve fund someday, if we use it for classroom \nsize reduction.''\n\n  That is essentially the amendment. It is out of order under the \nBudget Act and under the processes, and we will raise that point. The \nvote will be on whether or not it is out of order, for I assume the \ndistinguished Senator will move to waive it. But I cannot find it.\n  Normally, you set up a reserve fund and you say, We are going to put \ntaxes in this reserve fund or receipts from someplace, or we say, We \nare going to cut certain entitlement programs and use that money for \nsome program, project or activity. What has happened here is the \nfollowing: No one yet on that side of the aisle who wants to spend more \nmoney than required in this budget resolution has found a way to cut \nany program to pay for it--not yet. I have been looking. There are \nalready a series that I have looked at. None cut any program to pay for \na higher priority program.\n  Second, none say, even though we insist on keeping a balanced budget, \nand they do also, these amendments--they don't want to break that \nbalanced budget era we have--nonetheless, the amendments go right back \nto the era when we had programs for which we did not know how to pay. I \ndefy anyone to tell me how we are going to pay for this program if we \never did it.\n  Frankly, that is a statement of where we are. The same is going to be \ntrue for the amendment of my good friend, Senator Dodd, on child care. \nThey found a way to set up a reserve fund with nothing in it and they \nsay, ``When something happens, then we will pay for this wonderful \nprogram for the American people.'' I use that word in its fairest \nsense. Some people think these programs ought to be paid for by the \nFederal Government. I do not.\n  I just want you to look at one chart. Everybody can look at it here. \nThe business of classroom size in the United States is the business of \nthe sovereign States of America, and they know there is a problem. Mr. \nPresident, they are spending more and more money in the school \ndistricts across America to reduce class size than on almost anything \nelse they are doing, and they are doing a wonderful job of it. This \nsimple chart up here says from 1960 to 1996 classroom sizes have been \nreduced 51 percent, from 25.8 to 17.6. That is the green line. That is \nbecause the red line shows how many more teachers have been added. Not \nbecause we are paying for them at the national level, but because our \nStates are paying for them and the school boards are paying for them. \nIn New York, where the cities pay for it, they are paying for it.\n  Now we are going to come along in an amendment and try to tell the \nAmerican people if you don't vote for this, you are against education, \nwhich amendment has no way of paying for the teachers. These States \ncannot do that. You know that green line did not come about because \nsomebody set up a reserve fund and said if we ever find that we raise \ntaxes, we can put the taxes in that reserve fund--``if''--or we can cut \nsome other program and put that in there--``if.'' You know that green \nline would not have come down one bit if that is what States said. That \nis what we are saying here today.\n  The truth of the matter is the teacher ratio is coming down and it is \ncoming down dramatically. Frankly, I am not very impressed with Senator \nafter Senator from whatever side of the aisle coming down here and \nessentially saying, ``Education is not going well in America and we \nknow how to fix it up here in Washington. What we ought to do is have a \nnew program, a new mandate.'' But this one is even worse than that, \nbecause it suggests we ought to do that, and there is no money to do \nit, which is a very interesting phenomenon--if you can help education \nwithout putting any money into a program but saying you wish it would \nhappen.\n\n  The truth of the matter is that the National Center for Educational \nStatistics, commonly known as NCES, projects that trend is going to \ncontinue and, I might say, continue without anybody ever having thought \nthe Federal Government would start paying for reducing classroom size. \nThey estimate, in their publication, that by the year 2006 there will \nbe as many as 3 million K-12 public school teachers, an additional 16 \npercent over the 1996 number. This same organization, highly renowned, \nsays that the pupil-teacher ratios will continue to decline and they \nwill continue to drop as low as 15.4 in the year 2006, an 11 percent \ndecrease from 1996. And, Mr. President and fellow Senators, let me \nrepeat: They did not expect that the Federal Government would get \ninvolved in telling these schools how they can reduce class size.\n  Let me also suggest this is an interesting reserve fund in another \nway, because it proposes to fund a program that is unknown. The \nPresident suggests that there be this program. And, incidentally, for \nthose who wondered how he paid for it--for he paid for it--he paid for \nit out of the cigarette tax, the settlement. But the budget office said \nyou can't do that, because in doing that you break the budget. But he \ndid plan to pay for it. Let me suggest that NCES projects these without \never contemplating that the United States of America would get involved \nin paying for pupil-teacher ratio reductions.\n  Where is the program? The White House has not sent up their program, \nbut let me tell you there is a formula about. For Senators who might \nthink this amendment is determinative of something--I don't believe it \nis determinative of anything, but let's assume you really think it \nmight be--then I suggest you might not like the proposal if it was to \nbe carried out, because, since 20 States have invested additional funds \nin targeted efforts to reduce class size, that means that under the \nformula they are not even given credit for that. They are penalized, \nfor more money goes to States that have not done that. You know if we \nget a bill, if ever--and I don't think it will ever happen that we get \na bill on the floor of the Senate that attempts to get the U.S. \nGovernment into determining class sizes--you know that the formula is \nnot going to work. But there is no bill, no substance. Nobody has\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\nwritten the flesh on the bones that will tell us what kind of program \nthis is.\n  Senator Murray does not know how much or how it is paid for. The \nPresident's plan actually estimates $12 billion over 7 years --$12 \nbillion. If that is the plan, I wonder why the sponsors --and there are \nmore than one--don't look through the budget and find $12 billion to \nspend. I wonder why they don't say maybe we are going to increase taxes \nto pay for it. Is the era of balanced budgets gone? Are we going to \ncome up with a program we don't know how to pay for and try to let \nsomebody think it is a real, vital, operative set of words called a \n``reserve fund'' that will get anything done about classroom size?\n  Frankly, I am very grateful that to this point in our history we have \nnot asked the Federal Government to do this kind of thing. I am very \ngrateful because, as a matter of fact, everything they get into of this \ntype ends up with more bureaucracy, more redtape, more mandates on the \nStates than do most programs that truly produce beneficial results.\n  But I am also thankful we are not in it because the States and school \ndistricts see the problem. They do not come up to the floor of the \nSenate when the problem is getting solved. They start solving it. They \ndidn't start solving this problem when we were already down to about \n16.8, they started solving it when it was 25. So it is obvious to me \nthat there is a reason for this amendment being subject to a point of \norder. That point of order should be sustained.\n  I am not going to second-degree amendments which should fall by a \npoint of order, because I believe that is what we should do to them: \nOne by one, every one that is subject to that, like this one is, we \nought to quickly not waive the budget process and not waive the rules \nof the Senate and say the program just doesn't fit. Having said that, I \nwill have 2\\1/2\\ minutes later. Let me conclude.\n  Mr. President, I do want to say to the distinguished Senator, Senator \nMurray, I, too, was a schoolteacher--not with the great prowess and \nexperience that she had, but I taught one of those subjects we are all \nworried about, mathematics. I taught that. I didn't take political \nscience; I took chemistry and math. I don't know how that prepared me \nto be a Senator, but I did teach algebra and arithmetic. Frankly, it is \nhard work. Frankly, believe it or not, I believe I taught every single \nchild in my class who knew how to add and subtract--I believe I taught \nthem algebra.\n  Frankly--God forbid--I have to tell you, I had 44 students in each \nclass. I am not suggesting we do that. I am delighted to see this green \nline. In fact, for some of our children--and our States are on to this, \ntoo--with great disabilities, we are going to have to do better than \nthis. And they are, they are. They are doing better than this.\n  Let me just close by suggesting that if this program which is \nencapsulated in these reserve language words is as important as my good \nfriend contends, then it would seem to me we ought to find some other \nprogram in the U.S. Government's litany of programs--which is still \naround 2,600 and growing--we ought to find some programs we could \nterminate or cut to pay for it. As a matter of fact, the entitlement \nprograms of America, while somewhat under control, are a burgeoning \npart of the American budget. Essentially, if you want a real reserve \nfund, you ought to be able to find something in this enormous number of \nbillions of dollars of entitlement programs that is a little less \nimportant than the program the distinguished Senator says is so \nimportant.\n  Frankly, I do not in any way contend that we know that classroom size \nis the answer to every issue. I don't want to get into a debate on \nthat. We will just accept the Senator's language and words about how \nimportant it is. But there is a growing dispute, nonetheless, between \ncompetent schools of academics and education, as to whether the current \nproblem in the American schools is as much related to classroom size as \none of the other groups says. There is one group of experts who say it \nis not as important as some other things.\n  The reason I say that is because that is exactly the kind of thing we \nshould not be resolving up here. It is right at the State legislatures, \nit is right in the offices of superintendents and boards of education, \nand it is not right in Washington with another Washington-based \nprogram.\n  I see that the time for recessing has arrived. I will be asking \nSenators to concur with me that this amendment should fall because it \nis subject to a point of order under our rules, and in this case the \nrules make great sense, for to vote on a program like this as if it did \nsomething, as if there was real money in it, as if there was a way to \nfind real money--our processes are pretty good when they say that kind \nof amendment, for whatever reason, is subject to a point of order in \nthe Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes off the budget time \non the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Time is up. I understand there is an order to go into \nrecess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous agreement, there are 5 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the amendment that is pending.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that we will vote on shortly simply puts \nin place a deficit-neutral reserve fund for class-size improvement, \nespecially in the early grades. And, it would use as an offset anything \nwe designate over the coming year in available mandatory savings or \nrevenues, except for tobacco revenues.\n  I know that the chairman is going to say that this reserve fund has \nno money and it has not set up any specific policy on class size \nreduction. He is absolutely right. It is exactly what he has done in \nhis budget with the tobacco reserve fund and with the tax cut fund. I \nhave learned from him that if we want priorities within our budget, \nthis is the way we go about it.\n  Education is a priority. As I pointed out this morning, 2 percent of \nour budget goes to education. At a time when parents and families and \ncommunities and States are struggling with this issue. Parents say to \nus that they want their children's class sizes reduced. I have talked \nto parents, I have talked to students, teachers, principals. Down the \nroad, they say, this is going to make an important difference in our \nchildren's education.\n  I think the most important thing to remember is what every parent \nsays to their child when they come home on the first day of school. \nThey ask two questions: Who is your teacher? and how many students are \nin your classroom? because they know that the best qualified teacher, \nthe best trained teacher will make a difference for their child, and \nthey know that the number of students who are in that classroom will \nmake a difference in their child's ability to learn and be productive \nand get the skills they need to grow up and get a job and be a positive \nmember of our economy and society in the future.\n  Budgets are not just about today. Yes, we have a balanced budget \nbefore\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\nus today. But, more importantly, we have to ask ``will it be balanced \nin the future?'' The only way for our budget to be balanced in the \nfuture is for us to make sure that our students, who are in school \ntoday, have adequate resources available. To make sure they get the \nskills they need to contribute to the economy, so that we have a strong \nbudget in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Dodd and \nSenator Kennedy as original cosponsors of this amendment, as well as \nSenator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we will vote on this shortly. I believe \nit is one of the most important issues that is before us, and I urge \nits adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that material regarding class \nsize reduction be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Why is Class Size Reduction so Important?\n\n\n                           what students say\n\n  Christopher Shim, 17 years old, Mercer Island High School: ``In \nelementary school, I actually feel I was pretty lucky. I was able to \nget personal time with the teacher, even though we had 30-35 students \nin my elementary classrooms.''\n  Chris continues: ``In high school, I have 40 people in my calculus \nclass. This means anytime I have a question, there are 10 people in \nline.''\n  Ahmad Javid (A.J.) Aaf, 15 years old, Tahoma High School, Maple \nValley, Washington: ``Kids need more attention--personal attention for \nstudents is important.''\n  Antonella Novi, 18 years old. Anacortes High School, Anacortes, \nWashington: ``In elementary school or high school, class size is really \nimportant. Because interpersonal relationships among students are \nimportant, and being able to talk to the teacher is important. \nCloseness leads to comfort--if you ask teachers about school, then you \ncan ask teachers about things outside the classroom. It's easier to go \nto teachers you know.''\n  Antonella continues: ``In high school civics class, there is only one \nteacher, teaching two classes of 40 students each. It's harder to get \nthrough the curriculum, and to get answers to your questions.\n  ``When I was younger, I went to school in California. We were in one \nschool building when I started, but by the time I left, the building \nwas surrounded by portables.\n  ``I always got my questions answered by the teachers. I spoke up; I \nasked questions. But there were lots of kids who were quiet, who didn't \nget the attention they needed from teacher.\n  ``In smaller classes its easier to relate to your peers. You get to \nknow each other better. In large classes, if you don't like talking in \nfront of large groups, you're out of luck.''\n  Devone Van Dyne (female), 16 years old, University High School, \nSpokane, Washington: ``Class size is really, important. For example, my \nhigh school chemistry class has almost 40 students. It's hard to get \nindividual help; lectures alone don't work. If there were fewer \nstudents, we could get the kind of help we need.\n  ``I have trouble keeping up--it's easier to fall behind in a large \nclass. You don't feel the same investment. I have to make sure and find \nthe time outside class to meet with the teacher.''\n  Amber Casali, 16 years old, and Rebecca Dean 15 years old, Shorecrest \nHigh School, Seattle, Washington: ``In elementary school, the benefits \nof having smaller class size include getting more attention from \nteachers. You can do more activities, and fewer lectures. You can plan, \nand work more cohesively as a class. Especially for the early grades 1-\n3, smaller class sizes are very important. It's so important to start \nearly. Students can develop good working skills, and get more attention \nfrom the teacher early on, when it counts the most.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nStatement by Sandra Feldman, President, American Federation of Teachers \n                        On Reducing Class Sizes\n\n       Modern schools and more well-trained teachers are the right \n     antidote for the overcrowding that plagues too many American \n     schools. Research shows that youngsters, especially in the \n     early grades, perform better in smaller classes that allow \n     for greater one-on-one instruction. Smaller classes also help \n     teachers maintain discipline. Parents and teachers understand \n     this well, and that's why Senator Murray is absolutely \n     correct in supporting the President's proposal to provide \n     subsidies for school construction and to emphasize teacher \n     recruitment.\n       Several new studies clearly demonstrate the link between \n     reduced class sizes and improved academic achievement. A \n     sampling:\n       STAR, the highly reputed Tennessee class-size study, \n     analyzed the achievement levels of K-3 students randomly \n     assigned to classes of 13 to 17. Those in small classes did \n     much better than students in regular classes in math and \n     reading, every year and in all grades. The small classes made \n     the biggest difference in the scores of children in inner-\n     city schools.\n       SAGE, a Wisconsin program begun in 1996-97, reduces class \n     size for K-3 children in certain high-poverty schools. At the \n     end of the first year, SAGE kids had made significantly \n     greater improvements in reading, language arts, and math than \n     children had in similar schools.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            The Association of Washington School Principals\n\n       The Association of Washington School Principals (AWSP) is \n     strongly committed to supporting legislation which reduces \n     class size in our public school system. It is increasingly \n     evident that students entering our schools have diverse and \n     unique needs which can only be addressed by principals, \n     teachers, and support personnel who are not overwhelmed by \n     crowded classrooms. Rather, educators must be able to devote \n     attention to each student in smaller, more manageable \n     classes.\n       Recent studies on reduced class size and their impact on \n     student performance, undertaken in Tennessee (STAR study) and \n     Wisconsin (SAGE study), speak to learner benefits in areas \n     such as reading, language arts, and math. In our own state of \n     Washington, reduction of class size and improved student \n     performance are priorities for both legislators and \n     educators.\n       AWSP is convinced that class size reduction is essential if \n     our state's, and nation's, efforts towards school improvement \n     are to be successful. We appreciate and support Senator Patty \n     Murray's commitment to this end.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             Washington State School Directors' Association\n\n       ``As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for \n     all of our students,'' Larry Swift, executive director of the \n     Washington State School Directors' Association, said, ``it \n     becomes increasingly important that all of our resources be \n     used efficiently and effectively. The most valuable resource \n     in today's schools is the people who devote their time and \n     effort to make schools successful--the teachers. Reducing the \n     ratio of students to adults is particularly critical for \n     youngsters with a variety of learning challenges that must be \n     overcome if those students are to meet the new, higher \n     learning standards.\n       ``We acknowledge and commend Senator Murray for leading the \n     way to assuring that our students have the learning \n     environment and the human resources necessary for the kind of \n     schools that will provide the opportunities and training they \n     need to become successful,'' Swift said.\n       The Washington State School Directors' Association is a \n     statewide organization representing all of the 1,482 locally-\n     elected school board members from the state's 296 school \n     districts. WSSDA serves as an advocate for the state's public \n     schools, provides training and technical assistance for \n     school board members and is very active in the legislative \n     process.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with regret that I, once again, \ntell the Senate that this is an empty amendment--empty. It states a \nwish, a hope, and maybe a prayer, and it couches it in language that \nsays we are setting up a reserve.\n  Reserves normally have something in them. This reserve says maybe at \nsome point in time we will have something to put in this reserve. Maybe \nwe will raise taxes and put the raised taxes in this reserve. Maybe we \nwill cut a mandatory program, take away from some entitlement program \nand put it in there. Otherwise, it is an empty amendment. To have an \nempty amendment on a budget resolution ought to violate some rule, and, \nas a matter of fact, it does. This is subject to a point of order.\n  I think from time to time we wonder whether points of order really \ncontribute substantively to an argument. This one does. For anybody who \nthinks this amendment proposes anything real for the classrooms of \nAmerica--if one wanted to have the Federal Government involved in a \nprogram and if one knew what the program was--the truth of the matter \nis that this is empty and, therefore, is subject to a point of order.\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back any time that I have remaining. The \npending amendment is not germane to the provisions of the budget \nresolution pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act. I raise a \npoint of order against the pending amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to waive all points of order \nagainst the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to the Murray amendment No. 2165. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. \nHutchinson), is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nArkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 50 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Hutchinson\n     Mikulski\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, there are 46 yeas and 52 nays. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \ntherefore sustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the pending business, I inquire of \nthe distinguished manager through the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, debate is to \ncontinue until 4 p.m., evenly divided, at which point the Senate will \nvote with respect to the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciated that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, had an \namendment. I see the manager is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment will be voted on also at that \ntime.\n  Mr. DODD. The debate on that is over?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, Senator Gregg, we understand, desires no more \ntime on his amendment, which is his second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Presiding \nOfficer that the debate is concurrent, but apparently the Senator from \nNew Hampshire did not desire additional time.\n  Mr. DODD. Parliamentary inquiry. Will the Senator allow me to make \nthat amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent, if Senator Gregg desires the \ntime, that he be allotted time after the debate on the Dodd amendment. \nI am not sure the Senator will desire that. The regular order would now \nprescribe, if that unanimous consent is granted, the next amendment is \nSenator Dodd's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is my understanding, therefore, if the unanimous \nconsent is agreed to, that Senator Dodd will have as much as an hour on \nhis amendment based on the unanimous consent that was constructed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between now and 4 p.m. will be \nequally divided.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Between the proponents and the opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. But if there is any opposition, then, of course, that \ntime would be available. But let us assume for a moment that there \nmight not be. Would Senator Dodd then have an hour at his disposal?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent request, if it is \nagreed to, he would be able to secure the time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And that is a very big assumption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent request on the \nfloor; is there objection?\n  Without objection, the unanimous consent request is agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment Nos. 2186 through 2188, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could ask for 10 seconds to send three amendments \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Minnesota seeking consent \nthey be called up and then set aside?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I want to put them in proper sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report those \namendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes \n     amendments numbered 2186 through 2188, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

I have some comments to make on my own amendment, but \nseveral of my colleagues have other matters to attend to, and I will \nyield, if I may, whatever time she may consume to the distinguished \ncolleague from California and then to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  I yield first to my colleague from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I want the \nSenator to know what a pleasure it is for me to be able to support the \nSenator's amendment and also to say many, many thanks for his \nleadership on this issue. I am a member of his task force. He has been \nabsolutely indefatigable in the pursuit of quality child care for the \ncitizens of our country. I am very proud to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, if I might begin by asking a quick question through \nthe Chair. I ask the Senator from Connecticut this question: Is he \naware of how many children are on the waiting list for child care \nfacilities in the largest State in the Union?\n  Mr. DODD. I would say to our colleague from California I am aware of \nthis figure. It is 200,000. The reason I know that number is because in \n1996 I asked the General Accounting Office to do an assessment to \ndetermine the extent to which the child care needs of working families \nwere being met, including whether there were waiting lists for child \ncare. California was one of the States that was surveyed. The report \nfound that California presently has some 200,000 families who are \nwaiting for a quality, affordable, accessible child care slot to open \nup so they may leave their child in a safe place.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Boxer and I, I think this one \nstatistic irrefutably points out the need for this amendment. I did not \nsupport the welfare reform bill. The reason I didn't support the \nwelfare reform bill was exactly this. The way the bill is weighted, the \ntargets that need to be met in the State of California increase with \ntime. We estimated that we had to develop in California 600,000 \nadditional child care slots a year just to keep up with the need.\n  What the Senator has just revealed to me indicates that within this \nfirst year we already see a waiting list of 200,000. I expect in the \nnext 2 years this waiting list to increase threefold, up to 600,000 \nfamilies waiting for adequate child care.\n  If we want Americans to leave welfare behind as a way of life, if we \nwant to see Americans entrepreneurial and working, then we must see \nthere is adequate child care available for the children of these \nfamilies. A great bulk of the people involved here are single parents \nwith children. They need to earn a living. They have no choice. They \nmust find child care.\n  This amendment creates in the reserve fund some moneys to be able to \nhelp the State create the slots. Let me say how difficult this is in \nCalifornia, an earthquake-prone State, tough building codes, tough \nindividual county and city codes. Therefore, these facilities are \nexpensive to build. This amendment provides an opportunity to try a \nnumber of different approaches, including employer-based child care, \nchild care that is shared, chambers of commerce working with schools, \nworking with college districts to provide teachers for these child care \nfacilities. All of this can be done. You cannot do it without money. \nTherefore, I think this reserve fund is certainly small to begin with \nbut certainly necessary.\n\n  It is with great pride that I thank the Senator for his leadership \nand that both Senator Boxer and I are delighted to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank both of our colleagues from California, Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Boxer.\n  To our colleague from Minnesota, I yield such time as he may desire.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First, I ask unanimous consent Joseph Goodwin, an \nintern, be allowed to be on the floor during the duration of this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me start out on a \npersonal note. I really consider it an honor to work with Senators. I \nconsider it an honor to be here. Every time I come to the floor of the \nSenate, I still get goose bumps, and I think it is something I never \nexpected to have a chance to do.\n  Senator Dodd is one of the Senators I most love working with because \nhe has been, over the years, such a strong and such a committed voice \nfor children. I thank him for that.\n  I think this amendment is extremely important, because all it is \nreally saying is let's hold out a reserve fund for children so when it \ncomes to our commitments here in the Senate, we make the investment.\n  I will be brief. I have had a chance to travel the country. I have \nbeen in a lot of low- and moderate-income communities. I have been in a \nlot of other communities. Let me just say that the initial travel I did \nfrom Appalachia to Letcher County, KY, to Delta, MS, to inner city \nBaltimore, to public housing in Chicago, to urban and rural Minnesota, \neverywhere I go people ask the same question: Where is the equal \nopportunity for our children? Everywhere I go this focus on how we can \nmake sure the children come to school ready to learn is the priority. \nWe just have to do a lot better for our children. We have to do a lot \nbetter for all of our children.\n  My colleague from California talked about the welfare bill. She is \nabsolutely right, there are long waiting lists for affordable child \ncare, even longer now, because of the welfare-to-work provisions.\n  Above and beyond that, I say that I meet people, they are heroes and \nheroines of Head Start and child care, they do their very best, and \nthey can make a huge difference for children, but we have long waiting \nlists all across our country for affordable child care. When you talk \nto middle-income families--this is not just low-income--working \nfamilies, they will tell you that the expense may be up to $10,000 or \nmore per child, and it can be up to a quarter of their income.\n  This is a huge issue. If there is anything that we could do in the \nU.S. Senate that would be good for families, that would be good for our \ncountry, it would be to make this investment.\n  I have said this before and I will say it one more time and I will \nnot say it in a shrill way. I say to both colleagues--and I see my \ncolleague from Washington here on the floor, as well--every time there \nis a discussion of child care, every time we have a discussion about \nchildren, I think of Fannie Lou Hammer, the civil rights leader, \nMississippi, daughter of a sharecropper, who said in one of her \nspeeches, ``I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.'' Sometimes I \nget tired of the symbolic politics. Everyone loves children. Everyone \nwants to have a photo opportunity next to a child. Everyone says they \nare for children and education. Every breed of political person says \nthat. But there comes a point in time when if we are really for \nchildren we have to dig into our pockets and make the investment.\n\n  There is no more important national security issue than to invest in \nthe\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\nhealth and skills of intellect and character of our children, all of \nour children. That is what this Dodd amendment speaks to, that is what \nthe position that Democrats are taking speaks to, and I really think \nthat this is where the rubber meets the road. This is where ``the \ndifferences make a difference.''\n  I am hopeful that colleagues on the other side, many of them good \nfriends, many of whom I think do have this commitment, will support \nSenator Dodd in his amendment. It is just not enough to give speeches. \nIt is just not enough to be talking about how we are for child care and \nchildren and education. We have to make the investment. That is what \nthis amendment speaks to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his eloquent \nremarks. Let me turn to my colleague from the State of Washington who \nhas been a leader long before she arrived in the Senate on the child \ncare issue as a member of the legislature in Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for offering \nthis amendment I offered in the Budget Committee. I can tell you, as a \nworking parent, one of the most critical issues that faces parents \nevery single morning across this country is, will my child have a place \nto be? I have had the experience, and I guess that many parents across \nthis country have had the experience, of dropping their child off at \nday care on a Friday and have them say to you, ``We will not be here on \nMonday. We decided to go out of the business.'' There is nothing worse \nthat can happen to you in a day than to all of a sudden panic and try \nto find a place to put your child who may be 2, 3, 8, or 10, and you \nknow they need a safe place, you know you need to be at work Monday \nmorning, and there is nowhere for your child.\n  Mr. President, across this country businesses are recognizing this \ncritical issue because they know they need their employees to be \nproductive. A productive employee is not sitting at work worrying about \nwhether their child is safe or taken care of; a productive employee is \none who knows their child is all right. This amendment simply puts in \nplace a placeholder so that this Congress will address the issue that \nis discussed at almost every kitchen table of every family across this \ncountry.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut for being a leader on this \nissue for so many years.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank our colleague from Washington as well. As I \nmentioned, her experience goes back to her years of public service and \nher years as a parent.\n  I was looking at the clock as she spoke. It is almost 3 o'clock. This \nwould not apply to all parts of the country, but certainly on the east \ncoast right now there are as many as 5 million children who have no \nsafe place to go after leaving school. We know that for parents who \nhave no choice but to be in the workplace, when school lets out, and \nbefore they get home from work at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock, there is a \ngreat sense of anxiety about where their child is? They worry: Who is \nwatching my child? What is my child doing?\n  We know from police chiefs all over the country, that juvenile \ndelinquency rises, not after 11 p.m. at night, but between 3 o'clock \nand 8 o'clock in the evening.\n  My hope is to raise some legislative ideas which would allow us to at \nleast deal with after-school care, with infant care, with the quality \nof child care. But, I am being told by the budget resolution I cannot \ndo that; I cannot bring up my idea on after-school care on child care \nin this Congress because it is subject to a point of order. I don't \nthink it is fair. I don't think it is right. I think it is harmful to \nchildren and working families.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts cares about this issue very, very \nmuch. I know he has some comments he would like to share as well.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for \nthe time. I also thank him particularly for his longstanding leadership \nin the Congress on this issue. There has been no more persevering or \nmore eloquent voice on the subject of children than Senator Dodd.\n  This is really the most important work we can do in America today: \npay attention to our children. All across this country, on a daily \nbasis, we pick up a newspaper and read a headline about trouble that \ncomes from children who are not structured in their lives in the course \nof a day, who don't have the care they ought to have at the earliest \nstages of their lives. Every bit of pediatric, psychological, \npsychiatric, early child development evidence that we have in this \ncountry indicates that the first years of a child's life are absolutely \nthe most important in the development of that child. You could \nliterally have a brain that is 25 or 30 percent larger, based on the \nappropriate nurturing, attention, problem-solving, love, and focus that \nchildren get in the earlier stages. Why? Because that is when the brain \nconnections are being made. We know this scientifically beyond any \ndoubt whatsoever.\n  In Boston the other day, I was in the Castle Square Early Child \nDevelopment Center. There are 67 kids there. They are getting a \nnurturing, caring, structured environment which, while their parents \nare out at work, is precisely what we required in the welfare bill. \nPrecisely what most Americans want most other Americans to be sharing \nalong with them is the burden of work in America. So while they are out \ndoing it, where are their kids? For the 67 kids in the Castle Square \nEarly Child Development Center, there are 500 on the waiting list--500 \nkids who will never cross the threshold of that center by the time they \nreach 6 years of age and are supposed to go to school and be ready to \nlearn. The truth is that in too many schools in America today, when \nkids are 6 years old and they go to school, there are among them \nchildren who cannot recognize numbers, who cannot recognize colors or \nshapes or forms or even perform the most simple kinds of problem-\nsolving.\n  Now, I know our Republican friends speak a lot about values and about \nthe nature of parenting and the importance of it. But the fact is that, \nin America today, one-third of our children are born out of wedlock. \nThey start with a single parent. In too many cases, that single parent \nis out in the workplace trying to make ends meet, and the child has \nnobody at home. I was in a middle school the other day in Boston, with \nkids age 10 to 14, 35 kids in a class. I asked them, ``When you go home \nat 2 o'clock in the afternoon, how many of you go to a house, apartment \nhouse, or whatever, where there is no adult present until around 6 \no'clock in the evening?'' Fully 50 percent of the hands in that room \nwent up, Mr. President. Whose fault is that, theirs or ours? It is \nours.\n  What the Senator from Connecticut is trying to say is, let us at \nleast have the vision of trying to set aside a reserve fund that will \npermit us to be able to come down the road and say that we are going to \nhelp America do this. Out of 3 million children in the United States of \nAmerica that are eligible for early Head Start, only 30,000 get it. Out \nof 1.6 million kids in America that are eligible for Head Start itself, \nonly about 800,000 get it.\n  Now, Mr. President, if we don't want to come back here and decide how \nmany prisons we are going to build and how many drug abuse programs we \nneed and how we are going to cope with the trauma in our streets or \ndeal with countries that can outcompete us in the marketplace because \nour kids don't have the skills for the new world of globalization and \ntechnology, this is the business of America that we should be paying \nattention to. I think it's unconscionable that we can have a reserve \nfund for tax cuts but not a reserve fund for children. I can't think of \nanything more important in the business of the Senate than to at least \nsay let's avoid the parliamentary chicanery of a point of order on \nbehalf of our children. A point of order can deprive our kids of the \nopportunity to have child care, because I will tell you, Mr. President, \nthere is a majority in the Senate prepared to vote for it--a majority. \nTo steal from the majority of those Senators the right to be able to \ngive those children that child care is to take it away from those \nchildren itself for the sake of parliamentary process and not for a \nfuture vision of this country.\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\n  I thank my colleague profoundly for his willingness to bring this to \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. And \nI'd like to recognize him for his significant contribution to the issue \nof child care, particularly to early child development. We've all \nlearned a great deal over the past year about brain development and the \ncritical period in children's growth from the ages of zero to 3. My \ncolleague from Massachusetts has been instrumental in focusing \nattention on the needs of children during the earliest years. I am \nparticularly grateful that he is here today to comment on this \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Murray, Kerry of Massachusetts, \nDaschle, Kennedy, Lautenberg, Landrieu, Durbin, Wellstone, Kohl and \nHarkin be listed as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support \nfor the Dodd amendment. This amendment would provide a reserve fund to \nimprove the affordability, availability, and quality of child care. It \nalso would support families' choices in caring for their children.\n  As you know, Mr. President, child care remains a pressing national \nproblem. More families need it. Not enough families can afford it. And \nthere aren't enough qualified professionals to provide it.\n  Families with children under 5 and with incomes under $14,400 a year \ntoday spend one-quarter of their incomes on child care. Yet only 1 of \nevery 10 children eligible for child care assistance receives it. Most \nmodest-income families are getting crushed by the costs of child care.\n  Compounding matters, the quality of much child care remains seriously \ndeficient. And a major reason is the high rate of turnover among child \ncare providers. More than one-third of them leave their jobs each year, \nlargely because of low wages.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would help address these problems by \nproviding a mechanism for additional federal support for child care. \nAnd it is critically important.\n  Some have argued that working families don't need this help, because \nthe states already are getting more federal child care funding than \nthey can spend. But that is just wrong. According to the latest HHS \ndata, states' child care outlays are 90 percent of total budget \nauthority for 1997, and states have obligated 99.8 percent of those \nfunds. Morover, so far in 1998, states are drawing down child care \nfunds at a higher rate than last year--and at a higher rate than either \nCBO or OMB had projected.\n\n  I also have heard the argument that we don't need to support spending \non child care when we can expand the dependent care tax credit instead. \nBut that's just not sufficient.\n  As long as the dependent care tax credit remains non-refundable, \nexpanding it will not help modest-income working families. In fact, a \ntwo-parent family with two children that pays $400 per month for child \ncare would not begin to benefit from a non-refundable expansion until \nits annual income reaches almost $31,000.\n  Let me emphasize that. If you have two kids, a $30,000 income, and \nyou pay $400 a month for child care, you're not going to benefit at all \nfrom current proposals to expand the dependent care tax credit. Your \nincome is just too low.\n  Finally, I know that the Republican budget resolution is assuming \nsome additional discretionary funds for child care. But I question \nwhether these funds will materialize given the strict overall caps on \ndiscretionary spending. And, in any case, discretionary spending is a \n1-year, short-term approach to a long-term problem. Americans' child \ncare needs are increasing, and families should have our commitment that \nwe will lend a helping hand.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will agree that it's time to \naddress child care needs in a serious way. And I hope we can get \nbipartisan support for Senator Dodd's important amendment.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Dodd \nfor his important leadership on this issue. I am a cosponsor of his \nchild care ACCESS bill and I am proud to join him in supporting this \namendment.\n  I have been on this floor already today talking about the importance \nof education and how closely educational attainment is tied to every \nindicia of well being. From an individual's physical health to the \nnation's economic health, education is the key.\n  With this amendment, we turn to the issue of child care. I submit \nthat adequate public and private funding for child care is a necessary \nfoundation for educational attainment and economic well being at every \nlevel. Children who are not well cared for have trouble thriving and \nsucceeding in school and in life. Parents who cannot find or afford \ndecent child care cannot work or are less productive and reliable when \nthey are working. We all suffer when good, safe child care is not \navailable.\n  Children who have the opportunity to learn and grow with adult care \nand attention will do better throughout their lives. Recent studies \nhave confirmed that the first three years of a child's life are the \nmost critical in a child's development. For a child, it is these first \nthree years that have, as a Carnegie study stated, ``. . . a decisive, \nlong-lasting impact on their well-being and ability to learn.''\n  There are many child care alternatives for families ranging from \nsmall, home care settings to child care centers with low child to \nteacher ratios to a stay-at-home mother or father--but only if the \nfamilies can afford them. The key to successful child care is that the \nparents have choices about how to best care for their children. For too \nmany American families the high cost of child care puts options out of \ntheir reach.\n  In Illinois, full-day child care can cost from $4,000 to $10,000 per \nyear for just one child. This can be compared to the cost of a college \ntuition at the University of Illinois of just over $4,000. These high \ncosts often force parents into unsafe choices. A recent national study \nfound that 40 percent of the rooms used to provide care for infants in \nchild care centers provided care that was so poor as to put the child's \nhealth, safety or development at risk. Only 8 percent were rated as \nproviding quality care for infants and toddlers. These statistics do \nnot even take into account those parents who cannot find care at all. \nIn Chicago, for example, a 1995 report found the demand for child care \nfor infants exceeded the supply.\n  Without choices, parents are unable to work, have to forgo needed \nfamily income, or are unable to devote their full time and attention to \ntheir work. The lack of choices not only affects the family but has a \ndirect and negative impact on the economy as a whole in public \nassistance and lost productivity costs.\n  A 1991 study for the Illinois Department of Public Aid, for instance, \nfound that for single parents in Illinois receiving welfare, child care \nproblems kept 42 percent of them from working full time. Twenty percent \nof those women who worked but returned to welfare within a year were \nforced back onto welfare because of child care problems. For those who \nhad to quit school, 42 percent left because of child care programs. \nWhile the statistics may not be so stark for middle-class families, the \neffects can be as great. The lack of decent, affordable care crosses \neconomic lines.\n  The fiscal year 1999 budget resolution has several provisions for \nimproving child care, but these are tentative and modest compared to \nthe need. This amendment will allow those in the Senate concerned with \nthe lack of child care choices for at-home and working parents to \neffectively target public and private resources to address the child \ncare crisis. We cannot slam the door on child care as we open the door \nto the 21st Century. It would be irresponsible. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Dodd, and I commend the Senator from Connecticut for \nattempting to make the Senate address the need to improve affordable \nchildcare in this nation.\n  Mr. President, few issues are more important in determining the \nfuture of our children and our nation than access to safe and \naffordable child care. Ensuring the availability of affordable, quality \nchild care programs must be a top national priority for us as \nlawmakers, as parents, and as citizens. Today, we have a rare \nopportunity to\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\noffer hope to families struggling to find or keep their children safe \nand learning.\n  By sponsoring this amendment, Senator Dodd has sent an important \nmessage to every American who is working hard to raise a child--we know \nit is sometimes difficult, and we know your government has a \nresponsibility to assist you in your most important work. With this \namendment, of which I am lead cosponsor, we make room in the budget to \nlay out a vision for the type of assistance the American public has \ntold us will truly help.\n  First, I must say that like many issues affecting children and \nfamilies, child care is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Senator \nDodd and I have had the opportunity to work toward child care solutions \nwith several Republican senators over the past couple of months. \nAlthough both parties and the administration have submitted differing \nchild care proposals, I know we can all work together to create a new \nchild care law that does what American families need. With the right \nmix of participation from families and communities, private industry, \nand government, we can create a child care system that is the envy of \nthe world.\n  But we don't have that system today. And, this is why the Senator \nfrom Connecticut's proposal is so critical to our nation's success. \nBecause child care is not just a place you put a child until you get \nhome from work. If we know one thing about child care today, that many \nof us have long intuitively known was the case, it is that child care \nis an enterprise defined by the quality of education and care that it \nprovides.\n  Let us examine some of what we know about child care in America \ntoday:\n  Recent research about the way a child's brain develops shows us the \nimportance of quality care to a child's healthy development. The first \nthree years of a child's development are decisive in determining that \nchild's future. Quality child care, with an age-appropriate \ndevelopmental and educational focus, provides the early stimulation \nrequired to correctly develop a child's sensitive neural systems.\n  It is time for policy-makers and the American public to reject the \nnarrow view of early child care and education as separate entities. \nEarly child development must now assume its place in our local and \nnational funding priorities as an integral piece of the educational \nprocess. Child care lays the foundation required for a lifetime of \nlearning.\n  Children who experience quality care demonstrate higher language and \nmath skills when entering school. Our first National Educational Goal \nis that by the year 2000 every child will enter school ready to learn. \nWithout quality early child development programs for all children, we \ncannot meet this important goal. Early child development also gives \nchildren the increased self-perception and social skills that allow \nthem to succeed in school and in life.\n  We cannot continue to view child care as ``just another expense.'' \nFunding for quality care represents a wise investment in our nation's \nfuture. Studies consistently show that quality child development \nprograms produce long-term positive social benefits. Quality care \nreduces the anti-social behavior and chronic delinquency which threaten \nthe stability of our communities. Early child development must also be \na priority if we truly want to halt the spread of crime. Law \nenforcement leaders across the nation agree that investments that \ncreate a safe and nurturing environment for children, especially in the \ncritical hours between 3 and 10 p.m., will sharply reduce crime.\n  Some early childhood services for low-income toddlers have been found \nto cut the number of chronic criminal offenders by 80 percent and \ndelinquency by 90 percent. By providing children with the preparation \nto learn, quality child care prevents the lack of literacy and \nmarketable skills that force many people to rely on public assistance.\n  By reducing the later, more-expensive costs of public assistance and \nimprisonment, investment in child care can save billions of taxpayer \ndollars. The High Scope Preschool Study found that by providing \nincreased tax revenues and reduced costs of crime and welfare, every \ndollar invested in high quality early childhood programs for low income \nchildren eventually saved $7 of taxpayer money.\n  Despite the monumental consequences, the current American ``system'' \nof early child development meets neither the demand for supply, nor the \nquality required of it. In too many communities, parents are simply \nunable to find affordable, quality care. The situation is especially \nacute for low-income parents; the working poor currently face waiting \nlists in thirty-eight states. Although children from low-income \nfamilies receive the most benefit from child care, they attend child \ndevelopment programs at only half the rate of children from high-income \nfamilies.\n  The 1996 welfare law dramatically increased the already urgent demand \nfor affordable, quality child care. Welfare plans will direct over two \nmillion parents, mostly mothers, into the workforce. Without the \nsupport provided by child care which meets at least minimal standards \nof affordability and quality, few parents can afford to leave the home \nfor the workplace.\n\n  Too many existing child care programs fail to provide \ndevelopmentally-appropriate care. Studies show that less than a tenth \nof child care centers provide appropriate care. A recent national study \nfound that most centers provide care that is poor or mediocre. The \nwidespread lack of appropriate training and experience, and the lack of \nsafe facilities, holds long-term consequences for the health and \ndevelopment of American children.\n  Efforts to improve K-12 education can never be fully successful when \none-third of our children enter kindergarten unprepared to learn.\n  We cannot not allow providers to maintain environments which harm our \nchildren. The federal government must do something to help states \nimprove their standards--we cannot allow dangerous and inadequate child \ncare environments to continue. A recent analysis of state regulations \nfound that no states have child care safety regulations above the \n``mediocre'' level.\n  We must also improve standards in the half million to million \nunlicensed home child care businesses operating in this country. Simply \nbecause a child is in an unlicensed facility does not decrease her need \nfor developmentally-appropriate challenges. There are things we can do \nto increase the kind of care that stimulates a child's early growth.\n  Parents are an integral part of a child's early developmental growth \nand must have the opportunity to become involved in early child care \nprograms. Parents cite lack of time as the top reason for not becoming \ninvolved in their children's education. I am proud to have sponsored \nthe Time for Schools Act of 1997 which expands uses for time under the \nFamily Medical Leave Act to allow parents to be involved in their \nchildren's education, or to take care of child care emergencies, \nwithout losing their job.\n  There is also so much more we can do to involve parents in the care \nand education of their children. Across this nation, people have worked \nto put tools in the hands of parents, so they can make the best choices \npossible when it comes to the care of their children. The family is the \nengine that drives our economy and society. Any child care legislation \nmust include efforts to get parents and families the information they \nneed, whether it's about choosing quality child care, choosing to stay \nhome and care for a child, or choosing strategies to make caring for a \nchild safer and more affordable.\n  There are things that states across the nation can learn from my the \nexperiences of my home state of Washington. Washington state has a \nchild care system nationally recognized for its excellence. State \nlicensing requirements far exceed federal standards and go further than \nalmost all state regulations towards ensuring safe child care. The \nstate has implemented an integrated system of child care assistance for \nall low-moderate income families, regardless of whether they are \ninvolved in work first programs. In addition, the state legislature has \ninstituted a training requirement for child care professionals, and \nprovided initial funds for a training system and a registry to track \nthat training.\n  But even in a state like Washington, the lack of investment from the \nfederal level forces difficult choices at the state level--in our case, \nlower subsidies which are reducing options for low-income parents.\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\n  So whatever solutions we seek here must give assistance flexibly to \nstates, so individual states can make improvements in the areas where \nthey need it most.\n  Two other discussions in my state are very promising, and they \ndeserve your attention.\n  First, there is the work of the Human Services Policy Center at the \nUniversity of Washington. The Policy Center has reached out to leaders \nin the private and public sectors, and to parents and the child care \ncommunity, and come up with recommendations to improve child care \nfinancing. Their study, ``Financing Quality Child Care in Washington,'' \nprovides a thorough review of the state of child care financing in one \nstate, with implications for our national debate.\n  Another very exciting discussion and project is underway in Spokane, \nWashington, of which you all should be aware. It is a family child care \ndemonstration home and small business center, created by a wide array \nof partners:\n  Founding partners, including The Health Improvement Partnership of \nSpokane, Holy Family Hospital, the Nevada-Lidgerwood Neighborhood, and \nNorthwest Regional Facilitators (the local child care resource and \nreferral agency); and newer partners, including the Child Care Facility \nFund of Washington State, the Dayton Hudson Foundation, Spokane Falls \nCommunity College, Eastern Washington Association for the Education of \nYoung Children, Eastern Washington Family Child Care Association, \nFamily Care Resources, Kathy Modigliani National Accreditation, the \nNational Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, the \nWashington State Office of Child Care Policy, the Small Business \nDevelopment Center, and the Washington State Child Care Resource and \nReferral Network.\n  The project is called the ``Family Child Care HOME (Hands On Model \nEnvironment)'' and provides child care in a high quality family child \ncare setting for children from infant to age twelve. The projects also \nprovides orientation and training for child care providers, and a \nbusiness incubation center for new family child care businesses. The \nHOME project partners have also set up a revolving microcredit loan \nprogram, for child care providers to purchase equipment, expand their \nbusiness, acquire professional training and remodel their facilities. \nOn site at the child care home, there is a library, equipped with toys, \nbooks, start-up supplies, videos, and child centered leaning materials \nfor all child care providers throughout the county. In addition, there \nis a consumer education center for parents, businesses, and communities \nto learn more about family child care.\n\n  I have gone into some detail today, about the state of child care in \nthis nation, and some examples from my own home state, because the Dodd \namendment gives us a chance to do something good for American families.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has introduced legislation to address \nthis issue more comprehensively than the amendment before us today. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of that bill as well. But if we do not pass \nthis amendment, this Senate will never even have a chance to debate the \nmerits of the bill that could actually improve child care for working \nparents.\n  Working Americans, many of them lower income, are in the greatest \nneed for assistance in our current child care system; the Dodd-Kennedy-\nHarkin-Murray ACCESS bill would do a lot of important things to help \nthem. It includes refundable tax credits to provide such assistance. \nThe ACCESS bill does not mandate national standards; it gives states \nthe funding and flexibility to make quality improvements where they see \nthem as necessary. The bill expands Family and Medical Leave to more \nemployees. Taken along with my ``Time for Schools Act'' allowing \nparents to take care of child care emergencies, this represents a true \nstep forward.\n  The ACCESS bill provides funding for important quality improvements, \nincluding resource and referral services --currently the best source \nparents have for child care information in many states. Parent \neducation can be expanded with these funds--giving parents the kind of \ninformation and resources they are looking for.\n  The bill makes several changes to promote the kind of private/public \npartnerships happening in my state. It sends out challenge grants and \nemployer tax credits, but doesn't limit businesses' involvement to the \nchildren of their own employees. The quality of child care in the \ncommunity as a whole will benefit from such provisions.\n  But the point here today is that we will never even have a chance to \npose such questions to the Senate if the Dodd amendment is rejected. \nThat is because the budget resolution before us today does not allow us \nto debate childcare. It makes no provisions for addressing the \nchildcare needs of American families. By reading this resolution, one \ncould easily conclude the majority party in the Senate simply does not \ncare about childcare.\n  Not every partent can afford to hire a nanny to look after their \nchildren. When we begin to see child care, especially family child \ncare, as a business opportunity, and supporting investments that lead \nto child care businesses becoming licensed and meeting other quality \nguidelines then we will begin to build capacity in our communities. We \nwant people to enter this business, to do it well, and to succeed.\n  As I mentioned, there is bipartisan agreement about the need to \nimprove child care in this country. There must also be agreement about \nfunding, or we will not have child care improvement this year. I can \nassure the American public that if Congress hears loudly enough about \nthe interest and need for child care improvement, we will find the \nmoney for this. Within the context of a balanced budget, with or \nwithout a tobacco settlement or any other possible funding source--if \nthis is a national priority, we can take this step.\n  But the American people must weigh in, or it will not happen. \nIncreasing the supply of quality child care must become a top national \npriority. Failure to do so threatens our children's future, and that of \nour nation. I urge my colleagues to support the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes and describe what \nwe are trying to do. This amendment is a procedural one. I am not \nreally debating the issue of how we should resolve the child care \ncrisis--although there are certainly no shortage of opinions on how we \nought to do that. All I am trying to do here with this amendment is to \nsay, at some point later this year, if the funds are available, can I \nbring up a child care amendment without being subjected to a point of \norder? That is all I want to do. We can get to the merits of various \nchild care proposals at some point later. But under this budget \nresolution, I am precluded from bringing up such proposals, unless I \ncan override a point of order that requires a supermajority. I don't \nthink that is right or fair.\n  I don't disagree with those who might say we want to provide a tax \ncut as a result of having additional revenues, either because the \neconomy is doing tremendously well or if we are able to come up with a \ntobacco settlement. But what I don't understand is, if it's OK to bring \nup those issues, why can't I bring up child care, which is a staggering \nproblem? Five million children at this hour, as they finish school for \nthe day, are home alone, unattended. Thirteen million children, every \nday need some kind of child care setting. And their parents need the \nability to pay for that care. But, as you can see from this graph, due \nto inadequate funding, only 1 in 10 eligible children are receiving \nassistance from the Child Care and Development Block Grant. Many other \nfamilies are left to cope with skyrocketing costs. As you can see from \nthis second chart the cost of child care in various cities across \nAmerica is truly astonishing. In Boston, child care for an infant is \n$11,860 a year. For a 3-year-old, it's $8,840. For 6-year-olds, it's \n$6,600. Costs of child care in other states--Florida, Minnesota, Texas, \nColorado--range from $4,000 to $9,000.\n  These figures are all the more astonishing when you realize that half \nof all the parents with young children earn less than $35,000. Can you \nimagine how difficult it must be for a family in the city of Boston \nthat earns $35,000 a year to afford $11,000 in child care for an \ninfant? Your family is making $35,000 a year and you may have to spend \na third of your budget on child care. How do you make ends meet?\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\n  I am not suggesting that the federal government should pick up the \nwhole tab here. But I have some ideas about how we can leverage funds \nfrom states, from communities, and from businesses. But I can't even \noffer these ideas without overcoming a point of order.\n  Whatever else you may agree or disagree with when it comes to child \ncare, isn't it at least fundamentally fair on an issue this important \nthat we be allowed in this body to debate our options? The budget \nresolution is about making decisions on how to spend the money of the \nAmerican people. Now not all of my constituents may agree that child \ncare is important, but a lot of people do. I am going to have to say to \nthem: I am sorry, I can't even bring up your ideas about what we should \ndo to make sure that your child has a safe place to be when you can't \nbe with them. I am not allowed to raise your concerns under this budget \nresolution. We are allowed to have, on page 27 of this bill, title II, \nbudgetary restraints and rulemaking, line 3, a tax cut reserve fund. \nThat is allowed. So we are allowed to have a reserve fund for tax cuts, \nbut we're not allowed to have a reserve fund for child care.\n  All I want to do is to create a reserve fund to leave open the \npossibility of dealing with the issue of child care. Vote against me \nlater if you want. Stand up and say you're sorry, but you don't like my \nideas. I will accept it if you disagree with me. But, I can't imagine \nanybody here, regardless of ideology or party, would say I should not \nbe allowed, in a budget resolution --to address a priority we all agree \nis pretty high on the list. I ask my colleagues here, 50 plus 1, to say \nwe agree with you, we think that ought to be a priority and we are \ngoing to support you. As it stands right now, if it tries to raise \nconcerns or offer solutions to this problem then I have to produce a \nsupermajority to overcome a point of order--which everybody around here \nknows is virtually impossible to do.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a very real issue, one that I think is \nimportant. I only have half an hour and to even debate this issue and \nto tell people why I feel so strongly about it. We have to move along.\n  I will say from the outset that I have great respect for the chairman \nof the Budget committee. He has a thankless job, as does my colleague \nfrom New Jersey. It is difficult work. I sat on his committee for a \nnumber of years. I realize it is not easy to put a budget resolution \ntogether. But I believe I ought to have a chance--I believe I deserve a \nchance--to speak to the needs of children in this nation. There are \nmillions of children, Mr. President--who don't have access to high \nquality care. Only 17 States have child care standards that meet even \nminimal standards of quality. In most States, if give manicures, if you \nwork on someone's nails, you have to meet tough standards. But only 17 \nStates require any training at all for somebody who is going to hold a \nchild's life in their hands. Where is the logic in that?\n  What I would like to see is debate on how we can improve the quality \nof child care, through training, and by improving provider-child \nratios. I want to debate tax cuts to assist businesses that want to \nprovide child care to their employees. I know my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Kohl, would like the chance to present this very \ngood idea.\n  There is something fundamentally wrong with a process that would \npreclude debate on those ideas.\n  I see my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, is here. Let me, \nif I can, yield a few minutes to her. I turn to my colleague from \nLouisiana, who has worked for many years on children's issues in her \nstate and has brought great energy to these matters since her arrival \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his great and \ntireless leadership on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, it has been well stated, the need for child care in \nthe United States. But the point I want to make is that the child care \nthat is just barely there now in our system is not really affordable to \nworking families. As much as there is not enough of it, and not enough \nspots, we have a real crisis, as my colleague from Connecticut and \nothers realize, because even if it were available under the current \nsystem, it is not really affordable to working families.\n  We have the majority, 65 percent of moms--and I am in that 65 \npercent; I am a working mom here in the Senate. I have a 6-year-old and \nan 8-month-old, so I can really speak to all those mothers and fathers \nwho are working with children at home. Some of us work out of choice, \nbut many of us work out of necessity. Many, many parents have to work; \nthey don't have a choice to be at home. Because of some laws that we \njust recently passed--welfare-to-work and welfare reform, which I \ngenerally supported--we have now mandated it. It is not a choice that \nmany poor women have now; we have actually mandated that they leave \nhome and go to work. So we have made what was a problem 2 years ago \neven greater by forcing many women, who were home, out to work.\n  It seems to me that in our efforts towards welfare reform--which, \nagain, I support--some Members of this Congress might be somewhat \nhypocritical in mandating poor women to go to work, wanting to give tax \nbreaks for middle class women to stay home, and then not providing \nchild care to anybody that is affordable to anybody. Mr. President, \nthat is really the situation we are in, which is a crying shame for the \nworking families in our country.\n  I know my colleague from Connecticut knows the average cost of out-\nof-home care is $6,000. For even two parents who are working at a \nminimum wage 40 hours a week, their income is $21,000. By the time they \npay whatever taxes and other requirements for that paycheck, they don't \neven take home enough money to pay for the child care.\n  So what are some of the options? Some of the options have been \noutlined, mostly on this side of the aisle. Tax credits for \nbusinesses--we have to do a better job as an employer, ourselves, in \nthe Senate, in the Federal Government, to make our systems and our \ncenters more affordable to all of our employees, from our highest paid \nto our lowest paid. We can do that. We can also provide some direct \nsubsidies, some tax credits, and then some block grants, in addition, \nto States to expand the slots that they have.\n  But my final point on this is to say to this Senate and to our \ncolleagues that we can talk about family values, talk about how much we \nlove our children, talk about how important families are, but, really, \nour checkbooks reflect our priorities. In this budget, it doesn't \nreflect that our priorities are our families or our children. Only \nGovernment, through some action--not by doing it all--can pull this \nsystem in our country together for child care and reward, if we will, \nthe families who are working and have made the best choices they can \nfor their families.\n  I hope we can adopt the amendment of Senator Dodd and many other \namendments that speak to this issue, because there is a crisis in this \ncountry and one that we should not ignore and one that our checkbook--\nnot our words but our checkbook--should reflect.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  Let me reiterate the point of this amendment. What this amendment \nwould do is establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund, similar to the \ntax reserve fund created by the Chairman on page 27 of the resolution, \nto improve the availability, affordability, and quality of child care. \nA reserve fund--for those who may not be aware--is simply a mechanism \nthat allows legislation, in this case child care legislation, to be \noffered later in the year without the threat of a budget point of order \nbeing brought against it.\n  Why is that necessary? The budget resolution before us today \nforecloses the possibility of other meaningful and comprehensive \nsolutions to child care. It does contain some proposals for child care, \nbut it doesn't allow us to offer our alternatives for meeting the \nconcerns of families in this country.\n  Senator Murray, our colleague from Washington, offered an amendment \nas a member of the Budget Committee in the markup which would have kept \nour options open. That amendment and this one would allow the Senate to \nconsider mandatory funding--just consider it, not require it--for child \ncare. This amendment was rejected by the committee along party lines. \nSo, as the budget resolution now stands, future\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\nlegislative attempts to improve the quality of child care, or to help \nfamilies afford the skyrocketing costs of care, or to create after-\nschool programs for the 5 million children home alone each day after \nschool, to provide for care for children with special health needs, are \nall shut out. I would like the opportunity to offer those ideas. To do \nso, this amendment must be adopted. If not, then I am foreclosed from \ndoing so, and that is the reason I am asking for support.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not need time in opposition for another 5 or 6 \nminutes, if he wants to speak some more. He is eloquent on the subject. \nEven though his amendment is quite deficient, he is spectacular in \nterms of his presentation.\n  Let me just ask a question.\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You said even if you wanted to present a child care \nproposal, you would be precluded from doing that unless there were \nsomething in this budget resolution that allowed it. I don't believe \nthe Senator meant that. For, let me tell you, this budget resolution \ndoes nothing to the right of anyone to bring up a bill with a new \nentitlement, which is what you are contemplating, so long as it is paid \nfor. You would have to provide tax increases or entitlement restraint. \nAnd you can offer all the child care add-on mandatories you would like; \nthey may not pass, but they would not be subject to a point of order. \nThe budget processes are complicated and in some cases arcane, but \nthere is a simple one: You pay for entitlements with entitlement cuts \nor tax increases. So you could do that.\n  I am not suggesting that is the best way, or the only way, but I \nbelieve you said you could not, and I just wanted to make sure that, at \nleast from my standpoint, you either--if you meant what you said, you \nat least take into consideration what I have said--or perhaps you could \nsuggest that I am in some way in error?\n  Mr. DODD. To my good friend and colleague, who is so knowledgeable on \nthese issues, let me state this as I understand it, and you respond, if \nyou will.\n  In order to do what you have suggested, of course, I would have to \noperate within the existing budget structure--which means I would have \nto take from one critical program--perhaps Head Start or education, to \nfund child care. I would have to make families compete against \nthemselves. But if I want to take anticipated tobacco revenues or draw \nfrom the additional resources of a growing economy, as I understand it, \nI am precluded under this budget resolution from doing so.\n  Out of that $300 billion or $500 billion in tobacco funds--whatever \namount we ultimately decide here--I believe that $15 billion or $20 \nover 5 years can be found to commit to child care. But under this \nbudget resolution, I would be subject to a point of order; is that not \ncorrect?\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct. But I didn't raise that point. \nI answered a statement you made that you would be precluded from \noffering it under this budget resolution. All I said is, anybody can \noffer a spending bill, an entitlement, mandatory spending bill. It will \nnot be subject to a budget point of order if it is paid for, and the \n``paid for'' is either cutting other similar programs or tax increases \nthat you use for it.\n  You raise a different question. You raise the question now, which I \ndid not think was in your reserve fund, because the reserve fund is set \nup for all of the tobacco settlement receipts. If you want to take \nsomething out of that, then, like others, you might want to amend that. \nIf you try to amend that, we suggest that money should go to Medicare. \nSo that will be the battle, and we will have that out. There will be a \nnumber of amendments which handle it that way.\n  Let me just also suggest that you mentioned appropriated accounts. I \ndon't want to get this to be a mumbo-jumbo ``budgetese'' discussion \nhere, but your amendment is not one that has anything to do with \ndiscretionary programs. It creates an entitlement program. So the \ndiscretionary caps which we are all--excepting maybe three Senators or \nfour--coming down here saying we want to keep--and I don't know where \nyou stand on that, whether you want to break them or not--you break \nthose by spending discretionary money. You don't break them by creating \na new mandatory program, a new entitlement. Although nobody thought we \nwould be creating new entitlement programs once we got the budget \nbalanced; most people thought we would not do that anymore because we \nwant to keep it balanced. But if you want to do it some more, you have \nto pay for them in the ways I have described.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I agree that we should not be \ncreating programs that we can't pay for. That is the purpose of \ncreating a deficit neutral reserve account. Like all reserve funds, \nincluding that of my friend and colleague from New Mexico, this reserve \nfund makes the hypothetical statement that if we somehow find \nadditional revenues we should use them for the purpose stated in the \nfund. Being deficit neutral means that we would be required to find an \noffset. We don't know where the funds might come from, obviously. \nAround here, anything can happen between cup and lip. But we are \nworking on an assumption that there will be some revenues available \nthis year, and we want the opportunity to debate whether those funds \ncan be used for child care.\n  With regard to potential tobacco funds, the majority has made the \ndecision that they must exclusively be used for Medicare. What some of \nus are saying here is that we don't disagree that certainly part of it \nought to be for that purpose. But we think in addition to Medicare \nthere are some other legitimate purposes, and one of them is child \ncare.\n  The fact is that the tobacco industry has, for generations, targeted \nchildren--and we all know that to be the case. Certainly their \nadvertising, Joe Camel for example, has been designed to appeal to \nkids. Why? Because the industry knows that 90 percent of the adults who \nsmoke began as teenagers.\n  We are suggesting if you have some additional resources generated by \ntobacco company payments, shouldn't some of those funds be targeted to \nchildren and families? That is all we are suggesting. I am certainly \nnot asking for the money to go exclusively to child care. I am not \nasking for a provision which says that money from tobacco can only be \nused for children. I wouldn't say that, because I respect the fact that \nthere are other activities that need and deserve these dollars--public \nhealth programs, smoking cessation and biomedical research, and \ncertainly Medicare. But I think that child care also has merit and that \nI ought to be allowed to make a case on why it deserves some of these \ntobacco dollars.\n  Again, we may differ, as we certainly do, about how a child care bill \nought to be framed. My colleague, for instance, from Vermont and my \ncolleagues from Kansas, Pat Roberts, Senator Snowe from Maine, Senator \nCollins from Maine, Senator Specter of Pennsylvania and others--all \nhave had ideas on child care which are ones they would like to have \nconsidered. So when I stand here to try to set up a reserve account, it \nisn't just to protect my proposals, it is to protect ideas they may \nhave as well. But in the absence of the adoption of this amendment, \nwhether it is my colleagues from the Republican side who care about \nchild care, or colleagues from this side, unless we have the reserve \naccount, we are precluded from doing anything meaningful in this area.\n\n  I see my time has expired, the time of those who are the proponents \nof this amendment. I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Are we scheduled \nnow to vote on the Gregg amendment at 4 o'clock, except that each side \nhas 1 minute to discuss the Gregg amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That will be followed by the Dodd amendment, which is \nnot amendable, and there will be 1 minute on each side after that vote \nhas expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Clearly, Senator Dodd has perceived my position \ncorrectly. I will make a point of order\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\nwith reference to his amendment. It clearly is subject to a point of \norder, and then I presume he would like to vote on a waiver. That is \nprobably what the vote is going to be when it comes to the amendment of \nSenator Dodd, because we have waived no points of order as we have gone \nthrough this process.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Dodd, while I believe I am entitled \nto the rest of the time, of course, in the interest of half the time to \neach side, if the Senator from Connecticut needs some time, he can call \non me and I will relinquish some of my time.\n  I will discuss various reserve funds shortly, but I would like very \nmuch to talk about this amendment which, in essence, as to its \nsubstantive effect, is very, very similar to the Murray amendment which \nwas denied germaneness by the Senate in the last vote, and it fell. \nWith regard to what it attempts to do, it is a different subject matter \nbut the same kind of process.\n  There is a little-used process called a reserve fund. There is \nnothing wrong with trying to expand. We will get a proliferation of \nreserve fund attempts this year. It is interesting, and perhaps, Mr. \nPresident, you would be interested in why there will be a proliferation \nof reserve funds.\n  First of all, most reserve funds create a new spending program, and \nalmost all reserve funds--there have been very few--when it comes to a \nnew program, they are entitlements that are created. Essentially, \nreserve funds say that if you want to fund a new transportation program \nor Amtrak, that if, in fact, you put into that reserve fund the \nresources to do it, then the chairman of the Budget Committee says the \nbudget accommodates it, and it would, obviously, be neutral, by \ndefinition; it would not increase the deficit or the expenditure.\n  The problem this year is most interesting. The era of the balanced \nbudget is bringing forth a plethora of suggestions--get this--that we \nincrease entitlement programs, not necessarily in dollars spent on each \none, but brand new ones. Isn't that interesting? At the time we finally \nhave our budget under control, when we have spent the best part of 18 \nyears, that I am aware of, saying, ``Let's get entitlements under \ncontrol''--that is, the automatic spending items; they just spend \npursuant to a formula or the letter of the law, and they spend until \nyou change the law, whereas appropriations you do every year--every \nyear.\n  The plethora of these new ones is because we found a way, believe it \nor not, to say you can't spend any more money on this other kind of \naccount, the annual appropriations bills, in which these programs \nbelong. This child care program belongs in that category called an \nannual appropriation. But if you put it in there, you have to do two \nthings, and that is why there will be reserve funds, because you have \nto cut some domestic program to make room for it, or you break the \nbudget, which has a dollar number in for each year.\n  So now that that is firmly fixed and we have it under control and \nWall Street and Alan Greenspan and those who make interest rates in \nAmerica are saying, ``The one thing you really did''--now let's follow \nthrough--``is you placed that cap, annual amount, that dollar number, \nthat you can't exceed, you put it in each year,'' now they said, \n``Prove it; do it.'' What we do is say we don't want to provide any \ncuts, reductions, or eliminations, so we are coming around and creating \nnew mandatory expenditures.\n\n  Frankly, the problem with mandatory expenditures is, they go on \nalmost forever, but, secondly, you frequently underestimate them. Yet, \nif they spend out above the estimate, they just spend out. An example \nis Medicaid. Medicaid was created on the floor of the Senate with an \nestimate of less than a billion dollars in cost. It became an \nentitlement. I don't remember, when we finally reformed it and made it \na block grant, how many billions it was, but it was many tens of times \nbigger than the estimate. When we changed it, we usually changed it to \nspend more.\n  You can see why we were so worried that if we wanted to get to an era \nof balanced budgets and surpluses--``Good for America,'' everybody in \nthe world said; ``It is great for America that our unified budget is \nbalanced; you have to try to keep those caps in place, and you have to \ntry to not create any new entitlement programs.'' But if you cannot \nspend any more on this side of the ledger, then go over to this side \nand say we will create a new one over here, and we will try to pay for \nit one way or the other so it won't increase--it won't affect the \nbudget surplus.\n  The problem with this one is very, very simple. Just like Senator \nMurray's reserve, it said we would like to spend more money on child \ncare and we would like to have our programs expanded rather \nsubstantially--I don't know how many billions; it just says child care \nprogram.\n  Then it says here is a reserve fund, but the reserve fund is only \nhalf filled, because it says what we want to spend the money on but it \ndoes not say where we get the money to spend. It does not say increase \ntaxes $15 billion to pay for it. It does not say decrease entitlement \nprograms in some way to pay for it, because what no one wants to do is, \nno one wants to go home and tell their constituents that in order to \nhave a new program, ``We had to raise your taxes.'' They just want to \nsay, ``We are giving you a new program.''\n  No one wants to go home and say, ``We got you a new program, and we \nhad to cut these other programs,'' because, obviously, there will be \npeople who like the programs that were cut, too.\n  So here we are with, as I said, a number of these proposals going to \nbe forthcoming, and they are going to sound, for all intents and \npurposes--and I really give Senator Dodd credit in this area. He has \nbeen a leader in bringing everybody's attention to child care needs and \ngetting it started in one very serious way. We had a big compromise \nbattle one time. He gave, we gave, and we actually got a bipartisan \nbill, the first one that was bipartisan. He deserves credit, no doubt \nabout it.\n  What we are doing now is saying we want more of those but we don't \nwant to tell anyone what we have to do to pay for it. We just want to \nput it in this reserve fund, and that will happen some other time, but \nlet everyone know the sponsors want an expanded child care program. I \nhave no doubt that they do. It is just that the budget law says you \ncan't do it this way.\n  It is going to be subject to a point of order, and I am very hopeful \nit will fail on that. I am very hopeful that those in the country who \nlook at this will conclude that it was not a proposal that had much of \na chance to ever be carried out, because there was no money to do it. \nIf you are going to spend $12 billion or $16 billion, keep a balanced \nbudget--and you know how that is already planned; it is called the \nbaseline--if you already know that, and then somebody comes along and \nsays, ``We want $16 billion more,'' it is pretty obvious you have to \nraise taxes or you have to cut something. That is one argument for \ntoday. But I want to give you a couple others.\n\n  First of all, according to the General Accounting Office, there are \nnow 22 separate programs and tax expenditures which support and fund \nchild care. The combined Federal programs provide child care services \nand subsidies to over 5.1 million children, or half the children under \n5 with working mothers. The Federal Government, as one part of \ngovernment in America, pays for 40 percent of all child care \nexpenditures that are governmental.\n  In 1997, the Federal Government spent $13.8 billion on child care \nprograms. And I will give you the range of them:\n  Dependent care tax credit, child care programs ranging from Head \nStart to the program I just mentioned, and a couple of others. The \nmilitary has the largest single program, $302 million, 166,000 kids.\n  The Federal Government spending on child care has increased $6.1 \nbillion, for an 82-percent increase since 1990. Not too shabby. Under \ncurrent law, by 2003 the Federal Government will spend almost $17 \nbillion for child care programs and subsidies. The budget resolution \nwould increase this spending to $20 billion and an increase of almost \n20 percent. In particular, the budget resolution more than doubles the \nsize of the child care and the child care development block grant, \nincreasing the funds from $1 billion in 1998 to $2.2 billion by the \nyear 2003.\n  The budget resolution also assumes that tax relief of up to $9 \nbillion could be afforded as a portion of the funds and a portion of \nthe funds could go to\n\n[[Page S2808]]\n\ntax relief to stay-at-home parents if the tax-writing committee so \ndecides.\n  All of these funds are within the $1.7 trillion budget. They are all \nwithin the $1.7 trillion. We do not increase taxes to pay for them; we \ndo not worsen the deficit to pay for the new spending. The amendment \nbefore us is different from that, albeit, in the mind of the principal \nsponsor, totally justifiable. But the $1.7 trillion is not enough, and \nwe must ask the taxpayers to give us, the Federal Government, more so \nthat we can spend even more on child care than is assumed in this \nresolution.\n  In short, while I am not necessarily arguing that under no \ncircumstances should we ever put any more money in child care, I am \nsuggesting that this year in this budget resolution we do provide some \nsignificant increases.\n  Let me make one other statement and then call one precise item to the \nattention of the Senate. I know this sounds like a lot of money and, on \nthe other hand, my friend Senator Dodd might say it is not enough \nmoney, but just prior to the budget markup I asked for a breakdown of \nall of the money being spent on what would commonly be called child \ncare.\n  Mr. President, Senator Dodd may still maintain that we need more and \nhe may have evidence that we need more, but, obviously, there are a lot \nof things we need more in America, and we can't afford to pay for them \nall. The Senator from Connecticut voted many times not to pay for \nsomething because we didn't have enough money.\n  I went through and looked at the total amount of money that we will \nspend under this 5-year budget, under the discretionary part of this \nbudget--that is, the annual appropriations for child care of various \ntypes, special education for infants and toddlers, development block \ngrant, head Start--we will spend $31 billion in just that one category \nover these 5 years.\n  Then I looked and said, what about mandatory programs, those that you \ndo not have to appropriate each year? I found a child care development \nfund, which is a perpetual fund, not one that you feel you must vote on \neach year, a child care feeding program, social service block grant, \nand I found that $23 billion is spent over the next 5 years for that.\n  Then I looked on the tax side to see how we were doing, and I found \nthat dependent-care tax credit, $15 billion for 5 years; employer-\nprovided child care exclusion, $22.3 billion; dependent-care assistance \nprogram, $800 million. Now if you add them all up, it is $76.8 billion \nthat goes out of the Federal Treasury in this area helping little \nchildren with developmental funds, feeding programs and child care. \nThis number is without the add-ons. This is if we started off the \nbudget process and said we are going to make no reductions and no \nincreases; that is it.\n  I want to raise one other program with you, I say to Senator Dodd. \nMaybe you are unaware of it. Maybe you and others, if you are made \naware of it, might say we should do something about this. But I think \nyou recall--you probably were part of it--when we did the welfare \nreform, we put $1.7 billion in there for child care.\n  Remember the package. We said, let us help with child care, let us \nhelp with training; and all that went into welfare. I understand that \n55 percent--just a moment. CBO estimates, and this is a current \nestimate, that States will use only 80 percent of the available funding \nin 1999. States have obligated all funds, but if they do not obligate, \nthey lose any rights to the funds. So they are not going to be able to \ndraw down all the money. Frankly, I think we ought to try to do \nsomething about that. That has already been provided for. I do not know \nwhat we can do about it.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield on that last point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. DODD. We anticipated that this might be one of the arguments that \nwould be raised, and asked the Department of Health and Human Services \nto tell us exactly what the status of child care spending by the States \nis. I think this graph here states it well. My colleague from New \nMexico just pointed out that 98.8 percent of child care funds have been \nobligated, but in addition, by January of this year 90.6 percent of \nfunds had actually been spent. So the notion somehow that states are \nnot spending the available child care money is not valid. I appreciate \nthe Senator raising this point, but according to our latest data, the \nStates have already spent pretty much 90 percent of available child \ncare dollars. And they have obligated, of course, virtually 100 percent \nof it, which demonstrates, I think, a clear need out there.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, let me tell you, we are both \nright. It is just that those numbers of what HHS is telling you about \nare the moneys that the Treasury of the United States has turned over \nto be spent. But now we have to have the States literally draw them \ndown. The Congressional Budget Office is saying that they estimate that \nthe States will draw down and use only 80 percent, and there is a \nchance they will lose some money, according to what my staff says. So \nmaybe we can work on something there saying that they are extending \nsomething so they will not lose it. That might be one thing we could \nwork on.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me ask my friend, Senator Dodd, if he needs \nanother 5 minutes or so.\n  Mr. DODD. If I could. I appreciate, Mr. President, the chance to, if \nI could, take just a couple minutes to rebut.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will split the time with you.\n  Mr. DODD. I have my colleague from Illinois and the ranking member \nfrom New Jersey who would like to be heard. So I will take a couple \nminutes, if I can, and just respond.\n  Let me, first of all, thank my colleague from New Mexico for his \ngenerosity.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is the regular order, however, unless changed by UC \nthat we will start voting by 4 o'clock?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will give you half the time and keep half for myself \nand Senator Enzi.\n  Mr. DODD. Very quickly, first let me thank my colleague from New \nMexico for his generosity in providing time here, on his time, to \nrespond to his arguments.\n  They still come back to the central point. We can debate all day the \nquestion of whether or not you think we are doing enough or not enough \nfor child care.\n  I tell you again that there are waiting lists in California of \n200,000, Texas of 25,000, Florida 30,000--and in my State they don't \neven keep the waiting lists any longer. I say again that there are \nparents out there, as we sit here today, worried about where their \nchildren are. And the costs of child care, when it can be found, are \nstaggering.\n  Putting aside those issues--all I want to be able to do is at some \npoint this year, before we adjourn, is to be able to offer child care \nlegislation. I want to create a reserve account for children just like \nSenator Domenici has created for tax cuts.\n  And I would like the chance to use some of the tobacco dollars, Mr. \nPresident. There may be as much as $600 billion in tobacco funds. But \nmy good friend from New Mexico has said you cannot touch that money. \nThat money is only going to be for Medicare.\n  I do not disagree that Medicare is a priority. But if the tobacco \ncompanies for decades have targeted young people in my State of \nConnecticut and all across this country and 1,000 of the 3,000 children \nwho every day start smoking will die prematurely, I think we ought to \nbe able to take some of those moneys from tobacco and apply them to \nkids' needs in this country. I think most Medicare recipients would \ntell you they think their children and their grandchildren are \nimportant. You go ahead and ask any grandparent in this country whether \nor not they think every dollar we get from tobacco ought to go to \nMedicare. I think many of them will say that we should give something \nto our children--that they are also a priority. But unless I get this \namendment adopted here, I am not going to be able to ask that question.\n  I would like to have a debate about whether or not you think we do \ntoo much or too little in child care. But we are never going to get to \nthat debate unless this amendment is adopted.\n  This is not the time to debate child care, although I know I can make \na case for the tremendous need that exists. The question my colleagues \nhave\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\nto ask themselves is, should this body have the right to debate the \nissue of child care? Should we be allowed to go after some revenues \nthat are coming in from the tobacco resources? Yes or no?\n  If we adopt my amendment, you give me a chance to try. It does not \nguarantee me that I am going to get what I want. You may defeat me, but \nat least I get a chance to try.\n  With that, let me yield a minute or two to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 1 minute \nunder his control. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Let me say, I hope those who are listening to this debate understand \nthe issue that is at stake here. It is the care of our children. When \nSenator Domenici speaks about 4.5 percent of the Federal budget going \nto the care of our children, that is not an overwhelming percentage. \nBut I will tell you what is overwhelming, speak to the working families \nwho show up every day at day care centers struggling to pay for \nquality, safe child care. Senator Dodd understands what their concerns \nare.\n  I hope this Senate will support his effort to finally let this \nFederal Government go on record as saying, yes, let us reward work but \nlet us also care for the children. We pay a fortune when we fail with \nchildren. And we pay it every day. Let us invest some money to help \nfamilies take care of their kids and in a safe, quality setting.\n\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have the remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining. The \nSenator from Connecticut has 12 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Twelve seconds. Do you want to use your 12 seconds?\n  Mr. DODD. If you would give me 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 1 minute of mine.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is very kind. I thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his generous giving up of some time here.\n  In 1 minute, very succinctly, Mr. President, it is this: I heard our \nfriend from New Mexico talk about the proliferation of reserve funds. I \nwant to remind the Senator that he and I were part and parcel of an \nagreement to establish a major reserve fund last year in the budget \nagreement. It was designed for transportation.\n  We encouraged that process to make sure that there would be money to \ntake care of the transportation needs. We had a commitment by the \nchairman of the Finance Committee that that was an appropriate use of \nprocess, to set up a reserve fund. Well, we have a reserve fund now to \nmake sure our kids, when they grow up, are healthy and learned and \nready to take on their responsibilities. I do not mind a little reserve \nfund. I hope that the Senator's vote carries.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am kind of confused on my side for the \nmoment. I see two Senators. I yield time to Senator Enzi. I ask the \nSenator, do you want to speak on the Dodd amendment or do you want to \nspeak on another amendment?\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to speak on the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask Senator Hatch, do you want to speak 1 minute on \nthe Gregg amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. One minute on the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will give you each 1 minute on mine. I will try to go \nquicker than that.\n  The argument has now reached the point where everybody can understand \nit. Although the amendment which the Senator offered does not address \nthe reserve funds set up with the tobacco settlement money, he has \nclearly stated his case. He would like to be able to spend some of the \ntobacco settlement on his ideas on child care.\n  Even if his amendment passed, he could not do that. But let me just \ntell you what this means. This means that the Senator from Connecticut \nwants to spend tobacco settlement money on child care where the Budget \nCommittee wants to spend it on Medicare. Medicare spends $25 billion a \nyear and thus it is in default and will be bankrupt in 10 years because \nof cigarette smoking which causes illness and cancer in the seniors \ncovered.\n  The Budget Committee said the best place to use the money is to put \nit in the Medicare fund so we do not let the program go bankrupt. I \ncontinue to say that is the best place and the highest priority.\n  Today is another good example. No matter what the Government of \nAmerica is doing, we must do more. Whatever we are doing in child care, \nwe must do more. Whatever we are doing in some other area, it is not \nenough. Now we have heard that for a long time, but I believe we are \npassed that stage. I think we are in an era of balanced budgets and \nsurpluses. You will not stay there very long if you return to the day \nthat whatever the Government is spending, it is not spending enough, \nlet us have a new program.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2168\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the \namendment offered by my friend and colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg. I think it is too early in the process to talk about whether we \nare going to limit liability or not. I have never accepted any money \nfrom the tobacco companies.\n  I am not trying to help the tobacco companies. What I want is for the \nsmokers of America to realize that there is not enough money in all of \nthe assets of all of the tobacco companies to take care of the problems \nthat have already been caused. What the smokers need to be worrying \nabout is how they are going to divide up those assets to take care of \nthe health problems which have already been caused to be sure that they \nare getting a piece of the money that they have already paid in and \nwill be paying in through higher taxes.\n  We need to wait on the debate to make sure that we are debating the \nissues on liability and leaving the options open to protect those \npeople who have already been harmed by smoking and those people that \nwill be harmed by smoking.\n  As I said, Mr. President, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the \namendment offered by my friend and colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg. I have worked with the Senator from New Hampshire on the tobacco \nissue in the Labor Committee and I can appreciate his position on this \naspect of the settlement. However, I oppose this amendment because I \nbelieve it is premature for this body to decide the issue of immunity, \neven in a sense of the Senate resolution, before we have the \nopportunity to debate tobacco legislation on the Senate floor.\n  First, I would like to explain that my reasons for opposing this \namendment are not based on any desire to protect the tobacco companies \nfrom legitimate legal actions. I have explained before that I did not \naccept any money from the tobacco companies during my campaign because \nI have seen the destructive effects of cigarette smoking my entire life \nand I have never seen that smoking ever helped anyone. In short, I \noppose this amendment because it is too early in the debate to limit \nour options on the issue of liability.\n  Mr. President, let me make it very clear that we will not help one \nperson suffering from smoking-related illnesses by adopting this sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. Rather, we will send a green light to \nplaintiffs' lawyers that Congress will not stand in the way as they \nfill their retirement coffers at the expense of the smokers and the \nAmerican public.\n  By prohibiting any type of current or future immunity for the tobacco \nmanufacturers, we actually do a disservice to the very people we are \ntrying to help. If Congress is really concerned about providing long-\nterm reimbursement for people suffering from smoking-related illnesses, \nwe should look at ensuring that the money will actually go to smokers--\nnot into the pockets of trial lawyers.\n  Mr. President, I have proposed for some time that we should take a \nlook at a smokers' compensation fund, whereby individual smokers could \nbe reimbursed for their smoking-related medical expenses from an \naccount funded by payments by the tobacco companies. Such a system as \nthis\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\nwould ensure that real stakeholders in the tobacco debate--smokers \nthemselves, would receive the proceeds from any tobacco settlement. It \nwould also be a good way to help the long term solvency of both the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs by alleviating some of the burden of \nreimbursing providers for smoking-related medical expenses.\n  I understand that any such comprehensive reimbursement scheme is not \ngoing to be accomplished this year. That is why I support the efforts \nof the chairman of the Budget Committee in his efforts to ensure that \nany money received from a tobacco settlement is going to be dedicated \nto the Medicare trust fund. I applaud his efforts in ensuring that any \npossible proceeds actually be used to help pay for the smoking-related \nexpenses of Medicare beneficiaries instead of being used for any number \nof unrelated programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment. We should \nsend a message to the American people that any money from the tobacco \nsettlement should be used for smokers--not inflated legal judgments.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for the time to speak on this. I \nfully support putting that money, if we ever get it, into the Medicare \nProgram. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise in opposition to the Gregg amendment. The Gregg \namendment is an attempt to put the Senate on record against any \nliability provisions in connection with the tobacco bill now being \nformulated in the Commerce Committee.\n  True, the amendment refers to ``immunity.'' Now, I do not want to \ngive the tobacco industry and nobody else wants to give them immunity. \nNo one does. However, the term ``immunity'' is broader than the limited \nliability provisions many of us believe are key to the comprehensive \nantitobacco global settlement bill.\n  I fear many will seize upon what will be a near unanimous vote today \nto say the Senate opposes any liability provisions. That is not the \ncase. And 284 days ago, 40 courageous State Attorneys General, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, announced an agreement which should continue \nto be the basis of any legislation to curb youth smoking. It is \npredicated on large tobacco industry payments for a whole host of \nantitobacco programs, including cessation, prevention, and biomedical \nresearch.\n  I, for one, continue to believe that the best way to ensure we will \nhave the huge sums necessary to wean a generation of teens off tobacco \nis to guarantee there are industry payments. I do not believe that it \nwill be possible to attain that without endorsing the framework of the \nAG settlement which does include some liability provisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on the second-degree \namendment of Senator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for it to be in order for me to \nmake a point of order on the Dodd amendment so he can make the motion \nto waive, so that will have been accomplished, and we will, therefore, \nhave that be the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Regarding the Dodd amendment, it is not germane to the \nprovisions of the budget resolution pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of \nthe Budget Act, and I raise a point of order against the Dodd \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays on my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2168\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg, which expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should not \ngrant immunity to the tobacco companies as part of comprehensive \ntobacco legislation.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from New Hampshire for \noffering this sense of the Senate. It's a clear statement on a critical \nissue.\n  Mr. President, there is no valid reason to give the tobacco industry \nspecial protections from liability. The tobacco industry, for decades, \nhas lied to the American people. It's intentionally boosted the \naddictive power of its products to hook consumers. And, worst of all, \nit's conspired to illegally market its products to children.\n  The end result of all this fraud and deception is that millions of \nAmericans have died prematurely. Families have lost mothers. Fathers. \nGrandparents. Brothers. Sisters. And all too often, these families \nwatched helplessly as their loved ones smoked themselves to death, \nunable to break this deadly addiction.\n  Now. Mr. President, the tobacco industry is asking for a special \nfavor. They want to be shielded from liability for the harms they've \ncaused. A shield that hasn't been granted to any other industry.\n  Mr. President, why would Congress give special immunity to the \ntobacco industry, of all industries?\n  Well, the main argument you hear is that Congress must let the \nindustry off the hook because otherwise they'll keep marketing tobacco \nto our kids. It's as if the industry has a gun to our heads. Or, more \nprecisely, the heads of our children.\n  Well, Mr. President, that's an outrageous threat. And I don't think \nwe should give in to it. After all, the U.S. Government doesn't \nnegotiate with terrorists. And the same should be true for those who \nthreaten to market deadly drugs to our children.\n  I also would point out, Mr. President, that if we did give the \nindustry the broad liability restrictions that it wants, we still \nwouldn't get much in return. And it's important to understand why not.\n  The tobacco industry has said that it would be willing to give up \nadvertising to kids if we give it immunity. But the tobacco \nmanufacturers can't make an agreement on behalf of all those who might \nwant to advertise. So, instead of RJR buying ads, its distributors \ncould. Or retailers. Or anyone else. These others would not be bound by \nany agreements entered into by manufacturers.\n  It's also important to remember that many constitutional experts \nbelieve that these agreements could be ruled unenforceable. So we could \ndiscover later that we have compromised the legal rights of tobacco \nvictims, and gained absolutely nothing in the process.\n  Mr. President, instead of giving special breaks to the tobacco \nindustry, Congress should be developing legislation that keeps our kids \naway from tobacco. That helps adults kick the habit. And that saves \nlives.\n  We need legislation that will increase the price of cigarettes to at \nleast $1.50 per pack--as the Budget Committee agreed, in a bipartisan \nvote.\n  We need legislation to give FDA the authority to regulate tobacco as \na drug. Legislation to fund anti-teen smoking programs, smoking \ncessation programs, counter advertising, and other anti-tobacco \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. President, there's no reason to give the tobacco industry veto \nrights over that kind of legislation. None.\n  Mr. President, this is the Senate of the United States of America. \nAnd our job is to do what is right for the American people. It is to do \nwhat we can to save lives. And if the tobacco industry doesn't like \nit--frankly, that's too bad.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. Let's not give \nthe tobacco industry a special handout. This is an industry that has \nlied to the American people. It's an industry that's directly \nresponsible for the deaths of millions of Americans. And they should be \nheld accountable. There just is no excuse for letting them off the \nhook.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The question is on agreeing to \nthe Gregg second-degree amendment No. 2168.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two \namendments be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are laid \naside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't think we have anything further by unanimous \nconsent. By virtue of the list we have, the next amendment is Senator \nKyl's. That will be followed by a Democratic amendment yet to be \nchosen.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask the manager if we can take a \ncouple of minutes to lay down some amendments here--I think people have \nhad a chance to look at them and know what they are--so that we are in \nthe order to be considered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the Senator talking about the two amendments we had \nagreed we were going to dispose of by Senator Burns and Senator Kerry?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have the two that were cleared by Senator Burns \nand Senator Kerry. We can do those. I was talking about in advance of \nSenator Kyl's amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator have more amendments?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have two we would like to lay down on behalf of \nsome of our Members here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \nthat purpose.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be called up and set aside for disposition in a \nsequence that would be agreed to by the managers. There are four first-\ndegree amendments and one second-degree amendment. We have an amendment \non behalf of Senator Hollings which concerns Social Security, a \nLautenberg amendment, a Conrad second-degree amendment, a Lautenberg \namendment on the environment, and a Boxer amendment on education. I ask \nunanimous consent that these be accepted at the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I am not \nobjecting on the basis that the second-degree amendment alluded to is \nnot automatically called up as a second-degree amendment to the \namendment suggested, because I believe we will have an opportunity, \neven if we have to have the majority leader here, to offer the second-\ndegree amendment before it is offered on that side. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree amendment will not be a part \nof the unanimous consent agreement if the Senator from New Mexico \nobjects to it. If the Senator accepts the unanimous consent agreement \nas propounded----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I didn't think it was a unanimous-consent request. I \nobject. I have no objection to the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The four first-degree amendments----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They are just going to be pending like the other \namendments, as I understand it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in the interest of moving the program \nalong, we will eliminate the Conrad second-degree amendment at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 2193 through 2195, en bloc\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Kyl.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2169\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are now back on amendment No. 2169. That \namendment is a sense of the Congress, and it is very simple. I will \nread the operative clause:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that seniors have the right to \n     see the physician or health care provider of their choice and \n     not be limited in such right by the imposition of such \n     unreasonable conditions on providers who are willing to treat \n     seniors on a private basis, and that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that legislation will be enacted to assure this right.\n\n  It is that simple, Mr. President. Senior citizens should not be \ndiscriminated against because when they turn 65 they are eligible to \nreceive Medicare. Unfortunately, the administration has taken the \nposition that eligibility to receive Medicare is exclusive; that is to \nsay, that it's either Medicare or no care, that a senior citizen has no \nright to be treated outside of Medicare for Medicare-covered services. \nHow could we be in that situation in the United States of America, \nwhere the Government provides a good program for senior citizens which, \nin most cases, is going to be precisely what they want to take \nadvantage of, but it says to them that, if there is some reason why you \nmight want to privately contract and pay the bill yourself, you can't \ndo that.\n  Here is the history of it, Mr. President. For over 20 years during \nthe time Medicare has been in force, senior citizens have had the right \neither to go to the physician of their choice and have him submit a \nbill to Medicare or, if they choose, to be treated outside of Medicare \nand not submit the bill. There are some people who have not wanted \ntheir records to be part of the official Government archive.\n  They may have psychiatric problems, for example, and they didn't want \nto have their treatment be a part of Medicare and they were willing to \npay the bill themselves. That is just one example.\n  But recently HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, began \ntaking the view that that was illegal and began sending letters to \nphysicians threatening them with prosecution if they treated patients \noutside of Medicare. So, as part of the Balanced Budget Act, I offered \nan amendment which prevailed on an overwhelming vote here last year \nthat citizens did, in fact, have the right to privately contract--a \nvery straightforward proposition.\n  During the last-minute negotiations of the Balanced Budget Act, \nhowever, the administration representatives convinced whoever was \nnegotiating on our side that the President would veto the entire \nBalanced Budget Act if the Kyl amendment stayed in, and it was changed, \npursuant to the administration's request, to provide that while the \nright of the senior citizen existed, it could only be exercised by a \nphysician who, in advance, dumped all of his Medicare patients for a \nperiod of 2 years. That is obviously an unreasonable requirement. Very \nfew, if any, physicians are going to do that. So, as a practical \nmatter, the right of senior citizens to go to a physician of their \nchoice under Medicare was eliminated.\n  We have not yet offered legislation for a vote here which would \nreverse that. But this is the first opportunity we have had, so we \npresent to the Senate a sense of the Senate, as part of the budget \nresolution, which says that senior citizens should have this right. \nThen, when the opportune time comes, we will be offering the \nlegislation which has already been introduced and has 49 cosponsors in \nthe Senate, and 190 cosponsors in the House of Representatives, a bill \nsponsored by the Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer called \nthe Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. That legislation, \nwhich, as I say, has 49 cosponsors here and 190 in the House already, \nwill be offered, so we will have the opportunity to actually change the \nlaw. But pending that, this presents the principle that seniors ought \nto have this freedom to contract.\n  Our resolution, by the way, is sponsored by Senator Hollings, Senator \nLott, Senator Frist, Senator Gramm, Senator Domenici, Senator Stevens, \nSenator Gorton--the Presiding Officer--and, as I say, 49 Members total.\n  Let me give an example of a specific situation which came to my \nattention. One of my constituents from Prescott, AZ--a relatively small \ntown--has a severe case of diabetes. She went to a physician who said, \n``I am sorry, I am not taking any Medicare patients, so I cannot take \ncare of you.'' He was the only specialist, really, in the small \ncommunity who could care for her.\n  Why is it, by the way, that some physicians are in that position? We \nknow that Medicare reimburses at such a low rate--the average is 70 \ncents on the dollar of cost--that many physicians simply cannot take \nall Medicare patients. So they have to draw the line and not take any \nbeyond a certain point.\n  In any event, she said, ``That's fine, bill me directly, and I will \nbe happy to pay.'' He said, ``Medicare will prosecute me for fraud if I \ndo that.'' And that is\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\nwhat we are trying to fix here. There are a lot of situations where \npeople may wish to go to the doctor of their choice and be treated \noutside of Medicare.\n\n  I know of a situation in which I helped a constituent obtain a \ncompassionate release from FDA so that constituent could take an \nexperimental drug to treat her for cancer. The reason is that her \nhusband was willing to go to any lengths, to do anything, to preserve \nher life. She ended up dying, but I think her case is illustrative of \nwhat every one of us would do in her husband's position. If we had the \nmoney, if we had the ability, we would go to any length to do anything \nto save our loved one's life. That is what is being denied American \ncitizens today.\n  Believe it or not, the socialized medicine system in Great Britain \nallows patients this choice. They can either be treated under their \nsocialized medicine system or they can go to a private physician and \npay the bill themselves. But here in the United States of America, once \nyou turn 65, you lose that right. This amendment simply expresses the \nsense of Congress that that should not be the case. The seniors here \nshould have the freedom of choice. That right should not be limited by \nany unreasonable conditions placed upon providers.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to present these \nviews. I would love to hear from anyone who would like to speak in \nopposition to this principle that senior citizens should have the right \nto privately contract. I invite anyone who is in opposition to present \nthose views here, because I would love to debate that, as I said. \nConstituents all over this country are writing in and calling me \nsaying, this is outrageous; please reestablish this right.\n  So I am going to cease my presentation now since we are limited in \nthe amount of time we have. I reserve whatever time we have to respond \nto anyone who is willing to come defend the proposition that senior \ncitizens should not have the right to privately contract in the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. President, observing no other Members on the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Also, that the Kyl amendment may be temporarily \nlaid aside so I may speak to an amendment I introduced early this \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2180\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I sent an amendment to the desk \nearlier today to modify my original amendment numbered 2180. This \namendment simply provides an exception for federally funded research \nprojects being conducted on marijuana. This is to ensure that the \nNational Institute of Drug Abuse at NIH and other agencies may continue \ntheir important research on the long-term effects of drug use, and \npossible alternatives to the persistent use of marijuana.\n  This amendment addresses an issue which has become a great concern to \nme and to many in my State--legalization of marijuana for medical use. \nWhile this is simply a sense of the Senate to prohibit the use of \nFederal funds for medical use of marijuana, I intend to work with my \ncolleagues on legislation on this issue following the budget \nresolution. While this is not a new issue for the State of Arizona, or \nfor the State of California, which have already passed laws and put \nthem in place following the passage of Proposition 215, there are other \nStates, including Oregon, Maine, Alaska, Nevada, Florida, and the \nDistrict of Columbia, which are facing similar ballot measure \nproposals.\n\n  In my State of Oregon alone, five ballot measures have been proposed \nwhich would legalize the use of marijuana in varying degrees, from an \noutright legalization of the drug to legalization for medical purposes. \nCalifornia and Arizona have already passed legislation legalizing \nmedical use of marijuana and are already experiencing the adverse \neffects on their communities. In California, for instance, the law has \nbecome almost impossible to enforce, as the law enforcement community \nhas had difficult times suppressing illegal marijuana use and its sale. \nWith the opening of ``pot cafes'' in that State, it is impossible to \nprove whether patrons are there for medicinal or recreational use.\n  At a time when illegal drug abuse is on the rise, legalizing the use \nof marijuana in any form, medical or recreational, sends a mixed signal \nat best to our children, particularly when there are prescription drugs \nin the marketplace such as Marinol.\n  While the effectiveness of these prescription drugs is varied, I \nbelieve it is our responsibility to encourage a healthy alternative to \nmarijuana that is effective, safe, and can be regulated like any other \nprescription drug in the marketplace. I would be interested in working \nwith any of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have an \ninterest in this issue, particularly those who want to keep drugs, such \nas marijuana, out of the reach of our children.\n  In a study released by the National Institute of Drug Abuse at NIH, \nmarijuana is noted as the most commonly used drug in America. In fact, \n18 million Americans used it last year alone. In fact, smoking \nmarijuana over a long term has the same damaging effects on the brain \nas long-term use of cocaine and heroin and produces the same lung \ndamage and potential cancer risk as smoking cigarettes, even though \nmarijuana smokers smoke less.\n  Perhaps even more disturbing is that the National Institute of Drug \nAbuse also reported that 23 percent of all eighth graders in the United \nStates used marijuana in 1996 and that marijuana use overall has \nsteadily increased since 1993.\n  Mr. President, while this is a sense of the Senate and it is only a \nstart, I believe this is our opportunity to voice our opposition to \nthese efforts to legalize the use of marijuana in our States. Through \nthese laws, we are proceeding down a dangerous path by sending a mixed \nsignal to our children that marijuana use is an acceptable alternative. \nIt is not. It is dangerous. It is deadly.\n  I thank the Chair and encourage my colleagues to adopt this \namendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2169\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, are we now back on the Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I hope that Senator Richard Bryan \nfrom Nevada is on the way to the floor as I speak. I speak in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  I need to point out that Medicare beneficiaries did not ask for this \nso-called ``new right.'' This is a proposal which is written to, \nfrankly, charge seniors more money. That comment can be thrown around \nand thrown around very glibly when one is trying to make a populist \npoint. On the other hand, therefore, it is true--and it has to be said \nin that manner--92 percent of beneficiaries are satisfied or, in fact, \nvery satisfied with the availability of care under the Medicare Program \nnow.\n  It is this Senator's belief that fraud and abuse in the Medicare \nProgram will increase very substantially if private contracting is \nallowed to occur. The Congressional Budget Office has this to say about \nthe Kyl-Archer bill:\n\n       HCFA's efforts to screen inappropriate or fraudulent claims \n     could be significantly compromised because it would be \n     difficult to evaluate episodes of care with gaps where \n     services were directly contracted--\n\n  A very complicated way of saying a rather easy thing. It would not be \nvery easy to track this:\n\n       Without adequate regulatory oversight, unethical providers \n     could bill Medicare while also collecting from directly-\n     contracted patients.\n\n  In other words, they could collect twice from Medicare and the \npatient.\n\n  The bill would almost certainly raise national health spending.\n\n  The Government Accounting Office.\n  Private contracting, further, Mr. President, is not about the freedom \nof choice, as some of our friends from across the aisle would have us \nbelieve. The effort to privately contract is really, as I indicated \nmuch earlier, about\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\nmoney. Seniors have freedom of choice now.\n  You can make a very, very good case that the strength of Medicare is \nbased upon an original concept that no longer exists, and that is one \ngigantic pool. Because everybody is in that pool, almost like the \noriginal Blue Cross, Medicare wins money on some, loses on others, but \nin the end everything tends to wash out evenly.\n  Seniors now are given many options. I participated in one of the \noptions myself, the PSO amendment, which I did with Senator Bill Frist, \nand it was successful. But all this does not indicate, therefore, that \nseniors do not have the freedom of choice now. They do. They can go in \nmany directions, and that is increasing all the time. They can see any \ndoctor they want now, and they have adequate protections that the \nMedicare Program has and is providing them.\n  The proposal to privately contract is opposed by the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, the American College of Physicians, the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens, Families USA, et cetera, and that \nis not really the point, is it? Because one can always find groups that \nare for or against something.\n  While private contracting may be a good deal for doctors, it really \nis not necessarily a very good deal for beneficiaries, and that becomes \nimportant in the Medicare communities. Seniors would pay 100 percent of \nthe bill when they privately contract. That is the way it would work--a \nlarge price tag for services that Medicare would otherwise cover.\n  Private contracting would cripple Medicare's ability to hold down \nhealth care costs and would put elderly and disabled citizens at \nserious financial and medical risk. Under the Kyl-Archer bill, doctors \ncan charge whatever they want for a Medicare-covered service. One would \nask, why would one want to do that? The Kyl-Archer bill would allow \ndoctors to give priority, frankly, to wealthy patients who are willing \nand able to pay out of pocket.\n  My wife and I recently had an event--not serious--with our 18-year-\nold son. We took our son to six different physicians, most of them \nspecialists. So when I say this, I say this in the context of an \nenormous regard for physicians and for the field and for the fact that \nour 18-year-old son wants to become a physician himself. Nevertheless, \nit is an incentive for doctors to go to those who are able to pay and \nget them to pay out of their pocket and pay more.\n  In a February 23, 1998, letter from the GAO--which I believe is \nfairly broadly respected around here--to Senator Moynihan, the GAO's \nfindings do not support Senator Kyl's sense-of-the-Senate amendment. \nSenator Kyl's amendment, for example, reads, according to the GAO, \n``most seniors are denied this right (to obtain health care from \nphysicians or providers of their choice) by current restrictions on \ntheir health care choices.''\n  Again, a denial of choice argument.\n  The GAO letter to Senator Moynihan reads:\n       Nearly all physicians treat Medicare patients and accept \n     new patients covered by Medicare. Recent data from the AMA \n     indicate that 96.2 percent of all non-Federal physicians \n     treated Medicare beneficiaries in 1996. Moreover, the \n     percentage of physicians treating Medicare patients has \n     increased--from 95.2 percent in 1995 and 94.2 percent in \n     1994--over the last 2 years.\n\n  A 1-percent increase. It simply shows the direction of more \nphysicians treating Medicare patients.\n  Again, the GAO says:\n\n       According to the recent reports from PPRC, ``access for \n     most [fee-for-service] beneficiaries remains excellent and . \n     . . measures of access are essentially unchanged from \n     previous years.''\n\n  In closing, Mr. President, I wish to make this statement. Much has \nbeen made of the United Seniors Association, which is a conservative \nfundraising arm of the Republican Party, in fact, and is the No. 1 \nsupporter of the Kyl private contracting amendment. But then again, \nthose things happen, too. I will say when Chairman Roth of the Senate \nFinance Committee heard their testimony, he said, ``I just want to make \nit clear that those kinds of statements are not satisfactory to this \nchairman.'' And he was not at that point a particularly happy chairman.\n  At the beginning of the Kyl amendment, frankly, there were some of us \nwho were very, very concerned because there were 47 cosponsors, \nincluding one Democrat. There has been a lot of emphasis, I think, in \nthe last number of weeks to try to get this to be a better-understood \nproposition. In fact, I think now people are beginning to understand \nthat this is not necessary, and there is a way for physicians to be \nable to charge Medicare beneficiaries more, and, in a sense, if a \nMedicare beneficiary is in a very sick condition or bad condition, how \nare they able to negotiate in the first place? I think the Senate would \ndo best to simply send this sense of the Senate underground.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I yield myself 8 minutes off the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 8 minutes off the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from West Virginia, for his analysis of this issue. He is one \nof the real experts on Medicare and Medicaid and is very much involved \nin the subcommittee of the Finance Committee dealing with all of these \nissues. He brings a very sound perspective to this issue. His comments \nidentified the weaknesses of the Kyl proposal and also what are the \ndangers for so many of our senior citizens. I hope that our colleagues \npay close attention to his words.\n  I join in urging the Senate to oppose the Kyl amendment and defeat \nthis attempt to undermine Medicare by eliminating the protections in \ncurrent law that prevent doctors from overcharging senior citizens. \nThis is not a ``freedom of choice'' amendment for patients; it is a \n``freedom to price gouge'' amendment for physicians, and it deserves to \nbe rejected by the Senate.\n\n  Medicare patients already have freedom of choice. In fact, because \nMedicare is one of the only insurance programs that still offers a true \nfee-for-service option, senior citizens generally have more choices in \nhealth care than other citizens, including those of us in the Senate.\n  According to a February 23 report from the General Accounting Office, \nthe information available to us indicates that Medicare beneficiaries \nhave ready access to physicians. The report emphasizes the high \nparticipation rate in Medicare by physicians. Ninety-six percent of all \nthe doctors accept and treat Medicare patients.\n  The report also emphasizes that few Medicare patients have problems \nin obtaining health care. Only 4 percent report difficulty in finding a \nphysician. This does not appear to be due to the reimbursement levels. \nThe GAO found reimbursement levels for physicians under Medicare are \nadequate and do not jeopardize access to health care for senior \ncitizens.\n  The Kyl amendment is no answer to the problems of Medicare. It will \nonly make those problems worse. The freedom it proposes is the freedom \nto exploit senior citizens and the freedom to dismantle the fundamental \nguarantee of affordable health care for the elderly that has served \nAmerican senior citizens well for so many years.\n  Senior citizens deserve affordable health care provided by Medicare, \nand that they have earned through a lifetime of hard work and service \nto this country. The Kyl amendment takes the choice out of the hands of \nthe vast majority of senior citizens and puts it in the hands of the \ndoctors. That is the key flaw in the Kyl amendment.\n  Who is going to be making the decision? Is it going to be the \npatient, or is it going to be the provider? The patient already has \nthat kind of freedom today. If they want to indicate that they do not \nwant their doctor to bill the Medicare system, then they can go ahead \nand pay if they want to. They have that opportunity to do so.\n  That is not what the Kyl amendment is about. The Kyl amendment puts \nthe power in the hands of the doctors. If such legislation were to \npass, doctors would be free to charge unlimited fees and patients would \nbe free to pay them. Some freedom. Some choice.\n  Medicare works well for patients and physicians alike. Senior \ncitizens are\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\nfree to chose their doctor and are free to self-pay if they desire. \nPhysicians must abide by limits on what they can charge for services \ncovered by Medicare, which means that senior citizens know they cannot \nbe overcharged.\n  In addition, because Medicare covers the basic services, but not all \nservices, the elderly are free to pay out of pocket for services not \ncovered by Medicare. If they are able to afford it and they want to pay \nprivately for Medicare-covered service, they can do that too by asking \nthe doctor not to submit a claim. If the patient wants to pay the \ndoctor, and pay the doctor more, and pay the doctor an exorbitant \namount, the patient is free to do so now at the present time and not \nhave them submit the claim to Medicare.\n  This was the case before the Balanced Budget Act was enacted last \nyear, and it is the case today. The current system works and works \nwell. This aspect of Medicare is not broken, and it does not need to be \nfixed. The only fix the Kyl amendment provides is the authority for \ndoctors to fix the higher prices than Medicare allows.\n  Current law favors the patient by guaranteeing that it is the patient \nwho initiates actions to pay outside of Medicare. Medicare's balanced \nbilling limits continue to apply. The patients have the choice. They \nare the ones who can initiate or end the private transaction. The power \nis in the hands of the patient. That is where it should be. The Kyl \namendment gives that choice to the physician. That is the serious \nmistake that would jeopardize Medicare coverage for large numbers of \nsenior citizens.\n  The reality is that in a number of instances the patient will ask the \ndoctor not to submit the claim or the bill under Medicare. These are \nprimarily in the cases of mental health and substance abuse where the \nindividual, for any number of reasons, fears what might happen to them \nin the job market or because it might make it more difficult or complex \nin terms of other different personal reasons and chooses to pay \nthemselves and tells the doctor, ``Look, don't bill Medicare. I'll pay \nyou. I'll pay you.'' That happens today. It is not widely advertised, \nnot widely proclaimed, but it happens today. That goes on, and the \nMedicare system respects that.\n  But that isn't what this is about. This is about where the doctor \nsays to the patient who is in that doctor's office and needs help and \nassistance, ``Look, you're not going to effectively get it''--it might \nbe a little smoother than this, but the message is going to be clear--\n``unless you're going to pay me whatever I say.'' Now, that is the \nbeginning of the end. That is something that we have guarded against \nover a long period of time, and we should not open up those gates \ntoday.\n  Congress should not imperil the financial security of 38 million \nsenior citizens. Congress should not take the money out of the pockets \nof the elderly and put it in the bank accounts of wealthy physicians. \nThat is what this issue is really about. Simply put, who is going to be \nthe one who is going to make the decision? Is it going to be the \npatient, which I think all of us feel is the way that it should go, and \nit is that way at the present time, or is it going to be the physician \nwho is going to be making that judgment, looking into the eyes of a \nsick patient, virtually at the will of the physician, when they have \nthat illness and sickness and are told, ``Look, if you want my \ntreatment, if you want to be treated by me, it's going to cost you a \nbundle.'' That we have guarded against over a long period of time. It \nis a key element in terms of the whole guarantee of quality, good care \nfor our senior citizens, and we should not alter and change that \nparticular protection now.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the remarks of the \nSenator from Massachusetts, and perhaps those of the Senator from West \nVirginia as well.\n  First of all, let me clarify something. The Senator from \nMassachusetts says that this is the ``freedom to price gouge'' and the \n``freedom to exploit.'' In so saying, the Senator misrepresents \nsignificantly the amendment, or the bill that Representative Archer and \nI have introduced, which has a variety of provisions specifically \ndesigned to prevent fraud and abuse.\n  The only thing that we have before us here today is the sense-of-the-\nCongress resolution. I draw the Senator's attention to some of the \nprovisions on page 2 which specifically set forth the requirements that \nwould protect against fraud and abuse. In other words, what we are \nsaying is that this freedom to choose must--and I am quoting now from \nthe amendment that we are debating--must include provisions that ``are \nsubject to stringent fraud and abuse law, including the Medicare \nantifraud provisions in the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996.''\n  Now, if those are not good enough, then perhaps we ought to be \nchanging the existing law. But we are going to actually have more \nstringent fraud and abuse provisions than the existing law has. So I \nreally in a sense resent the suggestion that there is nothing in here \nthat prevents fraud and abuse. This legislation has more antifraud and \nabuse provisions than existing law.\n  Second point. The Senator from Massachusetts says that only 4 \npercent, according to a study, only 4 percent of seniors have \ndifficulty getting their health care under Medicare. Well, by my \ncalculation that is ``only'' 1,360,000 seniors. That is a lot of \nseniors.\n  The truth of the matter is most seniors will take advantage of \nMedicare. It is a good deal. We hope that will continue to be the case. \nBut for those few who choose to contract privately, why deny them that \nright? The GAO study cited by the Senator from Massachusetts says, ``If \ndirect contracting continued to be rarely used''--and I say ``continued \nto be'' because the right does exist today--``there would be no changes \nin the benefit payments, no additional difficulties in combating fraud \nand abuse, and no major new administrative burdens placed on HCFA.''\n  So if it is not a problem, then why oppose this amendment? GAO says \nit would not be a problem. And, in fact, the Senator proves too much by \nthe last point that he made. He said, actually it is the case today \nthat if a patient wants to ask the doctor not to submit a claim, the \ndoctor does not have to do that and therefore we already have this so \nwe do not need the Kyl amendment--to which there are two responses. \nFirst of all, if current law already provides this, then why does the \nSenator object to the mere statement of the principle that the choice \nshould exist? If the Senator is happy with existing law, he can't very \nwell oppose the principle that simply restates existing law.\n  I again quote from what we are debating. It is frequently helpful to \ndo that. All the sense-of-the-Senate provides is, and I quote, ``It is \nthe sense of Congress that seniors have the right to see the physician \nor health care provider of their choice, and not be limited in such \nright by the imposition of unreasonable conditions on providers who are \nwilling to treat seniors on a private basis. . .''\n  Does the Senator oppose that principle? The Senator suggests that \nthat is already existing law. If so, then what is the problem? The \ntruth, however, Mr. President, is that it is not existing law. As a \nmatter of fact, the Senator from Massachusetts cannot cite either a \nstatute or a regulation which says that this is existing law, because \nit is not. HCFA will quietly tell you that they would not mind if a \npatient did that, but they do not want to advertise it and there is no \nlegal authority for it.\n  The truth of the matter is that, as the GAO pointed out, it has \nalways been the case up until January 1, 1998, that patients had this \nright to privately contract. You have all of the great concerns about \nfraud and abuse that have been articulated by the Senator from West \nVirginia and the Senator from Massachusetts, but I have never heard of \none single case--and I would be delighted if the Senator could cite \none--where in the past 20 years, since this right did exist until \nJanuary 1 of this year, there was fraud and abuse as a result of this. \nI know of none.\n  So, Mr. President, I will make one final point. The Senator from West \nVirginia is not on the floor, but he made the point that this isn't \ngood for Medicare beneficiaries. I suggest, that goes to the heart of \nthis debate. Who decides what is good for the beneficiaries? \nWashington, DC, bureaucrats or the\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\nbeneficiaries? Let the beneficiaries decide.\n  As the GAO points out, if most beneficiaries do not take advantage of \nthis freedom to contract--and I doubt that they will--then there is no \nproblem. But let them make the decision. We should not be making the \ndecision that they do not have the right even if they desire to \nexercise it.\n  I think it is pretty hard to argue with the proposition that patients \nshould have this freedom of choice. And I have not heard anything yet \nthat persuades me that this is not a good amendment.\n  I again urge my colleagues to support it. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in respectful opposition to the amendment of my \nfriend, the junior Senator from Arizona. Although this amendment is \ndressed in the robes of patient choice, in my view it dramatically \nchanges the nature of the Medicare system and now, for the first time \nin more than three decades of Medicare experience, would give to the \nphysician the ability to determine how much a Medicare patient pays for \nMedicare-covered services. I believe it is a prescription for disaster \nfor the Medicare system and for the patient himself or herself.\n  Let me put this in some context, if I may. For 30 years-plus Medicare \npatients have come to their physician and have known with reasonable \ncertainty what kind of financial expectation they are required to pay \nin order to receive Medicare-covered benefits. This amendment would \nchange that and allow the physician to make that determination.\n\n  No. 2, we are plagued in the Medicare system today with fraud that \nsome estimate may exceed $20 billion a year. I believe that this change \nwould make it more complicated in addressing the problems of fraud that \nthe system confronts.\n  And, finally, for the Medicare patient himself or herself, I think it \ninjects a notion of uncertainty and confusion when that Medicare \npatient goes to the physician.\n  Let me put this in some context, as I understand it, so we can talk \nabout what is not involved here. Since the inception of Medicare, and \ncontinuing beyond the 1998 balanced budget agreement for noncovered \nMedicare services--that would be, for example, plastic surgery--a \nMedicare patient has always had the right to enter into a private \ncontractual arrangement with the physician of his or her choice. That \nis the history. That was unchanged by the balanced budget agreement of \n1997, and it continues to be the law today.\n  With respect to a Medicare-covered service, such as a diagnostic test \nin which Medicare pays for only one or two of those diagnostic tests, \nif a Medicare patient is uncertain as to the kind of advice he or she \nis getting as a consequence of that test, it has always been the case \nthat if a second or third or fourth opinion is sought by the Medicare \npatient, that Medicare patient has the right to enter into a private \ncontractual arrangement with the physician of his or her choice. That \nhas been true historically. That was true prior to the balanced budget \nagreement and remains the case as well.\n  Thirdly, this applies to part B Medicare, so we are not talking about \nthe trust fund. For an individual who is philosophically opposed or for \nwhatever reason chooses not to be a part of Medicare part B, that is \nhis or her absolute choice. No one is required to participate or to pay \nthat premium. And that is true with the physician as well.\n  What I apprehend will occur here is a rather dramatic change in the \nMedicare system. A Medicare patient goes to a physician, and the \nMedicare physician says, ``Look, there are three or four procedures \nwhich I believe you need. With respect to three of those procedures, \nI'm satisfied that the Medicare reimbursement schedule is adequate. As \nto the fourth, I will need additional compensation in order to provide \nthat service.''\n  The net effect of all of that, I respectfully submit, is that no \nMedicare patient, going to his or her doctor's office, will know with \ncertainty what the financial expectation will be of that Medicare \npatient. That changes the system rather dramatically.\n  For more than three decades, to the best of my ability, there has \nbeen no private contracting between Medicare patient and physician with \nrespect to covered service. My distinguished colleague may be right \nthat there may not be carved in stone any legal prescription, but that \nindeed has been the practice. And 96 percent of physicians in America \ncover and treat Medicare patients. So I think we ought to give a \nconsiderable reflection to what is at issue here.\n  My distinguished friend and colleague offered in the balanced budget \namendment an amendment which was ultimately fashioned into law. That \nprovided, for the first time, an opportunity for a physician who wants \nto enter into a private contractual arrangement with a Medicare patient \nto do so.\n  If the Medicare physician chooses to do so, then that Medicare \nphysician may not have other Medicare patients for a period of 2 years. \nThat was, in effect, an opening, if you will. That provided an expanded \nopportunity which did not heretofore exist.\n  There are some groups who I think have been irresponsible in \ncharacterizing that as a limitation. That is not the case, as I \nunderstand it.\n  I simply say to my colleagues, the Medicare system is not perfect. \nThere are certainly some things which we need to do, and, indeed, the \nMedicare Commission has been formed for that purpose. Hopefully, it \nwill come with some bipartisan recommendations. But I do not believe we \nwill want to change dramatically the nature of that system which does \nhave certainty; namely, a fee schedule for reimbursement to a physician \nfor Medicare-covered services. That has been the hallmark of the \nMedicare system. That will change rather dramatically if the proposal \nwhich my friend from Arizona offers is accepted, and would allow not \nthe patient, but the physician, to make that judgment.\n  Most of us, when we go to our physician, even those of us who might \nbe described as being in the ``pre-Medicare age''--that is, we are not \nquite eligible for Medicare services--approach the annual visit to our \nphysician with some trepidation. A physician has the ability to say, \n``Look, that condition that you have is terminal.'' So there is some \napprehension, some ill at ease, no matter how many times you have been \nto a doctor. When you are in that context, it is not a level playing \nfield, and the doctor saying to you, ``Look, I no longer accept this \nrate of reimbursement from Medicare which I previously accepted,'' \nplaces, in my view, the patient at a decided disadvantage in dealing \nwith that physician and is more likely than not to say, ``Well, all \nright, I will agree to pay.''\n  As I indicated previously, if there are two or three Medicare \nservices that the patient requires, the confusion of, ``I will accept \nMedicare reimbursement for two of the services but not a third,'' I \nthink leaves the patient in a very confused situation.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. Let's all work \ntogether as a result of the Medicare Commission and see what kind of \nchanges we need to make to improve the system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  I don't know what the time allocation is. I believe Senator \nLautenberg is in charge of our side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 8 minutes to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague and friend.\n  The great philosopher Kris Kristofferson once said, ``Freedom is just \nanother word for nothing left to lose.'' I believe those were actually \nsung or spoken by the late, great Janice Joplin.\n  This amendment characterized as the Freedom of Health Care Choice for \nMedicare Seniors, on its face, appears to be a positive addition to the \nMedicare system. You would think if you proposed, as the Senator from \nArizona does, that we will give more freedom to Medicare seniors--more \nfreedom--that you would just guess that the major senior organizations \nfrom around the country would be unified in support of this amendment. \nIn fact, they are unified in opposition to this amendment.\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\n So there might be more to this amendment than freedom. There is \nsomething to lose in this amendment.\n\n  Let me get down to the bottom line of what all this debate is about. \nThis debate is about whether a Medicare senior going into a doctor's \noffice is going to have to pay according to an established Medicare \nschedule or whether that doctor can charge more. So it is whether the \ndoctor--some doctors have the freedom to charge some seniors more for \nservices. You might argue that that is necessary if there is a shortage \nof doctors providing benefits to Medicare seniors. But, lo and behold, \n96 percent of doctors are already providing benefits to Medicare \nseniors. So virtually all of the doctors, 96 percent of them \nnationwide, have signed on. They are prepared to treat Medicare seniors \nand to be paid according to the fee schedule.\n  What is at stake here is not about doctors in service but, rather, \nwhether or not some doctors can charge more. What will this mean to us \nwhen we reach the Medicare eligibility age, which is creeping up on \nmany of us, or our parents, or grandparents? It may mean before you \nhave a chance--if the amendment of the Senator from Arizona prevails, \nbefore you have a chance to talk to your doctor about your problem, if \nyou are a Medicare senior with this new ``freedom,'' first you will \nhave to talk to the accountant in the office, who is going to want to \nknow a little bit about your salary, your net worth, and how much they \ncan charge you for the benefits they will provide. For some, that may \nbe freedom. From where I am standing, that is not freedom. In fact, it \nrestricts the rights which seniors already have.\n  I think we ought to take a look at this amendment for what it really \ndoes. Private contracting sounds good on its face, unless you \nunderstand what you lose in the process of private contracting. In this \nsituation, it means for seniors that instead of knowing what they pay \nwhen they go to the doctor's office, it really is going to be an \nuncertainty; they won't know. They will walk into the office uncertain \nwhether that doctor will charge considerably more than they might have \nexpected. That is the reason every seniors group--the AARP, the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens, Families USA, and others--have \ncome out in opposition to this amendment.\n  I might also add that there have been groups, one group in \nparticular, which is called the United Seniors Association, which is \nsending mailings to seniors and would-be seniors. Lo and behold, I \nended up on their mailing list. They were writing on behalf of this \namendment's concept. I don't believe they were authorized by the \nSenator from Arizona. I am sure they were not. But they are, \nunfortunately, spreading some rather alarming news to seniors across \nAmerica.\n  Listen to what it says on the front of the envelope sent to my home \nin Springfield, Il:\n\n       Mr. and Mrs. Richard Durbin: As of January 1998, our \n     government for the first time ever will stop everyone over \n     age 64 from getting lifesaving medical treatment.\n\n  If you receive this and you are a senior, or close to it, boy, you \nwill open it up in a hurry. What you find in here is a total \nmisrepresentation of the Medicare system as it currently exists. The \nMedicare system in America is a very successful medical system. It is \ntrue that we will need to deal with the fact that the cost of health \ncare continues to go up and our resources to pay for it are not \nmatching that, but the bottom line is from the viewpoint of parties. \nThey are happy with the system. They are content with the care they are \nreceiving. They don't want Members of Congress, House or the Senate, \nmeddling with the basic Medicare system. This amendment, this so-called \nprivate contracting freedom amendment, meddles with the system in a way \nthat most seniors are not going to be happy with.\n\n  Some doctors will, because they can charge more. But for a lot of \nseniors, we will find them really disadvantaged. For 38 million \nAmericans who rely on the system, I think it would be a serious mistake \nfor us to adopt this amendment. As a matter of fact, Senator Chafee and \nI will be offering an amendment at a later time in this debate which I \nthink more correctly addresses the feelings that I hope more Members of \nthe Senate share about the future of the Medicare system. In that \namendment, we say as a sense of Congress that the assumptions \nunderlying the functional totals in this budget resolution assume that \nseniors have the right to affordable, high-quality health care, and \nthey have the right to choose their doctors, and no change should be \nmade to the Medicare Program that could impose unreasonable and \nunpredictable out-of-pocket costs for seniors or erode their benefits.\n  If the Senator from Arizona prevails with his amendment, we cannot \nmake that claim, because the benefits provided to seniors will be \nunpredictable in cost. Each doctor can decide how much more they want \nto charge.\n  We also say in our resolution that we don't want to compromise the \nefforts of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to screen \ninappropriate or fraudulent claims for reimbursement and, finally, to \nallow unscrupulous providers under the program to bill twice for the \nsame services. Senator Chafee and I will offer this later during the \ncourse of the debate. I hope my colleagues, Democrat and Republicans, \nwill join us in supporting it.\n  In closing, let me say I know the Senator from Arizona is firm in his \nbelief that this would be a solid addition to the Medicare system. I \nhappen to think the system as it currently exists, with predictable \ncosts and predictable services for seniors, is exactly what they want \nto protect.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wonder if the Senator from New Jersey would yield 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am pleased to yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I inquire how much time remains on the amendment \nand how much in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 39 minutes, and \nthe Senator from New Jersey has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we use that, each side has used an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  Senator Bumpers.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for the sponsor \nof this bill, but I have utterly nothing but contempt for the \namendment.\n  Medicare has done more to provide a good night's sleep to the elderly \nof this country than any other single program, with the possible \nexception of Social Security. We made a solemn contract with the \nelderly of this country to provide them with medical care. When I was \nfirst elected Governor of my State, I found that 50 percent of the \npeople didn't even know what to do in case they got sick. But when you \npolled the people over 65, they knew what to do and they knew where to \ngo and they knew their bill was going to be paid.\n\n  The underlying assumption of the Kyl amendment is that somehow or \nother people are having a difficult time getting a doctor to take them. \nNow, the General Accounting Office has answered a number of questions \npropounded to them by the distinguished senior Senator from New York, \nMr. Moynihan, and in answer to one of the questions: How much \ndifficulty are they having? here is the answer. According to the GAO, \n96 percent of the Medicare-eligible people in this country stated that \nthey had some difficulty getting medical care. But listen to this. The \nKyl amendment goes to this figure: Only two-tenths of 1 percent said \nthey had difficulty getting satisfactory assistance because of \nMedicare. Here we are tinkering with a system that has been so \nsuccessful and so rewarding to our elderly, because two-tenths of 1 \npercent of the people in this country said they had difficulty getting \nthe kind of care they wanted under Medicare.\n  No. 1, doctors right now, under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, are \neligible to charge 15 percent more than the Medicare allowance. For \nexample, you have a procedure--say, laser surgery for your eyes. Assume \nthat the Medicare limit on laser surgery for your eye, or eyes, is \n$1,000, but the doctor can charge 15 percent more than that, or $1,150. \nMedicare may only pay 80 percent of the allowable charge, or $800, but \nthe doctor can charge 15 percent more than the Medicare allowance.\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\n  The balanced budget amendment also provided that if a doctor wants to \nprivately contract, he or she may privately contract, but they have to \ndrop out of the program for 2 years.\n  Now, we feel strongly--many of us--that this is an elitist amendment. \nObviously, there are a lot of people in this country--perhaps 2 percent \nto 5 percent--who will pay a doctor of their choice whatever he \ncharges. They want him; they are used to him. Say I worked from the \ntime I was 30 years old until I was 65 and went to the same doctor, and \nwhen I became 65 I said, ``Doctor, I am switching from my Blue Cross \npolicy over to Medicare.'' The doctor says, ``I'm sorry, I'm not going \nto be able to take care of you anymore because Medicare is simply not \nmeeting my expenses.'' You think about that. The patient may be a \nperson of very modest means but who, above all, wants to go to the \ndoctor he or she has been going to for years, and the doctor says, \n``Well, now, if you are willing to pay, that is a different matter, I \nwill let you keep coming to see me.''\n  Let me tell you another thing the doctor can do. Assume you are in a \nfairly big-sized clinic, and the doctor says, ``We will take you for \nyour heart conditions under Medicare, but we can't take your liver,'' \nor, ``we can't take your kidneys.'' Think of all the different kinds of \ncontracts people would enter into. If this amendment ever became law--\nGod forbid--you would start hearing some of the most fraudulent \ncontracts and some of the most exorbitant charges for medical services \nthat would choke a mule.\n  Mr. President, if there is a problem with Medicare, if we are not \npaying enough to entice a majority of the doctors in this country to \nprovide services under Medicare, let's raise the rates. But for Pete's \nsake, let's not allow people to enter into these private contracts. I \nhave the utmost respect for the medical profession. But I am telling \nyou, you are giving them unbelievable leverage over millions of \nMedicare patients if you allow them to say, ``I can't take you because \nMedicare is not enough.'' If only two-tenths of 1 percent of the people \nin this country are having difficulty getting medical care because of \nMedicare rates, I suggest to you that that is not a sufficient number \nto warrant tinkering with one of the finest programs this country has \never produced.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield up to 6 minutes to my friend \nfrom Minnesota. If more is needed, let me know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \nup to 6 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just say one more time to my \ncolleague from Arkansas, I wish he wasn't leaving the Senate. I can't \nadd too much to what he said.\n  Let me just say to my colleague from Arizona, whom I really respect, \nthat I don't agree with him on a lot of issues, but I respect him. I \nmean that very sincerely. I think this amendment is mistaken, and I \nrise in strong opposition to it.\n  I have just a few quotes. Families USA Foundation states that this \nprovision, the Kyl amendment, ``may put increasing pressure on older \nAmericans to choose between getting the health services they need or \nputting food on their table.'' I think Families USA has really had a \ngreat deal of credibility. I know what they mean. I think the fear is \nnow, what would happen with the Kyl amendment is that doctors could \ncharge an elderly person, a senior citizen, just about any fee for any \nvisit or service. The problem is that if doctors are now going to be \nmaking this judgment and they can charge more than Medicare payments \nand stay in the Medicare system, the danger is that many will do so.\n  I had two parents with Parkinson's, and neither one of them made much \nmoney. The Medicare Program was the difference for them between being \nable to live a life toward the end of their years with dignity, albeit \na struggle, and going under. Who is to tell what a doctor decides in \nany given community? A lot of elderly people are going to be put under \nenormous pressure. Indeed, it could be a choice between whether or not \npeople get the services they need or whether they put food on the \ntable.\n  Also, remember that senior citizens are paying more and more out of \npocket. Since we had the debate on universal health care coverage, \nnational health insurance, a few short years ago--a debate we should \nget back to--the fact is that seniors are paying even more out of \npocket for health care costs. For many of them, it is the prescription \ndrug costs.\n  I don't know about other States, but my guess would be that in \nMinnesota the median income for senior citizens may be $15,000 or \n$16,000 a year. I suppose if you are a senior citizen with an income of \n$150,000 a year--there are very few, contrary to the stereotype--then \nyou know a doctor could say, ``I want you to pay what I am going to \ncharge and we will have this private contract.'' Those people would be \nall right, but for the vast majority of elderly people in our country--\nand we are not talking about a high-income profile--the Kyl amendment \nis a very real threat to a system that has worked well for people.\n\n  Catholic Charities USA, representing nearly 13 million people, states \nthat the Kyl legislation would ``dangerously undermine the Medicare \nProgram.'' They are right.\n  It would leave ``average and low-income Medicare patients at grave \nrisk of substandard care and second-class medicine.'' That was in a \nletter to all Senators from Fred Kammer, March 31--today, my son's \nbirthday.\n  The National Council of Senior Citizens, asserting that the Kyl \nlegislation ``is fraudulent and should be defeated,'' says that the \nbill would ``essentially end Medicare as a national health insurance \nprogram for almost 40 million Americans.''\n  ``This proposal would essentially license doctors to gouge millions \nof seniors for Medicare services.'' That is from a letter to Senator \nDaschle from Steve Protulis dated today.\n  If the Kyl amendment succeeds, ``seniors will be left with big \nmedical bills and the doctors will have new weapons to exploit health \nneeds for profit.'' That comes from a memo by the National Council of \nSenior Citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that quotes from these organizations, along \nwith a series of other letters from organizations representing senior \ncitizens, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Private Contracting--Letters\n\n       1.

Ford, Executive Vice President of the Service Employees \n  International Union, in Opposition to Medicare Private Contracting \n                    Legislation (S. 1194; H.R. 2497)\n\n       The Service Employees International Union strongly opposes \n     S. 1194, the Medicare private contracting legislation. We are \n     deeply concerned about the consequences that this legislation \n     would have for access to affordable, quality care for \n     Medicare beneficiaries. In our view, this legislation is an \n     underhanded effort to destabilize the entire Medicare system \n     and make it unaffordable for poor and working class senior \n     citizens.\n       Our union represents over 1.2 million workers and retirees. \n     More than 600,000 of these are front line health care \n     workers, including nurses, hospital workers, nursing home \n     workers and home health workers, who provide Medicare funded \n     services to senior citizens every day. We also represent our \n     retired members--former public sector, building service and \n     health care workers. These retired janitors, secretaries, and \n     clerks live on fixed incomes and rely on Medicare to cover \n     the bulk of their health care needs.\n       Some have touted that this amendment is about offering \n     patients more choice, but this is very misleading. Medicare \n     beneficiaries have always been free to privately purchase \n     services that Medicare does not cover. Last year's Balanced \n     Budget Act broadened choice even further by allowing \n     beneficiaries to privately contract for services that are \n     already covered under Medicare. Medicare Beneficiaries \n     already have choice.\n       The Medicare private contracting legislation is really \n     about offering physicians, not consumers, more choice. This \n     legislation would remove the two-year exclusion provision and \n     other consumer protections that govern these private \n     contracts, giving doctors more leeway to rush people into \n     contracts they do not understand, to charge higher rates, and \n     to select to serve people who will make them the most money.\n       Currently, even with Medicare coverage, more than one out \n     of every five retiree dollars goes to covering health care \n     costs. And when the median income for those over 65 is a \n     little over $11,000 that leaves precious little for food and \n     much less for clothing and shelter. This means that the vast \n     majority of senior citizens in this country will not have the \n     means to enter into private contracts.\n       One of our major concerns--that lies at the heart of this \n     bill--is that it would destabilize the entire Medicare system \n     and make it unaffordable for many beneficiaries. This \n     legislation would have the effect of transforming Medicare \n     from a social insurance program that everyone pays into and \n     everyone benefits from to a privatized program with \n     incentives for doctors to serve only the most profitable \n     patients.\n       The 1.2 million members of our Union, along with all \n     working families in this country, count on care being \n     available when they need it--that is why health insurance was \n     developed in the first place. By allowing physicians to \n     charge for services at will this basic premise is lost. The \n     Medicare private contracting legislation would destroy the \n     stability of paying into a system that insures available, \n     affordable coverage for those who need it. Getting medical \n     treatment--although vital--is a service and as such should \n     not fluctuate in price depending on the income of the person \n     who seeks it.\n       We object to the premise of this legislation and question \n     why the Federal Government would want to replace a system in \n     which 95% of all physicians provide care to 100% of qualified \n     enrollees with a two-tiered system in which access to quality \n     care is determined by income rather than illness. The \n     potential effect of this legislation on overall health \n     spending is also very alarming. The non-partisan \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that if this \n     legislation is approved it would ``almost certainly'' send \n     national health care spending spiraling upwards.\n       Again, on behalf of our more than 1.2 million members and \n     our thousands of low-income retired members, I urge you \n     strongly to oppose Medicare private contracting legislation, \n     S. 1194. Thank you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               National Council of\n\n\n                                              Senior Citizens,\n\n                                Silver Spring, MD, March 31, 1998.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: The National Council of Senior \n     Citizens urges you and your Senate colleagues to vote against \n     Senator Kyl's amendment to S. Con. Res. 86. In our view, \n     Senator Kyl's proposal would essentially end Medicare as a \n     national health insurance program for almost 40 million \n     Americans. It would virtually destroy the price protections \n     that beneficiaries now enjoy.\n       This proposal would essentially license doctors to gouge \n     millions of seniors for Medicare services. It would add not a \n     scintilla of ``freedom of choice'' for Medicare beneficiaries \n     in finding a doctor to treat their medical needs. Ninety-five \n     percent of all doctors already treat Medicare patients.\n       The recent hearing held by the Senate Finance Committee \n     demonstrated that current Medicare rules allow Medicare \n     patients to pay their doctors for specific services without \n     requiring the doctor to withdraw from Medicare for two years.\n       In short, Senator Kyl's sense of the Congress resolution \n     would add no benefit or freedom to the lives of seniors. It \n     is fraudulent and should be defeated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steve Protulis,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    Retired Federal Employees,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 31, 1998.\n     To: Hon. Tom Daschle.\n     From: Charles R. Jackson, NARFE President.\n       Misinformation and deliberate distortion of facts about \n     Medicare's Private Contracting rules should not be the basis \n     for attaching even a non-binding version of Senator Kyl's \n     bill, S. 1194, to the Senate budget resolution, S. Con. Res. \n     86. Federal retirees, particularly the 8,296 annuitants in \n     your state ask that you vote against this amendment.\n       Medicare patients would negotiate from a position of \n     weakness if doctors were allowed to pick and choose when to \n     be in or out of Medicare. Absent private contracting \n     protections, physicians--not beneficiaries--would decide what \n     to charge for their services. That is the only freedom being \n     enhanced by the Kyl and Archer bills, S. 1194 and H.R. 2497.\n       Congress and President Bush approved legislation in 1989 to \n     limit doctor fees to 115 percent of the Medicare fee \n     schedule. Fee limitations were enacted to ensure that \n     beneficiaries have access to health care at predictable \n     costs. More than 90 percent of America's physicians \n     participate in Medicare despite fee limitations which private \n     contract protections help to enforce. Fee limitations have \n     not resulted in services being denied to Medicare patients, \n     but we fear repealing private contract protections will \n     render fee limitations meaningless.\n       The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \n     warned Congress that this legislation could significantly \n     compromise Medicare's ability to screen inappropriate claims. \n     As a result, CBO says that it would be easier for an \n     unethical physician to bill both Medicare and the private \n     contract patient for the same service.\n       Fraud, waste and abuse is already a $23 billion a year \n     problem in Medicare. NARFE believes unrestricted private \n     contracting will only increase fraud at a time when public \n     policy makers are trying to preserve Medicare for current and \n     future generations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                         Medicare Rights Center\n\n\n   F.A.L.S.E. ALARM Fooling Americans into Losing Senior Entitlements\n\n       Seniors around the country are being fooled into believing \n     that Medicare won't take care of them. Americans Lobbying \n     Against Rationing Of Medicaid Care (A.L.A.R.M.). Alarm of \n     United Seniors Association, is falsely scaring seniors and \n     tricking them into giving up one of Medicare's\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\n     greatest protections: the limit on the amount doctors can \n     charge Medicare patients.\n       ``A.L.A.R.M. is not telling seniors the truth when they \n     state that Medicare won't pay for their health care and they \n     will be left with nowhere to go to get it.'' says Diane \n     Archer, Executive Director of the Medicare Rights Center, a \n     national not for profit consumer service organization.\n       Currently, traditional Medicare pays for all reasonable and \n     necessary services and limits seniors' out-of-pocket costs. \n     Seniors can see almost any doctor they want anywhere in the \n     country: 96% of doctors treat Medicare patients and agree to \n     charge these patients at a fixed rate set by the government.\n       ``The real alarm is that unless Medicare retains its \n     billing protection, seniors will have to pay out of their own \n     pockets whatever fees their doctors come up with. If they \n     cannot afford the fee, they will be forced to go without \n     health care.'' says Ms. Archer.\n       The current limits on doctors' charges allow people on \n     Medicare freedom to get the health care they need. permitting \n     doctors once again to set their own fees only makes health \n     care unaffordable for many seniors.\n       In short, says Ms. Archer, ``A.L.A.R.M. wants to shift \n     responsibility for the cost of health care from the \n     government to seniors who cannot afford to pay for it.''\n       A copy of A.L.A.R.M.'s letter is attached along with a MRC \n     fact sheet about what Medicare really provides seniors.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     New Kyl Legislation Would Disproportionately Harm Older Women\n\n\n    Older Women Are Poorer, Have More, and More Complex, Illnesses; \n    Increased Costs Would Price Them Out Of Health Care Marketplace\n\n       OWL, an organization representing the more than 57 million \n     American women over the age of 40, today (October 8) issued \n     the following statement opposing S 1194/HR 2497, bills that \n     would enable physicians, without any consumer protections, to \n     contract privately for services with Medicare beneficiaries:\n       ``Kyl II,'' which would give doctors license to charge \n     whatever the market would bear for services that already have \n     Medicare-imposed cost ceilings, would be particularly \n     damaging to women who suffer from more, and often more \n     complex conditions than men. Requiring more general physician \n     care and more specialist care, these already vulnerable \n     patients, who even now have trouble affording the out-of-\n     pocket health care expenses they must pay, could be faced \n     with a choice of private treatment or a Medicaid-funded \n     nursing home stay.\n       ``Kyl II'' would make bad public policy worse. The so-\n     called Medicare ``reforms'' that were include din the \n     Balanced Budget Act have aptly been identified as the start \n     down a slippery slope that will eventually lead to the total \n     dismemberment of Medicare. OWL believes that ``Kyl II'' would \n     be a large rock rapidly careening down that slope, taking \n     with it the guarantees of access and quality that Medicare \n     has always provided to America's older women.\n       21.8 million (out of 38.1 million) of all Medicare \n     beneficiaries are women, and 83% have an annual income of \n     less than $25,000 per year. in fact, older women live on a \n     median income of $9,355 a year (compared to a man's $14,983), \n     and depend upon Medicare and their monthly Social Security \n     check for maintaining their independence at home rather than \n     entering a nursing home. This proposed legislation not only \n     threatens to destroy the foundation of a critical social \n     insurance program, but could seriously threaten the lives of \n     America's older women.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Statement by Judy Waxman, Director, Government Affairs, Families, USA\n\n       The Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act of 1997 \n     could result in beneficiaries being held hostage to high-\n     priced doctors. Doctors could seek any fee they want for any \n     service, and Medicare beneficiaries would feel compelled to \n     pay such unlimited fees to retain their doctors.\n       Out-of-pocket health care costs have continued to rise for \n     America's seniors since Medicare's inception. This provision \n     may put increasing pressure on older Americans to choose \n     between getting the health services they need or putting food \n     on their table. This choice is simply unacceptable.\n       Families USA is the national health consumer group.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   The National Council on the Aging\n\n\n           LCAO Opposes Medicare Private Contracting Proposal\n\n       My name is Howard Bedlin and I am the Vice President for \n     Public Policy and Advocacy for the National Council on the \n     Aging, which currently chairs the Leadership Council on Aging \n     Organizations (LCAO). The LCAO represents 43 national \n     organizations serving over 40 million older persons.\n       The Leadership Council of Aging Organizations opposes \n     efforts to overturn current provisions that protect Medicare \n     beneficiaries from physician overbilling. Doctors are already \n     permitted to charge 15% more than what Medicare considers to \n     be a reasonable price, and now they want to charge even more. \n     We oppose opening up Medicare provisions enacted under the \n     Balanced Budget Act just two months ago on an issue that has \n     far reaching implications, yet has never been the subject of \n     a congressional hearing or even debated on the House or \n     Senate floor. LCAO members will be sending a letter to \n     members of Congress next week to express our opposition to \n     this ill-conceived, anti-consumer proposal.\n       The National Council on the Aging believes that the \n     proposals introduced by Senator Kyl and Chairman Archer are \n     not designed to solve any problem experienced by Medicare \n     beneficiaries. Well over 90 percent of physician's bills \n     accept Medicare rates and there is no evidence to indicate \n     that access problems exist because of Medicare payments to \n     doctors. The proposals would, however, increase physicians' \n     income and fundamentally change the nature of the doctor-\n     patient relationship.\n       Without notice, or in the middle of a course of treatment, \n     doctors could tell Medicare patients that treatment will be \n     denied unless payment is made for the full amount of whatever \n     the doctor wants to charge. No other insurance policy, in \n     either the public or private sectors, permits this. Access to \n     specialists would suffer, as they could refuse to see the \n     vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries so that a small \n     handful of the wealthiest seniors could pay their higher \n     rates. Instances of fraud and abuse would increase, as \n     unscrupulous doctors would have an easy time getting away \n     with double billing both Medicare and the patient.\n       Beneficiaries could be subject to bait-and-switch tactics, \n     in which doctors begin a course of treatment under Medicare \n     and then turn around and demand full payment of higher \n     charges out-of-pocket for treatment to continue. What if a \n     particular doctor doesn't like what Medicare is paying him \n     for one particular service? What if the doctor notices that \n     the patient has driven up in a nice new car? The kind of \n     uncertainty this proposal would create would be extremely \n     harmful to Medicare beneficiaries.\n       We strongly urge members of Congress to reject this \n     proposal, to act in the interest of 33 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries, and to refuse to line the pockets of a few \n     greedy doctors.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Arizona and \nto other colleagues, this amendment is profoundly mistaken. This \namendment, if passed, I believe, really puts way too many senior \ncitizens at risk.\n  The Medicare Program is a universal coverage program. The Medicare \nProgram is, for many seniors, the difference between survival and even \nlife with dignity versus going under. To all of a sudden now say to \ndoctors and other providers in this country that you can charge what \nyou want and still stay in the Medicare system now, I am not in favor \nof that. But if they do it for 2 years, they are out of Medicare. To \ntell the doctors and providers they can charge what they want and stay \nin Medicare, that doctors can decide, for any senior citizen and their \nfamilies, whether or not they have the money to pay for additional \ncosts the doctors want to impose on them does a grave injustice to the \nMedicare system.\n  I don't hear a lot of senior citizens--I say to my colleagues--in \nMinnesota saying they want to see the Medicare system ``fixed'' in this \ndirection. I hear people talking about, ``Can there be coverage for \nprescription drug costs?'' I hear people talking about the problems \nthey have when they are faced with catastrophic expenses, not wanting \nto spend the end of their lives in a nursing home and maybe going under \nbecause of that. I hear senior citizens talking about the need to have \nmore funding for home-based health care so they can live at home in as \nnear normal circumstances as possible with dignity. I don't hear senior \ncitizens in Minnesota saying they want the Kyl amendment passed, which \nwill enable providers, in too many cases, to gouge them, to charge what \nthey want to charge to seniors, to put a whole lot of senior citizens \nat risk. This amendment is mistaken. This amendment undermines the \nMedicare system, and this amendment should be resoundingly defeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire about the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona controls 39 minutes \n30 seconds. The Senator from New Jersey controls 14 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  I think it is probably time for me to respond to some of the things \nthat have been said. I appreciate the spirit in which the comments were \nmade by the Senator from Minnesota, and earlier by the Senator from \nArkansas, and certainly also by the Senator from Nevada. We have \nreasonable differences of opinion about certain matters here. I \nappreciate the spirit in which their comments have been made.\n  But my, oh, my, Mr. President, it is amazing to me that we would have \n49\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\nor 50 cosponsors of this legislation in the Senate and almost 200 in \nthe House if it were going to do all of the horrible things that have \nbeen suggested by my colleagues. I don't think I could go home. I \ndaresay that I probably represent more senior citizens--or at least as \nmany as my distinguished colleague from Minnesota. In fact, half of the \nState of Minnesota comes to my State in the wintertime, and we really \nenjoy visiting with his constituents. Obviously, they probably receive \nsome medical care in our State, too. Obviously, we are not going to be \ndoing something by which my mother and father and all of their friends \nand all of my other senior constituents are going to feel threatened.\n\n  What could it be that is so horrible about this?\n  The Senators from Arkansas and Nevada made, I think, a very telling \npoint. They said that Medicare has certainty. The Senator from Nevada \nsaid that it may not be perfect but at least it has certainty. Mr. \nPresident, that is true. The Congress began here with a program, an \nentitlement for senior citizens, to provide certain medical care--not \nall care, but certain care for senior citizens. Gradually, over time, \nthat has transformed from an entitlement into an exclusive program. It \nis Medicare or no care, as of January 1 of this year.\n  Up to that point, you had options. You could go outside the Medicare \nsystem, if you wanted to, for covered services. As the Senator from \nNevada pointed out, it wasn't done very much, but you had the right. \nThat is the point. All of these dire warnings about price gouging and \npeople having to choose between food and medical care, that has been \nthe situation for the last 20 some years. Patients have always had this \nright to privately contract. It was taken away from them, as a \npractical matter, on January 1 of this year. That is why I am standing \nhere. I would not be here otherwise.\n  What happened was that because the Health Care Financing \nAdministration was writing letters to doctors threatening them that \nthey had to submit a bill to Medicare for anyone who was ``Medicare \neligible''--obviously, that is everybody over 65--the doctors were \nworried. They said, ``We never had to do this before,'' and, as a \ncolleague pointed out, ``If the patient doesn't want to have this done, \nwe don't have to do it. They could be treated outside of Medicare. So \nwould you please confirm that, make it absolutely certain in the law?'' \nSo I introduced the amendment. It passed overwhelmingly, like 65-35 or \nso.\n  All of us want to give patients the freedom of choice: Even if the \nright isn't going to be exercised very much, let the patient decide. \nBut what happened was that after that became part of the Balanced \nBudget Act of last year, as it was being negotiated in its details at \nthe very end of the year, in the middle of the night, the \nadministration officials convinced some House and Senate negotiators \nthat they had to attach a condition onto our amendment; namely, in \norder for a patient to have this right, they had to find a doctor who \nwould dump all of that doctor's Medicare patients for 2 years in \nadvance, or you could not contract privately. As a practical matter, \nthat eliminated the choice, because very few doctors are going to dump \nall of their existing Medicare load to just treat a few private \ncontract patients.\n  So, as a result, we are now dealing with a new phenomenon. What \nstarted as a great program, an entitlement, which people could take \nadvantage of, has now become the exclusive, only way for senior \ncitizens to receive care in our country. As I pointed out earlier, even \nin England where they have socialized medicine, they have a system \nwhereby, if you don't want to go to the socialized medicine program, \nyou can go to a doctor of your choice. Many people do, and has it \nruined the English system of health care? No. If this is going to be \nsuch a horrible thing and ruin Medicare, why hasn't it ruined the \nEnglish system, where this right of private choice always has existed? \nWhy didn't it ruin the Medicare system before January 1, when this \nright existed? It may not be perfect, but at least there is certainty. \nWe are saying the certainty has now gotten to the point where it is a \nconstraint, the denial of a right and the denial of a freedom. In that \nregard, certainty is less desirable than choice.\n\n  Now, my colleague from Minnesota made an interesting point in \nconcluding. He said doctors could overcharge here and you could \nactually create two classes of medicine. Mr. President, I think this \nsays a lot, because what it says in the long run is that we are going \nto have one level of care for senior citizens. We can't predict exactly \nwhat that level of care is going to be, but whatever it is, if a senior \nfeels dissatisfied with that level of care, he or she is stuck with it; \nthere is no way out. Even in Great Britain, you have a way out. If you \nare not satisfied with it, if you don't think it suits your particular \nneeds, you at least have the right to go to the doctor of your choice \noutside the system. But not in the United States of America.\n  We are going to say, ``No, no, there has to be only one type of care \nand it has to be the same for everybody once you hit 65.'' What we are \nsaying is that there may be a few people--and I grant it will not be a \nlarge number--but there may be a few people who are not satisfied with \nthat, who, for whatever reason, decide they want to have care outside \nof the Medicare system and they are willing to pay for it. Why deny \nthem that right? This is America.\n  One of my colleagues made the point, I think it was the colleague \nfrom Arkansas, that this is elitist because some people will pay for \ntheir own care. Perhaps you have a patient who has been treated by the \nsame doctor for many years and he just wants to go back to that same \ndoctor even though he would have to privately contract. That could well \nhappen, but I don't call that elitist. I cited the example of a friend \nof mine, who is not a senior citizen, by the way, but his wife was \nvery, very ill with cancer. He would have spent every nickel that he \nhad, he would have spent his life savings, he would have done anything \nto save her life. In the end he couldn't, but he went to great lengths \nto try to save her life.\n  As I said, I was successful in getting a compassionate release from \nFDA so she could be treated with some experimental drugs. When it is \nyour life, or your wife, your spouse, you will do anything when their \nhealth care, their life, is involved. Are we going to say to them, in \nthe United States of America, ``No, you are stuck with Medicare whether \nyou like it or not,'' even though you might be able to go to a great \nspecialist somewhere at some great university who is not taking very \nmany Medicare patients and he doesn't want to take any more Medicare \npatients but he is willing to treat you? We are saying, ``No, we are \nnot going to let that great surgeon, that university research expert, \ntreat you outside of Medicare because we only have one level of care in \nthis country and we don't want anybody to have any better care than \nanybody else.''\n  I don't call that elitist. I call that the denial of the basic \nAmerican right of freedom. That is why I think we need to get this back \nto what we are really talking about.\n  Let me read again the words, because I find it hard to believe that \nmy colleagues would really vote against these words. This is the \namendment we are debating here:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that seniors have the right to \n     see the physician or health care provider of their choice.\n\n  Those who vote no are saying, no, they should not have that right. It \nis that simple.\n  Finally, perhaps I could refer to some of the antifraud provisions. I \nhad not wanted to take the time to do this, but there has been a \nsuggestion that patients are in jeopardy, that seniors would be in \njeopardy because doctors could charge all kinds of extra money. I \nreally don't have the time to read all of this; it is page after page \nafter page. Let me just cite some examples here of some of the things \nthat are included that a physician would have to do in order to enter \ninto this kind of contract, in order to assure that there is no fraud \nor abuse. And HCFA, Health Care Finance Administration, would have \ntotal control over this. The requirements are as follows.\n  First of all, a contract would have to be in writing and signed. No \nclaims could be--the contract provides that no party to the contract \nand no entity on behalf of any party to the contract shall submit any \nclaim or request for payment to Medicare.\n  The contract must identify the Medicare-covered professional services \nand\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\nthe period, if any, to be covered, but does not cover any services \nfurnished before the contract is entered into for the treatment of an \nemergency medical condition. So this couldn't be used when the patient \nis in extremis unless the contract was entered into before the onset of \nthe emergency medical condition. There must be clear disclosure of \nterms. The contract must clearly indicate that by signing the contract \nthe Medicare beneficiary understands and agrees not to submit a claim \nto Medicare, agrees to be responsible, whether through insurance or \notherwise, to pay for the services, acknowledges that no limits under \nthis title may be charged, acknowledges that Medicare supplemental \npolicies do not make payments for such services, acknowledges that the \nbeneficiary has the right to have such services provided by other \nphysicians or health care practitioners for whom payment would be made \nby Medicare; that the contract must also clearly indicate whether the \nphysician or practitioner is excluded from participation; the parties \ncan modify the contract if they consent, the health care practitioner \nmust submit a variety of--a whole variety here of things to HCFA, \nincluding information to HCFA which makes it clear as to what the \ncharges are, what the services are for which the payment is being made \nby the patient, and other information that Medicare--HCFA deems \nnecessary to prevent fraud and abuse. It goes on and on and on. I don't \nneed to quote it all.\n  The point is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we have before \nus here also makes reference to and summarizes those provisions. I \nnoted just one of the provisions. I will cite it again, that the \nlegislation we are talking about here must include provisions that are \nsubject to stringent fraud and abuse law, including the Medicare anti-\nfraud provisions in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct of 1996.\n  The point is, if the existing law antifraud provisions are good \nenough for the existing law, then it is kind of hard to criticize them \nas applicable to this.\n  So I think it is a red herring to say doctors could somehow gouge \npatients under this. They are going to be subject to very stringent \nantifraud provisions, at least as stringent, and frankly more \nstringent, than those under existing law. So I really don't think that \nis a fair criticism of what we are trying to do here.\n  This is merely a sense of the Senate that people in this country, \njust because they turn 65, should not be precluded from making the \nchoice--that they are willing to pay for--to be treated outside of the \nMedicare Program. Most will not want to do so. But who are we to say in \nthose cases in which a person does want to do so that they can't do it, \nwhatever it means to their life or the life of their loved ones? I \nthink that is what is elitist. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for 4 minutes to respond.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Minnesota 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \nup to 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, again, colleagues should understand \nexactly what this sense of the Senate is about. What this amendment is \nabout is what the Kyl legislation is about, which is really quite a \nchange from current policy. Right now what we have said is that if a \ndoctor or provider wants to charge more than the reimbursement he or \nshe will get from Medicare, fine. Go ahead and do it. But if you do \nthat with your own private contracting, then for 2 years you are not in \nthe Medicare system. The reason for that is to protect people, elderly \npeople, who rely on this program.\n  Mr. President, again I present to colleagues a very important letter \non private contracting, a GAO letter to Senator Moynihan of February \n23, 1998:\n\n       Nearly all physicians treat Medicare patients and accept \n     new patients covered by Medicare. The recent data from the \n     AMA indicate that 96.2 percent of all non-Federal physicians \n     treated Medicare beneficiaries in 1996. Moreover, the \n     percentage of physicians treating Medicare patients has \n     increased to 95.2 percent in 1995 from 94.2 percent in 1994; \n     over the last 2 years.\n\n  Mr. President, here is the point. The point is that the Medicare \nProgram is a program that seniors rely on. A lot of Senators may not \nunderstand where the Kyl amendment takes us. Where the Kyl amendment \ntakes us is the following direction.\n  By the way, people who are covered by Medicare are covered. They are \nable to get the care they need. My colleague was talking about the \nhorrible example of someone who had a loved one who was struggling with \ncancer. It's the vast majority of people in the country who do not have \ninsurance or are underinsured who need the most help. We really ought \nto be expanding Medicare for people in our country. We ought not to be \nabout the business of dismantling Medicare.\n  I will use the same example as my colleague from Arizona used, but I \nwill reach a whole different set of conclusions. I will simply say to \nyou: Imagine a situation where you have an elderly couple, age 70. The \nwife is now battling cancer. It turns out that in the community where \nthey live, under the Kyl amendment, given where the Kyl amendment is \ntaking us, the vast majority of doctors in the community have decided, \n``Listen, we are going to charge more than Medicare reimbursement will \ngive us. We are going to charge more.'' It just so happens that this \ncouple can't afford it. They maybe have a total income of $20,000 or \n$25,000 a year.\n  Now it is two classes of medicine. If you are wealthy, you are going \nto be able to afford it. But what about the vast, vast majority of \nsenior citizens who can't afford now what doctors are charging them? \nThat is really what we are going into. We are not talking about freedom \nof choice for elderly people. We are taking a lot of choice away. We \nare talking about a situation where conceivably in a given community \ndoctors could get together, or the majority of doctors could get \ntogether, charge more, still be in the Medicare system, and decide for \neach and every elderly person and their loved one what they pay--what \nthey pay.\n  A whole lot of people who now can go and get the care they need, \ngiven the Medicare system, may no longer be able to afford it. The \nwhole purpose of Medicare was that we said when you get to be older, \nyou are going to incur more health care costs and we want to make sure \nthat there is coverage for you, that we should at least do that for \nelderly people. Why in the world would we want to turn the clock back? \nWhy in the world would we want to turn our backs on elderly people? Why \nin the world would we now want to create a situation where, if you are \nwealthy--and by the way most senior citizens are not--you have it made. \nYes, you can contract with this doctor and these doctors. This doctor \nor these doctors can charge you anything they want to. But for the vast \nmajority of people, Medicare beneficiaries, this will not work well. \nThis will not work well.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator can have a couple more minutes as he \nneeds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Let me just give an analogy. Take the Kaiser plan. It is well known, \na managed care plan. You join the Kaiser plan and you are going to pay \na given fee, the enrollees pay a given fee. Can you imagine what it \nwould be like if all of a sudden doctors in the Kaiser plan could \ndecide on their own, based upon what particular citizens they were \nseeing, that they would charge more for service? You join the plan just \nlike people join Medicare. You join the Kaiser plan. Where Senator Kyl \nis taking us, it would be as if doctors in the Kaiser plan could now \nsay to the enrollees, ``By the way, we have decided we are going to \ncharge you more for coverage of this service.'' I mean, people would be \nfurious. People would feel betrayed. People would say, ``Wait a minute, \nthat is not the contract with us.''\n  Medicare is a sacred contract with senior citizens. We ought not \ncreate this gigantic loophole for too many providers who I fear rip off \nelderly people to charge fees for services that senior citizens cannot \nafford. We ought not tear up a very sacred contract.\n  I hope we will have a strong vote against this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could make just a couple of comments in \nresponse to the Senator from Minnesota. If an insurance company or plan \nlike Kaiser company has a contract to provide care, they would be \nobligated to provide the care they contracted to provide. They can't \nall of a sudden just opt out and say we have decided we don't want to \ndo that anymore or we are going to charge more money for it. I really \ndon't understand the point of the Senator from Minnesota in that \nregard.\n  Second, he argued that under this amendment it could well come to \npass, probably would come to pass, that so many physicians would charge \nso much more that pretty soon people wouldn't be able to afford their \nmedical care. Yet it has also been argued here that very few people \nwould want to take advantage of this; that 92 percent of the people in \nMedicare are happy with the care that they are getting. I don't think \nyou can have it both ways. I don't think you can argue on the one hand \nthat there would be dire consequences because everybody will want to do \nthis and on the other hand everything is just fine and nobody is going \nto want to do it.\n  The truth of the matter is that probably not very many people will \nwant to do this and therefore it will not have dire consequences on the \nsystem. But for those people who do want to do it, it becomes a very \nimportant matter to them. They may want to spend whatever they have--\nwhether they have very much or not--in order to get that physician of \ntheir choice.\n  Let me present an analogy to you, Mr. President, about what the \nSenators who are arguing in opposition to this are really arguing.\n  They said we provided this great health care system for the citizens \nof the United States, and so it has to be the only system. To be \nconsistent, they should also say we provided a great retirement system \nfor people in this country; it is called Social Security. So in order \nto prevent anybody from getting anymore money than anyone else in \nretirement, we are going to provide that under Social Security; that is \nwhat you got; you can't go outside; you can't have pension benefits, \ninsurance benefits, stock paying you dividends or money from your kids \nor whatever. It is the Government plan or no plan, just like they are \nsaying, here it is, Medicare or no care. Same thing, Mr. President. You \ncan see how absurd the proposition is when presented in that way.\n  For retirement savings, we acknowledge the fact that people ought to \nhave a choice. They can have the Government plan but they can also \nexercise their own freedom of choice to provide for themselves as they \nsee necessary. But what our colleagues on the other side are saying is, \nwhen it comes to health care, which I argue is even more important to \npeople than money, ``No, you don't have that choice, because the \nGovernment has decided not only is it going to provide you an \nentitlement of health care, but it has now decided that is the only \nthing you can get once you turn 65; that you cannot go outside of that \nsystem.''\n  That, Mr. President, is what is so wrong with the law that took \neffect as of January 1 of this year and what we are trying to correct. \nThat is why we need to go on record expressing the sense of the Senate, \nand I will read it again:\n\n       [Expressing] the sense of the Senate that seniors have the \n     right to see the physician or health care provider of their \n     choice. . .\n\n  I hope my colleagues will support us in that expression.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment offered by Senator Kyl, which calls for the \nexpansion of private contracting between physicians and Medicare \nbeneficiaries. This proposal could leave beneficiaries vulnerable to \nhigher out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services. And it could leave \nthe Medicare Program more vulnerable to fraud and abuse.\n  Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allows physicians to \nenter into ``private contracts'' with Medicare enrollees and set their \nown fees for services covered by Medicare. The intent of this provision \nwas to allow the 9 percent of physicians who don't participate in the \nMedicare Program, to continue to treat their Medicare-eligible patients \nthrough private contracts.\n  To protect Medicare from fraud and to ensure that private contracting \narrangements are limited to physicians who otherwise would not be \navailable to Medicare beneficiaries, the law is limited to those \nphysicians who agree, in an affidavit, to forgo all reimbursement from \nMedicare for at least 2 years. The law also requires a physician to \ndisclose to the patient that no Medicare payment will be made for \nprivately contracted services, no balance billing limits will apply, no \nMedigap coverage will be available, and the services to be performed \nwould be paid for by Medicare if provided by another physician.\n  The proposal advocated by Senator Kyl could jeopardize these \nimportant protections by allowing all physicians to charge Medicare \nbeneficiaries more than the levels set by the Congress on a service-by-\nservice or patient-by-patient basis. And that could lead many seniors \nvulnerable to pressure from providers to pay higher rates. For example, \na physician could tell someone with a serious illness that they would \nhave to pay extra to get the services they need. And for a desperately \nill person, that may leave them feeling that they have no real choice.\n  So, Mr. President, we need to evaluate the impact of the law we just \npassed before we make changes that could raise costs for beneficiaries \nor add to the already critical problems of fraud and abuse. The \nAmerican College of Physicians has recommended that we not legislate \nfurther on the issue of private contracting at this time. They have \nadvised that any further expansion of private contracting could have \nmany unknown effects that should be studied in the broader context of \nMedicare reform by the bipartisan commission on Medicare. I believe \nthat's good advice, Mr. President, and I would urge my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Kyl amendment. I \ndo so because I am not convinced that a private contracting provision \nis necessary in the first place. This amendment is presented in the \nname of freedom of choice when in fact it has a potentially devastating \neffect on the Medicare program and the health care costs paid by \nAmerica's senior citizens. Seniors today have a choice in their health \ncare options. They have the ability to privately contract for care not \ncovered by Medicare as they always have. They also have payment \nprotection in terms of how much they can be charged for Medicare \ncovered services. Under the Kyl amendment these protections are removed \nand seniors who engage in private contracting would be responsible for \n100% of the cost of their care. Even if this care is for Medicare \ncovered services. Medicare would not pay for these services under \nprivate contract nor would supplemental policies pay as well. Seniors \nwould be 100% responsible for these costs.\n  Today, 92% of Medicare beneficiaries are satisfied with Medicare. \nUnder this amendment, the potential for significant out of pocket costs \nfor seniors becomes a reality. When seniors already pay 21% of their \nhealth care costs out of pocket, any amendment to raise these costs \nshould be closely scrutinized. The potential for fraudulent activity is \nalso significantly increased under this amendment. While I have faith \nin our physician community and don't believe they are waiting in the \nwings to defraud our Medicare system, the potential for the Health Care \nFinancing Administration (HCFA) to monitor claims that might be \nsubmitted while a private contracting relationship has been established \nis questionable. We have a responsibility to minimize any scenario that \nmight lead to fraudulent activity and under this amendment, those \nguarantees to do not exist. The Congressional Budget Office reports \nthat the HCFAs efforts to screen inappropriate or fraudulent claims \ncould be significantly compromised. There is no system is a place that \nwould allow HCFA to determine which patients are paying for their care \nout of pocket from those whose physician is submitting claims to \nMedicare for these same services. It is for this reason that the \nprivate contracting clause in the balanced budget Act of 1997 has a 2-\nyear exemption clause which would require physician's who participate \nin private contracting to see no other Medicare patients during this \nperiod. This would enable HCFA to ensure that no double payments are \nbeing made. This is the only\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\nway HCFA at this time could preclude possible fraudulent activity.\n  Prior to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 few of us in Congress had \never heard about private contracting in Medicare. This is because our \nsenior constituents were not concerned about this issue and our \nphysician constituents had never surfaced the issue either. My sense is \nthat the truth of the matter is that they would not be concerned about \nthis issue now as well had it not surfaced during the balanced budget \ndebate. The cost protections afforded by Medicare are valuable to \nseniors and the peace of mind that is achieved knowing out of pocket \ncosts will be limited means a great deal to those on fixed incomes. In \nthat 96 percent of physicians participate in Medicare, there were no \nsigns of their dissatisfaction or a call for change. Perhaps rather \nthan voting on this amendment which is framed in the name of freedom of \nchoice, the better approach would be to remove the private contracting \nchoice provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and return to the \nway things were. I do not believe that this debate is about freedom of \nchoice for seniors nor do I believe that physicians are standing in \nline to defraud our Medicare system. What I do believe is that we are \ndebating an issue that before we learned what it meant seven months \nago, few of us, constituents included, were even aware of. I submit \nthat change for change sake is a mistake. We have a strong Medicare \nProgram with protections in place to protect beneficiaries from high \nout of pocket costs and one that is committed to removing the potential \nfor fraudulent activity from the system. We must be very cautious \nbefore we take steps to destroy the success of this program and the \nmany protections this program provides to the 38 million beneficiaries \nwho count on it for their day to day health care. In my view, the Kyl \namendment does not pass the test to ensure payment protection for \nbeneficiaries nor does it ensure the potential for fraudulent activity \nis removed. As such, I must oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains on the Kyl amendment and the \nopposition to it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona controls 22 minutes \n40 seconds; the Senator from New Jersey controls 8 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \ncan agree we will both yield back the remainder of the time. I wonder \nif you intend to second degree the amendment. If you do not, then based \non a UC that says that, we won't offer a second-degree amendment. If \nnot, we intend to----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have no indication from anybody \nhere that they want to offer a second-degree amendment. So that would \ntake care of that.\n  Is the Senator proposing that we yield back all remaining time from \nthe Senator from Arizona as well as our side; all yielding back?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I am. Obviously, when this amendment comes up, if \nyou desire to yield off the resolution, we can still do that. I just \nwant to get on to another amendment, if we can.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. When is the Senator proposing to set the vote on this \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Jersey, I \nreceived a note from the majority leader that votes will start tomorrow \nat 12 noon on a number of stacked amendments.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So all the people who want to rush down here and \noffer amendments will still have time to do so tonight?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We know of three that will take quite a bit of time, \nand they are willing to do that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That would be wonderful. We are not thinking of \nclosing up shop until we have heard all the amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All amendments that can possibly be taken up on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Oh, that would be excellent. I can't wait to hear \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say this in all sincerity, because the \nvotes were very long. One was in excess of a half hour, and quorum \ncalls before the votes don't count and the vote time doesn't count. We \nhave not even used 5\\1/2\\ hours today from starting at 9:30 this \nmorning. We still have 29 hours remaining at this point, and we have \nessentially 2 days, Wednesday and Thursday, to get it done. That is \ngoing to be very difficult.\n  I am going to stay here, and we are not going to close the Senate. We \nwould like Senators to come down and offer amendments.\n  I propose the following so there will be a sequence: First of all, \nthere will be no votes until 12 noon tomorrow, and then there should be \nthree votes. While this is not a unanimous consent request--it will be \nproposed later--let me say those votes will be on or in relation to the \nKyl amendment, on or in relation to the Conrad amendment, and on or in \nrelation to the Coverdell-McCain amendment. We are expecting to debate \nat least, if not more, Senator Conrad's amendment and the Coverdell, \nMcCain, et al. amendment. We are trying to get Senator Conrad, and I \nhope Senator Coverdell is on notice we will be ready soon after that. \nWith that, I yield to my friend from New Jersey.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I appreciate the message that the \nchairman of the Budget Committee is sending out here, and that is the \ntime is going to be consumed. We always know what happens when it gets \nto the bewitching hour, which is the end of the week, and people want \nto go home or take care of other business.\n  I say to my colleagues on my side, as well as the other side, do not \nbe surprised, if you want to delay doing it now, that you are not going \nto be able to get enough time, in many cases, to really explore the \namendment that you want to present. We could wind up in a vote-a-thon. \nThat is going to be allowed. It means 1 minute debate and a vote. I \ndon't think that is a good way to do legislation.\n  I say we are going to be here. Senator Domenici and I have agreed we \nwill stay as long as we can, to use the expression, to do some \nbusiness, to have people come down and offer their amendments. We \ninvite them, whether it is 10 o'clock or 12 o'clock. We don't want an \nhour to elapse in between them, frankly, but we are here and we will \nstay as long as our colleagues want to bring amendments. We hope they \nwill. If I still have the floor, I have a couple of amendments to send \nto the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator let me make an assignment? Mr. \nPresident, Senator Gorton is going to take over my responsibilities as \nmanager, and whatever privileges I have under the Budget Act belong to \nSenator Gorton from this point until I return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back the time on the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back any time Senator Kyl had on his amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And we yield back on our side as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is understood there will be no second-degree \namendments, and the Kyl amendment will be voted on tomorrow in \nsequence. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2204 and 2205\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have two amendments that I send to \nthe desk. One is for Senator Kohl from Wisconsin and the other is for \nSenator Durbin and Senator Chafee. I send these to the desk and ask \nthey be held pending further action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendment will be set aside and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes \n     amendments numbered 2204 and 2205.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2204\n\n      (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the \nestablishment of a national background check system for long-term care \n                                workers)\n\n       At the end of title III add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF \n                   A NATIONAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM FOR LONG-\n                   TERM CARE WORKERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 43 percent of Americans over the age of 65 are \n     likely to spend time in a nursing home.\n       (2) Home health care is the fastest growing portion of the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), with an average annual growth rate \n     of 32 percent since 1989.\n       (3) A 1997 report from State Long-Term Care Ombudsmen \n     assisted under the Older Americans Act of 1965 indicated that \n     in 29 States surveyed, 7,043 cases of abuse, gross neglect, \n     or exploitation occurred in nursing homes and board and care \n     facilities.\n       (4) A random sample survey of nursing home staff found that \n     10 percent of the staff admitted committing at least 1 act of \n     physical abuse in the preceding year.\n       (5) Although the majority of long-term care facilities do \n     an excellent job in caring for elderly and disabled patients, \n     incidents of abuse and neglect do occur at an unacceptable \n     rate and are not limited to nursing homes alone.\n       (6) Most long-term care facilities do not conduct both \n     Federal and State criminal background checks on prospective \n     employees.\n       (7) Most State nurse aide abuse registries are limited to \n     nursing home aides, thereby failing to cover home health and \n     hospice aides.\n       (8) Current State nurse aide abuse registries are \n     inadequate to screen out abusive long-term care workers \n     because no national system is in place to track abusers from \n     State to State and facility to facility.\n       (9) Currently, 29 States have enacted varying forms of \n     criminal background check requirements for prospective long-\n     term care employees. However current Federal and State \n     safeguards are inadequate because there is little or no \n     information sharing between States about known abusers.\n       (10) Many facilities would choose to conduct background \n     checks on prospective employees if an efficient, accurate, \n     and cost-effective national system existed.\n       (11) The impending retirement of the baby boom generation \n     will greatly increase the demand and need for quality long-\n     term care.\n       (12) It is incumbent on Congress and the President to \n     ensure that patients receiving care under the medicare and \n     medicaid programs (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.) are \n     protected from abuse, neglect, and mistreatment.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that--\n       (1) funds should be directed toward the establishment of a \n     national background check system for long-term care workers \n     who participate in the medicare and medicaid programs (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.);\n       (2) such a system would include both a national registry of \n     abusive long-term care workers and a requirement for a \n     Federal criminal background check before such workers are \n     employed to provide long-term care; and\n       (3) such a system would be created with ample input and \n     comment from representatives of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, State government, law enforcement, the \n     nursing home and home health industries, patient and consumer \n     advocates, and advocates for long-term care workers.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2205\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the right to \n           affordable, high-quality health care for seniors)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING \n                   AFFORDABLE, HIGH-QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR \n                   SENIORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Seniors deserve affordable, high quality health care.\n       (2) The medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) has made health care \n     affordable for millions of seniors.\n       (3) Beneficiaries under the medicare program deserve to \n     know that such program will cover the benefits that they are \n     currently entitled to.\n       (4) Beneficiaries under the medicare program can pay out-\n     of-pocket for health care services whenever they--\n       (A) do not want a claim for reimbursement for such services \n     submitted to such program; or\n       (B) want or need to obtain health care services that such \n     program does not cover.\n       (5) Beneficiaries under the medicare program can use \n     doctors who do not receive any reimbursement under such \n     program.\n       (6) Close to 75 percent of seniors have annual incomes \n     below $25,000, including 4 percent who have annual incomes \n     below $5,000, making any additional out-of-pocket costs for \n     health care services extremely burdensome.\n       (7) Very few beneficiaries under the medicare program \n     report having difficulty obtaining access to a physician who \n     accepts reimbursement under such program.\n       (8) Allowing private contracting on a claim-by-claim basis \n     under the medicare program would impose significant out-of-\n     pocket costs on beneficiaries under such program.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that seniors have the right to affordable, \n     high-quality health care and that they have the right to \n     choose their doctors, and that no change should be made to \n     the medicare program that could--\n       (1) impose unreasonable and unpredictable out-of-pocket \n     costs for seniors or erode the benefits that the 38,000,000 \n     beneficiaries under the medicare program are entitled to;\n       (2) compromise the efforts of the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services to screen inappropriate or fraudulent claims \n     for reimbursement under such program; and\n       (3) allow unscrupulous providers under such program to bill \n     twice for the same services.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, on this past Sunday night history was made, \nperfection was attained, and a dynasty was firmly established in \nwomen's collegiate basketball. It is with great Tennessee pride that I \nsalute the 1998 NCAA National Championship Lady Vols of the University \nof Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 203, submitted earlier today by \nmyself and Senator Thompson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 203) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the University of\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\n     Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball team is the new dynasty \n     in collegiate women's basketball.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this evening, along with my fellow Lady Vol \nfan, Senator Fred Thompson, I introduce this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution establishing the Tennessee Lady Vols as the new dynasty in \ncollegiate women's basketball. When one recites the great basketball \ndynasties of all time, the Boston Celtics, the Chicago Bulls, and the \nUCLA Bruins Men's team, one should certainly complete that list with \nthe Tennessee Lady Vols.\n  The greatest coach in women's basketball history, Pat Summitt, who \nrecently appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated as the ``Wizard of \nKnoxville,'' has led the Lady Vols to their third national championship \nin a row by defeating a great Louisiana Tech team by the score of 93-75 \nin the NCAA Tournament final. This victory capped a perfect season at \n39 wins and zero losses, the most victories ever for a woman's team. In \nfact, their current winning streak is 45 games.\n  I watched, along with my fellow Tennesseans, with pride as the Lady \nVols marched through their perfect season, defeating 39 teams by an \naverage margin of 30 points. And 16 of these victories were against \nteams ranked in the top 25 in the Nation. This dominance is likely to \ncontinue into next year because, as all Lady Vol fans know, only one of \nthese champion players is a senior.\n  In closing, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous effort and the \nteam play by the Lady Vols, who include team members, now familiar to \nthis country, Niya Butts, Kyra Elzy, Laurie Milligan, Misty Greene, \nKellie Jolly, Semeka Randall, Chamique Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings, \nBrynae Laxton, Kristen Clement, LaShonda Stephens, and Teresa Geter.\n  I would especially like to acknowledge the tremendous coaching job of \nPat Summitt, and all the members of the University of Tennessee who \nhave helped contribute to the building of this great dynasty. Lastly, I \nwould like to recognize the most important group, and one which I am \nhonored to be included in, the great Tennessee Vol fans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding victory of the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers in \ncapturing their third consecutive national basketball championship. And \nI ask my colleagues to join me in formally recognizing the Lady Vols as \nour country's newest sports dynasty.\n  Under the leadership of Coach Pat Summitt, the Lady Volunteers went \nundefeated this season. Only a few weeks ago, Sports Illustrated \ncompared Coach Pat Summitt to the great John Wooden. I think the \nmagazine was right on the mark.\n  Of course, many of my colleagues had their own home-state favorites \nin the tournament. But Mr. President, I say that they shouldn't be too \ndisappointed with the outcome. They might want to keep in mind that all \nthose other teams were, after all, up against a basketball dynasty that \njust finished an undefeated season of 39 wins, coming off back-to-back \nnational championships. Plus, we're talking about a Tennessee team \nhere, so what else could you expect? Frankly, Mr. President, my heart \ngoes out to anybody who would get between the UT players and the win \nthat marks their third consecutive national championship.\n  Back home in Tennessee we are very, very proud of this team. We're \nproud of the scholar-athletes. We're proud of the coaching staff. We're \nproud of the parents and the friends and the faculty who support them. \nWe're proud of a program that has made women's basketball into a \nnational phenomenon. And we're proud that at the end of this season, \nthis team wrote itself into the sports history books with six \nchampionships in twelve years.\n  This is just about as flawless a season of athletic performance as \nyou're ever going to see, and we're fortunate in Tennessee to have this \ntremendous program and these gifted, talented young people.\n  So today, I congratulate them. My colleagues have enjoyed this kind \nof excitement with teams from their own states. And I know they \nappreciate just how pleased we are in Tennessee to get bragging rights \nfor 1998. Year after year, this tremendous program and these \noutstanding young people make us proud. So, Mr. President, I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in declaring the University of Tennessee Women's \nBasketball program a certified, world-class sports dynasty.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this \nresolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 203) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 203\n\n       Whereas the Lady Volunteers (referred to in this resolution \n     as the ``Lady Vols'') won its third straight National \n     Championship in the National Collegiate Athletic Association \n     women's basketball tournament on March 29, 1998;\n       Whereas the Lady Vols finished the 1997-1998 basketball \n     season with a perfect record of 39 wins and zero losses; and\n       Whereas the Lady Vols have won 6 National Championships in \n     the last 12 years: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball team \n     should be recognized as the new dynasty in collegiate women's \n     basketball.\n\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 204) to commend and congratulate the \n     University of Kentucky on its men's basketball team winning \n     its seventh National Collegiate Athletic Association \n     championship.\n       Whereas the University of Kentucky Wildcats men's \n     basketball team defeated the University of Utah's team on \n     March 30, 1998, in San Antonio, Texas, to win its seventh \n     National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Wildcats overcame the largest halftime deficit \n     in a championship game, earning for themselves the nickname \n     ``The Comeback Cats, and\n       Whereas, Coach Tubby Smith, his staff, and his players \n     displayed outstanding dedication, teamwork, unselfishness, \n     and sportsmanship throughout the course of the season in \n     achieving collegiate basketball's highest honor; and\n       Whereas Coach Smith and the Wildcats have brought pride and \n     honor to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, which is rightly known \n     as the basketball capital of the world: now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commends and congratulates the \n     University of Kentucky on its outstanding accomplishment.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the president of the University of \n     Kentucky.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank the clerk for reading it. I \napologize for imposing upon him, but I wanted that to be a part of the \nRecord. Not many people will read the Record back home. I would like \nfor them to see and hear it. On behalf of the fans and the people of \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky, it is a great pleasure for me to come to \nthe Senate floor today to brag on a group of young men that refused to \ngive up, a team that showed us all the best about teamwork, \nselflessness, and dedication--the 1998 NCAA National Champion \nUniversity of Kentucky Wildcats.\n  The University of Kentucky has a storied tradition of outstanding \nbasketball teams; the ``Fabulous Five,'' the ``Fiddlin Five,'' ``Rupp's \nRunts,'' and more recently, ``The Unforgettables,'' to name just a few.\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\n But today, we have a new team to add to that list: ``The Comeback \nCats.''\n  Faced with a 10-point half-time deficit, the Cats overcame that \ndeficit and rallied to beat Utah, a team of outstanding athletes \nplaying under a fine coach. And by doing so, they broke the all-time \nrecord for the largest half-time deficit overcome in the NCAA Title \ngame.\n  But this was not the first time the Wildcats had to make a rally in \nthis tournament. Down to Duke by 17 in the Elite Eight and down by 10 \npoints to Stanford in the National Semifinal, the Wildcats did what \nwe've become accustomed to in Kentucky. They turned up the defense, \nthey hit the offensive boards and they hit the ``threes'' when they \ncounted.\n  And they did it on a team that can best be described as a celestial \nbody--a team with no individual stars. As Washington Post sportswriter \nMichael Wilbon noted this morning, ``This is one of the few Kentucky \nbasketball teams that is completely without a star player. But Coach \nTubby Smith convinced the players many games ago they don't need one.''\n  This is a team with three seniors as tri-captains who have all \nsacrificed: Cameron Mills, a player who'll be long remembered for his \nclutch three-pointers, came to the team as a walk-on after passing up \nscholarships to play at other schools; Allen Edwards, a three-position \nplayer fighting on after the loss of his mother; and Jeff Sheppard, a \nred shirted player last year who became this year's Most Valuable \nPlayer in the Tournament.\n  Of course all of this would not have been possible without the \nguidance and steady hand of Coach Tubby Smith, a man filling the shoes \nof a coach who became a legend in Kentucky over a few short years, Rick \nPitino.\n  Today in Kentucky they're talking about a man who led this team to \nthe Championship and has shown, as a local paper noted, that ``skill, \nintelligence and a self-effacing gentlemanliness are enough to win \ngames--and hearts.'' Tubby Smith has shown us that nice guys do, \nindeed, finish first.\n  For all the players, the coaches, the managers--and anyone else \nassociated with the team--let me say congratulations on a job well \ndone, and please know there are thousands of Kentuckians who are very \nproud of you.\n  Mr. President, I might say that of the three times the Tennessee \nwomen will have been at the White House to be honored, Kentucky will \nhave been there two of those, and they had to go into overtime to lose \nthe third one. I think we have an outstanding group of people.\n  I ask for approval of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 204) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the Senator from Kentucky is here, I \nappreciate the resolution that was offered and that was just passed in \nthe Senate. In my estimation, there have never been two teams that had \nsuch good sportsmanship. The two coaches were of such high quality. In \nall their victories along the way, they complemented each other, and \nlast night, even though one was a victor and one was the vanquished, \nthey both talked as if they had won. It was very good performance and \nset a good standard for sportsmanship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2827-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2828-S2847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEARS \n                    1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 AND 2003\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are operating under a unanimous consent \nagreement under which the next two amendments are to be proposed by \nSenator Conrad of North Dakota and Senator Coverdell of Georgia. \nNeither of them is here. We do have two Senators here who are ready to \noffer amendments, Senator Reid of Nevada and Senator Allard of \nColorado.\n  I ask unanimous consent now that we hear first from Senator Reid and \nthen from Senator Allard, warn the other two Senators that this will \ntake perhaps half an hour combined, something of that sort, and they \nwill come after that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may, in my discussion with Senator Reid of \nNevada, he believed about 15 to 20 minutes would be his maximum \nrequirement, and I spoke to the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard. He \nalso talked about the possibility of a matching 20 minutes. So in the \nunanimous consent agreement, why don't we do that, recognizing that one \nSenator may not be available to do his immediately, and as such, would \nthe Senator from Colorado be willing to do his when there is a break in \nthe schedule?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am more than glad to work with the floor managers on \nthis. I am set to preside over the Senate until 8 o'clock. I have to \nset up some charts and I am ready to go. I can be flexible, and any \nMember who thinks they want to go ahead and make comments, it is all \nright with me.\n  I just was hoping I could get to go this evening. If there was nobody \nelse that was willing to go, I was ready to go so we wouldn't lose \ntime.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. This sounds like a generous offer. I will ask now that \nSenator Reid of Nevada be recognized to offer an amendment in spite of \nthe existing unanimous consent agreement, and then when he is done, we \nwill see who is here and perhaps be able to accommodate Senator Allard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may, Mr. President, we are expecting the \nunanimous consent agreement that was propounded before that includes \nSenator Conrad followed by Senator Coverdell, and we intend to follow \nthat order, but understanding that after Senator Reid presents his, at \nSenator Allard's convenience when we have a break, we will include him \nas part of the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is important because I think \nwhat we are doing here is setting some very important public policy. \nThat public policy is that we should not auction off Federal land to \ntake care of the Endangered Species Act.\n  In short, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution I have presented to the \nSenate deals with the budget resolution and its report concerning the \nsale of excess public lands. The provision in question\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\ncalls for financing of certain landowner incentive programs through the \nsale of excess BLM land. What this means, in layman's language, is that \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee came up with an endangered \nspecies reauthorization compromise. It came out of the committee by a \nvote of 16-3 and received bipartisan support in the committee.\n  The problems that have arisen since we reported that bill are \nrelatively minor in nature. However, one of the problems that has been \ntalked about is some permanent means of financing the programs in the \nnew Endangered Species Act. I support the new Endangered Species Act, \nbut I know that there must be some form of financing for that. I am \nconvinced this is not the way to finance it. As someone who has been \ninvolved in the negotiations on the reauthorization of the Endangered \nSpecies Act, I am aware of the need to provide a dedicated source of \nfunding for these programs. These programs assist private landowners in \ncarrying out the purpose, the intention, the aim of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. That is basically protection and recovery of threatened \nand endangered species.\n  I am supportive of providing the landowners with incentive for \nproactive efforts to conserve endangered species. However, the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility in assisting landowners carrying out this \nact should not be borne by Western States, and principally one Western \nState, at this time because the real estate market is so hot in the \nsouthern Nevada area. This responsibility should not be borne basically \nby one State. The Endangered Species Act covers the whole country. In \nthat it does cover the whole country, the whole country should be \ninvolved in solving the details of it, especially the financing. It is \nnot fair that States like Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and New \nMexico be the cash cow for the Endangered Species Act.\n  The Endangered Species Act and requirements apply to all 50 States. \nIt is a national Federal law because, Mr. President, there is a \nnational Federal interest in the protection and conservation of \nendangered species. We shouldn't turn our Federal lands into a land \nbank that finances this important act.\n  I understand the importance of Federal land. The State of Nevada is \n87 percent owned by the Federal Government. I repeat, 87 percent of the \nState of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government; 13 percent of that \nland is owned by private parties. We want to get more of that land in \nthe public sector into the private sector, but we want to do it in an \norderly fashion, and we have done that in the soon-to-be second largest \ncity in Nevada. Henderson, NV, is the place where I went to high \nschool. At that time, it was a community of about 10,000 people. It is \nnow approaching 200,000 people and growing very rapidly--the most \nrapidly growing city in all of Nevada; in fact, one of the most rapidly \ngrowing communities in all of America.\n\n  Now, the reason it has been allowed to grow is because we have added \nFederal land to the land base of the city of Henderson. It has had a \nvery orderly growth. We have some planned communities. One of the most \nimportant planned communities anywhere in the country is a place called \nGreen Valley. It is a beautiful community. Mr. President, that has been \ndone in an orderly fashion. It hasn't been forced upon anyone. It \nwasn't done at auction. That, in effect, is what we are talking about \nhere. They are public lands that belong to the public for their \nenjoyment.\n  Not only has Henderson received the benefit of public lands, but \nother places throughout the State of Nevada, like Mesquite, Carlin, NV. \nWe could go on with many other examples. These are public lands and \nthey belong to the public for their enjoyment.\n  Are we going to auction off all the nice places in Nevada and then \nonly people of wealth who can buy those lands will be able to use those \nnice places in Nevada? I hope not. That is in effect what they are \ndoing here. They are mandating in this budget resolution the sale of \npublic lands to meet the needs of the Endangered Species Act. Mandating \nthe sale and using the proceeds to fund programs outside the State \nwhere the land is would be patently unfair.\n  This body should reject this misguided proposal and support this \namendment. It is surprising to me that any Western Senator could \nsupport the underlying provision in this budget resolution saying we \nare going to auction off Federal lands the purpose of which is to carry \nout the intent of the Endangered Species Act. Apart from the regional \nStates' specific bias, the amendment should also be rejected on \nenvironmental grounds. This will be one of the key environmental votes \nof this Congress, or any Congress.\n\n  Opponents of this provision in the budget resolution are Friends of \nthe Earth, American Oceans Campaign, Center for Marine Conservation, \nDefenders of Wildlife Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, Environmental \nDefense Fund, Grassroots Environmental Effectiveness Network, Izaak \nWalton League of America, National Audubon Society, National Wildlife \nFederation, Natural Resource Defense Council, Trout Unlimited, U.S. \nPublic Interest Research Group, Western Ancient Forest Campaign, the \nWilderness Society, the World Wildlife Fund, and many others.\n  The League of Conservation Voters is looking at this very closely, I \nam told, as they should.\n  We have worked closely with these groups over the past years in \ncoming up with the Endangered Species Act. One of their strongest \nconcerns in this period of time is to ensure that we put in place a \nlong-term mechanism to finance these programs. The proposal included in \nthis resolution funds these important programs only for limited times \nand only for the one-time revenue scheme. As a matter of public policy, \nthis doesn't make sense. The demand to participate in the program and \nadditional obligation to maintain incentives over time is going to \ncreate a tremendous pressure to sell additional public lands.\n  That isn't how we should get rid of public lands, how we should get \npublic lands into the private sector. We should not do it on a forced \nsale. It should be done in an orderly process, certainly not an auction \nso that we need money this year because we have three endangered \nspecies listed in Florida, two in Colorado, one in Nevada, and three in \nHawaii. That isn't the way it should be.\n  To show you how disingenuous those who are pushing this proposal are, \nthe Bureau of Land Management sells an average of 5,000 acres per year \nfor about $2.5 million. It is interesting to note that Congress Daily \nquotes an unnamed BLM official as saying the Budget Committee estimates \n$350 million revenue from this proposal. Absurd. It is impossible.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of appropriate justifications for \ndisposal of public lands. I have talked about the city of Henderson, \nthe city of Carlin, the city of Mesquite, and other places in Nevada. I \nhave also worked closely with Senator Bryan and my two colleagues from \nthe House on the Nevada Public Lands Act, which provides for the \ndisposal of certain public lands in Nevada--a good piece of \nlegislation. We are going to have a hearing in May on this matter \nbefore the committee of the senior Senator from Alaska, who is the \nchairman of the committee. We have confidence that he will report that \nbill out favorably and that it will pass.\n  Now, why in the world would they--whoever ``they'' are pushing this \nbudget resolution--want to undermine something that is working well? We \nhave general support from the committee--I spoke to the chairman \nmyself--on the Nevada Public Lands Act. And it applies not only to \nNevada, but to the entire West. It would allow lands to be auctioned, \nand those moneys would stay in the State from where the land is sold \nfor environmental concerns. There may be a special piece of land that \nthe Federal Government wants. There may be some things that the Federal \nGovernment needs, and auctioning off these lands would allow them to do \nthat.\n\n  For example, we have a number of things in the State of Nevada for \nwhich the Federal Government wants these lands. They do not want the \nland to be subdivided. It is a special place to be used for a park or \nrecreational purposes. So these lands would be auctioned off, and you \ncould purchase that land to put it in the public sector or the private \nsector.\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\n  So I think it is important that some of the lands we identified in \nour legislation--the Nevada Public Lands Act--would, of course, be used \nnow for this legislation, the budget resolution. That is not the way it \nshould be. I am very concerned. I have worked long and hard on the \nEndangered Species Act, but I am not about to be part of an Endangered \nSpecies Act if it has this as a source of funding. I think there is \nprobably some concern about why this is put in the budget resolution. I \nguess it is kind of like a fire auction. You get the best you can with \nwhat you have. I think what they have in this instance is a hot real \nestate market in the State of Nevada, southern Nevada particularly, and \nthey are going to sell this land as quickly as they can. I think that \nis wrong. The amount of public lands in Las Vegas would be the only \nlikely source today of a significant amount of money to fund these \nproposed programs. Tomorrow, it may be the outskirts of Denver. Next \nyear, it may be the outskirts of Albuquerque. These would be places \nthey would go to raise as much money as they could as quickly as they \ncan--fire sales to fund the Endangered Species Act. Funds would then be \nmade available for incentives throughout the country, not just in \nNevada. This is a conflict with the legislation that I have talked \nabout earlier that is now before the Energy Committee. The resolution \nputs in place a public lands disposal policy that is entirely driven by \nthe need to sell excess lands. But unlike the meritorious programs they \nwill fund, which are temporary, the disposal of public lands is \npermanent.\n  Mr. President, I have said that this proposal is a poison pill. I \nbelieve it is intended to kill reauthorization of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. We have been negotiating the reauthorization of this \nmonumental act for 2 years or more, along with Senators Baucus, Chafee, \nKempthorne, and the administration. We sought to secure a dedicated \nsource of funding for these private land programs. This is not it. \nWhile I can't speak for the administration, I repeat that we were never \nconsulted on this proposal. Frankly, I don't like it. I think it is a \npoison pill. If our amendment is defeated, as far as I am concerned, it \nis the death of the Endangered Species Act. I could not agree to \nsupporting a bill which so unfairly exploits the value of Nevada public \nlands and undermines the legislation. It has been more than a year in \nthe making, the Nevada Public Lands Act.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make part of the Record a letter from \nthe group of environmental concerns, including Friends of the Earth, \nAmerican Oceans Campaign, and others, dated March 30, 1998. I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record, along with \na letter dated March 31 from the Sierra Club dealing with this subject, \nand a letter from the League of Conservation Voters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 30, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to express our concern over a \n     proposal described in the Senate Budget Resolution to use the \n     proceeds from the sale of public lands under the Interior \n     Department's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to fund the \n     private landowner incentive programs of S. 1180.\n       In general, we are supportive of providing private \n     landowners with incentives for proactive efforts to conserve \n     endangered species and would like them funded through \n     sustainable, long-term revenue mechanisms. However, under the \n     proposal being developed, the landowner incentives programs \n     in S. 1180 would be funded presumably only for a limited time \n     from a one-time revenue scheme. Thereafter, additional \n     revenues would need to be generated to continue funding of \n     these programs. The demand to participate in this program, \n     and the obligation to maintain the incentives over time, \n     could create pressure to sell additional public land if \n     other, more acceptable, revenue sources were not identified. \n     We believe a more sustained funding mechanism is needed.\n       In addition to failing to establish a reliable source of \n     funding, the proposal would set an unacceptable precedent \n     regarding the sale of public lands. Our public lands are an \n     integral part of America's national heritage, and we strongly \n     oppose the sell-off of such important assets. Disposing of \n     public lands may be appropriate when the planning process \n     concludes it is in the public interest to exchange or sell \n     certain parcels. In such cases, the lands could be exchanged \n     for--or revenues dedicated to--acquisition and permanent \n     protection of lands that contain important natural habitats \n     and/or resources. However, the need for revenues should not \n     drive the decision-making on disposal of public lands. That \n     is exactly the wrong reason to sell off public lands. From a \n     policy and budget perspective, it is not appropriate to tie \n     the permanent disposal of taxpayer-owned property to \n     temporary measures for endangered species.\n       While we support efforts to find the necessary resources to \n     fund the protection of endangered species, we believe this \n     proposal creates serious problems and we will oppose it.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gawain Kripke,\n       Director, Appropriations Project, Friends of the Earth.\n     Ted Morton,\n       Program Counsel, American Oceans Campaign.\n     Wm.

This proposal would set a dangerous \n     precedent regarding the management of our federal public \n     lands and the amount and quality of public land available to \n     future generations of Americans. The Sierra Club is firmly \n     opposed to the selling off of these important assets.\n       Sierra Club is generally supportive of providing small, \n     private landowners with incentives for proactive conservation \n     measures, but such measures should be funded through \n     sustainable means. The mechanism proposed in the Senate \n     Budget Resolution is problematic because it fails to \n     establish a reliable source of funding. Under the Proposal, \n     funding for landowner incentives would likely come from the \n     one-time sale of BLM lands. This would not provide a sound \n     funding program for landowner incentives, and would create \n     pressure to sell off additional public lands.\n       Some in Congress support the outright ``disposal'' of our \n     public lands. The budget bill should under no circumstances \n     be used as a backdoor mechanism to achieve this controversial \n     goal.\n       Later this week, a Sense of the Senate amendment will \n     likely be offered by Senator Harry Reid and Dale Bumpers in \n     opposition\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\n     to this provision. We strongly urge you to support this \n     amendment and protect our federal public lands from this \n     precedent setting provision. In addition, we urge you to \n     refer to our previously delivered coalition letter in support \n     Senator Frank Lautenberg's amendment to provide adequate \n     funding for environmental protection programs. . .\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Debbie Sease,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                                   March 30, 1998.\n     Re Senate Concurrent Resolution 86. supporting the Latenberg \n         amendment to fund environment and national resource \n         protection.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, the League of Conservation Voters is the \n     bipartisan, political arm of the national environmental \n     movement. Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of Members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is \n     distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide and \n     the press.\n       Last year's balanced budget agreement contemplated \n     decreasing spending every year until at least 2003 for \n     natural resources and environmental programs. The American \n     public has made clear that clean water, our public lands, \n     fisheries and wildlife management, and other environmental \n     programs require a higher priority than was reflected in this \n     agreement.\n       During consideration of the Budget Resolution, S. Con. Res. \n     86, LCV urges you to support an amendment by Senator \n     Lautenberg (D-NJ) that would restore funding for critical \n     environment and natural resource programs that were proposed \n     in the President's budget but omitted from the Resolution. \n     This amendment would address the following crucial \n     environmental initiatives:\n       The Clean Water Action Plan which will provide increased \n     resources to states, tribes and individuals in order to \n     address polluted runoff from urban areas, agriculture, mining \n     and other sources.\n       A continuation of funding for the Drinking Water and Clean \n     Water State Revolving Loan Funds which will help to ensure \n     that our drinking water and wastewater treatment \n     infrastructure can meet water quality and public health needs \n     for the next century.\n       The Land, Water and Facility Restoration Initiative, which \n     provides increased funding for ``Safe Visits to Public \n     Lands'' and ``Supporting the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     Vision''.\n       An increase in funding to continue progress in cleanups at \n     Superfund sites around the nation, where many communities \n     have been waiting for over a decade to have toxic and \n     hazardous sites restored to safety.\n       In addition, LCV urges you to support any amendments to \n     address the following:\n       We understand that an amendment may be offered to reduce or \n     eliminate the existing tax subsidy for mining on public and \n     parented lands--known as the percentage depletion allowance.\n       The Budget Resolution assumes that landowner incentives \n     programs for endangered species would be funded from the \n     proceeds of the sale of public lands under the Interior \n     Department's Bureau of Land Management. This proposal would \n     set an unacceptable precedent regarding the sale of public \n     lands and would fail to provide a sustainable, long-term \n     revenue mechanism for endangered species protection.\n       America's land, water, fish, wildlife and plants are \n     irreplaceable natural assets that belong to, and benefit our \n     entire nation: their protection and stewardship warrant the \n     modest increase in funding that Senator Lautenberg's \n     amendment would allow. LCV's Political Advisory Committee \n     will consider including votes on S. Con. Res. 86 in compiling \n     LCV's 1998 Scorecard. Thank you for your consideration of \n     this issue. If you need more information please call Paul \n     Brotherton in my office at (202) 785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I have indicated earlier in my \npresentation, I think that Senator Bumpers, at a subsequent time, would \nlike to come speak on this. His not being here today does not waive his \nability to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota is ready, we just heard from the Senator from Nevada; he \nput his amendment in. Further action will occur at the appropriate \ntime.\n  I would like now to ask our colleague from North Dakota to present an \namendment he has been waiting for.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2174\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment on behalf \nof myself; Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee; Senator Bingaman of New Mexico; and Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will address one of the problems with \nthe budget resolution that was passed out of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. The Senate budget resolution says that if any tobacco \nrevenues are forthcoming as a result of a conclusion to the tobacco \ncontroversy, that money can only be used for the Medicare Program.\n  I would be the first to acknowledge the critical importance of \nMedicare and to say that some of the tobacco revenues ought to go for \nthat purpose. In fact, the measure that I have introduced, which has 32 \ncosponsors in the U.S. Senate, provides for some of the funds to go to \nstrengthen the Medicare Program. But there are other important \npriorities as well. Under the budget resolution passed by the \nRepublican majority in the Budget Committee, none of the funds can go \nfor other purposes to address the tobacco challenge facing our country. \nIn fact, none of the funds that could come from a resolution of the \ntobacco issue could be used for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, \ncounter-tobacco-advertising programs, to expand health research on \ntobacco-related issues, to provide for additional funding for FDA \nincreased regulatory authority over the tobacco industry.\n  That just seems to be a serious mistake. Every single expert that \ncame before our task force on the tobacco legislation said that if you \nare going to be serious about protecting the public health, if you are \ngoing to be serious about reducing youth smoking, you need a \ncomprehensive plan, a plan that raises prices to deter youth from \ntaking up the habit; you need to have smoking cessation and smoking \nprevention programs; you need to have counter-tobacco advertising. You \nalso need to expand FDA's regulatory authority. And, yes, you should \nhave expanded health research into the diseases caused by tobacco \naddiction and tobacco use.\n  The resolution from our friends on the other side of the aisle says \nno to all of those other priorities. It says there is only one \npriority. It says all of the money should go for only one purpose. Mr. \nPresident, that is just a mistake. If we look at all of the \ncomprehensive bills that have been introduced in this Chamber by \nRepublicans and Democrats, every single one of those comprehensive \nbills provides funding for matters other than just Medicare. They \nprovide money for smoking cessation, for smoking prevention, for \ncounter-tobacco advertising, for expanded FDA regulatory authority, for \nincreased health research into the problems caused by the addiction and \ndisease brought on by the use of tobacco products.\n  I brought this chart that compares reality to rhetoric. If we look at \nthe policy goals in all of the comprehensive bills that have been \nintroduced in this Chamber, bills by three Republican chairmen--Senator \nMcCain, chairman of the Commerce Committee; Senator Hatch, chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee; and also Senator Lugar, chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee--all of those bills provide for funding for these \nother priorities. In addition to my own bill, the HEALTHY Kids Act, \nSenator Lautenberg's bill and Senator Kennedy's bill, all of them use \ntobacco revenue for anti-youth-smoking-education initiatives--every \nsingle one of them, Republicans and Democrats, provide for using some \nof the funds for that purpose. The Republican budget alternative \navailable on the floor says no money for that purpose. All of the \nbills, Republicans' and Democrats', that have been introduced on the \nfloor, use some of the tobacco revenue for public service advertising \nto counter the industry's targeting of our kids. But the Republican \nbudget that is before the Senate says no money can be used for counter-\ntobacco advertising.\n  Mr. President, all of the major bills that have been introduced say \nuse some of the tobacco revenue to fund tobacco-related medical \nresearch. That just makes common sense. But the Republican budget \nalternative says not one dime from a resolution of the tobacco \ncontroversy can be used for that purpose. What sense does that make? \nAll of the major bills that have been introduced by Republicans and \nDemocrats say some of the tobacco revenue should be used to fund \nsmoking cessation programs. The Republican budget says no. The \nRepublican budget says not one penny out of the tobacco revenues for \nthe purpose of funding smoking-cessation programs. What sense does that \nmake? All of the major bills say use part of the tobacco revenue to \nassist tobacco farmers.\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\n  The Republican budget resolution says no; not one dime to ease the \ntransition for tobacco farmers that would result from the passage of \ntobacco legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Republican budget resolution would hold every \ncomprehensive tobacco bill that has been introduced by Republicans or \nDemocrats to be out of order on the floor of the Senate--all of them. \nThey would all be out of order under the Republican budget resolution. \nWhat sense does that make?\n  I submit that we can do better. We should do better. We have the \nopportunity to respond by taking what is in the Republican budget \nresolution with respect to the funds that would be taken in, the \nrevenue that might result if we are able to resolve the tobacco \nquestion, and, instead of only allowing those funds to be used for the \nMedicare Program, to broaden the use of those funds to allow them to be \nspent in a way the American people want to see them spent, and the way \nevery bill which is comprehensive which has been introduced by \nRepublicans or Democrats provides. It is in my amendment; that is, not \nonly should the money go for Medicare; yes, some of the money should go \nfor that purpose; but some of the money should go for public health \nefforts to reduce the use of tobacco products by children, including \ntobacco control, education, and prevention programs, \ncounteradvertising, research, and smoking cessation.\n  Every expert who came before our task force--we heard from over 100 \nwitnesses--said you have to have a comprehensive plan, you have to do \nsome or all of these things, if you are going to be successful at \nprotecting the public health; you have to do some or all of these \nthings if you are really going to be successful at reducing youth \nsmoking.\n  We should also provide the chance, at least for comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation, to provide assistance for tobacco farmers. The budget \nresolution before us says no; no help for tobacco farmers. Not only are \nwe not going to have any money from tobacco revenues for smoking \ncessation, for smoking prevention, or for health research, we have no \nmoney to assist tobacco farmers and their communities.\n  We also provide increased funding, or at least the chance for \nincreased funding, for the Food and Drug Administration, which, under \nvirtually every bill that is out here, would be asked to take on a \ngreater role and more responsibility. If they are going to be given \nmore obligations, they ought to be given the funding to match those \nobligations. They ought to be told yes, those additional resources to \nregulate the tobacco product will be provided. Virtually every bill \nthat has been introduced here by Republicans and Democrats says that is \nan appropriate outcome. The Republican budget resolution says no--not \none thin dime for that purpose, or for the purpose of the farmers, or \nfor the purpose of smoking cessation, smoking prevention, health \nresearch, or countertobacco advertising--no tobacco revenues to be used \nfor that purpose.\n  Mr. President, it just doesn't make sense. Yes, we provide that the \nfunds which would be set aside taken from the tobacco revenues could \nalso be used for expanded health research. If there is one thing we \nhave heard from the experts, it is that we need to know more about the \ncauses of the diseases which flow from the addiction and the use of \nthese tobacco products.\n  The National Institutes of Health need additional funding to look \ninto the cancers caused by the use of tobacco products, to examine the \nheart problems caused by the use of tobacco products, to examine the \nemphysema which is caused by the use of tobacco products. We need to do \nmore research to understand the role of addiction in causing the \ndiseases which flow from the use of tobacco products. But the budget \nresolution which is before us says no; not one thin dime for any of \nthose purposes out of tobacco revenue.\n\n  That contradicts every single public health organization and every \nsingle public health leader in America. Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler have \npleaded with us: If you are going to have an effective program of \nprotecting the public health, if you are going to have an effective \nprogram to reduce use of smoking, you have to have a comprehensive \nplan; you have to have one which addresses every one of these aspects. \nYou can't just limit it to Medicare.\n  Yes, Medicare is very important. There is no question about it. Our \nlegislation would provide some of the funding for Medicare. Our \nlegislation would provide some of the funding for Social Security, \nwhich the Republican budget resolution also precludes. They wouldn't \nprovide a penny to strengthen Social Security. They oppose providing \nany help to Social Security, even though we know it faces a demographic \ntime bomb, the same demographic time bomb that Medicare faces. But they \nsay no for any money to strengthen and protect Social Security. And \nthey say no to any funding for smoking prevention, smoking cessation, \ncountertobacco advertising, and additional health research out of the \ntobacco revenues. It does not make sense.\n  Mr. President, I am going to turn now to my colleagues, my leading \ncosponsor, Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, and Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who is here as well. I \ndon't know--Senator Reed has been waiting--if he would like to comment \nnow, or if Senator Lautenberg would like to take this opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask how much time the Senator from \nRhode Island would need.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island may proceed.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I strongly support the amendment proposed by Senator Conrad, Senator \nLautenberg, and my colleagues. The budget resolution before us today \ndoes not give us a fighting chance to do what we want to do, but more \nimportantly, what the American people want us to do. That is to reduce \nteenage smoking in the United States. We know it is a curse. We know it \nis causing incalculable pain throughout this country in terms of health \nproblems down the road.\n  But this budget resolution does not give us the tools to grapple with \nthe issue of teen smoking. It is illogical, too, as Senator Conrad \npointed out so eloquently. All of the major legislative initiatives \nhave specific provisions which require anti-youth-smoking efforts, \nincreased research at the National Institutes of Health, FDA regulatory \nauthority, State regulatory authority, and none of these can be funded \nfrom the budget resolution.\n  But there is something that is even more illogical, in my view. I do \nnot want to take a brief for the tobacco industry. But with every one \nof these major pieces of legislation for the tobacco industry, you must \nreduce teen smoking by 50 percent, 60 percent, or 70 percent in so many \nyears. Yet, if we take all of  the proceeds from the increased tobacco \ntaxes and all the other payments and we don't use them in some way to \ntry to suppress teen smoking through counteradvertising campaigns, to \ntry to get people who are addicted to nicotine over the addiction, \nthere is no way that these goals can be met. We are setting up a test \nthat is bound to fail. We have to recognize that if we are serious \nabout mandating the reduction of teen smoking by significant \npercentages over the next several years, we have to provide the \nresources to do that job. This budget resolution does not make such a \nprovision. It does not allow us to take the proceeds of whatever \ntobacco deal is ultimately reached and use those proceeds to invest in \na healthier America, to invest in the health of our children.\n\n  All of these provisions, which Senator Conrad has outlined, are so \nabsolutely necessary in making any proposed agreement work, and also, \nfundamentally, to ensure that we reduce teen smoking, we have to adopt \na very strong anti-youth-smoking effort. The principal means to do that \nis a counteradvertising campaign. Every year, the tobacco industry \nspends $5 billion on advertising, billboards, sporting events, teams, \nsponsorships, giveaways--hats, jackets, whatever, key chains--a \npowerful influence on the youth of America. In fact, all of us can \nthink back through our sort of history, and, even if we do not smoke, \nwe know we have been terribly influenced by tobacco advertising \ncampaigns.\n  I was on the floor a few weeks ago talking about the legislation \nwhich I\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\nhad, and it came to me that if I asked anyone who is roughly my age--I \nwill be kind, about 40--if I asked them what LSMFT meant, the light \nbulb would go right on. If I ask these young ladies and gentleman, they \nwould say it is gibberish. I see the shake of the head. They do not \nknow. LSMFT means ``Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco.'' Through \nliterally millions of dollars of advertising over 20 or 30 years, a \nwhole generation, or more, of Americans understood that. We have to \nreverse that. We have to convince a whole generation of Americans now \nand in the future that tobacco is dangerous, addictive, and will \nultimately kill them. We can't do it just with good wishes here on the \nfloor of the Senate; we have to do it with real resources. This budget \nresolution will not give us a chance to do that.\n  We have to look seriously at NIH research, because there are \nopportunities perhaps to develop antidotes to nicotine, to the harmful \neffects of tobacco smoke. There are ways through science and research. \nWe might have better ways to wean individuals off tobacco smoke. All of \nthese things have to be done if we are going to meet our objective of \nusing this historic opportunity, this historic agreement, to improve \nthe public health of Americans.\n  We also have to ensure that the FDA has the resources to do the job \nof enforcing on the tobacco industry. We know every year it is a battle \nhere through the appropriations process to fund worthwhile programs for \nthe FDA. We know at the end of the day that there are many worthwhile \nprograms which just do not make the cut, not because they are bad but \njust because we run out of money long before the public health \ncommunity runs out of problem. If we do not provide within this \nresolution for the use of the resources of the tobacco industry to \ninvest in FDA, we are not going to be able to give them the tools to do \nthe job to make sure that smoking is not contagious among young people.\n  Add to that our responsibility to help the States provide an \nimportant part of this overall agreement. We expect--in fact, in most \nof the legislation it is clearly explicitly written--that the States \nwill fund elaborate programs of access control to tobacco through \nlicenses of clerks, thorough investigations and inspections of \nfacilities that are selling tobacco products, ensuring that products \ndon't mysteriously appear in the State without these controls.\n\n  All of that takes money, and the States are going to look to us and \nsay, ``Listen. You are the folks that have all of the money. You are \nthe ones that are getting the $500 billion over so many years from \nincreased taxes and increased fees and penalty payments. We need this \nto ensure that we can control access to tobacco products.''\n  One of the other aspects is thrown in our face constantly when we \ntalk about this tobacco arrangement. That is the possibility, or the \nprobability, the eventuality, of a black market in cigarettes because \nthe price is going up. How are we going to counteract this black market \nif we do not have the resources at the State level and the FDA level \nand through other law enforcement means to actually counteract the \npotential growth of black markets? Once again, I don't see within this \nbudget resolution those types of resources being available.\n  We also have to fund smoking cessation programs. Mr. President, 70 \npercent of smokers today want to quit. But wanting to quit and being \nable to beat this addiction are two different things. They cannot do it \nwithout resources--without access to counsel, without access to \nnicotine patches, without access to those items which are going to \nensure that they can avoid their present dilemma, which is smoking but \nwanting desperately to quit.\n  Then, as Senator Conrad also pointed out, every one of these pieces \nof legislation includes substantial payments to farmers who are likely \nto lose their valuable crops because tobacco is going to be suppressed \nin this country--not prohibited, not outlawed--but certainly we hope \nthe demand will begin to shrink for tobacco products as fewer people \nsmoke, particularly fewer young people smoke. Every one of these bills \nhas it. Both sides of this aisle are trumpeting their support for the \nfarmer. They are not going to let these innocent victims of this \nindustry be left adrift without any resources, cut off from a lucrative \neconomic crop and left to their own devices. Yet, once again, within \nthe confines or context of this resolution, there is no resource to do \nthe job.\n  We have to do something. Frankly, this amendment makes so much sense. \nIt allows for the funding of all of these provisions. It allows for \nother important uses of the tobacco settlement, too. But at a minimum \nit allows us to do what we have to do, and I am supportive, not only of \nthis effort but overall of developing strong and tough tobacco \nlegislation. We have an opportunity, a historic opportunity, for the \nfirst time in many, many years, to put America on the path of sense and \nsanity when it comes to smoking policy.\n  We can, we hope, empower a generation of young Americans with the \nknowledge and with the support to stop smoking. If we do that, we will \nreap a tremendous benefit in a healthier America and a healthier \nsociety. Yet, without these resources we cannot, in fact, go forward \nbecause this budget resolution does not give us the opportunity and the \nflexibility to go ahead and do, again, not only what I want to do, what \nI assume the vast majority of my colleagues want to do, but what our \nconstituents demand that we do: Use these historic opportunities, when \nthe industry has recognized its past mistakes, when the industry is \nattempting to change its culture, when we have for the first time the \nsupport not only of the American people but the cooperation, to a \ndegree at least, of the industry, to ensure that we prevent young \npeople from smoking.\n  The fear is we will have debates on this floor about all of these \nlegislative materials and all of the different aspects of the proposed \nagreements, but, ultimately, when it comes down to the bottom line, \nwhen we have to put our money where our words are, there will be no \nmoney because this resolution takes that option off the table for us. \nSo I hope all of my colleagues will join us in supporting this \namendment, will join us in the continued effort to ensure that we have \ngood, tough tobacco legislation, but legislation that not only will say \nthe right things but have the money and resources to do the right \nthings.\n  My colleague from New Jersey, I think, is going to speak in a moment. \nI think he is present. While he is coming forward, let me just say that \nwe have before us a very challenging set of issues. This is a critical \none, getting this budget resolution in a shape where it will support \nsound legislation on the floor. There are other issues, too, that will \ncome up before us.\n\n  Many aspects of this proposed settlement are controversial, not only \nbetween the two contesting parties, the tobacco industry and those who \nare trying to protect the public health, but also controversial by \ntheir nature. I talked a little bit about the need for adequate \nresources to fund smoking cessation advertisements that will actually \ngo out and convince young people not to smoke. That will become \nparticularly crucial if some provisions we have in the legislation are \nstricken down because of the first amendment. As you realize, most of \nthese legislative initiatives contain language which essentially asks \nthat the industry give up their first amendment rights to advertise in \nexchange for immunity protection. There is always the threat that \nsomeone--perhaps not even in the tobacco industry, perhaps a third \nparty, like convenience stores--would come out and suggest that these \nrestrictions are contrary to the first amendment. In this regard, we \nwould really definitely, most definitively, need resources to keep up \nan effective counteradvertising campaign.\n  So for these reasons and many others, we must, I think, support this \namendment, and we must, in fact, ensure that we have the dollars as \nwell as the legislative language to prevent teen smoking. If we do \nthat, then we will achieve the historic conclusion to these debates.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, \nSenator Reed. He has been one of the most dedicated members on our task \nforce on tobacco. He has been absolutely committed to the effort to \nform sound national tobacco policy. Nobody\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\nworked harder in our task force. Nobody is more thoughtful, more \ncreative about how we approach this set of challenges and problems than \nthe Senator from Rhode Island. I thank him personally and publicly for \nthe role that he has played.\n  If we ultimately succeed in passing comprehensive national tobacco \nlegislation, in no small measure it will be because of the contribution \nof the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed. I especially thank him \nfor his contribution to the debate on this amendment, because I think \nthis goes right to the heart of the question. Are we going to have a \nchance to write comprehensive national tobacco legislation or are we \ngoing to be foreclosed and that effort endangered because the \nRepublican budget resolution puts at risk any chance of passing a \ncomprehensive bill? They would create supermajority vote requirements \nto pass any comprehensive tobacco bill. Instead of requiring 50 votes \nor 51 votes, we would have to have supermajority votes of over 60 \nbecause they have created points of order against any of the major \nbills that have been introduced by Republicans or Democrats.\n  This is a matter that must be fixed. This amendment that Senator \nLautenberg and Senator Reed and Senator Bingaman and I have introduced \nis the key to unlocking the chance to have national tobacco \nlegislation. So I especially thank my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Reed.\n  Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield 30 seconds, just to not only \ncommend the Senator and thank him for his kind words, but also for his \ntremendous leadership with respect to the tobacco task force and also \nto commend the senior Senator from New Jersey for his leadership over \nmany years. I thank both the  Senators.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their kind \ncomments and would say, while this looks like a mutual admiration \nsociety, we kind of get that way because we work on an issue we care an \nawful lot about, something with which several of us have had a history \nfor a long time. I particularly say what a delight it is to work with \nour distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad. He is \nalways very thorough in his review of budget matters or whatever the \nsubject is. He is on the Finance Committee. He has done a lot of good \nwork there and has earned the respect of all the people he works with \nbecause he is so thoughtful and so deliberate and so direct in the \nthings he sees and that he wants to work on.\n  Senator Conrad was designated as chairman of the tobacco task force \nby our leader. It was a singular honor, because what the minority \nleader wanted to do was to pick someone whose objectivity could be \ncounted on because we do have different views on how we ought to treat \nthe tobacco negotiations, deal with the tobacco companies, and deal \nwith our constituents and the public at large. The Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, chose Senator Conrad because he knew he could be \ncounted on to do a thorough analysis, bring the parties together, and \ncertainly that has been the case. Senator Conrad had people there who \nwere friends of the industry, unabashedly. They made sure the industry \npoint of view was being represented. On the other hand, we had those \nfrom the science community, Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, and people who \nhad seen the effects of tobacco directly in their homes and often on \ntheir own person.\n  So he has done a thorough job all the way through the discussions \nhere. We have a chance now to finally come to the beginning of the \nanalysis of what might take place here in the Senate as it regards a \nkind of comprehensive settlement. It is discouraging, I must say, at \nthis point, to find out, despite the good intentions of our friends on \nthe other side, that we wind up with a budget resolution facing us that \ntotally restricts our ability to work with the problem. The problem, \nvery simply, is how do we protect young people--kids, if I may use the \naffectionate expression--kids, from starting to smoke when they are 8, \n9, 10, 11 years old? We had a boy, a young man, in front of our \ncommittee. I think he was 12, a young man from Iowa, 12 years old. He \nwas pleading for help to stop his addiction--12 years old--because he \ndidn't want his little brother to start smoking and be addicted to \ntobacco--12 years old. He said he was already hooked and he tried to \nstop several times.\n  I looked at him and I said, ``My gosh, how can that happen that \nsomeone that age, still in the full bloom of development and growth, \nhow could he be hooked on tobacco?'' He told it as it was. He wasn't a \ncity slicker. He was a boy from--kind of country. He came in with a \nmember of the police department, as I remember, who was his friend and \nkind of counselor.\n  We have lost the mission, I think, by directing the language so that \nwe are hamstrung. We are unable to say to the country at large that \nwhat we want to do is we want to see that the tobacco industry finally \nmakes up for some of the terrible damage it has brought on our \ncommunity, brought on our people. We lose sight of that sometimes, the \ndamage, as we go through the debate, because we talk about  immunity \nfrom the suit, protection from litigation, talking about how we can cut \na deal with the tobacco industry. I, frankly, think it comes under the \numbrella of nonsense.\n\n  I don't like to be casual with language. We are dealing with an \nindustry that has taken a terrible toll on America. To put it in some \nframe that makes it quite clear, in all of the wars of the 20th \ncentury--World War II, World War I, Korea, Vietnam--the casualties, \nthose killed in combat in all the wars of the 20th century, don't equal \nthe number that die each year as a result of smoking. It is incredible \nwhen you think about it.\n  We know there are over 400,000 deaths a year, most of them premature, \noften fatal after surgery--after surgery--lungs, throat, you name it, \nrespiratory conditions galore, gastrointestinal conditions. We found \nout not too long ago, via the Harvard School of Public Health, that in \naddition to those who we knew died from tobacco-developed illnesses, \nthat those who have exposure to secondhand smoke, numbering over 50,000 \npersons a year, 50,000 persons a year have fatal heart attacks, fatal \nheart attacks from exposure to secondhand smoke.\n  We look at this and we say, ``Well, what do we do about our \narrangement with the companies?''\n  The first thing we have begun to find out--and we are about to find \nout a lot more--is what they have hidden in their planning over the \nyears, their papers over the years, their attempt to hide information \nfrom the public by pretending that there is a client-attorney \nrelationship.\n  The reason I mention these things is, we have to understand who it is \nthat we are working with, that we are talking to. This is an industry \nwhich has been a foul-play industry for decades, knowing very well that \naddiction was being created by the manipulation of the nicotine, trying \nto grow plants that have a higher nicotine content that will addict \nquicker and firmer.\n  After a lot of discussion, after the attorneys general of most of the \nStates in the country have met and have fashioned out what they think \nis a settlement--which we didn't all fully agree with, but they made a \nstart, and I give them credit--they began to lay out what the \nparameters might be, an arrangement which would have the companies \nstepping up to help us develop a proper public health policy, because \nthat is the primary mission.\n  Money, in this case, while not unimportant, is certainly a secondary \npart of the discussion, because with that money what we want to do is \nstop kids from smoking. We want to teach people how to stop even after \nthey have begun smoking. We want to do some research. We want to find \nout what that nicotine does to the body, to the lungs, to the digestive \nsystem--the whole thing. We want to be able to stand up face to face \nwith the powerful tobacco industry and say, ``Hey, listen; whatever you \ndo, understand that we are going to limit your ability to get your \nmessage out to children and to other unsuspecting people, and we want \nyou to pay for it, but we want you to work with us to help us develop \nthese programs.''\n  We thought we were doing pretty well, because that proposed \nsettlement served as a springboard for other discussions. It served as \na springboard for what else we might do, as the President so carefully \nand positively laid out. We saw that there would be programs as a \nresult of an agreement with\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\nthe tobacco companies and to ask the public to join in and help pay for \nsome of the costs that tobacco renders on our society. There are \nguesstimates that it goes from $30 billion, $40 billion a year, up to \n$100 billion a year when you talk about lost productivity and problems \nwhich arise for individuals and families which go beyond just the \ntreatment of the health problem. We worked hard.\n  Mr. President, we have just been joined by the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee, who has become a friend over the years as we \nworked together and with whom we had an unusually successful program \nlast year to get to a balanced budget, to help continue the process \nbegun by President Clinton and his policy and watch that deficit go \ndown. We look forward to surpluses in the future, possibly over $1 \ntrillion in the next decade. Think about what good we could do with \nthat money.\n  The President laid it out very carefully. It had to do with teen \nsmoking programs, how we stop that from happening, and all the things I \njust talked about to improve health, prevent people from becoming \naddicts, which they are, over 41 million of them--addicts. It doesn't \nsound pleasant, but that is the truth. As a matter of fact, it is said \nin some quarters that addiction to smoking is almost deeper and longer \nlasting than it is with some of the illegal drugs that we hear so much \nabout in our society.\n\n  We were enthusiastic. I know I speak for the Senator from North \nDakota and I speak for myself, Senator Reed, Senator Durbin, and \nSenator Bingaman, when I say we thought, ``OK, we're on a good track; \nwe talked to our friends on the Republican side of the Budget \nCommittee, and we worked to find a plan so that we could use whatever \nrevenues developed effectively,'' even as we developed a good health \npolicy, because that was outside the Budget Committee directly. But it \ndid include the programs which would be considered as part of the \nbudget resolution, budget planning, for fiscal year 1999.\n  I don't have to tell you how disappointing it was to find out we were \nnot at all going to be able to implement the policies we thought were \npositive--that we thought would prevent the kids from starting to \nsmoke, that we thought would help us counter advertising, that we \nthought would help us with research, the NIH--to find out that by \ndesign, certainly more than by coincidence, what we were doing was \nrestricting the use of any funds which might derive from a fee--we \nmight even call it a user fee--from those who smoke, but a fee, an \nexcise tax--that it was going to be restricted to something we like, by \nthe way.\n  All of us want to see a more solvent Medicare, a stronger Medicare. \nThe President has confirmed his view of what ought to be done, because \nhe has appointed a commission. They are going to have a chance for \ndeliberation. In the next year, there are going to be specific \nrecommendations on how to protect Medicare, how to create the kind of \nsolvency which will give us all some confidence that Medicare is going \nto be there as a program to use for all who reach 65.\n  We find out, however, despite the fact that we want to see Medicare \nprotected, what has happened is the use of funds has become so narrowed \nthat we can't do the other programs; that we are going to be unable to \ntake the money which was earned off the addiction, off the habit that \nruined so many people's health. Out of the 41 million people who are \nout there, we don't know how many are going to die prematurely, but we \nknow a lot of them are, and we know a lot of them will be wrestling \nwith diseases which will render them unable to conduct their lives in a \nnormal fashion, and we are not going to be able to use those funds for \nthat.\n  Again, there is not a suggestion of anything underhanded-- not at \nall, Mr. President. I want to make sure that is completely understood. \nIt is a focus on what the programs are that we are going to be able to \nput into place as a result of having those funds available. Our friends \non the Republican side have decided you are not going to use it for any \nof those things; you are not going to use it for developing an \nappropriate health policy program; you are not going to be able to use \nit to stop teen smoking. I know there are programs within the basic \nbudget resolution to encourage that, but, Mr. President, those programs \nare financed to the tune of $125 million a year. That is the \nrecommendation. My gosh, even the tobacco companies, who hate to admit \nthey have done anything wrong, were willing to put $2 billion into the \nanti-teen-smoking program.\n  We find ourselves in the position where we agree with the interests \nand the effort on behalf of the majority of the Budget Committee in \ndeveloping a program, but we also find ourselves saying, ``Hey, wait a \nsecond, is this going to help the tobacco companies in some way? Is \nthis going to hurt our ability to attack the programs that we so \ndesperately need to do? Or is it just a little bit of a disguise to \nsay, `Well, OK, what we are going to do is, we are going to support \nhealth programs very narrowly'?''\n\n  It is with regret that we talk about that today. Mr. President, you \nhave seen the list that the Senator from North Dakota has alongside him \nthere: Reality versus rhetoric. We have some work to do. We have to try \nto amend what it is that came out of the Budget Committee. I am the \nranking member. I like working with Senator Domenici. I hope he will \nlike working with me when I am the chairman. But that is the way these \nthings go, Mr. President. Sometimes what goes around comes around.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How long do you plan to be a Senator?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Long enough to accomplish that objective. Anyway, we \nare going to want to amend this, and I hope we can get that done. That \nwould be a positive start. Think about it: 3,000 young people a day \nstart smoking; over 1 million a year. One-third of them will die \nprematurely, just as sure as we are standing here, if we don't make \nsignificant changes in the way tobacco is understood in our society--1 \nmillion kids a year. Wow, that is larger than some of our biggest \ncities. It is certainly larger than a lot of the countries that are on \nthis globe.\n  It is time we reach out a helping hand and say, ``OK, we are going to \nhelp you stop before you get started on this addiction.'' I hope our \nfriends on the Republican side will join us.\n  It was interesting for me to see what happened on two different \noccasions in these last couple of weeks. One was this very day, when a \nsenior Member of the Senate on the Republican side, the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, offered an amendment to say that there would be no \nprotection for the tobacco companies, that they would have to face up \nto what the process is--whether it is the courts or negotiated \nsettlements, or what have you--and take their chances. It drew a lot of \nvotes. I think there were 75 votes in favor of the Gregg amendment.\n  The other was an earlier time, when we were marking up the budget \nresolution, when we had six members of the Republican Party stand up \nwith Democrats and confirm the fact that we think the $1.50 price per \npack of cigarettes put in place over 3 years at the rate of 50 cents a \nyear ought to move ahead.\n  And that was the only amendment that had any bipartisan support--the \nonly amendment. It meant that some of our friends on the Republican \nside, just as we have heard in these Capitol Grounds, just could not \nsay no. They had to say yes. They had to say yes, we want to see a \n$1.50 per pack fee imposed on cigarette use.\n  We are looking at a lot of money. We are looking at hundreds of \nmillions of dollars over the next 25 years. I make a plea for those who \nare going to be voting on this amendment tomorrow sometime: Take a look \nat what it is you are doing. We understand the interests in Medicare, \nbut we want you to share our concern that the place to start in \npreventing disease from the use of tobacco starts with kids, starts \nwith the youngest of them, starts with the most helpless of us, and \njoin us in amending this budget resolution so that we can get a \ndifferent kind of message out there.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate I strongly support this amendment, which \nwould expand the tobacco reserve fund to allow tobacco revenues to be \nused for anti-tobacco efforts.\n  This amendment, in effect, is a test of whether the Senate is serious \nabout comprehensive tobacco legislation. If we vote down this \namendment, then\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\nwe're saying ``no'' to tackling the issue of tobacco this year.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle have various visions of how \ntobacco revenue should be spent. But there had been a bipartisan \nconsensus that, at the very least, we should dedicate tobacco revenue \nto fighting teen smoking and developing smoking cessation programs.\n  The majority leader, Senator Lott, has taken that position. Senator \nMcCain is developing legislation that would use tobacco revenues for \nanti-smoking efforts. And other bills by Senators Hatch, Conrad, \nJeffords, Kennedy, and myself all would devote tobacco revenue to anti-\nteen smoking programs, tobacco-related research, smoking cessation, and \nother tobacco related programs.\n  Even the tobacco industry's proposed settlement called for tobacco \nrevenue to be used for a variety of programs, including teen education, \nsmoking cessation and tobacco research.\n  Unfortunately, this budget would block all of these activities. \nThat's wrong. And it just makes no sense.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has argued that \nthere is enough funding available in the resolution for these \nactivities. I strongly disagree.\n  The budget resolution assumes $125 million in budget authority for \nanti-youth smoking and cessation in fiscal year 1999. But that is far \nbelow any of the major tobacco bills. In fact, it's not even in the \nsame ballpark.\n  The tobacco industry's original proposed settlement included over $2 \nbillion per year for these programs. Senator Conrad's bill included a \nsimilar figure. That's $2 billion versus $125 million.\n  That is not even close.\n  Also, the $125 million assumed for teen smoking reduction programs \nand smoking cessation in the budget resolution must be accommodated \nwithin the discretionary spending caps. And there's reason to be \nskeptical that this will happen. After all, those caps are very tight. \nAnd increasing funding for these activities would require cuts in other \nprograms. Maybe that will happen. But I certainly wouldn't count on it.\n  The bottom line, though, is that the restrictive reserve fund \nlanguage in this resolution makes it much less likely that we will pass \ntobacco legislation this year. That's a grave concern to me, and to \nmost of my colleagues on this side of the aisle.\n  After all, 3,000 kids a day start smoking every day; 1,000 of them \nwill die prematurely as a result. We simply must act. And this \nresolution would create a major roadblock.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Conrad amendment, and pave the way \nfor comprehensive tobacco legislation this year.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the status of time under the Budget Act on the \nConrad amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 8 minutes remaining, and \nthe opponents have 1 hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, my friend, the ranking member \nfrom New Jersey, when we are finished with this, however soon it is or \nin a half hour, the Senator from Colorado is going to be heard next. Is \nthat what we have tentatively understood?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Absolutely. That is what we promised him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, can you let me respond a bit \nsince there has been a little response? I will certainly not use \nanything like an hour.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Take your time, Mr. Chairman. I will be glad to wait \nuntil you are finished.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For your State and mine, a half hour from now or so is \na better time for your people anyway.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me start by saying that the Senator \nthat has proposed this amendment, in my opinion, even though we may not \nhave agreed on a number of things, as I have watched things evolve on \nmatters pertaining to fiscal policy, has grown tremendously in his \nunderstanding and his forthrightness and his ability to articulate the \nfiscal condition of this country.\n  I want to acknowledge right up front that there are some who worry \nabout this budget resolution, but there are some who worry about 10 \nyears from now. And, frankly, we have an awful lot of new sources of \ninformation and new sources of estimating that have become very, very \nreliable so that as adult leaders of our country we ought to be able to \nlook at a budget 10 years from now and 15 years from now in terms of \nsome big big-ticket items and be able to honestly and forthrightly \nindicate where we are.\n  I just say to him, he has done a very good job in that respect, and I \nthank him for that. Like I say, I do not necessarily, when he gets up \nand makes his frequent speeches about how wonderful America has become \nsince the Democrats voted in a budget, I join him in attributing to \nthat the great success of the American economy. But I do acknowledge \nthat he has a perfectly valid opportunity to so allege to the world. I \nhave not yet really found enough time to really talk with the American \npeople about how that is impossible in terms of having been the primary \nreason for America's sustained economic recovery. I am not going to do \nthat tonight either, but in a sense--in a sense--I am going to talk \nabout something that I believe my good friend, the proponent of the \namendment that is before us, has stated as well as I will or better \ntime and again in the Budget Committee and in the Committee of Finance.\n  That is what this chart before us, in back of me, shows to all of \nus--a very, very simple chart. You see that red line, and you see 2021. \nThat red line is the Medicare hospitalization trust fund balances at \nthe end of each year.\n  Now, you see, anything close to that zero line means that the \nbalances are pretty close--the outgo and the intake. But look what \nhappens to that red line out there in the future, but not so far in the \nfuture that people like Kent Conrad would not stand up and say, with \nPete Domenici, for all the accolades we  are giving ourselves about how \ngreat we have done on fixing the fiscal policy of our Nation, if we sit \nback and do not fix that, where that red line can, in a year or so when \nwe have reformed this program, start to move up and parallel the line \nthat is at about zero, we have failed the American people in a most \nserious way.\n\n  Because of that we could put one up here on Social Security. We could \nargue about their trust fund. And, frankly, that is a very, very \nexciting argument for 2 or 3 hours, if we want to do it. But \nessentially, in terms of the impact on America, if we do not fix \nsomething, the impact is apt to be more severe if we do not fix this \nthan if we do not fix Social Security.\n  Both are serious. Both are predictable. We understand all the reasons \nfor what is happening. And we can choose, as we have in the past when \nwe did not know any better, we could wait 10 years. We could all be \nrunning around saying how wonderful everything is. Probably 25 years \nago nobody could run around after us as we campaigned and say, ``You're \nnot facing up to the facts.'' But I tell you, they can now, because we \nknow that red line is a pretty accurate presentation of the most \nserious fiscal and social problem that this country has--bar none.\n  Now, having said that, the budget I chose to present, after much \nconsultation with the Budget Committee, which was adopted by the \nSenators on that committee, I regret, on a party-line basis--but I \nactually believe the total reason for that party-line vote had to do \nwith this issue that is before us, because I do not believe that every \nDemocrat who voted against the Domenici mark voted against it because \nthey want to spend a lot more money on new programs.\n  As a matter of fact, if this tobacco settlement, as fragile and as \namorphous as it is, had not come along--and it was not available either \nto the President in his budget or to us in our markup--there would have \nbeen little to argue over, because we do not have any money to spend \nunless we want to break the agreement and knock those caps on \ndiscretionary spending off of their pillars and say, ``We just made a \ndeal, but we're going to break it.'' I do not believe that would have \nhappened. And I do not think Senator Conrad, who is here with an \namendment tonight on the tobacco settlement--I do not think he would \nhave joined in saying, ``We've got to invent some new programs and \nspend some new money and break those caps.''\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\n  Essentially, we got off on the wrong foot, because the President of \nthe United States gave a speech called a State of the Union Address, \nand, in his normal manner, he was eloquent. The problem was, nobody had \nan opportunity to check his budget. So America got excited about an era \nof balanced budgets where all of a sudden we could spend a lot of money \nthat we did not spend the year before. And it was interesting. Some of \nus listened and said, what's happening? I mean, we have a literal \nfreeze on all the programs the President is talking about--more \neducation money, classroom sizes, interest reduction so you can build \nmore classrooms, child care--you know, on and on--oh, more health \nprograms for children who are smoking, and a huge advertising campaign \nfor that.\n  And I was thinking, ``Man, all of those belong over here on that side \nof the ledger where already we've agreed we can't spend any more \nmoney.'' The President said, ``Well, we'll spend it out of the tobacco \nsettlement'' that may never occur. If it  occurs, it might be very \ndifferent than he assumed. And lo and behold, the Congressional Budget \nOffice told us, he cannot spend it the way he says without breaking the \nBudget Act of the United States and breaking the caps by $68 billion \nover 5 years.\n\n  That is where we found ourselves, with everybody getting excited that \nwe could have some new programs, we could preserve the surpluses, \nright--which my friend from Colorado is going to speak to in a minute--\nand we could spend on at least six new programs that pop in my head, \nand a whole bunch of add-ons, we could spend $124 billion over 5 years \non things we were not paying for last year.\n  Mr. President, that sounded like a fairy land, that we would have \ntombs and beautiful songs and we could dream and say, ``Boy, isn't that \njust fantastic?'' Sort of like Alice in Wonderland. But we soon found \nout it was all predicated upon a tobacco settlement that the tobacco \ncompanies agreed to with the attorneys general. And we had no more idea \nup here how that was going to get resolved than the Man in the Moon.\n  And I regret to say, while I think we ought to try to settle that \ndispute--I am not averse to raising cigarette taxes--we are still not \nvery close, when you look at the House and the Senate, to coming up \nwith a way to do that which has enough votes to do what Howard Baker \nused to say, ``Whatever the rules and procedures are, don't worry about \nit if you've got enough votes.'' Nobody has enough votes yet. But I \nbelieve there are enough votes for this budget resolution, because it \ndoes the right thing. This Republican budget--which I wish some \nDemocrats would vote for--says: Don't spend the surplus in the regular \nbudget of the United States on anything but Social Security, or, as we \nput it, ``Social Security reform.''\n  My friend from Colorado has another suggestion--it is intriguing, and \nI hope everybody looks at it--as to the surplus. But we said that. And \nthe President said it a little differently than us. But essentially, \nfor the year 1999, don't touch it. For those who might think it is very \nbig, let me remind you, ``Don't touch it '99'' means don't touch $8 \nbillion worth of surplus, I say to my friend in the Chair, not $30 \nbillion, not $60 billion, not $100 billion--$8 billion.\n  So this euphoria about, ``We've got to protect that, we can't spend \nit,'' with others saying, ``Let's cut taxes''--it is $8 billion. So we \nsaid two big goals: Save Social Security--and I might add, under our \nbudget resolution that is before us, we literally use the word \n``reform,'' so that we do not just contemplate putting the surplus into \nthe Social Security trust fund; we contemplate having it available for \nthose who will reform and rewrite Social Security to use, if they need \nit, to make that program one that is far better for America's retired \npeople in the future and which has a chance of making the fund itself \nmore solvent.\n  The second thing we said was once the next program that the American \nU.S. Government has a responsibility to pay for--not a State issue, not \na city issue, one of ours--and lo and behold, we find the American U.S. \nproblem is that one, Medicare. Medicare. We found the second big \nproblem is that, one, that huge red line on the chart going down. It \nalmost moves in a direction like when you are a young kid and you \nwondered where hell was--that is sort of looking like it is going down \nto hell, down into the depths of the Earth, in the red, going broke.\n  We said, what do we do about that? There is nothing more important \nthan doing what we can to start fixing that. We said whatever the \nFederal Government keeps from the settlement--if it ever happens, and \nwe assume the President's number, but we said whatever it is and \nwhenever it happens--put the Government share in that fund.\n  What we are going to do with the amendment of my friend, whom I have \njust spoken to, is to say we are not going to put all the money in that \nhospital insurance fund for seniors that is going bankrupt; we are \ngoing to spend it on some other things. Frankly, I believe for a \nbudget, a blueprint, that is a mistake. It will be subject to a point \nof order, and I will make it. It is not with any reluctance that I make \nit, because I think what we have planned in the budget before the \nSenate is better for our country, so long as we have no agreed-upon \nplan to do otherwise. I remind the Senators, and the occupant of the \nChair was working hard and very knowledgeable about the tobacco \nsettlement, we don't have a plan. We have a lot of people talking about \na lot of things, and a lot of wonderful things we ought to buy, but we \ndon't have a plan that has broad-based bipartisan support. I believe \nunless and until that happens, the money ought to go where this budget \nsays--every nickel should go in Medicare.\n  Now, I am amazed--and I want to allude back and forth to other \nproposals--that the President of the United States in his State of the \nUnion Address, and in his budget which followed, which not even the \nDemocrats have used in budget debates, that budget that he told the \nAmerican people about, that he sent us, I am amazed in that budget \nthere was $124 billion in new expenditures from this, that, and the \nother, but a huge amount of it from the tobacco settlement and not a \npenny for the second worst problem that America has. Not a penny.\n  Not so with the budget that is before the Senate. The reverse. Not a \npenny for any other new program but all the money for that one.\n  Now, from this Senator's standpoint, I did not set about to ignore \nwhat many people said we ought to pay for if we get the tobacco \nsettlement. Fellow Senators, I want you to know if there is never a \nsettlement of the cigarette controversy, if it is never settled and \nnever resolved, the budget before the Senate, because we chose to \nprioritize, to put first things first, has the largest increase for the \nNational Institutes of Health over the next 5 years for research \nrelated to the effects of cigarette smoking that we have ever put \ntogether in the history of our biological and chemical research \nprograms of America, the largest. On average, 11 percent a year. We are \nnot waiting for a cigarette settlement to pay for that.\n  When you vote for the budget before the Senate that I put together--\nand I hope it is not just Republicans--we will have dramatically \nincreased the National Institutes of Health because we chose to look at \nthe President's cuts, and he had many. And we said, amen. But we want \nto spend it where we think we should spend it and we put it in NIH. \nThis afternoon we argued about child care, and we put it there, too. We \nput $5 billion there in a new block grant to add to what we are doing, \nand we don't have to wait for the tobacco settlement to do it.\n\n  A number of other items, such as an advertising campaign to address \nthe issue of trying, with advertising, to mellow the effect of \ncigarette advertising on young people. We don't have to wait around for \nthe cigarette settlement. We have funded that to the tune of $825 \nmillion.\n  Now, frankly, we will never have enough for some. There are some who \nwould think we should spend $2 billion a year on children's programs \nand on health programs for children out of this settlement. Mr. \nPresident, what is intriguing about it all is that in order to get that \ndone, most amendments around here, and the amendment that is presently \nbefore the Senate, attempt to solve these problems by creating new \nmandatory permanent programs for ideas that are being implemented about \nwhich we have little certainty they will succeed. If anything, they\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\nought to be annually appropriated so we can look at them each year. Mr. \nPresident, you understand that can't be done without breaking the \nbudget agreement because we don't have any more room in our budget for \nthat kind of expenditure. So this amendment and others spend it in a \nnew entitlement program for kids' advertising or for tobacco research \nor whatever the five or six programs are that are there.\n  Now, $825 million over 5 years for various antiteen smoking and \npublic health initiatives--I have heard from some of my colleagues we \nhave not put enough resources into these antismoking initiatives, \nwithout a settlement. I have even heard that we need to spend, maybe, \nand I repeat, ``multiple billions of dollars, perhaps even as much as \n$2 billion a year,'' on such a campaign. Frankly, fellow Senators, I \nfind those proposals hard to believe. First, the President's budget \nidentified $400 million over the next 5 years for antismoking \ninitiatives at the Federal level through the Centers for Disease \nControl.\n  Let me quote from the HHS 1999 budget press release. This was when \nthe President was still living off the budget that turned out not to be \ndoable because it violated the budget but they had money to spend. It \nsaid, ``We will expand our support for State and community programs \nfrom $34 million in 1998 to $51 million in 1999,'' a 50 percent \nincrease. ``The Centers for Disease Control,'' the quote continues, in \ntheir public relations submission, ``will now fund all States and the \nDistrict of Columbia to implement innovative tobacco prevention \nprograms as a core component of the public health.'' We fund that much \nand more without waiting around for the tobacco settlement. Now, it \nmore than doubles the funds identified in the President's budget for \nthis initiative.\n  Let me also point out that we have some history with public campaigns \naimed at youth. According to this administration, we have increased our \nefforts to prevent and treat drug use from $4.1 billion in 1992 to $5.4 \nbillion in 1998. Much of that funding was aimed at young Americans. \nNonetheless, teenage drug use has increased from 15 percent in 1992 to \n22.2 percent in 1995, the last year we have evidence, and everyone here \nknows it  is higher now than 1995, and the campaign continues to spend \nmoney, to affect their lives on drugs, with advertising and other \nprograms.\n\n  I only say that not because I do not think we should continue trying, \nbut I firmly believe it would be wrong to put huge amounts of money in \nan entitlement program in this area and just say for the next 5 to 10 \nyears, that is where it goes. So, wherever I look and however I think \nabout this, I say to those committees and those assigned by our \nleadership to try to work a tobacco settlement--good luck. I also say, \nif you put it together and you can find 60 votes, you will pass your \nprogram in the Senate. And if you do, who knows? I may be one of the \n60. I haven't said I would not, but I believe since we are not anywhere \nclose to that and we have no consensus on that, that we ought to do \nwhat is the most prudent thing.\n  I have failed to discuss and I have failed to put up the chart that \nclearly depicts what is happening to Medicare spending on tobacco-\nrelated illnesses. It is there now. It is simple and frightening.\n  The hospital insurance trust fund for the seniors of America has been \nmade stable for about another 10 years. But we didn't really reform the \nprogram; we reformed the payment plan. It will, once again, as that red \nline on the previous chart, it will start to go down again, and when \nthe baby boomers hit entitlement age, it will go broke. But look at \nthat, one of the reasons it has gone broke is we never could have \nestimated the costs that program would bear on its shoulders from \ntobacco-related illnesses of senior citizens. And there it is, $25.5 \nbillion, 14 percent of total Medicare spending, in 1995. Mr. President, \n1995 is the best we can do. Say it got better. I don't believe so. In \nfact, I am prepared to speculate with a bit of intuition that I think \nis right that it is higher now, not lower.\n  So I submit the budget that is before us is better for America and \nhas a better chance of solving our serious problems than a budget with \nthe amendment before the Senate added to it, because I do not believe \nthere is a better way to spend that money than on the program that is \ngoing bankrupt and is so necessary and was so infringed upon by smoking \ncosts that we cannot ignore the reality of the relationship between the \nsmoking and the bankruptcy of the hospital insurance program.\n  Now, this does not mean, Mr. President, that the Senator from New \nMexico thinks the distinguished Senator, whom I have spoken of this \nevening with great affection and as honestly and positively as I have \nspoken about a Democrat Senator since I have been here--  perhaps my \nfriend Sam Nunn has had me do that once before, and perhaps my friend, \nthe ranking member, has had me do that before. But in any event, that \nis not to say that this is a wild idea. It is just that I believe if \nyou have the facts before you and you don't know how the tobacco is \ngoing to come out at all, we have no idea--and there are all kinds of \nthings people want to spend it on, right? We could add to this list \nhere, in the next 48 hours, another six or seven things, and we might, \nI say to my friend from Colorado. If this amendment fails, we are going \nto see more. They won't all try to do the same things. They will have \nother things we ought to do and pay for it out of this fund.\n\n  So the best I can do is to say that I believe the best budget we can \ndo is to save the surplus for reform and solvency of Social Security, \nsave the Government's share of the cigarette tax to save Medicare, \nincrease the National Institutes of Health, put some additional money \nin child care, add about $9 billion to education. A whole bunch of \namendments are going to say we didn't do enough about education. I just \nwant to say to everybody that we will take those one at a time, one at \na time. But we put everything in this budget on education that the \nbipartisan administration budget agreement contemplated for the year \n1999. There is an $8 billion-plus increase year after year on \neducation, which is exactly what we contemplated. It is there. When the \nappropriators finally do it--we don't know what they are going to do, \nbut we suggested some things that were very interesting. We don't wait \naround for the settlement of the tobacco issue for those educational \nadd-ons. The President did. We don't. We put $2.5 billion in IDEA or \ndisability education to try to move forward in our commitment to pay \nour share. It is embarrassing that we have mandated that disabled young \npeople be educated in a certain way from here down to our school \ndistricts and we are supposed to pay 40 percent of the tab. Senator, if \nyou are not embarrassed that your schools have never seen the \nGovernment put up more than 9 percent of that program, I am. We are \ngoing to start putting more in there, and do you know what. They are \ngoing to be relieved of expenditures and be able to hire new teachers, \nas they see fit, and do the other things they may need. We will live up \nto our responsibilities. They will have money left over to do theirs. \nThat is in our budget.\n  Yet, whatever you do, it isn't enough. Tomorrow, we will speak about \nbuilding classrooms. Let me suggest, for those who want to build \nclassrooms and think the President is for it, you will have a surprise \ntomorrow. Two budgets ago, the President said in his Department of \nEducation that it is no business of the Federal Government to build \nschools in the school districts of America. He said it even better than \nthat. And then he canceled the $100 million worth of programs to build \nschools. All of a sudden, it's the greatest program ever and we better \ndo it from up here, even though we have never done that in any big way \nas part of American Government's help to our schools. We will debate \nthat. Some will say we should pay part of that out of the cigarette \nsettlement. Can you imagine. If you are talking about things related to \ncigarette smoking, isn't that one more related? Isn't that fund more \nbankrupt than any other fund around and any other obligation? So, Mr. \nPresident, when the time comes after tomorrow--we have a few more \nminutes, and I hope some people listened tonight--we will vote. The \npoint of order will be the issue. I have no doubt that \nsignificant numbers of Senators will vote with my friend. I have \nnothing but praise for him, and if they do that, that is OK. But I \ndon't believe there are going to be enough votes to get around the \npoint of order.\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\n We will be back to where we started, which we think is a very good \nplace to be. That is, we are going to spend the money, if we ever get \nthe tobacco settlement, to pay for making that Medicare Program \nsolvent.\n\n  Mr. President, make no bones about it; we have appointed a national \ncommission. It is bipartisan. I have already seen them on C-SPAN, and \nthey disagreed violently. I don't know if the chairman is going to be \nable to ever get them together. We were all wondering who ought to be \nchairman and we said, ``Senator Breaux, you ought to be.'' I like him \nvery much. He is a Democrat. Frankly, the more I look at the different \nviews, I am glad that he is there because, frankly, it is going to be \nhard to put them together. If we have a few tens of billions of dollars \nto help them get this reform put together, it will be one of the best \nthings we have ever done. It may just be the ointment, along with \nreforms, that will glue it together. And, conversely, if we throw it \naway on programs that we are not sure will work, we will be real sorry \nif they can't put together a Medicare reform package because we spent \nthe money that might have helped them do it.\n  With that, I don't know how much time remains, but from my \nstandpoint, I yield the floor on this. I will shortly be prepared to \nmove with the distinguished Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wonder if we can get the Senator's \nquestion answered as to how much time is left on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 7 minutes 42 seconds. The \nopponents have 24 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico just \nvolunteered to give us 5 minutes on our side, with the understanding \nthat the rest will be yielded back. What I would like to do is ask my \ncolleague from North Dakota to say what he wants to do. Does he want 7 \nminutes or so? I would like 5 minutes. If that would be all right, I \nwould agree with the proposal offered by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would be acceptable.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Colorado thus far for his \never-present indulgence.\n  I will take my 5 minutes first, and I ask the Chair to remind me when \nmy 5 minutes is up so that I can give the remaining 7 minutes to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  First of all, I am not personally insulted, I promise you that, not \nat all. I heard the chairman of the Budget Committee talk about what a \ngreat guy and a good friend and a nice Democrat and everything else the \nSenator from North Dakota was. Then he talked about the Senator from \nLouisiana. It doesn't bother me. It is just one of those things, Mr. \nPresident, two Democrats being described as great guys and all that. \nBut we will go on from there.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say, Mr. President, whatever I have said about \nother Senators from the other side of the aisle, it is quite obvious \nthat the most significant achievement that I have participated in was \nthe balanced budget agreement of last year, and without my good friend, \nSenator Lautenberg from New Jersey, we could not have achieved that \nresult. So he knows with that statement that I am very proud to work \nwith him. You got it, Senator.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are together, believe me. As a matter of fact, I \nwant to tell you something, Mr. President. You have no idea--few have--\nhow hard I worked to get this man to stop smoking. It showed my true \naffection for him because I wanted him to be around here. Even when I \ndisagree with him, I like him here because he stimulates reactions and \ngets us going at times, if you know what I mean.\n  Mr. President, I ask people to consider this question with me. What \ngrandparent, I ask you, would not say: Take care of my grandchild \nfirst, help my grandchild so that when he or she grows up, they are \nhealthy, help my grandchild to not become an addict to tobacco or other \ndrug substances? What grandparent would not stand up and proudly say \n``take care of them first'' because eventually they will be the ones \nwho will shoot the Government programs and health insurance programs up \nthrough the roof?\n  Yes, there is $22 billion worth of spending in Medicare on tobacco-\nrelated illness. We are not sure, but there is a significant amount, \nperhaps a like amount, in Medicaid tobacco-related illness. But if we \ndon't inhibit smoking among the youngsters today, this price will \ncontinue. Sometimes you have to make an investment in the long term \nbefore you can obtain the result that you want. You can't always do it \novernight.\n  So I submit, Mr. President, that we are determined not to break the \ncaps. We are determined to abide by CBO accounting. We are determined \nnot to spend money that we don't have. And to correct something the \nSenator from New Mexico said a moment ago, he said the surpluses should \nbe used for Medicare. I think he didn't quite mean it that way because, \ntechnically, the words are, ``surplus is going to Social Security,'' \nand hopefully the proceeds from the tobacco legislation would go toward \ncreating a more solvent Medicare.\n  So, Mr. President, I kind of rest the case here. My colleague from \nNorth Dakota is going to want to wrap up, as they say, but I say as an \nexperienced grandparent--and if anybody wants to see the pictures of my \nfive grandchildren, I have them here in my pocket. But I tell you that \nthere is nothing--nothing--in my life that I would not give to prevent \nsickness or illness to any one of my grandchildren. There is no price \nthat is too high to pay. I will take care of myself, but I want to make \nsure I give my grandchildren a chance to grow, develop, and be healthy.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor for my friend from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I want to say to the \nchairman of our committee, he knows that I have the utmost regard for \nhim for the way he conducts our committee. I have real respect for the \nchairman. I have, as well, an affection for the chairman. That really \nis not the issue before us tonight. We work together, and on the larger \nissues of where we are going for the long term, there is much more that \nunites us than divides us because we are both persuaded that if we \ndon't address the long-term entitlement changes that are necessary in \nthis country, we put this country at risk.\n  We are talking about the national security of our Nation because, \nfundamentally, that cannot be preserved if we don't get our long-term \nfiscal house in order. We are united on that question. Mr. President, \nthe issue before us tonight is a reserve fund in the budget for tobacco \nrevenue. The chairman of our committee says that he believes if we get \na tobacco settlement, all of the revenue ought to go for Medicare. I \nwould be swift to acknowledge that Medicare is a priority, but it's not \nthe only priority. Medicare does not represent the national tobacco \npolicy. We have to do more with those tobacco revenues than just \nstrengthen the Medicare Program. And, in fact, I think the chairman \nwould be quick to acknowledge that even if we took all of the revenue \nfrom tobacco, we would not do the job that needs to be done with \nrespect to Medicare. We need fundamental reform of Medicare, and I \nvoted in the Finance Committee very controversial votes to do precisely \nthat, because I deeply believe we do need to reform the Medicare \nProgram, to preserve it and protect it for the long term.\n\n  Mr. President, the tobacco revenues won't do that job. In fact, in an \nodd way, they actually may retard our facing up to the long-term \nchallenge of Medicare. But there are other challenges we face as well. \nOne of them is, if we get the tobacco revenue, how should it be used? \nThe Republican budget resolution says none of it should be used for \nyouth-smoking-reduction-education programs. None of it should be used \nfor public service advertising to counter the tobacco advertising of \nthe industry. Their resolution says none of it should be used for \ntobacco-related medical research; that none of it should be used for \nsmoking cessation and prevention programs; none of it should be used to \nassist tobacco farmers in their communities in the transition. That is \nan honest disagreement.\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\n  In the bill I introduced, some of the money was used for Medicare, \nsome of it was used to strengthen Social Security. But we also believe \nthat, just as every comprehensive bill that is before this body by \nRepublicans and Democrats has said, some of the money has to go for \ntobacco control problems, smoking cessation, smoking prevention. The \nchairman says he has money elsewhere in the budget. Let me just say \nthat what he has elsewhere in the budget is wholly inadequate. That is \nnot just my judgment; that is the judgment of the public health \ncommunity on a united basis.\n  In the budget resolution, there is $125 million a year for smoking \ncessation, smoking prevention, counter-tobacco advertising, and health \nresearch that is specific to the question of tobacco issues. That is \napart from the NIH money. But in every comprehensive bill that is out \nhere by Republicans, or Democrats, it is not $125 million for those \npurposes. It is $2 billion a year to $4 billion a year. The chairman \nelsewhere in the budget has provided for $125 million, and the truth is \nthat under the budget resolution it may be the result that not a single \ndime is available for any of those programs because the Budget \nCommittee doesn't make that decision. All the money goes in a pot and \nthe appropriators determine what are their priorities. If they have a \ndifference on that question, they may decide not to provide one thin \ndime for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, counter-tobacco \nadvertising, or even health research. That is the hard reality.\n  That is why some of us believe deeply that we have to broaden out \nthis reserve fund to accommodate the other priorities, to have a chance \nto have comprehensive tobacco legislation without a supermajority \nrequirement here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. A 60-vote point of \norder lies against any of these comprehensive tobacco bills that have \nbeen offered by three Republican chairmen on that side and every \ncomprehensive tobacco bill on our side. We do not believe we should put \nsupermajority hurdles in the way of accomplishing national tobacco \nlegislation.\n  I will just conclude by saying I respect our chairman, I respect the \nwork of his staff, I respect the work of our ranking member, and his \nstaff. Let me just say with respect to our ranking member that no one \nhas been more dedicated on the question of reforming our Nation's \npolicy with respect to tobacco than the Senator from New Jersey. If \npeople on airplanes like the fact that they are smoke free, there is \none person who is responsible for it--more responsible than any other \nindividual--and that is the Senator from New Jersey. We can all thank \nhim for the contribution he has made to try to do something to get our \nkids off the tobacco habit, off the addiction, and the diseases that it \ncauses. I think we should recognize his leadership in this regard. \nNobody has been a more forceful advocate of changing the tobacco \nculture than the Senator from New Jersey.\n  At some point we are all going to be on the same page because I \nbelieve we are going to find a way to get together on national tobacco \nlegislation. But I hope that we do not put in the way as a roadblock \nthe budget resolution. We could broaden that reserve fund so that if we \ndo get tobacco revenue it can be used, yes, for Medicare, and, yes, to \nhelp strengthen Social Security, as my bill also provides, but in \naddition to that provide for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, \ncounter-tobacco advertising--all of the things that the public health \ncommunity has told us is important to a comprehensive approach to \nprotecting the public health.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from ENACT, a coalition of more than 45 major public health \norganizations with millions of volunteers and members who support \ncomprehensive legislation that will prevent children from taking up \ntobacco and will dramatically reduce tobacco use among adults. They \nsupport the type of amendment which I have offered.\n  I ask unanimous consent to also have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the American Lung Association, who say in their letter, ``As you \nknow, the budget resolution recently approved by the Budget Committee \nis a disaster for public health.''\n\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom Public Citizen making the same point; finally, a letter from Smoke \nFree 2000, a coalition interested in advancing the public health with \nrespect to the question of tobacco policy.\n  So, we will have those letters in the Record demonstrating the \nsupport of the public health community for broadening our tobacco \nreserve plan so that a comprehensive bill is possible.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                        ENACT,\n\n                                                   March 27, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: The ENACT coalition of more than 45 major \n     public health organizations with millions of volunteers and \n     members supports comprehensive legislation that will prevent \n     children from taking up tobacco and dramatically reduce \n     tobacco use among adults.\n       We are writing to express our serious concerns regarding \n     the restrictions contained in the Budget Resolution that \n     limit the use of money in the Tobacco Reserve Fund to the \n     Medicare Hospital Trust Fund. These restrictions will hinder \n     efforts to enact effective and comprehensive tobacco \n     legislation by requiring 60 votes to include funding for key \n     anti-tobacco programs. We believe that the Budget Resolution \n     should be changed to allow the Tobacco Reserve Fund to be \n     used for programs that will reduce the use of tobacco and its \n     harmful effects.\n       To reduce tobacco use among children and adults, \n     comprehensive tobacco legislation must contain funding for \n     tobacco-related public health programs, including:\n       1. A nationwide public education and counter advertising \n     program as well as state and local tobacco control programs \n     and projects.\n       2. Cessation programs to help children and adults who want \n     to quit.\n       3. Regulation of tobacco products by the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n       4. Research into how we can best prevent tobacco use and \n     help those who want to quit--this research will build on what \n     we already know and ensure that our efforts to drive down \n     smoking rates are effective.\n       Funding for tobacco-related public health programs should \n     be the first priority for any funds raised through tobacco \n     legislation; we are therefore opposed to the current \n     provision in the Budget Resolution that limits the use of \n     such revenue to the Medicare Hospital Trust Fund.\n       We recognize that the Budget Resolution includes funding \n     for teen smoking prevention and cessation programs, but these \n     programs would have to compete for limited discretionary \n     dollars available in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations \n     bill. Additionally, the funding called for in the Budget \n     Resolution under the discretionary caps is far below the \n     funding levels recommended by virtually every major public \n     health organization and below what was outlined in the \n     proposed Attorneys General agreement.\n       The undersigned groups support amending the Budget \n     Resolution to ensure that funds in the Tobacco Reserve Fund \n     can be used to support critical tobacco-related programs that \n     will help drive down smoking rates. This is a historic \n     opportunity to achieve fundamental change in tobacco \n     addiction and disease and to save lives. We are committed to \n     working with you and other members of Congress to pass a \n     Budget Resolution that will help protect America's children \n     from the dangers of tobacco addiction.\n           Sincerely,\n         Allergy & Asthma Network--Mothers of Asthmatics, Inc.; \n           American Academy of Family Physicians; American Academy \n           of Pediatrics; American Association for Respiratory \n           Care; American Cancer Society; American College of \n           Chest Physicians; American College of Preventive \n           Medicine; American Heart Association; American \n           Psychiatric Association; American School Health \n           Association; American Society of Internal Medicine; \n           Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids; College on Problems of \n           Drug Dependence; Family Voices; Federation of \n           Behavioral, Psychological and Cognitive Sciences; The \n           HMO Group; Interreligious Coalition on Smoking or \n           Health; Latino Council on Alcohol & Tobacco; National \n           Association of Children's Hospitals; National \n           Association of County and City Health Officials; \n           National Association of Local Boards of Health; \n           National Hispanic Medical Association; Oncology Nursing \n           Society; Partnership for Prevention; and Summit Health \n           Coalition.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                     New York, NY, March 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: As you know, the Budget Resolution \n     recently approved by the Budget Committee is a disaster for \n     public health.\n       Instead of allowing the use of tobacco revenues for public \n     health programs, as is the case with every major piece of \n     tobacco control legislation before the Congress, the \n     committee bill actually precludes the use of any new tobacco \n     revenues for public health. Moreover, the provisions of \n     committee bill will set up procedural barriers that will \n     hamstring the use of these new revenues for preventing youth \n     smoking, lifesaving research\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\n     at the National Institutes of Health, or FDA efforts to rein \n     in the tobacco industry. Monies that are provided--$800 \n     million over five years, is way below most other bills. For \n     example, the Health Kids Act, (S. 1638) calls for over $2 \n     billion per year for tobacco control efforts.\n       The American Lung Association strongly supports an \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution that would include funding \n     for public health programs in the tobacco reserve fund \n     established by the Budget Committee. We believe that the goal \n     of tobacco control legislation should be to control tobacco \n     use--not raise revenue.\n       Lastly, we support any amendment expressing the sense of \n     the Senate opposing immunity and supporting full FDA \n     authority to control tobacco. Recent public opinion polls \n     conducted by the American Lung Association indicate the \n     American people strongly oppose granting special protections \n     to the tobacco industry. The Senate should follow their lead.\n       We look forward to working with you to craft tobacco \n     control legislation that protects the public health without \n     creating special protections, like immunity, for the tobacco \n     industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Fran Du Melle,\n     Deputy Managing Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Public Citizen,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: Public Citizen has long supported \n     efforts to reduce the death and disease caused by tobacco \n     products and has worked for years against legislation that \n     would protect corporate wrongdoers from legal accountability \n     for the harm caused by their dangerous products. We applaud \n     your work in pursuit of the same public health goals.\n       We are concerned that the Budget Resolution recently \n     approved by the Senate Budget Committee does not reflect \n     sound public health priorities. The measure contains no \n     funding for many of the health related programs that should \n     be funded by new tobacco revenues. Instead, the Budget \n     Resolution proposes that these new tobacco revenues be \n     earmarked for Medicare. In addition, the money the Budget \n     Resolution provides for tobacco control--$800 million over \n     five years--is well below the amount that would be generated \n     by most of the tobacco bills now before Congress. For \n     example, the Healthy Kids Act, (S. 1638), calls for over $2 \n     billion per year for tobacco control efforts. We urge that \n     these deficiencies be corrected.\n       Further, Public Citizen strongly supports a floor amendment \n     expressing the sense of the Senate that the tobacco companies \n     must not be given any special protection from legal liability \n     as a quid pro quo for its payments--or for anything else. We \n     oppose any sweetheart deal for this industry that lied to and \n     cheated the American public and costs the U.S. economy over \n     $90 billion each year in health care costs alone.\n       Finally, Public Citizen believes that the FDA must be given \n     full authority to regulate nicotine and tobacco products, and \n     we would also support a sense of the Senate amendment \n     advancing that position.\n       Thank you for your leadership on these important issues. We \n     look forward to working with you to craft tobacco control \n     legislation that protects the public health without creating \n     special protections, like immunity, for the tobacco industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Joan Claybrook,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Smoke Free 2000 Coalition,\n\n                                     St. Paul, MN, March 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The Minnesota Smoke-Free Coalition \n     strongly supports an amendment to the Budget Resolution that \n     would include significant funding for public health programs \n     in the tobacco reserve fund established by the Budget \n     Committee.\n       In order to reduce tobacco and prevent tobacco use, a \n     comprehensive approach is needed including, counter-\n     advertising and education campaigns, reducing illegal sales \n     to minors, smoking cessation for those who want to quit. The \n     goal of tobacco control legislation should be to control \n     tobacco use--not just raise revenue.\n       The budget resolution recently approved by the Budget \n     committee prohibits the use of tobacco control revenues for \n     public health programs. This would be a disaster for public \n     health and exactly what the tobacco industry would support.\n       The Minnesota Coalition represents more than 60 health, \n     education, consumer and civic organizations from across the \n     state of Minnesota. Collectively, we urge your support of an \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution that would include funding \n     for public health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           A.

Mr. President, is it fair to assume now that we have \nboth yielded our time on this?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2209\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Committee on \nFinance shall consider and report a legislative proposal this year that \n  would dedicate the Federal budget surplus to the establishment of a \n     program of personal retirement accounts for working Americans)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before our friend from Colorado proceeds, I send to the \ndesk an amendment on behalf of Senators Roth, Breaux, Gregg, Robb, \nHatch, Nickles, Gramm, Gordon Smith, and Santorum, and ask it take its \nplace among the amendments to be determined in the future as to when a \nvote will occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), for himself, \n     and Mr. Roth, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Robb, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n     Nickles, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Gordon Smith, and Mr. Santorum, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2209.\n       At the end of title III add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY PERSONAL \n                   RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS AND THE BUDGET SURPLUS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The social security program is the foundation of \n     retirement income for most Americans, and solving the \n     financial problems of the social security program is a vital \n     national priority and essential for the retirement security \n     of today's working Americans and their families.\n       (2) There is a growing bipartisan consensus that personal \n     retirement accounts should be an important feature of social \n     security reform.\n       (3) Personal retirement accounts can provide a substantial \n     retirement nest egg and real personal wealth. For an \n     individual 28 years old on the date of the adoption of this \n     resolution, earning an average wage, and retiring at age 65 \n     in 2035, just 1 percent of that individual's wages deposited \n     each year in a personal retirement account and invested in \n     securities consisting of the Standard & Poors 500 would grow \n     to $132,000, and be worth approximately 20 percent of the \n     benefits that would be provided to the individual under the \n     current provisions of the social security program.\n       (4) Personal retirement accounts would give the majority of \n     Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in \n     the economic growth of America.\n       (5) Personal retirement accounts would demonstrate the \n     value of savings and the magic of compound interest to all \n     Americans. Today, Americans save less than people in almost \n     every other country.\n       (6) Personal retirement accounts would help Americans to \n     better prepare for retirement generally. According to the \n     Congressional Research Service, 60 percent of Americans are \n     not actively participating in a retirement plan other than \n     social security, although social security was never intended \n     to be the sole source of retirement income.\n       (7) Personal retirement accounts would allow partial \n     prefunding of retirement benefits, thereby providing for \n     social security's future financial stability.\n       (8) The Federal budget will register a surplus of \n     $671,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, offering a unique \n     opportunity to begin a permanent solution to social \n     security's financing.\n       (9) Using the Federal budget surplus to fund personal \n     retirement accounts would be an important first step in \n     comprehensive social security reform and ensuring the \n     delivery of promised retirement benefits.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this resolution assumes that the Committee on Finance \n     shall consider and report a legislative proposal this year \n     that would dedicate the Federal budget surplus to the \n     establishment of a program of personal retirement accounts \n     for working Americans and reduce the unfunded liabilities of \n     the social security program.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2210\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding repair and \n                 construction needs of Indian schools)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before we go on to the Senator from \nColorado, I, too, have an amendment to be sent up to the desk on behalf \nof the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, and ask that it be \nplaced in the order for such time as it is called up.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that the amendment on Indian schooling?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. We should note that the Senator from New Mexico \nis a cosponsor of that amendment, and please note that carefully.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), for Mr. \n     Johnson, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Bingaman, \n     Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2210.\n\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\n\n  The text of the amendment follows:\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REPAIR AND CONSTRUCTION \n                   NEEDS OF INDIAN SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) many of our nation's tribal schools are in a state of \n     serious disrepair. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) \n     operates 187 school facilities nationwide. Enrollment in \n     these schools, which presently numbers 47,214 students, has \n     been growing rapidly. A recent General Accounting Office \n     report indicates that the repair backlog in these schools \n     totals $754 million, and that the BIA schools are in \n     generally worse condition than all schools nationally;\n       (2) approximately 60 of these schools are in need of \n     complete replacement or serious renovation. Many of the \n     renovations include basic structural repair for the safety of \n     children, new heating components to keep students warm, and \n     roofing replacement to keep the snow and rain out of the \n     classroom. In addition to failing to provide adequate \n     learning environments for Indian children, these repair and \n     replacement needs pose a serious liability issue for the \n     Federal government;\n       (3) sixty-three percent of the BIA schools are over 30 \n     years old, and twenty-six percent are over 50 years old. \n     Approximately forty percent of all students in BIA schools \n     are in portable classrooms. Originally intended as temporary \n     facilities while tribes awaited new construction funds, these \n     ``portables'' have a maximum 10 year life-span. Because of \n     the construction backlog, children have been shuffling \n     between classrooms in the harsh climates of the Northern \n     plains and Western states for ten to fifteen years;\n       (4) annual appropriations for BIA education facilities \n     replacement and repair combined have averaged $20-$30 million \n     annually, meeting only 4% of total need. At the present rate, \n     one deteriorating BIA school can be replaced each year, with \n     estimates of completion of nine schools in the next seven \n     years. Since the new construction and repair backlog is so \n     great and growing, the current focus at BIA construction must \n     remain on emergency and safety needs only, without \n     prioritizing program needs such as increasing enrollment or \n     technology in the classroom; and\n       (5) unlike most schools, the BIA schools are a \n     responsibility of the federal government. Unfortunately, the \n     failure of the federal government to live up to this \n     responsibility has come at the expense of quality education \n     for some of this nation's poorest children with the fewest \n     existing opportunities to better themselves.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume that the repair and construction \n     backlog affecting Bureau of Indian Affairs school facilities \n     should be eliminated over a period of no more than five years \n     beginning with Fiscal Year 1999.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . REDUCTION OF NATIONAL DEBT.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, beginning with fiscal year \n     1999 and for every fiscal year thereafter, it shall not be in \n     order to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget, or \n     amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that--\n       (1) that would cause budgeted outlays for that fiscal year \n     to exceed budgeted revenues; and\n       (2) does not provide that actual revenues shall exceed \n     actual outlays in order to provide for the reduction of the \n     gross Federal debt as provided in subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount.--The amount of reduction required by this \n     section shall be equal to the amount required by amortize the \n     debt over the next 30 years in order to repay the entire debt \n     by the end of fiscal year 2028.\n       (c) Waiver.--The Senate may only waive the provisions of \n     this section for a fiscal year in which a declaration of war \n     is in effect.\n       (d) Passage of Revenue Increase.--No bill to increase \n     revenues shall be deemed to have passed the Senate unless \n     approved by a majority of the total membership of each House \n     of Congress by a rollcall vote.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to commend the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, for his \nvery laudable statement, which he made earlier on in the debate this \nevening. I think we are very fortunate in this body to have somebody \nwho is trying to bring accountability to the process. I hope that \nAmerica was listening, because I think he made some very good points, \nand I think as Americans we need to stop to think about our priorities \nand how we would like to see those priorities come down in the budget \nand how we would like to see those priorities in the budget reflect how \nwe want to live our lives as Americans.\n  I have an amendment that I would like to see added to the budget plan \nthat this chairman and his committee has put forward, the plan to pay \ndown the American debt.\n  I think back last year when I proposed an amendment to the then-\nbudget, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, that asked the President of \nthe United States to come forward with a plan on how he might want to \npay down the debt that we have. I think we ought to take a little time \nto define the terms. The deficit is how much more we spend in any 1 \nyear than what we bring in in revenue. The debt is an accumulation of \nall of that excess spending over the years--the accumulation of all of \nthese deficits. So I am of the view that we need to do something; we \nneed to have a plan before us to pay down that debt.\n  The President ignored the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that was \npart of the budget resolution last year, and we got into the budget \ndebate this year. There was simply not any plan coming from the \nPresident, or anybody else at that point, on how we might pay down our \nnational debt running somewhere around $5.6 trillion.\n  So I have decided I will put forward my plan on how I think we might \nbe able to pay down the debt. As we go through the discussion and the \ndebate, I will show that we will even have some money left over as we \npay down the debt to provide some tax relief for Americans.\n  I think we are very fortunate that we have somebody like the chairman \nof the Budget Committee who really believes we need to work to \neliminate the deficit and to balance the budget. It brings forth a \ncertain amount of accountability to the process. I think we need to \nhave leaders like him due to the fact that we do not have a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  I was very disappointed last year that a balanced budget amendment \ndid not pass, because I think we needed that accountability in order to \nassure that the Members of this Senate would work hard to set \npriorities and not ignore deficits that have been accumulating over the \nyears out into the future and to continue to allow the debt to grow \nyear after year.\n  I would like to move forward by beginning to congratulate, again, \nChairman Domenici and the Budget Committee on crafting a sensible \nresolution that maintains the discretionary spending caps previously \nset forth. I reemphasize that is very key in this debate to assure that \nwe have protected the future for our children and grandchildren by \nhaving a responsible budget which holds the promise that we made to the \nAmerican people.\n  Even though it appears that we will realize a surplus before the year \n2002, I believe that it is essential for this Congress to show \nrestraint when it comes to budget surpluses. The future solvency of the \nFederal Government will likely rest on what we do in the next 3 years. \nThere is simply no doubt that the economy is performing well--much \nbetter than anyone has expected. But today's rosy predictions could \nturn out to be a black future if we do not plan appropriately. We must \nbegin the process of paying down the Federal debt and preparing for an \ninvestment-based Social Security system. Some have said that they would \nlike to see the surplus used for Social Security. I say let's do it. \nThe fact of the matter is that making payments on the national debt is \nthe best way to provide flexibility for changes in Social Security in \nthe short term. The last time I came to the floor to discuss the \nnational debt, it stood at $5.476 trillion. Yes, $5.476 trillion. \nToday, even as the U.S. economy continues to grow, we have added $114 \nbillion to the debt, which is now over $5.59 trillion. I believe to not \napply at least a portion of any surplus to pay down the debt is simply \nunconscionable.\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\n  In February, Senator Enzi and I introduced the American Debt \nRepayment Act legislation. It is legislation that I believe is integral \nto the future of this country. I am a realist. I understand that we \ncannot retire the Federal debt immediately. What we can do is create a \nplan which I hope will become a part of the budget plan by which we pay \ndown the debt over a set number of years.\n  This is just a minimal plan. There is nothing in it that says we \ncannot do more. In fact, I hope we can do more because we need to sign \non to a plan to pay down the debt. The American Debt Repayment Act \nprovides such a plan. Senate bill 1608 would amortize and pay off the \ndebt in the year 2028.\n  Frankly, this is as simple as it gets. The plan puts the Federal \nGovernment on a 30-year mortgage to pay its creditors and place our \ncountry on sound financial ground.\n  Because I believe that we must have a plan when dealing with the \ndebt, I am offering this legislation today as an amendment to the \nbudget resolution. By approving this amendment, we have made the \ninitial commitment to pay down the debt. We are saying to the American \npeople that the Federal Government has finally recognized the time has \ncome to begin to pay off our Nation's credit card balance.\n  I realize that there are many competing interests when it comes to \nusing the surplus, and I am willing to meet my colleagues halfway. \nAnything above the amortized payment is not affected by my amendment \nand can be used in any way that Congress may deem appropriate. While I \nadvocate tax relief for the American family from any surplus above the \nrequired payment, my colleagues might decide differently. This \namendment proves that debt reduction and tax relief are not mutually \nexclusive.\n  I would like to take just a moment and refer to the chart that I have \nhere on the floor with me and talk a little bit about the chart. This \nis an amortization schedule, much along the lines of what you would be \nshown if you were to buy a new home. Say you are a new American family; \nyou have just been married; you decide to make probably the first big \ninvestment of your marriage, and you will make a commitment to pay that \ndown over 30 years. Your banker may very well give you a similar chart \nwhich shows how you are going make that payment year after year to pay \ndown the mortgage on your home.\n  This is the plan where we talk about paying down the mortgage of the \nFederal Government year after year. It is a 30-year plan, just pretty \nmuch like everybody's home mortgage. To keep things simple, I have just \nadopted in this proposal pretty much what the Budget Committee has \nestimated will be the surpluses for their 5-year plan. I say fine, we \nwill not argue with the Budget Committee. We will keep that in place. \nBut after that period of time, we ought to set $11.7 billion a year, in \naddition to what we did the year before, towards paying down the debt. \nThis accelerates and accumulates over time.\n  If we do that, let's look at the year 2004, after the current plan \nhas been adopted. In the year 2004, we have $616 million left over for \ntax relief, or maybe program growth or some other needs. When we drop \ninto 2005, that comes up to $2.1 billion over and above what I put \ntogether on this amortization part for program growth or to reduce the \ntax burden. My personal preference, as I stated earlier, is to reduce \nthe tax burden on the American family.\n  What happens over a 30-year period? We save $3.7 trillion. I think \nthat is a pretty substantial step, savings that we can use for Social \nSecurity reform or maybe doing something with our Medicare problems. \nThis is a plan that shows how we can begin to address those very \nserious problems we have before us, but to also keep as a top priority \nof this Congress and this Senate a commitment to pay down this national \ndebt. This plan reflects the amount of savings we are going to save for \nthe future generations, our children and our grandchildren.\n  The important point I want to make here is to have a commitment to \npay down the debt. With even a minor commitment with a 30-year payment, \nwhere we are setting aside $11.7 billion a year, we can accomplish \nthis. We can accomplish this with just a simple, straightforward \ncommitment. I remind everybody, our total budget is somewhere around \n$1.7 trillion. It is not much of the total picture.\n  I believe an excerpt from an article on March 23, 1988, in Newsday \nstrikes right at the heart of the issue. I have a quote out of that \nparticular article. I will read part of it. I have it up here on the \nfloor. It says:\n\n       * * * if Congress and the President agreed to toe the line \n     and direct all surpluses to pay down the debt for the next 30 \n     years [apparently he has thought about this, too] and if the \n     economy remained on a steady, moderate growth path, the \n     government could pay off its entire debt while covering \n     Social Security and other costs.\n\n  Mr. President, I have that article. I ask unanimous consent it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [from Newsday, March 23, 1998]\n\n            Dear Uncle Sam: Use Cash Surplus To Pay Off Debt\n\n                  (By Clay Chandler and John M. Berry)\n\n       Imagine that after years of struggling to gain control of \n     your finances, you suddenly come into some extra money. Even \n     better: Suppose you're likely to earn more money than \n     expected every year for the next decade.\n       How best to use the windfall? A good financial planner \n     might recommend you start by cutting debt.\n       ``One of the very first things I tell my clients is to get \n     rid of debt,'' says L. Edward O'Hara, a financial planner in \n     Silver Spring, Md. ``A lot of people are reluctant until I \n     show them what a huge difference it can make to their \n     financial situation over a long period of time.''\n       Economists are offering much the same advice to Uncle Sam.\n       With the federal government suddenly expecting surpluses \n     estimated between $660 billion and $1.1 trillion over the \n     next decade, a large contingent of fiscal experts is \n     recommending that President Bill Clinton and Congress resist \n     calls for new tax cuts or increased government spending. \n     Instead, many economists argue, the government is likely to \n     get the highest economic return from future surpluses by \n     using them to whittle down the $3.8 trillion in federal debt \n     held by the public.\n       ``Pretty much all macro-economists would be in the debt-\n     reduction camp,'' asserts N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of \n     economics at Harvard University and author of one of the most \n     popular economic textbooks for undergraduates. ``For most of \n     us, the choice seems clear.''\n       Others aren't so sure. Supply-side economists and GOP \n     presidential hopefuls Jack Kemp and Malcolm (Steve) Forbes \n     Jr. blast debt reduction as a ``castor oil'' remedy of no \n     benefit to the economy. A recent Wall Street Journal \n     editorial excoriated Republicans who would ``stand for an \n     abstraction of paying down the national debt . . . even if it \n     means taxing Americans at higher rates than needed to balance \n     the federal books.''\n       At the opposite end of the political spectrum, liberals \n     such as Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) and Northwestern \n     University economist Robert Eisner decry the folly of \n     extinguishing Treasury IOUs with money that might otherwise \n     be ``invested'' in new schools or health care for needy \n     children.\n       Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties, rallying behind \n     House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster (R-Pa.), \n     can tick off reasons why using the surpluses to fund \n     construction of new roads, bridges or other projects in their \n     districts will make the economy more productive.\n       Still, a little-noticed set of long-term projections \n     prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget \n     makes a tantalizing case for the benefits of using projected \n     surpluses over the next 30 years to pay down the debt. If \n     Congress and the president agreed to toe the line and direct \n     all surpluses to pay down debt for the next 30 years, and if \n     the economy remained on a steady, moderate growth path, the \n     government could pay off its entire debt while covering \n     Social Security and other costs.\n       Such an optimistic scenario hasn't been previously \n     envisioned, in part, because official economic projections \n     rarely go out longer than 10 years. But also, pragmatic \n     economists note that it is unlikely a government would direct \n     all surpluses to paying down the debt rather than funding \n     important programs.\n       ``From a political standpoint, the problem is simple: \n     Paying down the debt doesn't get your picture in the paper,'' \n     says economic historian John Steele Gordon. ``There are no \n     ribbon-cutting ceremonies,'' no throngs of grateful \n     constituents.\n       Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron said the OMB \n     projections--while they are based on conservative economic \n     assumptions--may be overly optimistic because they do not \n     incorporate the distinct possibility of a recession. ``The \n     right way to look at this is to say that there has been a \n     distinct change in the budgetary climate,'' Aaron said, \n     noting that he believes current tax and spending policies \n     could produce surpluses for the next 20 years. ``The sun is \n     shining, but that does not mean we won't have deficits\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\n     arising from recessions . . . It does mean we have more elbow \n     room to plan for the restructuring of Medicare and Social \n     Security than we had just a few years ago.''\n       One reason the OMB projections turn out to be so favorable \n     is the enormous saving on interest payments as the size of \n     the debt is reduced. If paying down the debt also caused \n     interest rates to fall somewhat, as some economists believe \n     it would, the fiscal picture would be even brighter.\n       Debt-burdened U.S. families last year used an average of 17 \n     percent of their after-tax income to make interest payments. \n     Similarly, last year the government paid out $244 billion, \n     more than 15 percent of its income, to cover interest on the \n     debt owed to the public.\n       Paying down debt triggers a sort of virtuous cycle: As the \n     amount owed drops, so does the interest due on the remaining \n     unpaid balance, and the saving on interest leaves still more \n     money available to reduce the debt.\n       May economists in the debt-reduction camp concede, however, \n     that their position of pay-down-the-debt-first is colored by \n     assumptions about the mechanics of American democracy. In \n     theory, they acknowledge, it might be possible to craft tax \n     cuts or new spending programs that would harness projected \n     surpluses as efficiently as shrinking the debt. But as a \n     practical matter, they say, such ideas aren't likely to \n     emerge from the legislative sausage grinder in an \n     economically rational form.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I say to my colleagues, this is exactly what my amendment \ndoes, what is talked about in this article. It creates future \nflexibility to deal with the impending Social Security crisis by paying \ndown the debt over 30 years. I understand we cannot budget 30 years \nout--the free market economy does not allow us to do that--but what we \ncan do is adopt a blueprint for the future, a blueprint that Congress \ncan follow to eliminate the debt and show the American people, with a \nlittle bit of discipline, we can do that--and a little bit of \naccountability. The American people know how difficult it is to make a \nliving and pay the home mortgage. Let's give them a hand by retiring \nthe national debt and thereby decrease the interest rates that we pay \non everything from a home loan to a student loan.\n  If somebody asks you, ``How am I going to benefit if you pay down the \ndebt?'' they are going to benefit because we have lower interest rates \nwith tremendous savings for home loans and student loans. A tax cut \nwould most certainly be beneficial, but we cannot cut taxes at the \nexpense of our children's future and our grandchildren's future. I ask \nthat each and every one of my colleagues join me in this effort and \nmake a commitment to retiring the Federal debt by voting to pass this \nsimple, commonsense proposal.\n  Mr. President, if we don't have any further debate on this on either \nside, I yield back the time, if that is appropriate at this particular \npoint, so the Senator from Idaho can be recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the Senator not yield back his \ntime but, rather, let us set his amendment aside, reserving whatever \ntime he has, and we will proceed with the next debate. So tomorrow, if \nmy colleague wants to pick it up when we are in session and use another \nperiod of time, maybe that will give the opponents a chance and we will \nhave a good debate. If we don't need it, we will yield it back then.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman for his suggestion. Mr. President, I \nwill amend my unanimous consent request. I will just yield the floor \nand reserve my time until tomorrow. I may use it at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is reserved.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nCraig, would like to speak for about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time did the distinguished Senator from \nColorado have under the unanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He had 45 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Remaining?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is with an hour allowance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent whatever time the Senator has, \nhe reserve that time and we set aside his amendment so Senator Craig \ncan introduce an amendment and speak to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2211\n\n(Purpose: To modify the pay-as-you-go requirement of the budget process \n to require that direct spending increases be offset only with direct \n                          spending decreases)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for himself, Mr. \n     Allard, Mr. Grams, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. Hutchison, and \n     Mr. Thomas, proposes an amendment numbered 2211.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. REQUIREMENT TO OFFSET DIRECT SPENDING INCREASES BY \n                   DIRECT SPENDING DECREASES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Surplus Protection Amendment''.\n       (b) In General.--In the Senate, for purposes of section 202 \n     of House Concurrent Resolution 67 (104th Congress), it shall \n     not be in order to consider any bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that provides an \n     increase in direct spending unless the increase is offset by \n     a decrease in direct spending.\n       (c) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the \n     concurrent resolution, bill, or joint resolution, as the case \n     may be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of \n     the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n       (e) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of direct spending for a fiscal year \n     shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as I debate this amendment this evening, \nlet me first recognize my colleague from Colorado, who has just brought \nbefore the Senate an almost unbelievable proposal. I say that because \nit is difficult for us to fathom a savings of $3.7 trillion to the \nAmerican taxpayer and to future generations in this Nation by taking it \nupon ourselves to pay down the Federal debt over a 30-year period. I am \nproud to support my colleague from Colorado. It is these kinds of \ninitiatives that I think reflect to the American people that we really \nare sincere about getting the spending habits of this Government, and \nthe debt we have accumulated over the last good number of years, under \ncontrol. It is also very reflective of the kind of impact that \ncontrolling deficits and debts has on our economy and on our future \ngenerations.\n  So, in my offering of the amendment this evening, I am proud the \nSenator from Colorado has joined me along with Senator Helms, Senator \nHutchison, Senator Inhofe, Senator Grams, and Senator Thomas. Mine is a \nsimilar measure to once again shape the spending habits of this \nCongress. My amendment is entitled the ``Surplus Protection \nAmendment,'' because it does just that; it protects the surplus from \nirresponsible spending.\n  Current budget policy as we know it, pay-as-you-go--so-called PAYGO--\nbudget enforcement rules were established to help put Washington's \nfiscal house in order. Since fiscal year 1994, the Senate has had a \npoint of order requiring 60 votes to waive against any legislation \nwhich would result in mandatory spending increases that would increase \nthe deficit. Mandatory spending in Washington's version of a fiscal \nautopilot. Once enacted, it requires no\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\nfurther congressional action to operate. And we know that. We see it \nhappening right here. It is a part of this budget resolution. Rather \nthan a perpetual motion machine, mandatory spending is a perpetual \nspending machine. It is the Energizer Bunny of budgeting, and it has \nkept this budget growing and growing and growing.\n  What does all of this mean? Any increase in mandatory spending must \nbe paid for with a tax increase, and any tax cut must be paid for by a \nmandatory spending cut. We wonder why taxes are high. We wonder why it \nis so difficult to cut taxes. Those are the reasons. As anyone can \ntell, PAYGO--that is what we call this provision in its present form--\nisn't sufficient. Mandatory spending has increased dramatically and \nwill continue to increase dramatically as far as any of us can sense \nit.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, in 1987, mandatory \nspending accounted for 47 percent of the Federal budget. In 1997, it \naccounted for 56 percent of the Federal budget, and in the year 2008 \nunder this budget resolution, it will account for about 70 percent of \nthe total Federal budget.\n  Now remember, that is the portion that is on auto pilot; that is the \nportion that just keeps growing and growing and growing. This means \nthat there has been and will increasingly be a crowding out of what the \nFederal Government can spend on schools, on roads, on law enforcement, \nand some of those fundamental things that keep our country operating in \na civil way, the kind of things for which historically our Government \nwas envisioned to have a responsibility.\n  I believe because of that it is time that we try to make a change. \nCurrent estimates are that the budget will be balanced this year, and \nthe budget chairman, my colleague from New Mexico, the senior Senator \nwho has done such a marvelous job shaping and nurturing and bringing \nthis balanced budget along, is going to see that that happens. We are \ngoing to help him, and of that we are proud.\n  As far as we can see out there, we are 4 years ahead of schedule on \nbalancing the budget, and I applaud it. I am proud to have been a part \nof it, and I think it is wonderful for the American people, for our \neconomy, for job creation and all that that means. The Senator from New \nMexico can be rightfully proud of it, and I know he is. However, we \nmust look not just at the horizon of the current budget, but we ought \nto look beyond it, beyond the 4 years. I know we can't get beyond it in \nthe budget process, but we can get beyond it in the policy. We can get \nbeyond it in how we operate moving toward the future.\n  To avoid what will happen in the future, we must change the way we \nwork now. I am proposing, as a modest first step, that like a good \ndoctor, we first pledge to do no harm, and I believe my modest first \nstep does no harm.\n  My surplus protection amendment establishes a point of order that \nrequires new mandatory spending programs be paid for by mandatory \nspending savings. Let me repeat that.\n  My amendment establishes a point of order that requires new mandatory \nspending programs be paid for by mandatory spending savings. In other \nwords, it would require 60 votes in the Senate to create a new \nmandatory spending program that was not funded by an equivalent \nmandatory spending savings.\n  If all of the new mandatory spending programs had been paid for, as \nwe had claimed, we would not be facing a fiscal future with exploding \nspending and exploding deficits in the outyears.\n  Why does this Senate and this country need the Craig amendment? I \nthink the current budget path that the Senator from New Mexico and all \nof us have worked so hard on is truly unsustainable. As good as a \nbalanced budget today is, without ever more fundamental changes, it \nwill not remain balanced. And it ought to be our goal to at least \nstrive to maintain a balanced budget.\n  That this path is unsustainable is no secret. We all know because of \nwhat we have been told by so many. My colleague, Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska, who chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax \nReform has said that is impossible to do. The General Accounting Office \nsays we cannot sustain a balanced budget under our current scenario, \nand the President's own budget office says so.\n  In its most recent report, the Congressional Budget Office states:\n\n       Currently, more than half of the nearly $1.7 trillion in \n     Federal spending goes for entitlements and other mandatory \n     programs (other than net interest) . . . As a share of total \n     outlays, mandatory spending has jumped from 32 percent in \n     1962 to 56 percent in 1997. If current policies remain \n     unchanged, such spending will continue to grow faster than \n     other spending, reaching 63 percent of total outlays by the \n     year 2002--or twice the size of discretionary outlays. Under \nbaseline assumptions, continued growth in mandatory outlays would raise \ntheir share of the budget to 70 percent by the year 2008.\n\n  Last year, the Congressional Budget Office wrote:\n\n       [T]his year's budgetary news should not lull people into \n     complacency: the retirement of the large baby-boom generation \n     is just over the horizon--\n\n  Just beyond where this budget and all of us can see--\n\n       . . .If the budgetary pressure from both demography and \n     health care spending is not relieved by reducing the growth \n     of expenditures or increasing taxes, deficits will mount and \n     seriously erode future economic growth.\n\n  That is the reality of what we deal with. That report concluded, Mr. \nPresident:\n\n       [C]urrent budget policy is unsustainable, and attempting to \n     preserve it would severely damage the economy.\n\n  How serious are future projections? The Congressional Budget Office \nconcluded that even if the budget were balanced through 2002--and that \nis our goal, that is the goal of this budget--if that were true, we \nwould still have a deficit equal to 34 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct by the year 2050 and the public debt would be 283 percent of \nthe gross domestic product.\n  There will be a demographic shift to an older population. We all know \nthat. The experts show us that. I am part of that. I am a baby boomer.\n  In 1995, there were 34 million 65-year-old, or older, citizens. In \nthe year 2030, there will be twice that number or 68 million. There \nwill be more elderly. They will be living longer and using Federal \nservices much more intensively. There will be relatively fewer workers \naround to pay all the bills. Let us remember that it is the current \nworking population that generates the economy that pays the bills.\n  In 1950, there were 7.3 workers for every senior. In 1990, there were \n4.8 to 1 senior. In the year 2030, there will be 2.8 workers per every \n1 senior.\n  So if that senior is receiving well over $1,000 a month in Social \nSecurity benefits and maybe health care benefits, who is paying for it? \nThose 2.8 workers. Divide it up. Count it out. It is pretty obvious how \nmuch has to come out of their wages on a monthly basis to transfer it \nto that senior's well-being.\n  What the demographic shift means is that spending will rise rapidly \nrelative to revenues. Quoting the Congressional Budget Office:\n\n       Revenues will be squeezed as the number of people working--\n     and the economy--grows more slowly. At the same time, outlays \n     for Government programs that aid the elderly will burgeon as \n     the number of people eligible to receive benefits from those \n     programs shoots up.\n\n  What the fiscal squeeze means, if we don't begin to recognize it now, \nis enormous deficits. Just at a time when we thought the deficit battle \nwas over, when this Congress has battled through to get to a balanced \nbudget, where we are now, all of a sudden this begins to dramatically \nshift. We know it will happen because the facts, the figures and the \nspending programs are already in law.\n  The deficit last year was less than 1 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct of our country. In 2035 it would be 29.8 percent. Let me repeat \nthat. The deficit by the year 2035 will be 29.8 percent of the gross \ndomestic product if we don't begin to shape it down and scale it down.\n  The Federal debt was 50 percent of the gross domestic product last \nyear. Now we are talking about debt. It would be 250 percent by the \nyear 2035. These are not my figures. These are the projections of the \nprofessionals, the budget professionals--the Congressional Budget \nOffice and others--who look at the long term, who put on the binoculars \nand look over the horizon to see what our spending programs must yield \nto benefit the citizens who are\n\n[[Page S2846]]\n\nliving today who will be recipients of those benefits in the year 2035.\n  Those figures I have given you are truly unprecedented. We have never \nhad to deal with them before as a percentage of the gross domestic \nproduct of this country. The deficit has been higher than 10 percent of \nGDP, but only briefly and during a major war. Not during peace times, \nnot during prosperity, but at a time when we were fighting for the \nsafety and the security of this country.\n  The debt exceeded 100 percent only once, briefly during World War II. \nThe results, if we were to continue to do this with these projections I \nhave just given you, would be economic catastrophe. Even to make the \nburden sustainable, in CBO's terminology, allowing debt to rise but \nkeeping it at a constant to the gross domestic product rate would have \ndire consequences. In other words, we can't just sustain where we are. \nWe have to begin to back away from where we are and do so over an \nextended period of time. The tax burden would have to increase 20 \npercent above where it is today just to continue running deficits and \nadding debt.\n  Of course, some will say that this budget agreement solves the \nproblem. I wish it did. It solves the problem in the short term, and \nfor that we are proud. For that all of us who vote for it and support \nit and support the chairman in what he is bringing before us ought to \nbe proud. We have a right to be. But it is within the short term. It is \nin the foreseeable future.\n  It is certainly an improvement, but it only delays the same scenario \nthat I have just sketched out. According to the CBO, even if the budget \nis balanced through the year 2010--and that is the Congressional Budget \nOffice speaking--it will take less than 15 years to reach the scenario \nthat I have just projected, and that is a debt that consumes over 250 \npercent of the gross domestic product of this country.\n  The Congressional Budget Office states:\n\n       Regardless of how the budget is balanced in the near term, \n     additional budgetary action. . .would still be needed to put \n     the budget on a sustainable path.\n\n  I am offering, as I said, a modest first step. The year 2030 and the \nyear 2050 are unreal to any of us on this floor. But if there are any \nyoung people in the galleries tonight, it is their budget. It will be \ntheir Government. It will be their responsibility to run it. And it \nwill be their responsibility to pay for it. The Congressional Budget \nOffice paints such an alarming picture that even the authors cannot \nimagine it, and they write this:\n\n       Policymakers would surely take action before the economy \n     was driven to such dire straits.\n\n  So even those who analyze it are willing to say surely those of us--\nthat's me, that's you, Mr. President--as policymakers would never allow \nthis to happen. But we are not taking steps to change it. We are \ndealing in the short term, and we have to deal in the short term first. \nFor that I have already applauded the chairman and the ranking member, \nbut we have to do more.\n  Now is the time for us at least to prepare for such an action. My \namendment takes this first modest step that we do no fiscal harm to our \nchildren, like a good doctor would.\n  The first frightening thing in the CBO report is that it only \naddresses existing programs. It makes plain that our children cannot \nafford them. The existing programs are not now and will not in the \nfuture be paid for by our taxes. We certainly cannot responsibly add \nmore.\n  Regrettably, the President's budget adds more: $28 billion in new \nmandatory spending, $118 billion in total new spending, and $43 billion \nless in surplus that would be saved for Social Security as the \nPresident himself has called for.\n  My amendment will not affect a single beneficiary for a single \nexisting program. My amendment will not even affect anyone who would be \nqualified in the future for one of these programs. My amendment will \nnot prevent a tax increase in order to reduce deficits. And my \namendment will not even prevent a new spending program if a new program \nis so important that there is a supermajority, 60 votes in this body, \nto bring about a new spending program. This amendment should appeal to \neveryone serious about deficits. It will merely make sure that there is \nan overwhelming demand for a new program before we create it.\n  These are shared goals. By all 66 who supported the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution last year. By even those who opposed it \nbecause it included Social Security. For whatever purpose people want \nto use the surplus, they must first be protected. My amendment not only \nprotects them now but will for the future. Because mandatory spending \nhas historically failed to adhere to estimates, we must offset new \nmandatory spending with mandatory savings.\n  Good-faith first steps are something that we should all come together \non. So I urge my colleagues to take a look into the future to recognize \nthose figures that are very real, that no one disputes, whether it is \nthe President's budget estimators or whether it is our Congressional \nBudget Office. My amendment is a modest first step to look beyond the \nhorizon of a balanced budget, to recognize that our current spending \nprograms produce deficits and debts in the future that we have not yet \ndevised a method to respond to. And I would suggest, Mr. President, \nthat my amendment would attempt to do just that.\n  With that, I have spoken about this issue all that I would care to \ntonight. I would be happy to reserve the balance of my time if no one \nelse wishes to speak to this issue this evening.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Before the chairman speaks, let me ask, Mr. President, \nthat Senators Sessions and Coverdell be put on my amendment as original \ncosponsors. I ask unanimous consent that that be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just say, when we were attempting \nto come up with a constitutional amendment that would work with \nreference to a balanced budget, Senator Craig was the leader, and we \nall worked with him in an effort to get an amendment which controlled \nspending through controlling the amount of debt that could be issued. \nAnd, frankly, that was a lot better approach than many before it \nbecause it was actually doable, it was achievable, and it was \nunderstandable.\n  And it controlled spending in the right way, because essentially \nspending is one thing, but spending when you do not have the money is \nanother thing. And we have such a powerful country that we can borrow \nand borrow and borrow. It is just in recent years that we have finally \ngot a hold of our senses and have taken such a lead in the world, the \nindustrial world where we have competition and capitalism and free \nenterprise. We have taken such a lead of late because we are getting \nour debt under control.\n  I think it is fair to say we are also getting our entitlement \nprograms under control. We have never before, before the last decade, \nbeen so concerned--and rightly so--about entitlement programs as part \nof the package of expenditures that make up our budget for which we \neither pay or, if we do not have enough tax receipts, for which we \nborrow. And while I am not certain that I will support the amendment \nexactly as it is--I have not made up my mind--I do think it is welcome \nhere on the floor, because we have been talking about a lot of new \nentitlements in an era where we are proud of balanced budgets and an \nera of surpluses.\n\n  While they are not totally inconsistent--to be talking about an era \nof surpluses and balanced budgets for many, many decades--it is obvious \nthat the biggest danger is new entitlement programs. And since we \ncannot increase discretionary programs, as the Senator well knows, \nbecause we finally found a way with the caps and the automatic \nsequester at the end of the year--found a way to control them, and \neverybody now expects us to, the next front is to increase entitlements \nand in some way find money to pay for them, but that will just make a \nmuch bigger, bigger budget and it will be more and more dangerous than \neven if you increase discretionary spending.\n  If you increase discretionary spending 1 year, you don't have to the \nnext year. But if you increase entitlements, you have to change \nentitlements. If\n\n[[Page S2847]]\n\nyour estimating is wrong, you have to have an amendment. By then, you \nhave people who have been receiving the entitlement; right? Not so easy \nto change.\n  So I commend you on the thrust of the amendment and the remarks \ntonight. I think they are welcome in the debate we have had for the \nlast 2 years.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nfor those remarks. I think they are candid and appropriate to the very \nessence of my own that, at a time when we have an opportunity to begin \nto shape control over mandatory spending, we ought to take a look at \nthis time, and we can do that in a unique period in our Nation's \nhistory which we all fought to get to. So I thank my colleague for \nthose comments.\n  I ask to retain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the amendment will take its place among \nthe many amendments which will be at some point appropriately sequenced \nfor votes.\n  Does the Senator from New Jersey wish to speak?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened with interest and do not \nwant to enlarge the debate at this time. Obviously, the hour is late, \nbut I listened with a degree of interest and care to the comments of \nthe Senator from Idaho. And we have this debate sometimes that centers \naround whether the glass is half empty or half full. And we are looking \nat the same matrix, but I see it differently. I do not see a nation out \nof control. I do not see an economy that is in great jeopardy. I do not \ndespair over what is taking place in our economic structure. Yes, we \nare paying more taxes in total, but that is because people's incomes \nhave gone up and thus they are paying a larger share of the tax burden \nthan they used to pay.\n  But when we look at a time when the unemployment rate compares to \nall-time lows, when we see inflation so well controlled, when we see \nthe investment climate in our country so appetizing, no one knows when \nthis is going to change, but the fact of the matter is, lots of people, \nlots of hard-working, what we will call modest-income people, have made \ngood returns on their investments. And, Lord willing, they will be \nprotected.\n  But why is all that taking place? Why has the stock market galloped \nup like it has? It is not simply because there is some kind of a \nspeculation fever out there. A lot of it has to do with the fact that \nthe United States is the most attractive investment country in the \nworld. People feel secure. They know if they invest in America that \nthey have a better chance of keeping their money safe and getting a \nreturn than any other place because of the structure of our financial \nbeing. We cannot ignore these things.\n  I share the Senator's view. I would like to see us paying off the \ndebt. I am one of those who said, yes, I want to shore up Social \nSecurity. And how are we going to do it? We are going to do it by \npaying down the debt. The President has forecast over $1 trillion worth \nof surpluses over the next 10 years. That is a pretty encouraging \nprediction.\n  So, I hope we will continue this debate on the morrow, because I \nthink there are other people here who would also want to comment.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we ought to ever lock ourselves into \nstraitjackets to say that you cannot do this unless you do that. We are \nsent here to exercise judgment. And when I hear the speeches of some of \nmy colleagues, I say, well, we sound like a bunch of recalcitrant \nchildren who have to be locked in a corner or put in our seats, or we \nare so bad--why can't we control ourselves? I do not see it that way.\n  I must tell you, I have great respect for those that I disagree \ndeeply with here. They are sent here to represent a constituency who \nthinks that these people, the Senators in this Chamber, are going to \ncarry a point of view that they share. And if not, there is a test that \ncomes every 6 years. And you can see what happens. You have either \npassed the test or you have flunked it; it is very decisive.\n  But with all of that, I just do not see this, if I might call it, \nself-flagellation, this beating of ourselves. Look at the facts. The \neconomy is really good. I know that I feel better about my children's \nfuture now than I did a few years ago. I think we have proven one \nthing. And some would say, well, we have not, Alan Greenspan has. He is \npart of our crowd, whether we think we are in his league or not.\n  The fact of the matter is, we have inflation under control--something \nthat was hard to believe could be done, and has not caused deflation, \nhas not caused a crisis. Things are going along very well.\n\n  So I hope, Mr. President, we will have a chance to chat about this a \nlittle bit tomorrow, and I hope we will be able to encourage our \ncolleagues to vote against the Craig amendment, to say that we do not \nhave to put on the handcuffs and apologize for our behavior. I do not \nthink I do everything right, but I know one thing: I work at what I do. \nAnd so does everybody else here.\n  I do not think there is anybody here who shirks their responsibility, \nwho does not take it seriously. And I do not think I have to be put in \na corner like a child and told, well, you are not going to be allowed \nto do this unless you do that; you are not going to be allowed to spend \nmoney. How do we know when the crisis is coming?\n  We have done the things we said we ought to do. We have a balanced \nbudget. I think we are all proud of that. We can argue whether it is \nCBO balanced. We say, yes it is. We all kind of believe that on a \nunified budget basis we are going to be seeing a slight surplus in the \nvery short period. So I hope our colleagues will stand up and say no to \nlimiting our ability to use our heads, to use our judgment, to take the \nrisk of our votes and to see if we can do things without limiting our \nability to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we are about ready, as soon as the clock \nstrikes 10 o'clock, to recess. I think I have a long enough list of \nunanimous consent requests for all those wonderfully glowing, smiling \nfaces lined up alongside of the dais there. We will be 1 minute or 2 \npast 10 before we finish.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote in relationship to the Conrad amendment No. 2174 now occur at \n2 p.m., with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I also ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nresumes the budget resolution on Wednesday, there be 20 hours remaining \nunder the overall statutory time limitation. And, finally, I ask \nunanimous consent that when the Senate resumes the resolution on \nWednesday, the Coverdell amendment No. 2199 be the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2828-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, today is the last day of Women's History \nMonth.'' Throughout the month of March, we've paid tribute to the \nvision of women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott and Susan B. \nAnthony, the founders of the first Women's Rights Convention 150 years \nago in Seneca Falls, New York. We've recognized the historic \nachievements and celebrated the legacies of Ameila Earhart, Marion \nAnderson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Dolores Huerta and hundreds of other \nAmerican leaders.\n  During Women's History Month, it is also appropriate that we pay \ntribute to the countless American women whose names and great works are \nknown only to their families, neighbors and friends. These women may \nnot grace the pages of history books, but their contributions as \nmothers, teachers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and scientists have\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\nshaped the direction and progress of this great country.\n  In my own state of South Dakota, women of the plains have a long \nhistory of facing challenges with self-reliance and fortitude. \nCourageous women pioneers worked alongside fathers, husbands, and \nbrothers to clear land, build homesteads, and establish schools, \nbusinesses and towns. In 1998, the women of South Dakota continue to \nbuild upon the legacy left by their foremothers of strong families and \na better life for future generations.\n  Sadly, we lost one such woman this year. But the spirit of Sister \nMaurice Crowley of Aberdeen, South Dakota will remain alive in the \nhearts of all who knew her. Her legacy of laughter, joy and a lifelong \ncommitment to education continues on in those whose lives she touched. \nAs one of her first grade students more than forty years ago, I am one \nof those people.\n  Sister Crowley was an incredible human being blessed with great \nwarmth, sharp wit and Irish charm. With characteristic humor Sister \nMaurice Crowley used to joke, God created Adam, stepped back, took a \nlook, and said, ``I can do better than that.'' Man or woman, we all \nbenefit when we pay respect and honor those who make a difference in \nothers' lives. It is with great respect and admiration that I pay \npersonal tribute to Sister Maurice Crowley during Women's History \nMonth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2847-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

One of our very own, an employee of the United \nStates Senate, Mr. Donnee Gray, was at that game--not as a player or as \na spectator, but as an official.\n  Mr. Gray has worked in the Senate Library for 22 years, diligently \nhelping Senate staffs with legislative and legal research. His \nexpertise is well known and respected.\n  For more than a decade, Mr. Gray also has been officiating basketball \ngames at various levels of competition--from Olympic and international \ntournaments to NCAA Division I college games. During the past several \nyears, Mr. Gray has been honored by the NCAA by being chosen to \nofficiate the first round of the tournament. This year, Mr. Gray's \ninvolvement in March Madness began with the first round, continued in \nthe Sweet Sixteen round and culminated last night in the final game. \nThe NCAA's selection of Mr. Gray exemplifies his judgment and \nintegrity, as well as his superior knowledge of the game and its rules.\n  This really is a remarkable achievement by a remarkable and talented \nyoung man. We are proud of Mr. Gray and congratulate him on his \nselection as an official in the national championship NCAA basketball \ngame. We also thank him for his outstanding work here in the United \nStates Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2848-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NOMINATION OF JAMES C.

He was confirmed by the Senate for \nthat position in 1997. He was also a member of the U.S. Delegation to \nthe United Nations Human Rights Commission. In 1995 he participated in \nPresident Clinton's Conference on the Pacific Rim.\n  Jim Hormel is a talented lawyer who has shown his commitment to \npublic service by establishing the James C. Hormel Public Service \nProgram at the University of Chicago. This program is designed to \nencourage law students to enter careers in public service.\n  Jim Hormel is also a dedicated and energetic community activist. He \nwas instrumental in developing resources for organizations serving \npeople affected by HIV and AIDS, and he serves on the board of \ndirectors of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Recently, he \nwas honored by Breast Cancer Action for his leadership of the Men's \nCampaign Against Breast Cancer. He has also been a leader for human \nrights in his capacity as a director of the Human Rights Campaign \nFoundation.\n  Jim Hormel is also a renowned philanthropist, and he has supported an \nimpressively diverse array of causes, including the American Indian \nCollege Fund, the United Negro College Fund, Jewish Family and \nChildren's Services, the Catholic Youth Organization, the NAACP, the \nSan Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San \nFrancisco Public Library, the San Francisco Ballet, and the Virginia \nInstitute of Autism.\n  It was entirely fitting that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \noverwhelmingly approved his nomination last November. At the time, no \nSenator spoke in opposition. Only after the meeting did two Senators \nask to be recorded against the nomination.\n  I share the concern expressed by other strong supporters of this \nnomination that action on Jim Hormel's confirmation is being delayed \nbecause he is gay. Delay on that basis would be irresponsible and \nunacceptable. Prejudice based on sexual orientation should have no \nplace in this debate, no place in the Senate, and no place in America.\n  It is long past time for the Senate to vote on this nomination. Jim \nHormel will be an excellent ambassador for the United States, and \ndeserves to be confirmed as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2848-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2848-4", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2848-S2849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORTS CONCERNING B-2 BOMBERS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 116\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, \n1998, Public Law 105-56 (1997), and section 131 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, Public Law 105-85 (1997), I \ncertify to the Congress that no additional B-2 bombers should be \nprocured during this fiscal year.\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\n  After considering the recommendations of the Panel to Review Long-\nRange Air Power and the advice of the Secretary of Defense, I have \ndecided that the $331 million authorized and appropriated for B-2 \nbombers in Fiscal year 1998 will be applied as follows: $174 million \nwill be applied toward completing the planned Fiscal Year 1998 baseline \nmodification and repair program and $157 million will be applied toward \nfurther upgrades to improve the deployability, survivability, and \nmaintainability of the current B-2 fleet. Using the funds in this \nmanner will ensure successful completion of the baseline modification \nand repair program and further enhance the operational combat readiness \nof the B-2 fleet.\n  The Panel to Review Long-Range Air Power also provided several far-\nreaching recommendations for fully exploiting the potential of the \ncurrent B-1, B-2, and B-52 bomber force, and for upgrading and \nsustaining the bomber force for the longer term. These longer term \nrecommendations warrant careful review as the Department of Defense \nprepares its Fiscal Year 2000-2006 Future Years Defense Program.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to remove the \nprohibition on agricultural trade options outside contract markets; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             THE TRADE OPTIONS FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS ACT\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Trade \nOptions for Farmers and Ranchers Act (TOFRA). This legislation will \nprovide farmers and ranchers across the United States with new, \nimproved and affordable risk management products to help producers \nsucceed in the 21st century.\n  This bill fulfills a promise we made to America's farmers and \nranchers during the 1996 farm bill debate. The far-reaching, market-\noriented reforms contained in the Freedom to Farm Act have provided \nsubstantial financial benefits to agriculture producers throughout the \ncountry. At the same time, this policy must be buttressed by proper \nrisk management tools, regulatory relief, tax changes and a consistent, \nstrong export policy. As a result, while leading the fight to get the \nfederal government out of producers' daily lives and pocket-books, I \npromised to fight for better tools to help manage the tremendous \nfinancial risk that is inherent in life on the farm today.\n  The TOFRA would repeal the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's \nprohibition on the sale of over-the-counter agriculture trade options. \nThe CFTC ban dates to the Great Depression. It was put in place during \na time when financial and commodity markets were viewed with both \nsuspicion and fear. Today, we live in a time of mutual funds, \ncomputerized financial transactions and round-the-clock, global \ncommodity trading. While we should never forget the important lessons \nof the Great Depression, we must not let the troubling memories of the \npast hold back our nation's farmers and ranchers when there is so much \npromise in the future.\n  The CFTC's agriculture option ban created a monopoly. Today, if a \nfarmer or rancher wants to hedge his price risk with an agriculture \noption, he must purchase the option from a commodity exchange. Over the \nyears, the exchanges have performed a valuable service to farmers and \nranchers by giving them the opportunity to manage their price risk in a \nregulated environment. Despite their best efforts, organized \nexchanges--primarily as a result of excessive regulation--have not been \nable to keep up with the tremendous demand in Farm Country for newer, \nbetter alternatives to existing risk management tools.\n  I will continue to support legislative efforts to allow all \ninterested parties--commodities exchanges included--to sell a wider \nvariety of financial products. In fact, I continue to be frustrated \nwith the CFTC's unwillingness to provide organized exchanges with the \nsame basic business opportunities available to over-the-counter \nbrokers. This bias is unfortunate and counterproductive to both buyers \nand sellers of commodities.\n  At the same time, overly restrictive regulations are preventing \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers from receiving the new, innovative \nproducts they need. The CFTC ban on over-the-counter agriculture \noptions has been maintained in order to ``save farmers from \nthemselves.'' The argument here is that farmers, grain elevators and \nothers in rural America don't understand how options work. Therefore, \nthe federal government has seen fit to limit severely the development \nof, and competition in, financial instruments that would provide \nsubstantial benefits to producers who understand commodity marketing in \norder to protect the few remaining producers who have no interest in \nmanaging price risk. Basically, current federal policy in this area is \ntargeted towards the 1930s instead of the 2030s.\n  Agriculture options are complex, expensive financial instruments. In \norder to use them properly, producers must have specialized knowledge \nof commodity marketing and the risks associated with participating in \nthem. As a result, many producers may choose not to use the additional \nfinancial products made possible through this legislation. However, \nagriculture options should be readily available to those producers with \nthe skill, knowledge and desire to use them.\n  It is important that agriculture options--whether sold on an \norganized commodity exchange or through an over-the-counter broker--be \nsufficiently regulated. This legislation will simply make agriculture \noptions just like all other options. If you purchase an option on \nwheat, natural gas or common stock, the bookkeeping, registration and \ndisclosure requirements should be the same. Similarly, strong \nprotections against fraud and manipulation are included to help prevent \nand punish fly-by-night operations and bucket-shops. In short, this \nbill establishes a simple formula: provide business opportunity with \nlimited, but vigorously enforced rules. With proper oversight, this \nbill will be good for producers, brokers, businesses and consumers \nalike.\n  I do want to thank the CFTC for recently submitting a proposed rule \nthat would begin to lift its long-held ban on over-the-counter \nagriculture trade options. They have taken the initial step toward \nremoving the ban on off-exchange agriculture options trading. \nUnfortunately, the CFTC's proposal is so limited, so burdened with red-\ntape and reporting requirements, that significant benefit is doubtful. \nNo new\n\n[[Page S2852]]\n\nproducts, no improved products and no more competition to drive down \nthe price of risk management for America's farmers and ranchers.\n  I am hopeful this legislation will renew CFTC interest in a workable \nregulation to govern agriculture option trading. I also urge the CFTC \nto act quickly to make these important tools available to America's \nfarmers and ranchers. In conclusion, let me simply say this: if we give \nour producers a helping hand and appropriate safeguards, they will do \nthe rest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1884\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a medical innovation tax credit for clinical testing research \nexpenses attributable to academic medical centers and other qualified \nhospital research organizations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the medical innovation tax credit act of 1998\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my colleagues, Senators Rockefeller, Hutchison, Feinstein and \nBoxer, to create a new tax credit that will make it easier for medical \nschools, teaching hospitals, and non-for-profit research hospitals to \ninvest in potentially life saving medical research. Our bill will add \nSection 41A to the Internal Revenue Code to establish a Medical \nInnovation Tax Credit. This new credit would apply to qualified medical \ninnovation expenses for biopharmaceutical research activities, \nincluding clinical trials, at qualified academic institutions. The \ncredit rate would be 20% of qualified expenses on research conducted in \nthe United States. This tax incentive is necessary in order to assure \nthat the United States maintains its position as the leading country \nfor biomedical research.\n\n  The Medical Innovation Tax Credit will supplement the current law \nResearch and Experimental Tax Credit (R) which has allowed \nbiopharmaceutical companies to invest hundreds of billions of dollars \nin research for new drug therapies. Clinical trials are conducted by \nthese drug companies in order to obtain FDA approval. However, these \ninitial studies are only a fraction of the applied research needed to \nfollow patients and to discover possible combinations of drugs which \nprovide the most effective therapy. These post-approval studies are \nperformed by clinical investigators and major academic medical centers.\n  Until recently, medical schools, teaching hospitals, and not-for-\nprofit hospitals were able to fund research from their operating \nprofits. Many physicians chose to practice at these hospitals at a \nreduced salary based on the opportunity to engage in teaching and \nclinical research. With the profound changes in the health care \nindustry over the last few years, this profit no longer exists. In the \nera of managed care, many insurance companies are reimbursing \nphysicians and hospitals at the cost of services. Combined with cuts in \nMedicare payments and reduced subsidies for graduate medical education, \nteaching hospitals can barely afford to pay their medical staff's \nsalary, let alone fund its research.\n  These financing changes have had the largest impact on hospitals \naffiliated with academic medical centers. A recent study found a 22% \ndecline in clinical research conducted at member hospitals of the \nAssociation of American Medical College's Council of Teaching \nHospitals. This drop is alarming because it demonstrates that these \nhospitals no longer have the financial resources to contribute to the \npublic's health. Traditionally, academic medical centers trained new \ndoctors, supported applied biomedical research, and provided the bulk \nof uncompensated care for uninsured patients. Under this system medical \nresidents had the opportunity to treat a wide spectrum of patients, \nregardless of their health insurance status. In addition, uninsured \npatients were able to receive the latest care within the scope of \nclinical trials performed at academic hospitals. With reductions in \nprivate and public funding these medical centers have been forced to \nreduce these social services to compete with for-profit-hospitals with \nno research agenda. This development promises only to stagnate the \nlevel of care and number of treatment options that the next generation \nof doctors can offer their patients.\n\n  Mr. President, my state of New York has 12 medical schools and 40 \nteaching hospitals, in addition to 8 designated cancer centers. Each of \nthese institutions will be eligible for the Medical Innovation Tax \nCredit. Without continued funding of research at these institutions, \nmany New Yorkers will recognize a profound effect upon the quality of \ntheir health care. Without the opportunity to conduct research many of \nthe country's top doctors may leave to\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\npractice in locations where they can earn more money. Such a move will \nalso reduce the need for research specialists and their staffs. \nPatients will have to choose between hospitals that only recognize the \nbottom line while their children will not enjoy the same medical \nadvances as they did. Many uninsured patients will not be able to \nreceive uncompensated care and will not be able to receive the most \nadvanced medicine possible.\n  And these changes aren't just particular to my state. Almost every \nstate has a medical school which serves as the epicenter for a network \nof teaching hospitals which employ thousands of physicians, nurses, \nresearch specialists, and support staff. A large percentage of each \nstate's economy is based on these medical centers. Thus, we all stand \nto recognize two main benefits from the Medical Innovation Tax Credit, \nmore jobs and better health. Only by encouraging private investment in \nmedical research can our health care infrastructure develop new and \ninnovative ways to deliver the most advanced care to all citizens of \nour country.\n  We urge all of our colleagues to support this legislation that will \nrestore to medical schools and teaching hospitals the ability to \nperform applied biomedical research to help treat and cure many of our \npressing health needs such as cancer and heart disease. This is a \ntargeted measure which has widespread benefits for all citizens.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator D'Amato, \nSenator Boxer, Senator Rockefeller and others in support of legislation \nto create the Medical Innovation Tax Credit. The proposed tax credit \ncan be an effective complement to the existing research and \nexperimentation tax credit. The new proposal will support additional \nmedical research at fine research universities, like the University of \nCalifornia and Stanford University, assisting in the development of new \nproducts to improve health and save lives. I am pleased to support \nSenator D'Amato's proposal.\n  Under the legislation, the Medical Innovation Tax Credit would \nprovide a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company with a tax credit \nequal to 20% of their expenditures for human drug clinical trials \nconducted at medical schools, university teaching hospitals or non-\nprofit research hospitals working in conjunction with the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  The proposal will provide an important incentive to conduct the \nresearch trials in the university hospital setting, improving academic \ntraining, health care and the development of new research and bio-\nmedical products.\n  The legislation will assist medical schools and research institutions \nleverage additional private sector support for medical schools and \nteaching hospitals. Teaching hospitals have historically been an \nimportant site of research activity. However, partially because of the \nuniversities' broad education mission, teaching hospitals face a cost-\ndisadvantage when compared to a ``for profit'' contract research \norganization. This new research credit will help level the playing \nfield for medical schools and teaching hospitals.\n  The proposal will help provide, in an indirect manner, additional \nresources for medical research. The administration and Congress both \nenthusiastically support increasing federal support for medical \nresearch through the National Institutes of Health. However, with our \nacute budget needs, Congress may face difficulty in meeting our goals. \nCongress can provide new sources of revenue for these research \nhospitals by encouraging them to serve as sites for clinical trials. \nOnly clinical research activities conducted in the United States can \nqualify for the credit, decreasing the economic incentive to move the \nresearch activities to lower cost facilities off-shore.\n  The support is appropriate because academic health centers address \nimportant societal priorities, accepting expenses other medical \nfacilities may not have to incur.\n  University-based teaching hospitals provide a disproportionate share \nof high-cost, critical services to low-income or uninsured individuals.\n  University-based teaching hospitals carry a higher burden of \nnecessary, but in many cases unprofitable, services, such as emergency \ntrauma care and burn unit facilities. Academic health centers represent \nonly 2% of all non-federal community hospitals, but have 33% of the \ntrauma units and 50% of its burn units.\n  The credit will help provide, in an indirect manner, additional funds \nfor medical research by encouraging them to serve as clinical trial \nsites. The infusion of research dollars will support their vital \nmissions.\n\n  The proposal will help arrest the declining rate of clinical research \ntrials conducted at these facilities.\n  The American Association of Medical Colleges, which supports the \nlegislation, reports a 22% drop in clinical research at member \nhospitals.\n  A recent study of three pharmaceutical companies indicates that \nalthough pharmaceutical R is larger than the research funds of the \nNational Institutes of Health, the level of university-based clinical \ntrials has declined from 82% in 1989 to 68% in 1993.\n  This proposal can help schools arrest the steady, five year decline \nand make the most of their research dollars.\n  The credit will serve as an effective supplement to the current \nResearch and Experimentation Credit and the Orphan Drug Tax Credit and \nprovide a cost-effective incentive to encourage companies to pursue \nresearch in an academic setting. The credit will promote research at \nteaching hospitals, lead to the development of stronger research \nuniversities, contribute to new medical therapies and products and \nstrengthen our world leadership in the important field of medical \ninnovation. I am pleased to lend my support.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about \nan important piece of legislation which is being introduced today, the \n``Medical Innovation Tax Credit.'' I am an original co-sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  The Medical Innovation Tax Credit will establish a new, free-standing \ncredit in the Internal Revenue Code. The credit, modeled after a law in \nmy home state of California, provides a targeted tax incentive for \ncompanies to increase clinical trials at medical schools and teaching \nhospitals. The California law has been successful in encouraging \nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to expand their pioneering \nresearch activities at medical schools and teaching hospitals \nthroughout the state. The Medical Innovation Tax Credit will encourage \nand stimulate such pioneering research in California and throughout the \ncountry.\n  Many medical institutions today face significant financial pressures \nas a result of fundamental changes in the health care marketplace. With \nfewer funding sources available, medical schools, teaching hospitals, \nand charitable research hospitals designated as cancer centers by the \nNational Cancer Institute (NCI), are having to cut back on their \ncutting-edge research activities.\n  The Medical Innovation Tax Credit will help alleviate some of these \nfinancial pressures by encouraging more clinical trials to be conducted \nat medical schools, hospitals and NCI-designated cancer centers; thus \nproviding these institutions additional private sector resources to \nfund cutting-edge medical research projects which otherwise may not \nhave been funded. These extra resources will also enhance research and \ntraining opportunities, thereby ensuring our nation's continued \nleadership in innovative medical research.\n  Moreover, the Medical Innovation Tax Credit encourages companies to \nconduct their research activities here in the United States since only \ndomestic clinical trials are eligible for the credit. By decreasing the \neconomic incentive to move such activities off-shore, more clinical \nresearch projects will be conducted in the U.S. Such domestic based \nresearch will ultimately lead to increased jobs, investments and \nproductivity here at home.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very proud to support this bill and I \ncongratulate my colleague Senator D'Amato for his hard work on this \nlegislation. The enactment of this legislation will provide important \nresources for our nation's leading medical schools, teaching hospitals \nand NCI-designated cancer centers and it will help ensure America's \ncontinued preeminence in innovative medical research. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join in supporting the Medical Innovation Tax Credit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Durbin (for himself and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 1886. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nlocated at 3750 North Kedzie Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, as the \n``Daniel J. Doffyn Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n   the daniel j. doffyn post office building designation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today together with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, to introduce \nlegislation to designate the United States Post Office facility at 3750 \nNorth Kedzie Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, as the ``Daniel J. Doffyn \nPost Office Building.''\n  This legislation honors the service and heroism of Daniel Doffyn, a \n40-year-old rookie officer with the Chicago Police Department, who was \nfatally shot in the line of duty two years ago.\n  On the afternoon of March 8, 1995, Daniel Doffyn and his partner, \nMilan ``Mike'' Bubalo, who had just completed their regular shift, \nresponded to a report of a burglary in progress. What they encountered, \nin broad daylight, just a few steps away from the Austin precinct house \non Chicago's West Side, were three gun-wielding gang members hiding in \nan apartment. Believing the officers to be there to arrest them for \ntheir involvement in an earlier gang shooting, the trio panicked and \ntried to escape through a window.\n  After capturing one suspect, Doffyn was shot in the head and chest by \na second man, who opened fire with a TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol, one \nof the 19 assault weapons banned under the 1994 Federal law. Officer \nDoffyn died in surgery later that evening. In the barrage of gunfire, \nOfficer Bubalo was seriously wounded in the thigh, and has an \nartificial left hip as a result of the shooting.\n  Officer Doffyn tragically lost his life in the course of performing a \njob that he truly loved, less than a year after graduating from the \nChicago Police Academy, following a three-year quest to fulfill a dream \nto protect and serve his community. If someone needed help, Danny \nDoffyn was the first one there. In the words of District Commander \nLeRoy O'Shield, ``he exemplified the very finest the police department \nhas to offer. He was not assigned this job but responded to it.''\n  The post office sought to be designated is in the neighborhood where \nOfficer Doffyn, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor for his \nultimate sacrifice, resided with his parents, bicycled and roller \nskated with his eight-year-old daughter, Brittany, and donned his blue \nuniform and police star #14030 with pride.\n  We trust our colleagues will agree that this designation is a worthy \ntribute to salute the life and courage of Daniel Doffyn, and to pay \nrespect to the thousands of men and women in law enforcement careers \nwho risk their lives every single day striving to keep our citizens, \nstreets, and sidewalks safe.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF DANIEL J. DOFFYN POST OFFICE \n                   BUILDING.\n\n       (a) In General.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 3750 North Kedzie Avenue in Chicago, \n     Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``Daniel J. \n     Doffyn Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility of the United States Postal Service referred to in \n     subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``Daniel J. Doffyn Post Office Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1889. A bill to reduce tobacco use by children and others through \nan increase in the cost of tobacco products, the imposition of \nadvertising and marketing limitations, assuring appropriate tobacco \nindustry oversight, expanding the availability of tobacco use cessation \nprograms, and implementing a strong public health prevention and \neducation strategy that involves the private sector, schools, States, \nand local communities; read the first time.\n\n\n           the kids deserve freedom from tobacco act of 1998\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleagues \nSenators John Chafee, Bob Graham in introducing the first bipartisan \ncomprehensive proposal to cut youth smoking--The Kids Deserve Freedom \nFrom Tobacco Act, or simply, The KIDS Act. Today marks the turning \npoint in the drive for tobacco reform this year.\n\n  Before I go further, I want to thank my partners in this effort, John \nChafee and Bob Graham. They are real heroes in the fight to save kids \nfrom tobacco. They've taken significant risks in joining this effort. \nAnd they have done a terrific job in putting our proposal together. \nThis has truly been a bipartisan team effort.\n  I also want thank the leaders of the public health community who have \njoined us to support our efforts. They will play a critical role in \nshaping the course of this historic tobacco reform effort in the coming \nmonths. And their support is vital to the success of The KIDS Act. \nFinally, I want to thank Dr. C. Everett Koop and Dr. David Kessler, for \ntheir help and counsel to us in crafting our proposal.\n  We are introducing this bill because we face a public health crisis \naffecting our children. 3,000 kids start smoking every day and fully \n1,000 of them will die prematurely because of it. That's the equivalent \nof 3 jumbo jets packed with kids crashing every day. 400,000 Americans \ndie every year of tobacco related illness at a cost of over $50 \nbillion. And the tobacco industry has been engaged in a systematic \ncampaign of distortion and deceit to hook kids and hide the facts from \nthe American people.\n  Tobacco reform is the issue of 1998. It is the crown jewel of this \nCongress. And passing a tobacco bill like the KIDS Act is a once and a \nlifetime opportunity. Unfortunately, though, the tobacco debate so far \nhas been largely partisan. That's why we've joined arms across party \nlines behind the KIDS Act. We hope and believe that the introduction of \nour bipartisan bill will change the debate and significantly increase \nthe odds that reforms will be made.\n  The KIDS Act would cut tobacco use by kids in half over the next \nthree years through aggressive and comprehensive reforms. That's the \nsharpest and fastest reduction achieved by any bill proposed to date. \nOur goal is to cut it by at least 65 percent shortly after that. The \nFood and Drug Administration has found that reducing the use of tobacco \nby children by 50 percent could prevent well over 60,000 premature \ndeaths every year, and will save up to $43 billion annually in reduced \nmedical costs and improved productivity.\n  Now is not the time for anything but the strongest, most effective \nbill possible.\n  Experts agree that a substantial price hike over a very short period \nof time is key to changing teen smoking behavior. If left unchanged, \nthe Commerce Committee draft bill, which spreads a $1.10 price increase \nover 5 years will do little to impact teen smoking. In contrast, the \nKIDS Act increases the price by $1.50 in just two years, achieving a \n50% reduction in just three years. That's the bottom line and anything \nless is just smoke and mirrors.\n  In addition, our bill gets tough on the individual companies that \naddict the most kids by imposing tough penalties if the company doesn't \nmeet teen smoking reduction targets. I'm very concerned that the \nCommerce Committee proposes no company-specific penalty. Without a \nprofit-based deterrent, the penalty will just be passed through to \nconsumers, giving companies no incentive to cut youth smoking.\n  Finally, our bill caps the annual liability of the tobacco industry \nas part of a tough, comprehensive bill that dramatically reduces youth \nsmoking. Without a tough public health bill, the annual liability cap \nis not acceptable.\n  As Drs. Koop and Kessler say in their letter, our bill is ``tough \nmedicine for a tough problem.'' Our proposal sends a simple message to \nthe tobacco industry: Keep away from our kids. Our plan will be a very, \nvery bitter pill for the industry. And no doubt they will criticize us. \nBut in the end, I believe they are going to have to swallow it.\n  Creating a more sensible policy toward tobacco has been a goal of \nmine for many years. It was in 1977, over 21\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\nyears ago, that I first introduced legislation calling for repeal of \nthe tax deductibility of tobacco advertising and marketing.\n  Unfortunately, victories in the tobacco wars have come few and far \nbetween. In 1988, we finally changed federal law on smoking in \nairplanes. It was a full ten years later, and after failing one time, \nthe Senate took its next step last September by passing the Harkin-\nChafee plan to fully fund enforcement of the FDA youth ID check.\n  But I am more hopeful now than ever that we can pass a comprehensive \nplan that would once and for all change how this nation deals with \ntobacco and dramatically cut the number of our kids addicted to this \ndeadly product. Mr. President, our goal is to be on the Senate floor \nthree years from now announcing that indeed, child smoking has been cut \nin half. We're going to put all our energies into making that happen.\n  We urge our colleagues to review our proposal and join us in \nsponsoring it. We look forward to working with all our colleagues on a \nbicameral, bipartisan basis to make good on the historic opportunity we \nhave this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the KIDS \nAct, letters of endorsement of our bill and copies of several \neditorials in support our the KIDS Act be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Kid Deserve Freedom From Tobacco Act of 1998 ``The KIDS Act''\n\n     Principles\n       Congress has an historic opportunity to enact legislation \n     this year which will significantly reduce tobacco use--\n     especially among children. Nearly one in five deaths in \n     America today is attributable to tobacco use, making it the \n     single most preventable cause of premature death, disease and \n     disability facing this country. These facts compel us to act \n     now. However, to ensure the most effective result, \n     legislation must embody the following principles:\n       It must be bipartisan and comprehensive--not piecemeal--to \n     ensure a fundamental and lasting change in the way tobacco \n     products are marketed and sold in this country.\n       It must attack the youth smoking epidemic as rapidly as \n     possible by forcing the price of cigarettes to increase by \n     $1.50 per pack within the first two years, and providing for \n     comparable increases in other tobacco products.\n       It must preserve the rights of individuals and groups to \n     sue tobacco manufacturers for the damages they have caused, \n     while at the same time establishing a framework to ensure \n     that funds are available to cover awards and settlements \n     secured by successful claimants.\n       It must provide incentives to states, local communities, \n     schools, research institutions, health professionals and \n     other stakeholders to develop innovative strategies to \n     discourage youth smoking, and to assist adult smokers in \n     kicking the habit.\n       It must have as its primary purpose the promotion of \n     aggressive anti-tobacco initiatives and public health \n     improvements, including the provision of significant new \n     resources for medical research.\n     Summary\n       The Kids Deserve Freedom From Tobacco Act of 1998 (``The \n     KIDS Act'') significantly improves upon and strengthens the \n     June 1997 Attorneys General Tobacco Settlement Agreement \n     (``June 1997 Tobacco Agreement''). The legislation would \n     substantially reduce youth tobacco use through a \n     comprehensive set of policy changes. These include increasing \n     the cost of tobacco products, curtailing advertising and \n     marketing to children, assuring appropriate industry \n     oversight, expanding the availability of smoking cessation \n     programs, and implementing a strong public health prevention \n     and education strategy involving the private sector, schools, \n     states and local communities.\n\n\n                         i. economic incentives\n\n       Price Increase. Public health experts agree that the single \n     most important component of a comprehensive plan to reduce \n     youth tobacco use is to significantly increase the price of \n     tobacco products over a short period of time. A gradual \n     increase, phased in over 5 or more years, will not \n     significantly reduce teen tobacco use. Therefore, our \n     proposal would increase the price of a pack of cigarettes by \n     $1.50 within two years ($1.00 the first year; $0.50 the \n     second year). The price of other tobacco products with \n     significant market shares would be increased by a comparable \n     amount. These increases would be achieved through annual \n     industry payments totaling $20 billion the first year and $25 \n     billion per year thereafter (indexed to inflation).\n       Annual Youth Reduction Targets. There is clear and abundant \n     evidence that the tobacco industry has tailored its marketing \n     and advertising programs to attract and encourage children to \n     smoke. Largely because of the industry's success in this \n     regard, 3,000 children start smoking every day in America. \n     Accordingly, the KIDS Act would make the tobacco industry \n     accountable for promoting and achieving a significant \n     reduction in tobacco use among children. Our proposal would \n     set an ambitious, but realistic schedule for reducing the \n     rate of youth smoking by 65 percent over the next ten years.\n       The schedule would follow the recommendations of the Final \n     Report of the Advisory Committee on Tobacco Policy and Public \n     Health, chaired by Dr. C. Everett Koop and Dr. David Kessler. \n     The following targets would be set:\n\n\n                                                   Percent of reduction\nYear:\n    2................................................................15\n    3................................................................20\n    4................................................................25\n    5................................................................30\n    6................................................................40\n    7................................................................50\n    8................................................................55\n    9................................................................60\n    10...............................................................65\n    Beyond...........................................................65\n\n(youth prevalence measured by monthly use)\n\n       Tough Look-back Penalties. The KIDS Act would impose up to \n     an additional $10 billion per year in non tax-deductible \n     penalties (indexed to inflation) on the tobacco industry for \n     failure to meet these targets. First, and most importantly, \n     company-specific penalties would be imposed to prevent \n     individual manufacturers from achieving any financial reward \n     from addicting children to their products. Second, industry-\n     wide penalties would be assessed for failure to meet the \n     above targets. Finally, unlike the June 1997 Tobacco \n     Agreement, the KIDS Act would provide no abatement or rebate \n     relief to tobacco companies.\n       Company-specific Penalties: The KIDS Act would impose the \n     strongest possible incentives for individual tobacco \n     companies to stop recruiting and addicting children. It sets \n     up a system of tough and escalating penalties for those \n     companies that miss youth reduction targets. This is crucial \n     because, unlike industry-wide penalties which can be passed \n     on to consumers equally by all companies without affecting \n     market share, company-specific penalties directly tie company \n     profits to reducing teen smoking.\n       Under the KIDS Act, for each percentage point a company \n     misses between 0 and 10 percent, a penalty of 1 cent per pack \n     is imposed. The penalty doubles for each percentage point \n     missed between 11 and 20 percent and triples for each \n     percentage point missed over 21 percent. For those companies \n     that miss the targets by 20 percent or more for 3 consecutive \n     years, this portion of the penalty is doubled to 6 cents per \n     pack.\n       Industry-wide Penalties: The KIDS Act imposes a similarly \n     tough penalty structure industry-wide if it fails to meet the \n     youth reduction targets. In addition, if the industry fails \n     to meet the targets for 3 consecutive years, the penalties \n     are doubled.\n       No Anti-trust Immunity. Anti-trust laws are the most \n     important safeguard we have against anti-competitive actions \n     which hurt consumers and undermine the free market. As such, \n     exceptions to these laws should be made only in rare \n     circumstances, where important policy objectives outweigh the \n     benefit of free market protections. The tobacco industry has \n     not made a persuasive case for the grant of immunity it \n     seeks. Therefore, unlike the June 1997 Tobacco Agreement, the \n     KIDS Act would not extend any anti-trust exemptions to \n     tobacco manufacturers.\n       State Performance Bonus Pool. The June 1997 Tobacco \n     Agreement and pending legislative initiatives fail to provide \n     strong economic incentives for states and communities to help \n     decrease tobacco use among children. The KIDS Act would \n     address this shortcoming by establishing a $500 million \n     annual ``Performance Bonus Pool'' for states that meet or \n     exceed the reduction targets within their own borders.\n       This would serve as an important incentive for states and \n     localities to develop aggressive and innovative anti-smoking \n     strategies suited to their own individual needs. State-\n     specific baselines and targets would be developed using a \n     standardized methodology determined by the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, the KIDS Act \n     would clarify the authority of states and local governments \n     to encourage the enactment of stronger anti-tobacco policies.\n\n\n               II. changing how tobacco products are sold\n\n       Marketing and Advertising Reforms. The tobacco industry \n     spends an estimated $5 billion per year on marketing and \n     promotional activities--much of it targeted to children. The \n     KIDS Act would fundamentally alter tobacco marketing and \n     advertising practices to eliminate this reprehensible \n     practice.\n       Health Warning Labeling Reforms. Evidence suggests that the \n     current warning label regime for tobacco product packaging \n     fails to adequately convey to children the risks associated \n     with tobacco use. For example, nearly half of the 8th graders \n     in a 1993 study denied any great risk associated with pack-a-\n     day smoking, despite the presence of health warnings on \n     cigarette packaging. Moreover, consumer research indicates \n     that alterations in format, composition and warning label \n     content would make them far more effective in reaching \n     children. Thus, the KIDS Act proposes to significantly \n     strengthen warning labels on all tobacco products to improve \n     their impact on the behavior of children. These messages \n     would be regularly reviewed and updated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services to reflect\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\n     changes in public awareness and attitudes about tobacco use.\n       Minors' Access Reforms. Illegal sales to minors and \n     shoplifting are the primary means by which children obtain \n     tobacco products. An estimated 516 million packs of \n     cigarettes per year are consumed by minors, of which at least \n     half are obtained through direct, illegal sales to minors. \n     Shoplifting is another serious concern. In Iowa alone, more \n     than 4 million packs of cigarettes are shoplifted every year.\n       The KIDS Act would address these problems by banning self-\n     service displays in stores that sell tobacco products, \n     prohibiting vending machine sales in places children \n     frequent, requiring retailers to verify age, and fining those \n     vendors caught selling to children. In addition, the KIDS Act \n     would require states to conduct spot checks of tobacco \n     retailers to ensure compliance with minors' access \n     provisions. If a retailer repeatedly violates the law, it \n     could face suspension or revocation of their registration to \n     sell tobacco products. These reforms would build upon those \n     developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and \n     those contained in the June 1997 Tobacco Agreement.\n       Importantly, the tobacco companies would be bound by \n     enforceable consent decrees precluding them from challenging \n     such restrictions in the courts, or providing any means of \n     support to third parties for this purpose.\n       State Preemption. The KIDS Act would clarify the authority \n     of states and local governments to regulate the sale and use \n     of tobacco products by repealing the preemption clause in \n     existing federal law. However, it would preserve the national \n     requirement for uniform packaging and labeling standards to \n     ensure the free flow of interstate commerce.\n\n          At-A-Glance: Changing How Tobacco Products Are Sold\n\n\n                              advertising\n\n       B text only (except in adult-only facilities and \n     publications).\n       No human images or cartoon characters.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Contained in consent decrees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       No outdoor advertising.\\1\\\n       No advertising on the Internet.\\1\\\n       No self-service displays.\n\n\n                               marketing\n\n       No ``trinkets & trash'' (caps, jackets, bags, etc.) or \n     proof-of-purchase clubs.\n       No sponsorship of sporting events or other forms of \n     entertainment.\n       No paid product placement in movies, TV shows, on Internet \n     or video games.\\1\\\n       No free samples.\n\n\n                                labeling\n\n       Improved and updated warnings.\n       Increased size.\n       Rotating messages.\n       Statements of intended use.\n       Regularly reviewed and updated by HHS.\n\n\n                             minors' access\n\n       No distribution or sales to minors under age 18.\n       Photo id required up to age 27.\n       Face-to-face sales required.\n       No single cigarettes sales.\n       No vending machines sales (except in adult-only \n     facilities).\n       No self-service sales (except in adult-only facilities).\n\n\n                     iii. oversight and enforcement\n\n       FDA Authority. Given the addictive, disease-causing nature \n     of tobacco products, full and appropriate regulation is \n     needed. Therefore, in addition to establishing new \n     advertising and marketing restrictions, the KIDS Act would \n     assure that FDA has the authority to effectively monitor and \n     regulate the manufacture and distribution of tobacco \n     products, promote the development of safer alternatives, and \n     to conduct research. For these purposes, the KIDS Act would \n     allocate $300 million over and above those provided in the \n     annual appropriations process. Importantly, FDA would not be \n     required to overcome special burdens or procedural hurdles in \n     its regulatory activities--a major flaw of the June 1997 \n     Tobacco Agreement. The KIDS Act would classify ``nicotine'' \n     as a drug, and ``tobacco products'' as drug delivery \n     devices (to include cigars, pipes and loose tobacco). In \n     addition, our legislation would authorize FDA to implement \n     a ``public health'' standard in its review of tobacco \n     products.\n       The FDA's authority over tobacco products would be no more \n     and no less than its authority over other drugs and devices. \n     However, because of the addictive nature of tobacco products, \n     and the high prevalence of their use, the KIDS Act would \n     specifically prohibit the FDA from banning the sale of \n     tobacco products to adults. Finally, the KIDS Act would \n     ensure that FDA has adequate financial resources and \n     appropriate access to tobacco industry documents to carry out \n     its responsibilities.\n       Ingredient Disclosure. Evidence strongly suggests that \n     tobacco companies design and manufacture their products to \n     satisfy and enhance nicotine dependence. Therefore, increased \n     information about the role and function of tobacco additives \n     is essential to the effective regulation of such products. \n     The KIDS Act would substantially strengthen current \n     ingredient disclosure requirements for tobacco manufacturers. \n     For example, each company would be required, by brand and \n     content, to submit lists of all tobacco additives. Further, \n     if the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that \n     any of these additives pose a particular risk to smokers or \n     others exposed to tobacco smoke, this information will be \n     fully and promptly disclosed to the public.\n       Reduced Risk. Much remains unknown about the feasibility \n     and effectiveness of developing a less hazardous tobacco \n     product. However, it is clear that tobacco manufacturers have \n     the ability and knowledge to modify their products. Indeed, \n     various forms of ``reduced risk'' nicotine delivery devices \n     already have been introduced into the market. The KIDS Act \n     would require tobacco companies to come forward with \n     information in their possession about reduced risk products, \n     and provide increased monitoring of new technologies. It \n     would also stop tobacco companies from making misleading \n     claims about these products.\n       Licensing. There are approximately one million tobacco \n     outlets in the United States, and as recently as 1994, nearly \n     three-fourths sold tobacco products to minors. These include \n     supermarkets, newsstands, hotels, gas stations, convenience \n     stores, and other types of vendors. Additionally, each year \n     interstate cigarette smuggling costs states millions of \n     dollars in lost excise tax revenues. To address these \n     problems, the KIDS Act would establish minimum federal \n     licensing standards for tobacco manufacturers, importers, \n     exporters and distributors, and the registration of tobacco \n     retail establishments. States could continue to impose \n     additional licensing requirements, and would work closely \n     with federal officials to enforce licensing and registration \n     policies, just as they do with the distribution and sales of \n     alcoholic beverages. By providing for the permanent \n     revocation of tobacco licenses and registration permits for \n     repeated violations of any provision of our law. The KIDS Act \n     will put the worst offenders out of the business of making or \n     selling tobacco products.\n\n\n          IV. Stopping Children from Smoking Before They Start\n\n       Prevention in Communities and Schools. In addition to \n     economic incentives, changes in tobacco product advertising \n     and marketing, and improved oversight of enforcement, experts \n     agree that a comprehensive slate of public health activities \n     is needed to stop children from taking up this deadly habit. \n     For example, research-tested school programs have proven to \n     consistently and significantly reduce adolescent smoking. \n     Therefore, the KIDS Act would provide $1.25 billion to states \n     for community and school-based prevention activities. These \n     initiatives would be designed and implemented at the local \n     level to ensure their effectiveness.\n       Because minority and low-income populations suffer a \n     disproportionate burden of tobacco-related disease, and are \n     among the greatest users of tobacco products, the KIDS Act \n     would allocate a portion of the funding for community-based \n     prevention activities to address their special needs. Funding \n     also would be provided to assist Native American populations \n     in their efforts to prevent and reduce youth smoking.\n       Counter Advertising. Research findings show that well-\n     designed counter advertising initiatives do help to reduce \n     teen smoking. Thus, an intensive, sustained media campaign at \n     the state and federal level is needed to ``deglamorize'' \n     tobacco use among young people. Accordingly, the KIDS Act \n     would provide $650 million annually to fund a nationwide \n     campaign with national, state, and local components. \n     Preeminent advertising firms with proven expertise in the \n     formulation of messages aimed at children would be charged \n     with the development and implementation of \n     ``deglamorization'' campaigns.\n\n\n               V. Helping Current Smokers Kick the Habit\n\n       Smoking Cessation. While the primary emphasis of our \n     proposal is to reduce tobacco use among children, the more \n     than 48 million adult Americans who currently smoke deserve \n     and need help in kicking the habit. The KIDS Act would \n     establish a coordinated federal and state-based initiative to \n     increase access to, and awareness of, effective programs. \n     When fully implemented, the legislation would provide $1.5 \n     billion annually for programs designed to enhance existing \n     employer-based initiatives, and those which target uninsured \n     and underserved populations.\n\n\n                         VI. Expanding Research\n\n       National Fund for Health Research. Tobacco products kill \n     more than 400,000 Americans every year--more death than from \n     AIDS, alcohol and drug abuse, car accidents, murders, \n     suicides, and fires combined. To stop this epidemic, we must \n     strengthen our national commitment to finding preventive \n     measures and cures for diseases--especially those related to \n     tobacco use, including cancer, heart disease, emphysema and \n     stroke. Therefore, the KIDS Act would establish a National \n     Fund for Health Research to allocate resources over and \n     above those provided to the National Institutes of Health \n     (NIH) in the annual appropriations process. The KIDS Act \n     would allot $3.225 billion per year to the Fund.\n       Prevention and Cessation Research. While we know a great \n     deal about reducing tobacco use, much remains unknown. \n     Therefore, a significant expansion of prevention and \n     cessation research is critical to the success of any \n     comprehensive effort to reduce tobacco use. In particular, \n     more information is needed on why people use tobacco and on \n     what program interventions are most effective. Efforts must \n     also be undertaken to increase our understanding of the \n     health effects of tobacco use and exposure to second-hand\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\n     smoke. The KIDS Act would provide $600 million per year for a \n     major new research effort.\n\n\n          vii. helping the victims of tobacco-related diseases\n\n       The KIDS Act would fully preserve the rights of individuals \n     and groups to utilize the civil justice system to recover \n     tobacco-related damages. Unlike the June 1997 Tobacco \n     Agreement and some of the legislation currently pending in \n     Congress, the KIDS Act would not ban class action lawsuits or \n     punitive damage awards, as the tobacco industry has sought.\n       Simply put, it would provide no immunity to the tobacco \n     industry. Given the industry's behavior, such liability \n     protections cannot be justified or condoned. Furthermore, our \n     legislation would provide no protections from, or limitations \n     on criminal prosecution of the tobacco industry.\n       National Victims' Compensation Fund. To ensure that \n     resources are readily available for the victims of tobacco-\n     related diseases, the KIDS Act would provide for the \n     establishment of a prefunded National Victims' Compensation \n     Fund (the ``Fund''), from which court awards and settlements \n     would be paid. Furthermore, given the uncertainty of the \n     legal environment surrounding tobacco litigation, an \n     additional Contingency Reserve Account would be established \n     within the Fund. The Fund and the annual cap would be indexed \n     to medical inflation.\n       Annual Base Payment: At the beginning of each year, the \n     tobacco industry would make a Base Payment of $4 billion into \n     the Fund; awards and settlements would be paid from this base \n     amount. At the end of every year, any unobligated funds from \n     the Base Payments would be deposited into an interest-bearing \n     Contingency Reserve Account.\n       Out-of-Pocket Supplement and Annual Cap: If awards and \n     settlements exceed the Base Payment during any year, the \n     industry would be liable for an additional $4 billion in out-\n     of-pocket payments to cover the excess, for a total potential \n     annual liability payment by the tobacco industry of $8 \n     billion. This cap would not include payments made to states \n     in settlement of existing Attorneys General suits, and would \n     apply only to civil claims against past wrongdoing by the \n     industry.\n       Contingency Reserve Account: As a further protection for \n     claimants, the KIDS Act would establish a Contingency Reserve \n     Account (the ``Account'') within the Victims' Compensation \n     Fund. Any unobligated funds from the $4 billion Base Payment \n     would be placed in the Account. For example, if awards and \n     settlements paid in the first year amounted to $1 billion, \n     the remaining $3 billion would be deposited into the account. \n     Funds in the account would build up substantially in the \n     early years as settlements and awards during this period are \n     expected to be relatively small. For any year in which \n     liability awards and settlements exceed $8 billion, the \n     Account would be drawn down to make the excess payments. In \n     the unlikely event that awards and settlements ever deplete \n     the Account in any year, unpaid claims would be rolled over \n     and paid from the Base Payment at the beginning of the \n     following year.\n       If the Account accumulates a balance of $20 billion, the \n     Attorney General, in conjunction with the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services, would determine whether to continue to \n     deposit excess funds therein, or to redirect those funds to \n     anti-smoking and other public health activities authorized \n     under the legislation.\n       Small Claimant Protection: Under the KIDS Act, individuals \n     and smaller classes of individuals would be given priority in \n     disbursements from the Fund to ensure that large awards or \n     settlements, paid to 3rd parties for example, would not deny \n     smaller claimants timely payment of their claims.\n       Settlement of State Suits and Castano Class Action: Forty \n     state Attorneys Generals have brought suits against the \n     tobacco industry to recover costs incurred for tobacco-\n     related illnesses and other damages. The KIDS Act would \n     provide states the opportunity to settle their suits in \n     exchange for funding from the National Tobacco Trust Fund \n     established under this Act. In addition, the Castano Class \n     Action lawsuits would be settled in return for the \n     establishment of smoking cessation programs.\n\n\n                 VIII. ENDING TOBACCO INDUSTRY SECRECY\n\n       For decades, to the severe detriment of the public health, \n     the tobacco industry has concealed evidence of the \n     consequences of tobacco use and deliberately misled the \n     public. Moreover, tobacco manufacturers have broadly misused \n     the doctrine of attorney-client privilege to cloak industry \n     documents and research in a veil of secrecy.\n       Therefore, the KIDS Act would require tobacco companies to \n     submit key documents relating to the health effects, safety, \n     and marketing of products to children to a Tobacco Document \n     Depository. Trade secret and attorney-client privilege claims \n     would be scrutinized by a professional Tobacco Document \n     Review Board. This reform would assist the victims of \n     tobacco-related diseases in securing judgments against \n     tobacco companies, and out-of-court settlements, without the \n     traditional barriers and costs associated with document \n     discovery. Manufacturers who make claims in bad faith will be \n     subject to fines of up to $5 million per violation. Moreover, \n     failure to comply with this section would result in license \n     revocation and the waiver of the annual liability cap.\n       FDA to Obtain Needed Documents. Tobacco companies would be \n     required to turn over to the FDA all documents the agency \n     deemed necessary to carry out its regulatory \n     responsibilities--including assessing the health effects of \n     nicotine and other tobacco ingredients, the design and \n     development of ``less hazardous'' or ``safer'' tobacco \n     products, as well as the advertising, marketing and promotion \n     of such products.\n\n\n                  ix. transition assistance to farmers\n\n       Changes in national policy regarding tobacco products, and \n     the expected decline in their consumption, will have \n     ramifications for farming families, workers and communities \n     in tobacco growing regions. The KIDS Act would provide $13.5 \n     billion for compensation, income support and transitional \n     assistance to tobacco farming families, and for economic \n     development and related assistance in tobacco-dependent \n     communities.\n\n\n                      x. assuring clean indoor air\n\n       Our knowledge is growing daily on the deleterious effects \n     of exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) in the home, \n     the workplace and other public facilities. Annually, 3,000 \n     Americans die of lung cancer caused by second-hand smoke, and \n     15,000 children under 18 months of age are hospitalized with \n     respiratory infections related to ETS exposure.\n       While the ETS components of the KIDS Act are still a work \n     in progress, our bill would place significant emphasis on \n     reducing ETS exposure in the home--including such measures as \n     pediatric outreach, public service announcements, and \n     comprehensive media campaigns; $100 million from the counter \n     advertising funds would be directed towards this purpose. The \n     bill would also provide $100 million to help reduce exposure \n     to ETS in workplaces and public facilities.\n       The KIDS Act would also require Congress to comply with the \n     ``no smoking'' policies already in place throughout the \n     Executive Branch. Furthermore, legislation would not preempt \n     states and local governments from establishing even more \n     stringent policies to protect individuals from ETS.\n\n\n          xi. stopping smuggling and showing world leadership\n\n       In some countries, significant increases in cigarette \n     prices have resulted in large-scale smuggling operations. \n     Contraband cigarette trafficking can occur both at national \n     borders and between states with wide disparities in tobacco \n     excise taxes. Since 1992, this criminal activity has \n     increased by more than 500% in the United States. Each year, \n     interstate cigarette smuggling costs some states more than \n     $100 million in lost excise tax revenue. As the price of \n     cigarettes increases as a result of tobacco settlement \n     legislation, actions must be taken to prevent the wide \n     availability of contraband cigarettes.\n       Tough Anti-Smuggling Initiative. In addition to licensing \n     all tobacco product sellers in the stream of commerce, the \n     KIDS Act would allocate $100 million per year to implement \n     an aggressive, well-coordinated anti-smuggling program \n     aimed at stopping contraband tobacco products from \n     entering or being sold in the United States. The bill \n     would facilitate substantial coordination of \n     international, federal and state law enforcement \n     activities, as well as providing new resources to expedite \n     the deployment of innovative anti-smuggling technologies.\n       Harsh New Penalties to Stop Smuggling. To further deter \n     contraband trafficking in tobacco products, the KIDS Act \n     would also establish harsh new criminal and monetary \n     penalties for individuals convicted of such offenses. \n     Violations by manufacturers, importers, exporters, or \n     distributor or retailers could result in permanent revocation \n     of their license or registration.\n       World Leadership. The World Health Organization (WHO) \n     currently estimates that tobacco use causes three million \n     deaths per year worldwide--a number which is expected to \n     increase exponentially as the U.S.-based tobacco industry \n     intensifies its global marketing and promotional activities. \n     By the year 2023, WHO projects tobacco-related mortalities \n     will jump to ten million, with nearly 70 percent occurring in \n     developing countries. This troubling trend is expected to \n     accelerate with the enactment of strong anti-tobacco policies \n     in the United States.\n       Unlike the June 1997 Tobacco Agreement, our bill would \n     provide clear leadership on international efforts to curb \n     tobacco use. The KIDS Act would terminate all support for \n     tobacco promotion overseas by the United States Government, \n     provide $100 million per year to fund global education \n     efforts, and encourage America's participation with other \n     nations in efforts to harmonize tobacco policies worldwide.\n\n\n                     xii. industry consent decrees\n\n       Voluntary, but legally-binding consent decrees--signed by \n     the federal government, state governments and tobacco \n     manufacturers--are critical to the success of any \n     comprehensive tobacco legislation aimed at significantly \n     reducing tobacco use by children. Without these decrees, key \n     provisions of such a law could be delayed by lengthy legal \n     challenges. To help avoid this problem, the KIDS Act would \n     require tobacco companies to sign legally-binding consent \n     decrees in order to receive the benefits of the annual \n     liability cap established under the legislation. Violation of \n     any of the terms of the consent decrees would result in \n     exclusion of that company from the annual liability cap. \n     Among other things, the consent decrees--which would be \n     enforceable by the U.S. Attorney General or State Attorneys \n     General through federal and state courts--would\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\n     commit the companies to abide by the following agreements:\n       Not to directly or indirectly bring or support legal \n     challenges to the implementation of any aspect of the KIDS \n     Act, including existing or future FDA regulatory authority, \n     document disclosure, youth look-back survey methodology and \n     penalties, and advertising and marketing restrictions;\n       To pay and fully pass through the cost of annual industry \n     payments and industry-wide look-back penalties, assuring that \n     the price of cigarettes would increase by at least $1.50 per \n     pack over 2 years, with comparable increases for other \n     tobacco products;\n       All reforms related to the labeling, sale, advertising and \n     promotion of tobacco products intended by this Act;\n       Not to directly, or through contractors, lobby federal, \n     state or local governments against any provision of this Act;\n       To only do business with those retailers and distributors \n     in full compliance with all provisions of this Act;\n       To dissolve the Tobacco Institute and other existing trade \n     associations;\n       Not to advertise over the Internet; and,\n       To comply also with all of the marketing and advertising \n     restrictions in both the FDA regulation and the proposed June \n     1997 Tobacco Agreement.\n\n\n               xiii. annual tobacco payments and spending\n\n       Industry Payments: The KIDS Act would require a non-\n     deductible industry payment of $10 billion immediately upon \n     enactment. That payment would be used by states and local \n     communities, as well as the federal government, to begin \n     implementation of the strong anti-tobacco measures authorized \n     under the Act.\n       One year after enactment the industry would make a payment \n     of $20 billion to the National Tobacco Trust Fund. Each year \n     thereafter the industry payment would be $25 billion, indexed \n     to inflation. These payments would be assessed based upon \n     each company's share of the overall tobacco market. Twenty-\n     five percent of the payments would be deemed punitive, and \n     therefore non-deductible.\n       Payments to States: As under the June 1997 Tobacco \n     Agreement, $193.5 billion over the 25 year period would be \n     reserved for state use. Of those funds, fifty percent would \n     be distributed to the states to use at their discretion. The \n     remaining fifty percent would be allocated to the states in \n     the form of a Health, Human Services and Education block \n     grant to be used to meet each State's particular needs in \n     these areas.\n       Additionally, $500 million annually would be made available \n     to states meeting or exceeding youth tobacco reduction \n     targets.\n       Payments for National Programs: Under the KIDS Act, $4 \n     billion of the industry's yearly payment would be directed to \n     the National Victim's Compensation Fund as the Annual Base \n     Payment. Remaining industry payments would be used \n     exclusively for national anti-tobacco and public health \n     purposes. These include funding for smoking cessation, \n     counteradvertising, and community and school-based prevention \n     programs, international education, health research, and other \n     activities outlined in this summary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    March 11, 1998\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hon. John Chafee,\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin, Chafee and Graham: We are sorry we \n     are not able to be with you in person as you introduce your \n     bill, but we wanted to offer our congratulations to you for \n     crafting a very strong, comprehensive package of tobacco \n     reforms.\n       We have carefully reviewed a detailed summary of your plan \n     and strongly support its major features, with the exception \n     of the concept of liability caps. While we await actual \n     legislative language, it appears to us that if enacted, we \n     believe your proposal includes many measures that would \n     significantly reduce tobacco use and fundamentally alter the \n     way America deals with tobacco. It is tough medicine for a \n     tough problem. It would set national tobacco policy on to a \n     course that would bring down nicotine addiction and the \n     terrible health consequences of using tobacco.\n       You are to be especially commended for forging a bipartisan \n     consensus on this difficult and complex issue. For a proposal \n     to be successful in Congress, it must have bipartisan \n     support. Yours is the first to meet that crucial test.\n       Your plan correctly deals with this public health crisis in \n     a comprehensive manner, seeking to come as close as possible \n     at this time to the ideals expressed last July in the report \n     of the Advisory Committee on Tobacco Policy and Public \n     Health. A piecemeal approach clearly won't work. We are \n     especially pleased that you specify an increase in the cost \n     of tobacco products within two years. This is vitally \n     important for reducing tobacco use by young people. \n     Protecting the FDA's authority, protecting a State's ability \n     to develop and enforce stronger public health measures, and \n     other such provisions make this proposal very attractive. We \n     understand that you will address environmental tobacco smoke \n     and we will be pleased to work with you on that. You are also \n     to be commended for recognizing that the United States must \n     play an enhanced role in promoting enlightened policies \n     toward tobacco in other countries. We have a moral imperative \n     to lead in this area as well as protecting the public health \n     within the United States.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you as you \n     finalize this very promising proposal. There is much to be \n     done this year, but the announcement of your bipartisan \n     effort is a major step forward in our long battle for a \n     tobacco policy.\n           Sincerely,\n     C. Everett Koop, M.D., Sc.D.\n     David A. Kessler, M.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              The KIDS Act Allocation of Industry Payments\n\n       The following amounts represent the annual maximum spending \n     for each of the activities, assuming a 25% excise tax offset.\n\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n\nStates--no strings...............................................$3.000\nStates--Human Services Block Grant................................3.000\nStates--bonus pool................................................0.500\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n    States--total.................................................6.500\n                                                               ==========\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nSmoking Cessation.................................................1.500\nCounteradvertising................................................0.550\nCommunity-based Prevention........................................1.000\nSchool-based Prevention...........................................0.300\nYouth Database/Evaluation.........................................0.175\nEvent Sponsorship Replacement.....................................0.075\nTobacco Prevention Research.......................................0.600\nInternational Education...........................................0.100\nNative American Programs..........................................0.200\nEnvironmental Tobacco Smoke.......................................0.200\nFDA...............................................................0.300\nAnti-Smuggling Efforts............................................0.100\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n    Anti-Tobacco Program Total....................................5.100\nNIH Research......................................................3.225\nVictim's Compensation Fund........................................4.000\n\n       Additionally, the KIDS Act would provide a total of $13.5 \n     billion for transition assistance to farmers.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Statement of the ENACT Coalition Regarding the Introduction of KIDS \n                    Deserve Freedom From Tobacco Act\n\n       (March 12, 1998)--The ENACT coalition of major public \n     health organizations applauds today's introduction of the \n     KIDS Deserve Freedom From Tobacco Act by Senators Harkin, \n     Chafee and Graham. These Senators have exhibited courageous \n     leadership in crafting a strong, comprehensive, bipartisan \n     solution to the urgent problem of tobacco use.\n       This is the first bipartisan proposal which, based on the \n     summary being released today, encompasses the key public \n     health policies that ENACT has stated must be included in any \n     effective tobacco control legislation. We support the public \n     health features of this proposal because of their potential \n     to save millions of lives and, therefore, welcome it as an \n     important step forward.\n       The proposal contains strong and effective provisions \n     regarding FDA authority over tobacco sales, manufacturing and \n     advertising; significant price increases to deter use by \n     kids; ``look-back'' penalties if sales to youth do not \n     decrease; a vigorous crackdown on the illegal sale of tobacco \n     to minors; protections from secondhand smoke; disclosure of \n     tobacco industry documents; funding for tobacco-related \n     health and cessation research; assistance to tobacco farmers; \n     and support for efforts to reduce tobacco use \n     internationally.\n       The KIDS Act also addresses issues relating to the tobacco \n     industry's liability. It would make the internal documents \n     the tobacco industry has been forced to produce available to \n     plaintiffs and the general public. It would also require the \n     tobacco industry to make a minimum annual tort-related \n     payment of $4 billion a year, no matter what happens in the \n     courts. It contains no limitations on class action or the \n     rights of individuals to collect full compensatory or \n     punitive awards from the industry, nor does it protect the \n     industry from being held accountable for future misconduct. \n     However, it does contain an annual cap of $8 billion a year \n     on civil liability payments for the tobacco industry in suits \n     based on past action.\n       While we await the receipt of the actual legislative \n     language, we believe that this proposal would significantly \n     reduce tobacco use, particularly among children, and would \n     rein in the tobacco industry. We strongly support this \n     proposal's major features with the exception of the liability \n     cap. ENACT believes that only a comprehensive bill that meets \n     our minimum criteria can adequately address the complex \n     problem of tobacco use and reduce the number of kids who \n     start using tobacco, and the number of adults who die each \n     year. ENACT is committed to working with Senators Harkin, \n     Chafee and Graham, as well as all Members of Congress from \n     both parties, to enact a comprehensive, bipartisan, well-\n     funded and sustainable tobacco control policy.\n\n                    [From USA Today, Mar. 20, 1998]\n\n           Billion-Dollar Blinders Hide Tobacco Deal's Flaws\n\n       Big Tobacco has a politically enticing offer for lawmakers. \n     Give us some legal protection against our past sins, and \n     we'll pony up billions of dollars every year to fund your pet \n     programs.\n       The offer proved too much for state attorneys general.\n       They signed a loophole-ridden settlement deal last June \n     that gave a slap on the wrist to the industry and threw new \n     roadblocks in front of the regulation of nicotine by the Food \n     and Drug Administration (FDA)\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\n       Next week, Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain \n     will try to do better as his panel marks up a settlement \n     plan. He's hoping to put together a tougher deal--one that \n     will win the backing of health groups and members of both \n     parties, and still secure the industry's consent. A delicate \n     balancing act, to be sure, and one that comes amid fierce \n     partisan wrangling, turf wars and general election-year \n     money-grubbing.\n       Until last week, no proposals fit the bill. Either they \n     were winners for the tobacco industry or they couldn't get \n     support from across the aisle. Sens. Tom Harkin, John Chafee \n     and Bob Graham broke the pattern with a bipartisan bill that \n     has won over key health advocates.\n       Among their plan's virtues:\n       It would impose annual industry payments of $25 billion--\n     two-thirds higher than the settlement. That would push up the \n     price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50, deterring smoking by \n     children--the most important objective of any settlement.\n       Better yet, the deal would severely punish individual firms \n     if they failed to meet company-specific teen smoking \n     reduction targets--a clear incentive for each to join the \n     effort to cut teen smoking. The industry as a whole could be \n     fined up to $10 billion a year if teen smoking rates aren't \n     cut by 65% within 10 years.\n       The measure preserves the FDA's ability to regulate \n     tobacco. The industry had snookered the attorneys general by \n     requiring the FDA to meet absurd burdens of proof.\n       Finally, there's no offer of blanket immunity on class-\n     action suits, as the attorneys general allowed. People harmed \n     by the industry could recover up to $8 billion a year from an \n     industry-financed liability fund.\n       The offer to industry: Your total costs will be capped at \n     $39 billion a year. Put in perspective, domestic cigarette \n     sales are about $50 billion a year.\n       The two most prominent tobacco industry foes of recent \n     years--former surgeon general C. Everett Koop and former FDA \n     head David Kessler--both endorsed the Harkin-Chafee bill, \n     calling it ``tough medicine for a tough problem.''\n       Whatever its merits, this is the minimum acceptable. Yet \n     the risk that Congress will gut it and pass a flimsy \n     substitute is enormously high. The industry is sure to throw \n     its weight behind weaker bills; and with everyone in \n     Washington salivating over the prospect of all that money to \n     spend on pet programs in an election year, priorities easily \n     will be warped.\n       There are already so many meat hooks in the funds that it \n     would take several deals to appease all interests. President \n     Clinton wants to fund everything from child care to Medicare \n     with the money. Some Republicans want to use the tobacco \n     funds to pay for tax cuts, others to pay for reforming the \n     IRS. Advocacy groups see the chance to fund their cherished \n     programs.\n       As the prospect of billions of dollars draws closer, even \n     ardent health advocates might be tempted to dispense with \n     sweating the details.\n       But the point of this exercise isn't to raise lots of \n     money, boost the size of the federal government, or enrich a \n     bunch of trial lawyers. The goal is to cut the horrendous \n     human toll smoking imposes on society. The only effective way \n     to do that is to stop the supply of new addicts.\n       That for the most part means keeping teens from taking up \n     the habit. More than nine in 10 regular smokers started \n     smoking before celebrating their 19th birthday. The Harkin \n     proposal would give industry a strong push to help curb this \n     trend despite the long-term consequences for the industry.\n       In the end, however, lawmakers must be willing to chuck a \n     bad deal, even if that means killing the golden tobacco \n     goose.\n\n\n                       comparing the settlements\n\n       The so-called KIDS Act toughens the June 1997 attorneys \n     general settlement on several key fronts.\n     Annual payments\n       Settlement: Maximum of $15 billion a year for a total of \n     $368.5 billion over the next 25 years.\n       KIDS Act: Maximum of $25 billion a year for a total of $630 \n     billion over next 25 years.\n     Teen smoking\n       Settlement: 60% cut in smoking rates within 10 years.\n       KIDS Act: 65% cut in smoking rates within 10 years.\n     Failure to reduce teen smoking\n       Settlement penalty: Maximum of $2 billion a year.\n       KIDS Act: No; but does put an $8 billion annual cap on \n     total damages.\n     Class-action lawsuit immuity\n       Settlement: Yes, but individuals could still sue.\n       KIDS Act: No; but does put an $8 billion annual cap on \n     total damages.\n     FDA regulations\n       Settlement: Imposes new restrictions on FDA tobacco \n     regulations.\n       KIDS Act: Preserves FDA authority.\n     Advertising\n       Settlement: Tough restrictions, including ban on human \n     forms, Internet ads.\n       KIDS Act: Similar changes.\n       Source: USA Today research.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the Portland Press Herald, Mar. 28, 1998]\n\n                Senate Should Pass a Better Tobacco Deal\n\n       Legislation settling claims against the tobacco industry is \n     now before the Senate Commerce Committee. The committee's \n     chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is trying to forge a \n     compromise among Democrats, Republicans and opponents and \n     supporters of the tobacco lobby.\n       The starting point in this process is a settlement \n     agreement negotiated last year between the tobacco companies \n     and the attorneys general from 40 states. It is a deeply \n     flawed document that gives up too much to big tobacco.\n       What that agreement lacks--and what any final agreement \n     should have--is the approval of two men who have fought hard \n     to reduce tobacco's deadly toll on the American people. C. \n     Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, and David Kessler, \n     former head of the Food and Drug Administration, have opposed \n     the tobacco settlement as it is now.\n       Much of what Koop and Kessler seek is in a bipartisan \n     proposal sponsored by Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, John Chafee, \n     R-R.I. and Bob Graham, D-Fla. Maine Sens. Susan Collins, who \n     sits on the commerce committee, and Olympia Snowe should back \n     it or legislation that has the same basic elements.\n       The proposal would raise the price of cigarettes by $1.50 a \n     pack, extracting $25 billion a year from the tobacco \n     companies as payment for the huge costs imposed by these \n     products on the government. Unlike the settlement negotiated \n     with the states, it gives the FDA unfettered control over \n     tobacco. It also has strong proposals for reducing youth \n     smoking and sets up a system for processing claims against \n     the tobacco companies without granting them immunity from \n     future lawsuits.\n       In return, the tobacco companies would see their \n     liabilities in civil suits capped at $8 billion a year. This \n     is a far better approach than the blanket protection from \n     future lawsuits contained in the agreement negotiated by the \n     attorneys general.\n       Already, other ideas are surfacing. The committee seems \n     settled on a $1.10-per-pack price increase for cigarettes and \n     is discussing an annual liability cap ranging from $5 billion \n     to $8 billion. FDA authority over tobacco, meanwhile, remains \n     a sticking point.\n       The principles of the bipartisan bill are central to \n     reaching a fair accord with the big tobacco companies over \n     the immense harm they have caused the American people. As \n     such, the bill should be taken seriously by Collins, Snowe \n     and their Senate colleagues.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, over the course of the next month or two, \nthe Senate will have the opportunity to debate how best to address the \nmost significant, preventable public health problem confronting this \nnation today: the scourge of tobacco use by our young people. The \nSenate will face some difficult choices in this regard. The grim \nstatistics about this epidemic, coupled with almost daily revelations \nof tobacco industry misdeeds, underscore the need for our earnest \naction.\n  We can all agree, where adults are concerned personal responsibility \nmust be the rule; tobacco is a legal product and adults are free to \nmake that choice. However, the same level of independent judgment \ncannot be said where fourteen year-olds are concerned. Bear in mind, \nonly one in ten smokers takes up smoking after the age of eighteen; the \nremainder start well before that stage.\n  All of us--Democrats and Republicans--share a deep and abiding \nconcern about this problem, and a recognition that now is the time for \naction. However, each of us has different thoughts on how best to \nattack this problem. The Commerce Committee draft bill offers a good \nbeginning, but it must be strengthened. Senators Harkin, Graham and I \nbelieve that an aggressive, but responsible approach is essential if we \nare to be successful in reducing teen tobacco use.\n  This is why the KIDS Act would force the price of cigarettes up by \n$1.50 over the course of two--not four, five or six--years. The price \nhike must be significant and rapid in order to affect the purchasing \nbehavior of children; the evidence solidly favors that position. Simply \nput, a smaller increase of only $1.10 over a longer period of time--in \neffect 20 cents per year in the Commerce Committee draft--will not \nachieve the desired result. As a result of our aggressive approach on \nprice, the KIDS Act would halve teen smoking within just three years!\n  That is also why the KIDS Act contains very stiff so-called look-\nback'' penalties if the industry fails to meet the annual youth \nreduction targets specified in our bill. Unlike the Commerce Committee \ndraft, the KIDS Act emphasizes company-specific penalties to ensure \nthat the companies who do the addicting take the hit. Additionally, our \nannual penalties are capped at $10 billion per year, as opposed to $3.5 \nbillion in the Commerce Committee draft. These look-back penalties are \nthe very heart of our efforts to curb\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nyouth tobacco use; if they miss the mark, the whole program is the \nweaker for it.\n  This is also why the KIDS Act provides roughly $5.1 billion per year \nfor anti-tobacco programs, including counteradvertising, school and \ncommunity-based prevention and education programs, cessation and other \ninitiatives. For those who think this is too much spending, we spend a \nlot more money on addressing other ills which kill far fewer than \n400,000 Americans per year.\n  Recognizing that the needs of each state are very different, the KIDS \nAct hands back $6 billion per year to the states in recognition of the \ncosts and damages they have incurred in treating tobacco-related \nillnesses. Importantly, this funding could be used to meet the \nparticular needs of  each state; flexibility is the key with respect to \nthe use of this funding. One pool of $3 billion per year could be used \nto meet any need; the other pool of $3 billion takes the form of a \nhealth, human services and education block grant to meet virtually any \nhuman need.\n\n  Our bill also includes a State Performance Bonus Pool to help incent \nand enlist states in the war against teen tobacco use, and we need all \nthe stakeholders we can get! As a consequence of these provisions, the \nNational Governors Association supports the state payment mechanism \ncontained in the KIDS Act.\n  Some have pointed out that the draft Commerce Committee bill \nincorporates the cap on annual liability payments included in our \nbill--although at $6.5 billion, not $8 billion. My response is that the \ncap cannot be examined in isolation from the other parts of the \nlegislation. If, for example, the youth smoking provisions are not as \ntough as they should be, than I question the appropriateness of a \nliability cap.\n  Now, some people have said our bill is too tough and could bankrupt \nthe tobacco industry. Says who? The tobacco companies? I'm not sure we \ncan rely upon their representations if past history is any judge. What \nabout the securities analysts who understand the financial workings of \nthe tobacco industry? Can we rely upon these individuals and firms when \nmany of these same companies manage pension and mutual fund portfolios \nwith significant investments in tobacco stocks? Frankly, I think the \nonly reliable measure of what the industry can truly afford would be an \nindependent audit--not an illogical request of an industry which seeks \na virtually unprecedented deal with the federal government, the several \nstates and the American people.\n  The KIDS Act would require the industry to pass along in the price of \nits products an annual payment of $25 billion. Given discussions we \nhave had with a variety of experts, both inside and outside the \ngovernment, we do not believe the payment requirements in our bill \nwould jeopardize the profitability or future viability of the tobacco \nindustry.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to examine the KIDS Act and to join \nwith us in working to pass a strong, responsible tobacco bill as \nquickly as possible. We look forward to working with our respective \nLeaders, Senator McCain, and our colleagues toward that end.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator \nJohn Chafee and Senator Tom Harkin, to introduce the Kids Deserve \nFreedom from Tobacco Act of 1998, legislation which if passed will have \na monumental effect on the number one public health problem facing \nAmerica's youth: underage smoking.\n  This legislation is the first bipartisan, comprehensive piece of \nlegislation which has the support of the Administration and the public \nhealth community. Since the beginning of this school year, more than \nhalf a million kids have started smoking. If we don't act soon, another \nhalf million children will take up the habit by the start of the next \nschool year. And by its inaction, Congress will have signed their death \nwarrants.\n  In Florida alone, where minors purchase more than 12 million packs of \ncigarettes each year, 28% of high school students currently smoke \ncigarettes. Nationally, the number is closer to 35%. The KIDS Act takes \na number of strong actions--all of which would be funded by the \nindustry's annual $25 billion payment--to lower the rate of youth and \nteenage smoking. These include:\n\n\n                             price increase\n\n  Because public health experts agree that substantially increasing the \ncost of cigarettes is the most effective way of keeping adolescents \nfrom buying them, the KIDS Act would force the tobacco industry to \nraise the price-per-pack of cigarettes and other tobacco products by \n$1.50 over the next two years.\n  In addition to raising the price of tobacco products, the KIDS Act \nwould establish ambitious goals for the reduction of teenage tobacco \nuse. The bill would mandate that the tobacco industry reduce youth \nsmoking by 65 percent over the next ten years--or face as much as $10 \nbillion in annual penalties. States, on the other hand, would be \nrewarded for reducing teen tobacco use. The KIDS Act would set aside \n$500 million of bonus money each year for states that meet or exceed \nannual smoking reduction targets.\n\n\n                           marketing reforms\n\n  For decades, the tobacco industry has pushed its products on young \nAmericans both overtly--on billboards and through the prominent \nsponsorship of sports like auto racing--and subtly, through characters \nlike Joe Camel. Their efforts have been helped by the shockingly easy \naccess that many minors have to tobacco products. Nationally, more than \n62 percent of 12-to-17 year-old smokers report that they buy their own \ncigarettes. Nearly half of those minors were never asked to show proof \nof age.\n  The KIDS Act would dramatically change the rules governing tobacco \nadvertising and sales. It would limit tobacco companies to black-and-\nwhite text advertisements--no more human images, cartoon characters, \noutdoor displays, sports and entertainment sponsorships, or product \ngiveaways. It would also encourage illegal tobacco purchases by banning \nvending machines sales of cigarettes and requiring state licensing of \ntobacco retailers. Stores caught selling to minors would face severe \nfinancial penalties.\n\n\n                           payments to states\n\n  In addition to the federal money it channels to states through bonus \npayments, incentives, grants, and federal programs, the KIDS Act would \ndirectly distribute almost $200 billion over 25 years--a third of the \nsettlement money--to individual states to spend on a broad array of \nhealth and anti-tobacco programs.\n  As a former Governor, I strongly believe that states deserve to be \nrecognized for their efforts to bring the tobacco industry to the \ntable. Without state's efforts, Congress would not be in the position \nto introduce this bill today. Any legislation contemplated by this \nCongress must recognize the State crucial role in this process.\n\n\n                    cap on annual industry payments\n\n  Unlike last year's national settlement, the KIDS Act would not \nsafeguard the tobacco industry from future lawsuits. It ensures \nreliable industry payments, so that the industry cannot use the excuse \nof financial woes to avoid its annual $25 billion commitment. As such, \nit would require that tobacco firms deposit $4 billion/year into a \n``National Victims Compensation Fund.'' Money from that fund would be \nused to pay victims who settle claims or win judgments against the \nindustry. The industry would also have to pay up to $4 billion/year in \nany additional claims--a maximum total of $8 billion/year.\n  I want to stress that my colleagues, Senators Chafee and Harkin, and \nI believe that this is our best and possibly our only chance to get \nthis historic legislation passed. We cannot let this opportunity slip \naway. A half-hearted, piecemeal effort simply won't do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dodd, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 1891. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to protect \nconsumers in managed care plans and other health coverage; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\n                the patients' bill of rights act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in introducing the \nPatients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998. This legislation has been \ndeveloped cooperatively with Democrats in the House and Senate to \naddress a growing concern of the American public, the quality of care \ndelivered by health plans and insurance companies. Today, three of \nevery four working, insured Americans are in managed care plans, and \nfar too many have experienced serious problems with their coverage. We \nall know someone with a horror story in that regard.\n  Today, David Garvey of Illinois told us the tragic story of his wife, \nwho had taken a ``dream'' vacation to Hawaii with a few of her friends. \nWhen she arrived in Hawaii, she noticed some bruises on her body. She \nwent to a clinic and was quickly admitted to the hospital. She was \ndiagnosed with aplastic anemia. Her doctor in Hawaii began a course of \ntreatment, and said that she would likely need a bone marrow transplant \nto save her life.\n  Several days into the treatment, her HMO called from Chicago and said \nshe had to return to Chicago for the treatment and transplant. They \ninsisted that she return, even over the strong objections of the doctor \nin Hawaii who said that she was not stable enough to travel and that \nher immune system could not fight infection. Mr. Garvey tried to talk \nto the decisionmakers in the plan, but they insisted that she return to \nChicago or forego coverage. As the medical bills were adding up, Mrs. \nGarvey had no choice but to fly back to Chicago. During that flight, \nMrs. Garvey had a stroke, and within days of her return, she developed \na fungal infection. Ten days later, she died.\n  Mr. President, I am outraged by what happened to the Garveys and \nbelieve we need legislation to protect patients against medically \ninappropriate decisions by health plans that too often put the \nfinancial bottom line before patients' health care needs.\n  The bill I am introducing today would provide enforceable protections \nfor millions of patients. It would ensure access to medically needed \ncare, including coverage at emergency rooms. It would allow patients \nwith serious conditions to see their specialist without asking \npermission each time and would allow women direct access to their ob/\ngyn.\n  The bill would allow patients denied benefits to appeal decisions \nboth within the plan and to an independent, external reviewer. When a \nplan says no to a treatment that your doctor says you need, you should \nbe able to appeal to an independent body that has no financial stake in \nthe decision. This bill gives every patient that right and says the \ndecision has to be made in a time frame that will not put the patient \nat risk.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights provides protection for the provider-\npatient relationship by banning gag clauses and limiting inappropriate \nfinancial incentives to deny care. It also would put a stop to \narbitrary decisions by plans to limit care, such as decisions to \ndischarge mastectomy patients from the hospital before it is medically \nappropriate.\n  Finally, the bill would hold plans legally accountable for decisions \nto deny or delay care that result in harm to patients. Today, 125 \nmillion Americans who get their health care through their employer have \nlittle recourse if their plans' decisions harm them, even when the \ndecisions lead to death. Doctors and hospitals are held accountable for \ntheir decisions, but health plans are not, and that is something that \nneeds to change.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is an important proposal that has the \nbacking of the American Medical Association, Consumers Union, Families \nUSA, the National Association of Children's Hospitals and numerous \nother organizations that advocate for quality patient care.\n  I hope we can engage in productive debate on this issue in the coming \nmonths and pass legislation to improve the quality of health care for \nthe American people.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the time for action to protect patients \nand curb insurance company abuse has come. We face a crisis of \nconfidence in health care. A recent survey found that an astonishing 80 \npercent of Americans now believe that their quality of care is often \ncompromised by their insurance plan to save money. One reason for this \nconcern is the explosive growth in managed care. In 1987, only 13 \npercent of privately insured Americans were enrolled in HMOs. Today 75 \npercent are in some form of managed care.\n  At its best, managed care offers the opportunity to achieve both \ngreater efficiency and higher quality in health care. In too many \ncases, however, the priority has become higher profits, not better \nhealth. Conventional insurance companies, too, have abused the system \nby denying coverage for treatments that their customers need and that \ntheir faithful payment of premiums should have guaranteed.\n  And the issue is not just confidence. It goes to the heart of the \nissue of quality care and to the fundamental doctor-patient \nrelationship. In California, a Kaiser Foundation study found that \nalmost half of all consumers reported a problem with their health \nplan--and substantial proportions reported that the plan's misbehavior \ncaused unnecessary pain and suffering, delayed their recovery, or even \nresulted in permanent disabilities. Projected to the national level, \nthese results indicate that 30 million Americans actually developed \nadditional health problems because of their plan's treatment of them, \nand a shocking 11 million developed permanent disabilities.\n  The list of those victimized by insurance company abuse grows every \nday.\n  A baby loses his hands and feet because his parents believe they have \nto take him to a distant emergency room rather than the one close to \ntheir home.\n  A Senate aide suffers a devastating stroke which might have been far \nmilder if her HMO had not refused to send her to an emergency room--the \nHMO now refuses to pay for her wheelchair.\n  A doctor is denied future referrals because he tells a patient about \nan expensive treatment that could save her life.\n  A child suffering from a rare cancer is told that life-saving surgery \nshould be performed by an unqualified doctor who happens to be on the \nplan's list, rather than by the nearby cancer specialty center equipped \nto provide quality care.\n  A San Diego paraplegic asks for referral to a rehabilitation \nspecialist. Her HMO refuses, and she develops a severe pressure wound \nthat a rehabilitation specialist would have routinely checked and \ntreated. She is forced to undergo surgery, and has to be hospitalized \nfor a year with round-the-clock nursing care.\n  A woman is forced to undergo a ``drive-by'' mastectomy and is sent \nhome in pain, with tubes still dangling from her body.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  The opponents of action are already waging a calculated and well-\nfinanced campaign of disinformation arguing that protecting patient's \nrights is the same as massive government mandates and vastly increased \ncosts. But the American people know better.\n  Opponents of the legislation try to create a false dichotomy between \nrelying on competitive market forces and relying on regulatory \nstandards. In fact, this amendment helps competition by establishing a \nlevel playing field between those who compete by providing quality care \nat a reasonable cost and those who try to compete by attracting only \nhealthy enrollees and denying those who fall ill the care they have \npromised.\n  This legislation guarantees people the rights that every scrupulous \ninsurance company already provides. These rights are common-sense \nstatement of components of quality care that every family believes they \nhave been promised when they signed up for coverage and faithfully paid \ntheir premiums.\n  Let me cite a few of these common-sense rights specified in our \nlegislation. They include access to an appropriate specialist when your \ncondition requires specialty care. They allow people with chronic \nillnesses or disabilities to have standing referrals to the specialists \nthey need to see on a regular basis. They assure that patients who need \na prescription drug to save their life or their health can have access \nto it even if it is not included in their plan's formulary.\n  They assure that a person suffering from serious symptoms can go to \nthe nearest emergency room without worrying that their plan will deny \ncoverage. No patient with the symptoms of a heart attack should be \nforced to\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\nput their life at risk by driving past the emergency room down the \nstreet to the network provider an hour or more away. No patient with \nsymptoms of stroke should be forced to delay the treatment to the point \nwhere paralysis and disability is permanent, because a clerk two \nthousand miles away does not respond promptly and appropriately. And no \npatient who goes to an emergency room with symptoms of a heart attack \nthat proves to be a false alarm should suffer a real heart attack when \na bill for thousands of dollars arrives that the health insurer has \nrefused to pay.\n  This amendment also says that any reform worthy of the name \nmust guarantee that insurance plans meet the special needs of women and \nchildren. Women should have access to gynecologists for needed \nservices. No women with breast cancer should be forced to endure a \n``drive-by'' mastectomy against the advice of her doctor.\n\n  No child with a rare childhood cancer should be told that the \nurologist who happens to be in the plan's network will treat him--even \nif that urologist has no experience or expertise with children or with \nthat rare cancer.\n  Too many desperate patients--especially cancer patients--know that \ntheir only hope for survival is participation in a clinical trial. Such \ntrials not only offer hope to patients, they also advance our knowledge \nand lead to better treatments for dread diseases. Many insurers have \nroutinely paid for the medical costs associated with clinical trials, \nbecause they knew they offered benefits for patients and because the \npatients would incur medical costs in any event, even if they were not \npart of the trial. But today, many insurers are backing away from that \nconstructive policy. Managed care plans, in particular, have often \ndenied their patients the ability to participate in such trials.\n  Our legislation provides patients a right to participate in such \ntrials if stringent conditions are met. There must be no standard \ntreatment that is effective for the patient, and the patient must be \nsuffering from a serious or life-threatening illness. The trial must be \nfunded by the NIH or another government agency meeting NIH standards. \nAnd the trial must offer the patient a realistic hope for clinical \nbenefit.\n  Patients need the right to appeal decisions on their plans to \nindependent third parties. Today, if a health plan breaks its promise, \nthe only recourse for most patients is to go to court--a time-consuming \nand costly process that may not provide relief in time to save a life \nor prevent a disability.\n  Independent review was recommended unanimously by the President's \nCommission. It has worked successfully in Medicare for four decades. \nWorking families deserve the basic fairness that only an impartial \nappeal can provide. Without such a mechanism, any ``rights'' guaranteed \nto patients exist on paper only--and they are scarcely worth the paper \non which they are written. When the issues are sickness and health--and \noften as serious as life and death--no health insurance company should \nbe allowed to be both judge and jury.\n  When health plan misconduct results in serious injury or death, \npatients and their families should be able to obtain accountability. \nEvery other industry in America can be held responsible for its \nactions. Why should health plans, whose decisions truly can mean life \nor death, enjoy this unique immunity?\n  Reforms must protect the integrity of the doctor-patient \nrelationship. ``Gag clauses'' and improper incentive arrangements \nshould have no place in American medicine.\n  And finally, everyone should agree that noncontroversial steps to \nimprove quality and provide greater patient information should be part \nof reform.\n  This amendment should not be controversial for any member of the \nSenate who is serious about protecting patients from insurance company \nabuse. Its basic provisions were included in legislation introduced by \nDemocrats in the House and Senate. That legislation is supported by the \nAmerican Medical Association, the Consortium of Citizens with \nDisabilities, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National \nPartnership for Women and Families, the National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals, the AFL-CIO, and many other groups representing \nphysicians and other health care providers, children, women, families, \nconsumers, persons with disabilities, Americans with serious illnesses, \nand working families.\n  It is rare for such a broad and diverse coalition to be assembled in \nsupport of any legislation. But ending these flagrant abuses will help \nevery American family.\n  The choice is clear. The Senate should stand with patients, families, \nand physicians. We must not stand with the well-heeled special \ninterests that put profits ahead of patients.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Specter):\n  S. 1893. A Bill to establish a law enforcement block grant program; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           the local law enforcement block grant act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grants Act of 1998, which reauthorizes the very \nsuccessful Local Law Enforcement Grant Program. This program gives \nlocal governments the resources to fight crime, without the \n``Washington knows best'' strings attached. I believe it is a mistake \nfor Washington to try to micromanage how local communities spend their \nlaw enforcement dollars. Instead Washington should play the role of \npartner with local law enforcement to improve the tools they use to \nfight crime.\n  My views on this issue are based on more than 20 years of experience \nin the criminal justice system: as a prosecutor in Greene County, Ohio; \nin the Ohio State Senate; as a United States Congressman on the \nJudiciary Committee; as Lieutenant Governor overseeing anti-crime and \nanti-drug efforts; and now, as a member on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I have had an opportunity to work on criminal justice issues \nfrom the local, state, and federal levels, and have been fortunate to \nsee firsthand what Congress can do to help local communities be victors \nin the war on crime.\n  Because 90 percent of all criminal prosecution is local, the fight \nagainst crime will be won or lost by local law enforcement, local \nprosecutors and courts, and concerned citizens in every community. I \nbelieve the best way for the federal government to help local \ncommunities fight crime is to return more money to those communities, \nbecause in the final analysis, it is they who will get the job done. \nFor too long the Federal Government has had all the money--and local \ncommunities all the crime. Local communities know what works--and they \nshould have the resources.\n  From 1999-2003, this Act authorizes $750 million each year for direct \ngrants to local law enforcement to reduce crime and improve public \nsafety. Distributions are made by the Bureau of Justice Assistance on a \nformula basis, directly to local governments. Grants may include, but \nare not limited to, equipment and law enforcement personnel, enhancing \nschool security measures, violent offender adjudication, drug courts, \ncrime prevention programs and youth intervention programs.\n  One of the most frequent uses of this grant money in Ohio, and by \nlocal law enforcement across the country, has been for crime fighting \ntechnology. I believe there is a critical need to modernize the crime \nfighting tools used by local law enforcement, who have been fighting \nincreasingly sophisticated criminals with outmoded tools. That's why I \nam expressly providing that funds may also be used for information and \nidentification technology, such as criminal history information, \nfingerprint dissemination, and DNA and ballistics tests.\n  Let me underscore here that this Act leaves to local governments the \ndecision regarding what their funding priorities should be, while at \nthe same time requiring accountability as to how funds are ultimately \nused. Local advisory boards also have an opportunity to recommend how \nmonies are spent as well. These funds will help local law enforcement \nmeet the critical local needs, by letting them put the resources where \nthey are needed most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in celebrating National Public Health Week during the week of \nApril 6 through April 12. I believe that this years theme, ``healthy \npeople in healthy communities'' says it all. It should be the goal of \nevery single one of us of help focus public attention on major health \nissues in our communities, and the contributions our public health \nprofessionals play in addressing our health and safety needs.\n  Established by Congress in 1995, public health week affords us an \nopportunity to learn and to teach others about public health success \nstories like the elimination of small pox and polio and improvements in \nchildhood immunization. Few people know that it was public health that \nsuccessfully waged the war to reduce lead from paint, fluoridate \ndrinking water and protect people from gasoline vapor, thus giving our \nchildren a brighter future and gaining a 30-year increase in life \nexpectancy in the 20th century.\n  Incidence of heart disease and stroke have dramatically declined \nthrough public health community-wide education initiatives. As someone \nwho represents people who live in the buckle of the stroke belt in the \nUnited States, I was pleased to learn that 2 million American deaths \nfrom heart disease and stroke have been prevented in the past thirty \nyears through public health prevention programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a moment during spring recess to \nparticipate in public health activities in their states. In years past, \nNorth Carolinians have organized health fairs in churches and community \ncenters, and sponsored ``healthy eating'' cooking contests to \ncommemorate the week. I urge all Americans to take the time to evaluate \ntheir own personal health consciousness.\n  As we approach the millennium, threats of biological and viral \nepidemics plague our communities like never before. Our public health \ndepartments and professionals serve as our first line of defense \nagainst the growing threat of infectious disease and bioterrorism. With \nless than 40 percent of our health departments able to communicate by \ncomputer with CDC, it is our obligation to provide public health with \nthe manpower, training, and equipment needed to fight these growing \nthreats.\n  Our U.S. Public Health Service will celebrate their 200th anniversary \nthis summer, and the 50th anniversary of the World Health Organization. \nLet us be the Congress that is known for making the health of our \ncitizens our No. 1 priority.\n  Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege to submit to you today a \nSenate resolution to recognize the contributions of public health and \nprevention services to our nation in an effort to celebrate National \nPublic Health Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2864-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2864-S2872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    SMITH AMENDMENTS NOS. 2179-2181\n\n  Mr. SMITH (of Oregon) proposed three amendments to the concurrent \nresolution (S.

The level of \n     these tax rates is set permanently in the law at the rate \n     payable today;\n       (2) more than ninety-five percent of the work force--an \n     estimated 148.2 million workers in 1998--is required to pay \n     Social Security taxes;\n       (3) Social Security taxes are paid both by employees and \n     employers and the self-employed on earnings up to a maximum \n     amount of $68,400 in 1998, the amount increasing at the same \n     rate as average earnings in the economy;\n       (4) the Social Security tax was first levied in 1937 at a \n     rate of 1% on earnings up to $3,000 per year;\n       (5) the rate in 1998 has risen to 6.2 perecent--an increase \n     of 620 percent, and a majority of American families pay more \n     in Social Security taxes than income taxes;\n       (6) in his State of the Union message on January 27, 1998, \n     President Clinton called on Congress to ``save Social \n     Security first'' and to ``reserve one hundred percent of the \n     surplus, that is any penny of the surplus, until we have \n     taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social \n     Security system for the twenty-first century.''\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that when the \n     Congress moves to work in a bipartisan way on specific \n     legislation to reform the Social Security system, it will not \n     consider increasing\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\n     Social Security tax rates on American workers, beyond the \n     permanent levels set in current law nor increase the maximum \n     earnings subject to Social Security taxation beyond those \n     prescribed by the wage indexing rules of current law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2180\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . GENERAL PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF MARIJUANA FOR \n                   MEDICINAL PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that no funds appropriated by Congress \n     should be used to provide, procure, furnish, fund or support, \n     or to compel any individual, institution or government entity \n     to provide, procure, furnish, fund or support, any item, \n     good, benefit, program or service, for the purpose of the use \n     of marijuana for medicinal purposes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2181\n\n       On page 53, strike lines 1 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PRICE INCREASE ON TOBACCO \n                   PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the use of tobacco products by children and teenagers \n     has become a public health epidemic and according to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than \n     16,000,000 of our Nation's children today will become regular \n     smokers;\n       (2) of the 16,000,000 children who become regular smokers, \n     approximately one-third or 5,000,000 children will die of \n     tobacco-related illness;\n       (3) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     that tobacco use costs medicare approximately $10,000,000,000 \n     per year, and the total economic cost of tobacco in health-\n     related costs is more than 100,000,000,000 per year; and\n       (4) the public health community recognizes that by \n     increasing the cost of tobacco products by $1.50 per pack, \n     the rate of tobacco us among children and teenagers will be \n     reduced.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that, if \n     comprehensive tobacco legislation requires an increase in the \n     price of cigarettes, any such revenue should be used to \n     restore solvency to the medicare program under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HOLLINGS AMENDMENT NO. 2182\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS submitted an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S. \nCon.

Mr. President, I submit an amendment to repeal the three \npercent federal excise tax that all Americans pay every time they use a \ntelephone.\n  Under current law, the federal government taxes you three percent of \nyour monthly phone bill for the so-called ``privilege'' of using your \nphone lines. This tax was first imposed one hundred years ago. To help \nfinance the Spanish-American War, the federal government taxed \ntelephone service, which in 1898 was a luxury service enjoyed by \nrelatively few. The tax reappeared as a means of raising revenue for \nWorld War I, and continued as a revenue-raiser during the Great \nDepression, World War II, the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and the chronic \nfederal budget deficits of the last twenty years.\n  Earlier this month, however, we received some long-overdue good news: \nthanks to the Balanced Budget Act enacted by the Congress in 1997, the \nCongressional Budget Office projected an $8 billion federal budget \nsurplus for 1998. Mr. President, that announcement should mean the end \nof the federal phone excise tax.\n  Here is why. First of all, the telephone is a modern-day necessity, \nnot like alcohol, or furs, or jewelry, or other items of the sort that \nthe government taxes this way. The Congress specifically recognized the \nneed for all Americans to have affordable telephone service when it \nenacted the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The universal service \nprovisions of the Act are intended to assure that all Americans, \nregardless of where they live or how much money they make, have access \nto affordable telephone service. The telephone excise tax, which bears \nno relationship to any government service received by the consumer, is \nflatly inconsistent with the goal of universal telephone service.\n  It is also a highly regressive and unfair tax that hurts low-income \nand rural Americans even more than other Americans. Low-income families \nspend a higher percentage of their income\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\nthan medium- or high-income families on telephone service, and that \nmeans the telephone tax hits low-income families much harder. For that \nreason the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that increases in \nthe telephone tax would have a greater impact on low-income families \nthan tax increases on alcohol or tobacco products. And a study by the \nAmerican Agriculture Movement concluded that excise taxes like the \ntelephone tax impose a disproportionately large tax burden on rural \ncustomers, too, who rely on telephone service in isolated areas.\n  But, in addition to being unfair and unnecessary, there is another \nreason why we should eliminate the telephone excise tax. Implementation \nof the Telecom Act of 1996 requires all telecommunications carriers--\nlocal, long-distance, and wireless--to incur new costs in order to \nproduce a new, more competitive market for telecommunications services \nof all kinds.\n  Unfortunately, the cost increases are arriving far more quickly than \nthe new, more competitive market. The Telecom Act created a new subsidy \nprogram for wiring schools and libraries to the Internet, and the cost \nof funding that subsidy has already increased bills for business users \nof long-distance telephone service and for consumers of wireless \nservices. Because of more universal service subsidy requirements and \nother new Telecom Act mandates, more rate increases for all users will \noccur later this year and next year.\n  Mr. President, the fact that the Telecom Act is imposing new charges \non consumers' bills makes it absolutely incumbent upon us to strip away \nany unnecessary old charges. And that means the telephone excise tax.\n  Mr. President, the telephone excise tax is not a harmless artifact \nfrom bygone days. It collects money for wars that are already over, and \nfor budget deficits that no longer exist, from people who can least \nafford to spend it now and from people who will have new bills to foot \nas the 1996 Telecom Act gets implemented. That is unfair, that's wrong, \nand that must be stopped.\n  San Juan Hill and Pork Chop Hill have now gone down in history, and \nso should this tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               COVERDELL (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2199\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Craig, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \nHelms, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Gramm, and Mr. Kyl) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FEDERAL DOMESTIC \n                   DISCRETIONARY SPENDING RESTRAINTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Social Security and Medicare are deeply rooted \n     contracts, that must be honored, between the Federal \n     Government and the American people; and\n       (2) Federal spending for fiscal year 1999 is--\n       (A) more than twice the size of Federal spending for fiscal \n     year 1969, the last budget resulting in a surplus, in real \n     dollars; and\n       (B) requires revenue equal to 20.1 percent of gross \n     domestic product, the highest since fiscal year 1945.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the first priority of Congress will be to use any \n     unified budget surplus in order to reform Social Security and \n     preserve it for current and future generations;\n       (2) Congress will ensure that Federal funds will be \n     available to strengthen and further preserve Medicare until \n     such time as legislation is enacted making Medicare \n     actuarially sound;\n       (3) in making the spending reductions provided in section \n     201, programs that should be protected are those that--\n       (A) address the needs of elementary and secondary \n     education;\n       (B) enhance nutrition, particularly among children;\n       (C) reduce illegal drug use, particularly among juveniles;\n       (D) support medical priorities;\n       (E) are targeted for low-income families; and\n       (F) reduce illegal immigration; and\n       (4) Congress will limit itself to only administrative \n     reductions when determining mandatory spending offsets for \n     middle class tax relief as described in section 201.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       McCAIN AMENDMENT NO. 2200\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE EXPENDITURE OF \n                   $500,000,000 FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW COURT \n                   HOUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Illegal drugs cost our society approximately \n     $67,000,000,000 each year.\n       (2) Drug abuse and trafficking hurt families, businesses, \n     and neighborhoods, impede education, and choke criminal \n     justice, health, and social-service systems.\n       (3) The war on drugs started in America during the Reagan \n     years and was eagerly joined by most of the western world.\n       (4) Teenage drug use declined dramatically since the early \n     1980's, but that trend reversed in 1992, when teenage drug \n     use began to increase.\n       (5) Statistics indicate that 1996 drug-use rates among \n     youth, were 9 percent, well below the 1979 peak of 16.3 \n     percent, but substantially higher than the 1992 low of 5.3 \n     percent.\n       (6) The most recent National Drug Strategy figures show a \n     massive 66 percent increase in teenage drug use since the \n     1980's.\n       (7) By 1996, 50.8 percent of high school seniors reported \n     having used illicit drugs.\n       (8) The use of illicit drugs among eighth graders alone has \n     increased 150 percent over the past 5 years.\n       (9) When juveniles engage in drug abuse, they, their \n     families, and their communities suffer.\n       (10) Drug abuse is associated with violent crime and \n     income-generating crime by youth, which increases the demand \n     for juvenile and criminal justice services.\n       (11) One study found that, of the 113 delinquent youth in a \n     State detention facility, 82 percent reported being heavy \n     (i.e., daily) users of alcohol and other drugs just prior to \n     admission.\n       (12) A direct effect of juvenile drug use is an increasing \n     burden on the juvenile and criminal justice systems.\n       (13) Reducing juvenile drug use would reduce the drain on \n     the criminal justice system and obviate the need to construct \n     additional courthouses.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\n       (1) $500,000,000 for courthouse construction should not be \n     spent until the United States has reduced drug use among 12- \n     to 17- year olds to not more than 4 percent; and\n       (2) Congress' first priority should be to use the \n     $500,000,000 allocated for courthouse construction for \n     juvenile drug use prevention programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  COVERDELL AMENDMENTS NOS. 2201-2202\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. COVERDELL submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the concurrent resolution, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 2201\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FOOD SAFETY RESEARCH, \n                   CONSUMER EDUCATION, AND PREVENTION EFFORTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that food safety research, consumer \n     education, and prevention efforts should be a high priority \n     at the Department of Agriculture, the National Institutes of \n     Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention, and our nation's colleges and \n     universities. The Senate applauds the efforts of institutions \n     whose work on E. coli 0157:H7, Cyclospora, and other food \n     borne pathogens has helped us gain a better understanding of \n     these new and emerging threats. The Senate considers this \n     matter of extreme importance and encourages the Department of \n     Agriculture, in cooperation with other agencies and \n     institutions, to utilize funds for food safety research and \n     consumer education partnerships.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2202\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MILITARY HEALTH CARE \n                   FOR VETERANS AND MILITARY RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1998 the Congress recognized--\n       (A) the moral obligation the United States has to provide \n     health care to members and former members of the Armed Forces \n     who are entitled to retired or retainer pay (or its \n     equivalent);\n       (B) the necessity to provide quality, affordable health \n     care to these retirees; and\n       (C) Congress and the President should take steps to address \n     the problems associated with the availability of health care \n     for such retirees within two years after the date of the \n     enactment of the 1998 National Defense Authorization Act;\n       (2) several proposals lie before the Congress which address \n     military retiree health care.\n       (3) the Congress has yet to take significant steps forward \n     on any of these proposals.\n       (4) a shrinking Department of Defense health care \n     infrastructure and an increasing military retiree pool are \n     putting strains on our country's ability to provide military \n     retirees adequate health care.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that it is \n     morally incumbent upon the Senate to take steps to ensure \n     adequate health care for Veterans and military retirees in \n     its FY99 budget and all subsequent budgets, and it should \n     determine ways to provide funding adequate to cover the \n     health care needs of U.S. Veterans and military retirees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      WYDEN AMENDMENT NO. 2203\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WYDEN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe concurrent resolution, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF \n                   A NATIONAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM FOR LONG-\n                   TERM CARE WORKERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 43 percent of Americans over the age of 65 are \n     likely to spend time in a nursing home.\n       (2) Home health care is the fastest growing portion of the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), with an average annual growth rate \n     of 32 percent since 1989.\n       (3) A 1997 report from State Long-Term Care Ombudsmen \n     assisted under the Older Americans Act of 1965 indicated that \n     in 29 States surveyed, 7,043 cases of abuse, gross neglect, \n     or exploitation occurred in nursing homes and board and care \n     facilities.\n       (4) A random sample survey of nursing home staff found that \n     10 percent of the staff admitted committing at least 1 act of \n     physical abuse in the preceding year.\n       (5) Although the majority of long-term care facilities do \n     an excellent job in caring for elderly and disabled patients, \n     incidents of abuse and neglect do occur at an unacceptable \n     rate and are not limited to nursing homes alone.\n       (6) Most long-term care facilities do not conduct both \n     Federal and State criminal background checks on prospective \n     employees.\n       (7) Most State nurse aide abuse registries are limited to \n     nursing home aides, thereby failing to cover home health and \n     hospice aides.\n       (8) Current State nurse aide abuse registries are \n     inadequate to screen out abusive long-term care workers \n     because no national system is in place to track abusers from \n     State to State and facility to facility.\n       (9) Currently, 29 States have enacted varying forms of \n     criminal background check requirements for prospective long-\n     term care employees. However current Federal and State \n     safeguards are inadequate because there is little or no \n     information sharing between States about known abusers.\n       (10) Many facilities would choose to conduct background \n     checks on prospective employees if an efficient, accurate, \n     and cost-effective national system existed.\n       (11) The impending retirement of the baby boom generation \n     will greatly increase the demand and need for quality long-\n     term care.\n       (12) It is incumbent on Congress and the President to \n     ensure that patients receiving care under the medicare and \n     medicaid programs (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.) are \n     protected from abuse, neglect, and mistreatment.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that--\n       (1) funds should be directed toward the establishment of a \n     national background check system for long-term care workers \n     who participate in the medicare and medicaid programs (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.);\n       (2) such a system would include both a national registry of \n     abusive long-term care workers and a requirement for a \n     Federal criminal background check before such workers are \n     employed to provide long-term care; and\n       (3) such a system would be created with ample input and \n     comment from representatives of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, State government, law enforcement, the \n     nursing home and home health industries, patient and consumer \n     advocates, and advocates for long-term care workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DURBIN (AND CHAFEE) AMENDMENT NO. 2205\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Chafee) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

Con. \nRes. 86, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY PERSONAL \n                   RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS AND THE BUDGET SURPLUS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The social security program is the foundation of \n     retirement income for most Americans, and solving the \n     financial problems of the social security program is a vital \n     national priority and essential for the retirement security \n     of today's working Americans and their families.\n       (2) There is a growing bipartisan consensus that personal \n     retirement accounts should be an important feature of social \n     security reform.\n       (3) Personal retirement accounts can provide a substantial \n     retirement nest egg and real personal wealth. For an \n     individual 28 years old on the date of the adoption of this \n     resolution, earning an average wage, and retiring at age 65 \n     in 2035, just 1 percent of that individual's wages deposited \n     each year in a personal retirement account and invested in \n     securities consisting of the Standard & Poors 500 would grow \n     to $132,000, and be worth approximately 20 percent of the \n     benefits that would be provided to the individual under the \n     current provisions of the social security program.\n       (4) Personal retirement accounts would give the majority of \n     Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in \n     the economic growth of America.\n       (5) Personal retirement accounts would demonstrate the \n     value of savings and the magic of compound interest to all \n     Americans. Today, Americans save less than people in almost \n     every other country.\n       (6) Personal retirement accounts would help Americans to \n     better prepare for retirement generally. According to the \n     Congressional Research Service, 60 percent of Americans are \n     not actively participating in a retirement plan other than \n     social security, although social security was never intended \n     to be the sole source of retirement income.\n       (7) Personal retirement accounts would allow partial \n     prefunding of retirement benefits, thereby providing for \n     social security's future financial stability.\n       (8) The Federal budget will register a surplus of \n     $671,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, offering a unique \n     opportunity to begin a permanent solution to social \n     security's financing.\n       (9) Using the Federal budget surplus to fund personal \n     retirement accounts would be an important first step in \n     comprehensive social security reform and ensuring the \n     delivery of promised retirement benefits.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this resolution assumes that the Committee on Finance \n     shall consider and report a legislative proposal this year \n     that would dedicate the Federal budget surplus to the \n     establishment of a program of personal retirement accounts \n     for working Americans and reduce the unfunded liabilities of \n     the social security program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                JOHNSON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2210\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Johnson, for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. McCain) \nproposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 86, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REPAIR AND CONSTRUCTION \n                   NEEDS OF INDIAN SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) many of our Nation's tribal schools are in a state of \n     serious disrepair. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) \n     operates 187 school facilities nationwide. Enrollment in \n     these schools, which presently numbers 47,214 students, has \n     been growing rapidly. A recent General Accounting Office \n     report indicates that the repair backlog in these schools \n     totals $754 million, and that the BIA schools are in \n     generally worse condition than all schools nationally;\n       (2) approximately 60 of these schools are in need of \n     complete replacement or serious renovation. Many of the \n     renovations include basic structural repair for the safety of \n     children, new heating components to keep students warm, and \n     roofing replacement to keep the snow and rain out of the \n     classroom. In addition to failing to provide adequate \n     learning environments for Indian children, these repair and \n     replacement needs pose a serious liability issue for the \n     Federal Government;\n       (3) 63 percent of the BIA schools are over 30 years old, 26 \n     percent are over 50 years old. Approximately forty percent of \n     all students in BIA schools are in portable classrooms. \n     Originally intended as temporary facilities while tribes \n     awaited new construction funds, these ``portables'' have a \n     maximum 10 year life-span. Because of the construction \n     backlog, children have been shuffling between classrooms in \n     the harsh climates of the Northern plains and Western States \n     for ten to fifteen years;\n       (4) annual appropriations for BIA education facilities \n     replacement and repair combined have averaged $20-30 million \n     annually, meeting only 4 percent of total need. At the \n     present rate, one deteriorating BIA school can be replaced \n     each year, with estimates of completion of nine schools in \n     the next seven years. Since the new construction and repair \n     backlog is so great and growing, the current focus at BIA \n     construction must remain on emergency and safety needs only, \n     without prioritizing program needs such as increasing \n     enrollment or technology in the classroom; and\n       (5) unlike most schools, the BIA schools are a \n     responsibility of the Federal Government. Unfortunately, the \n     failure of the Federal Government to live up to this \n     responsibility has come at the expense of quality education \n     for some of this Nation's poorest children with the fewest \n     existing opportunities to better themselves.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume that the repair and construction \n     backlog affecting Bureau of Indian Affairs school facilities \n     should be eliminated over a period of no more than five years \n     beginning with Fiscal Year 1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CRAIG (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2211\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Grams, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, \nMrs. Hutchison, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Coverdell) proposed \nan\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\namendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

Mr. President, the Pediatric Emergency Medical \nServices Program was enacted into public law on a truly bipartisan \nbasis on October 30, 1984. Children are not ``merely little adults.'' \nThey have their own unique health care needs, respond to illness and \ntrauma in their own individualized manner, and although children \nconstitute between 20 to 35 percent of hospital emergency department \nservices, too often their families are not really considered an \nintegral component of their treatment and eventual rehabilitation. When \nPresident Reagan signed Public Law 98-555, a new era of hope and \nopportunity had arrived.\n  Over the years, I have been very pleased with the steady growth this \nprogram has experienced. The landmark 1993 Institute of Medicine report \nreminded us, however, that much more still needs to be done. ``Each \nyear, injury alone claims more lives of children between the ages of 1 \nand 19 than do all forms of illness. . .. Overall, some 21,000 children \nand young people under the age of 20 died from injuries in 1988. . .. \nClearly, preventing emergencies is the best `cure' and must be a high \npriority, but as yet, prevention is far from foolproof. When prevention \nfails, families should have access to timely care by trained personnel \nwithin a well-organized emergency medical services (EMS) system. \nServices should encompass prevention, prehospital care and transport, \nED and inpatient care at local hospitals and specialty centers, and \nassistance in gaining access to appropriate follow-up care including \nrehabilitation services. For too many children and their families, \nhowever, these resources have not been available when they were needed. \n. ..'' I would suggest that the Institute of Medicine has raised a very \ncritical issue for all of us in our nation, and particularly for the \nwell-being of our families.\n  This year, the Administration in its Fiscal Year 1999 budget \nrequested $11 million to continue the Pediatric Emergency Medical \nServices Program. This figure represents a decrease of $2 million from \nlast year and we might be somewhat distressed by the recommendation. \nHowever, I am very pleased that in this time of significant budgetary \nconstraints, Secretary Shalala requested funding. And, I am confident \nthat again this year our colleagues serving on the Appropriations \nCommittees, on both sides of the aisle and in the House and Senate, \nwill enthusiastically respond to the truly pressing needs of our \nnation's children. I am also confident that we will continue to have \nthe vocal support of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the \nNational Association of Children's Hospitals. But for their active \nsupport in the past, it is fair to say that Congressman Bill Young and \nI would not have been able to be as effective as we have wished.\n  The Department's budget justification continues to point out all too \ngraphically the real need for this program. They point out that: ``Each \nyear over 20,000 children die from injuries. Another 31,447,000 \nchildren and adolescents are seen in emergency departments, accounting \nfor $8.6 billion per year in medical costs. Government sources pay all \nor part of 40 percent of the pediatric emergency department visits, or \nabout $3.4 billion. . ..'' Without question, having appropriate and \nhigh quality care available in a timely fashion is an investment in our \nnation's future.\n  Every one of us should be aware that there is still much to be \naccomplished in our efforts to protect the lives and future of our \nloved ones. Even today, only two states require that Basic Life Support \nvehicles carry all the equipment needed to stabilize a child and\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\nonly five states require all such equipment for Advanced Life Support \nambulances. 34 percent of EMTs and paramedics report that they still do \nnot feel comfortable treating children. In 1996, 66 percent of persons \nwho failed the national EMT exam did so because they failed the \npediatric/OB section. A recent study found that paramedics' skills and \nknowledge for treating critically ill or injured children completely \ndecayed by six months post-training; yet no state requires even annual \nretraining in pediatric care. Children with special health care needs \npresent major complications for emergency treatment. Yet, only six \nstates have approved continuing education courses that address this \ntopic. Only nine states have the capacity to produce reports on \npediatric emergency medical services care using statewide emergency \nmedical services data. Perhaps most significantly, however, is the \nfinding that LESS THAN HALF (46 percent) of hospitals with emergency \ndepartments have necessary equipment for stabilization of ill and \ninjured children, and only 40 percent of our nation's hospitals with \nemergency departments have written transfer agreements with a higher \nlevel facility to ensure that children receive timely and appropriate \nhospital care when they need it. Many public policy experts have also \nraised the issue of how pediatric emergency care is being covered under \nmanaged care programs.\n  Earlier, I referred to the impressive report which the Congress had \nreceived from the experts at the Institute of Medicine. In my judgment, \nperhaps the most critical Institute of Medicine recommendation is that \nthe Congress should provide $30 million annually for this special \nprogram. Those of us from Hawaii truly appreciate on a first-hand basis \nthe many far reaching health policy recommendations that have been made \nover the years by our visionary pediatrician, Dr. Calvin Sia. I, as one \nU.S. Senator, shall continue to do my best to implement Dr. Sia's \nrecommendations. Our nation's children and families deserve no \nless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2872-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2873-S2874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NOMINATION OF JUDGE PAEZ\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few comments about \nJudge Paez's nomination, which was recently reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee with six Members noting dissents. Because I had a \nprior commitment, when the markup was moved from 10:00 A.M. to 5:30 \nP.M. Thursday afternoon I was not able to be there and accordingly did \nnot record a position on this matter, which was voted on by voice vote \nwith those wishing to note a dissent doing so. I would like the record \nto reflect, however, that I have serious objections to this nominee's \nconfirmation. My reasons center around some comments Judge Paez made \nabout two California initiatives while he was serving as a district \njudge.\n  In a speech given at Boalt Hall in April of 1995 as part of a series \nof lectures on Law & Cultural Diversity honoring Judge Mario Olmos, a \nBoalt Hall graduate, Judge Paez said the following:\n\n       The Latino community has, for some time now, faced \n     heightened discrimination and hostility, which came to a head \n     with the passage of Proposition 187. The proposed anti-civil \n     rights initiative [which was eventually placed on the ballot \n     as Proposition 209] will inflame the issues all over again, \n     without contributing to any serious discussion of our \n     differences and similarities or ways to ensure equal \n     opportunity for all.\n\n  Here are my concerns. In the case of Proposition 187, an initiative \nbarring receipt of state-funded benefits by illegal aliens, at the time \nJudge Paez made these remarks, he was a sitting district court judge, \nand there was litigation pending in Judge Paez's own court regarding \nthe constitutionality of this initiative. That court had granted a \nt.r.o. and had before it a request for a preliminary injunction, which \nthe district court did not rule on until November 1995, seven months \nafter Judge Paez made this speech. Assuming some aspects of the \ninitiative ultimately survived this facial constitutional challenge, a \nquestion that I believe has just gone to the Ninth Circuit, there was \nalso certain to be litigation over how it should be interpreted.\n  Judge Paez's comments on the initiative, it seems to me, at a minimum \nat least unnecessarily raise a question as to whether he will be able \nto decide cases presenting issues relating to Proposition 187 \nimpartially. Indeed, at his hearing, when asked about these remarks, \nJudge Paez practically acknowledged this problem in that he cited the \npending cases as a reason why he needed to be cautious in answering \nJudiciary Committee Members' questions about what he had said. That is \nthe very reason he should not have said what he did in the first place. \nAccordingly, I think these comments are inconsistent with Canon 4 of \nthe Model Code of Judicial Conduct, governing judges' extra-judicial \nactivities. Under that canon, off the bench a judge is supposed to \nconduct himself or herself so as not to ``cast reasonable doubt on the \njudge's capacity to act impartially as a judge.''\n  As for Judge Paez's comments regarding Proposition 209, barring \nracial preferences in the provision of public services, I believe they \nraise similar concerns and some additional ones as well. Proposition \n209 had not even been placed before the voters at the time these \ncomments were made, and so as far as I am aware, there was no pending \nlitigation about it at the time Judge Paez made these comments--\nalthough we have had before us another nominee for the Ninth Circuit \nwho tried to get an injunction against circulating petitions to place \nan initiative on the ballot, so such litigation certainly was not an \nimpossibility even at that stage of the process. Even if no challenge \nalong those lines were brought, however, it was crystal clear that \nthere certainly would be ample litigation about it if the initiative \nwas placed on the ballot and passed, and that again, it was likely to \nbe in Judge Paez's court. Indeed we know that is in fact what happened. \nSo in that instance as well, it seems to me that these comments are \ndubious under Canon 4.\n  In addition, I think they are problematic under Canon 5(D). That \ncanon generally prohibits judges from engaging in political activity. \nJudge Paez gave this speech on April 6, 1995. The next day, the \nCalifornia Democratic Party opened its State convention, where press \nreports say that the question of how to respond to the circulating \ninitiative was one of the central issues on the table. One day later, \nPresident Clinton went out to California to give a speech on the \nsubject. According to the press, at the time many were arguing that \ngiven California's significance in Presidential politics, this issue \ncould play a critical role in the Presidential election.\n  Given this context, Judge Paez's comments look a lot like a judge \nintervening in a hot political controversy. Granted, the forum where \nJudge Paez made these remarks--a lecture series at a law school--may \ninsulate them from actually violating Canon 5. And it is possible that \nJudge Paez was just unlucky about the timing of his remarks, and had \nno intention of affecting the California Democratic Party's position \n(although in answer to a question at his hearing about how an \ninitiative that tracks the Fourteenth Amendment could be ``anti-civil \nrights'', he said that at the time he was giving his remarks, he \nremembered ``just reading in the papers there was a lot of debate going \non as to how it should actually be formulated,'' suggesting that \nperhaps he was following that debate). Regardless of his actual \nintention, however, the appearance that a judge is injecting himself \ninto politics is exactly what Canon 5(D) is designed to avoid, and that \nis presumably why it is formulated as a flat prohibition.\n\n  When he was asked about these comments at his hearing, Judge Paez \nsaid ``we shouldn't and I wasn't trying to take a political position. \nWe were bound by certain ethics. Nonetheless, as I said a minute ago, \nwe are--we have a life outside of our role as a judge as well, and it \nwas an--I was trying to address a particular broad issue, and so I made \nthose remarks.'' He also said that he regretted having used the \nparticular words he did. In written answers to follow up questions, he \nalso explained why in his view his remarks did not violate Canon 3A(6) \n(prohibiting judicial comments on the merits of pending cases) and how \n``upon reflection, [he] underst[ood] how [his] reference to the \nproposed initiative could have led some to believe that [he] might have \na biased view of the constitutionality of Proposition 209.'' He \ncontinued ``I regret that anyone would have that perception, as I \nassure you that was not\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\nand is not the case. I am sorry that I may have given anyone such an \nimpression by uncritically referring to the proposed initiative in the \nway that I did.''\n  I do not think these responses are sufficient. The concerns that have \nbeen raised about these matters are not esoteric. They are the kind of \nthing that I think we reasonably expect judges to think about before \nthey give public remarks. Nor was Judge Paez brand new to the bench \nwhen he made these remarks: he gave the speech in April 1995, some nine \nmonths after his appointment. Finally, Judge Paez indicated in response \nto written questions from Senator Ashcroft (1) that since his comments \nonly went to the divisive nature of the initiative, he ``hope[d]'' it \nwould have been clear to the people of California that he had not \nprejudged the matter but that (2) in any event he would not have \nrecused himself from hearing a challenge to Proposition 209 because he \nbelieves he could have been impartial in the matter since judges often \nhave personal opinions on policy questions but are expected to put them \naside. It seems to me, however, that given that Judge Paez went out of \nhis way as a judge to say what he did, it would be perfectly reasonable \nfor the people of California not to trust his impartiality and that a \nrecusal pledge with respect to cases involving these initiatives was a \nbare minimum indicator of the sincerity of his expressions of regret.\n  Despite the central role that the initiative process has played in \nCalifornia in correcting judicial excesses, I have supported two prior \nnominees. One was a nominee to a California district court seat who had \nwritten a piece criticizing the initiative process itself. The other \nwas a nominee to the Circuit Court whose pro bono work challenging a \nWashington initiative even before it had been placed on the ballot I \nalluded to earlier. These activities raised some questions about \nwhether either of these nominees should be confirmed for judicial \npositions where they would of necessity be passing on the validity of \ninitiatives. In each instance, the nominee's explanations persuaded me \nthat they should be given the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, in \nJudge Paez's case, I find myself unable to do so, and accordingly I \nhave serious objections to his elevation to the Ninth Circuit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2873-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2874-S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on February 25, the Supreme Court \nissued an opinion invalidating the National Credit Union \nAdministration's (NCUA) multiple group policy. I am concerned that the \nCourt's ruling may require some current credit union members to divest \ntheir credit union membership. Let me explain.\n  Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 provides that \n``federal credit union membership shall be limited to groups having a \ncommon bond of occupation or to groups within a well-defined \nneighborhood, community or rural district.'' Accordingly, prior to \n1982, federal credit unions were chartered to serve a single group \naffiliated by either occupation, association, or residency in a well-\ndefined community.\n  In 1982, however, the NCUA altered its interpretation of section 109 \nto allow federal credit unions to comprise not just one, but multiple \noccupational groups. For example, a credit union formed by and serving \nthe employees of a clothing store, could also, pursuant to the NCUA's \n1982 interpretation, serve the employees of a grocery store or a \npharmaceutical company. In 1990, a group of North Carolina Banks, as \nwell as the American Bankers Association filed suit against the NCUA \narguing that the NCUA interpretation was contrary to the Federal Credit \nUnion Act. The Supreme Court recently issued an opinion in which they \nfound on behalf of the five North Carolina banks and the American \nBankers Association.\n  I think it is important to ensure, however, that no current credit \nunion member be forced to give up their membership if they are \nmultiple-group credit union members. I know that my friend and \ncolleague Senator Kerry is also concerned about this issue.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer and I share her \nconcern that the Supreme Court ruling could require some credit unions \nto remove some individuals from credit union membership. The credit \nunions operated in good faith when they extended membership to members \nof unrelated groups. However, the Supreme Court found that such actions \nhave gone beyond the bounds of the Federal Credit Union Act.\n  The U.S. District Court, to which the Supreme Court returned the \ncase, can choose from a number of alternatives to provide the required \nrelief in National Credit Union Administration v. First National Bank & \nTrust et al.  The Court could choose to expel current credit union \nmembers who are not affiliated with the original occupational group, \ngrandfather all current members of credit unions but prevent credit \nunions from adding any new members who are not affiliated with the \noriginal group or allow credit unions to add new members from any \nemployer groups represented by current credit union members but \npreclude adding members from other unrelated occupation groups.\n  I believe the members of all current multiple-group credit unions \nshould be allowed to continue in the credit unions they have chosen. \nDislocating approximately 10 million credit union members not \naffiliated with their credit union's original occupation group could \npotentially have serious effects on the safety and soundness of the \ncredit unions in Massachusetts and across the nation. It would also \nlimit the credit and financial services options for millions of working \nfamilies who have come to depend on their credit unions.\n  I am not prejudging precisely how the Congress should legislate a \nfinal resolution of this matter. It deserves careful consideration by \nSenators and Representatives. But, I believe strongly that until that \nresolution is determined and enacted into law, it would be a grave \nmistake for the Court to force existing credit union members out of the \naffiliation with their credit unions. Such a step would be counter to \nthe public interest.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would add that the American Bankers Association, to its \ncredit, has said that, despite the Court's ruling, it has no intention \nof trying to force credit union members who currently belong to \nmultiple-employer group credit unions to divest their membership. I am \nhopeful, therefore, that Judge Jackson will allow all current credit \nunion members to remain with their respective credit unions.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree with my good friend and also applaud the American \nBankers Association decision not to seek action to force dropping \ncredit union members from credit union rolls. All working families in \nthe United States, whether they live in urban or rural areas, deserve \naccess to fairly priced credit and other financial services. Credit \nunions serve as a way for people of average means, without easy access \nto affordable credit, to pool their savings in order to make credit \navailable to themselves and their fellow credit union members at \ncompetitive interest rates. In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for \nexample, there are more than 300 credit unions serving approximately \n1.7 million people. These credit unions have helped launch and sustain \nsmall businesses. Some of them have played a key role in the \ndevelopment and revitalization of economically distressed communities. \nIn dozens of ways, credit unions have proven themselves to be a vital \ncomponent of our financial services industry. We must not take \nprecipitous action that could result in grave damage to this portion of \nthe industry. That is especially important until the Congress can pass \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I could not agree more. In my home state of California, \nthere are 500 federal credit unions and more than 5 million credit \nunion members. So credit unions have been an extremely valuable \nresource to millions of residents of my state as well.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think it is important to put into some \ncontext the multiple-group charters that the NCUA began approving in \n1982. Beginning in 1982, as a result of the economic conditions of the \ntime--the downsizing of companies, the closing of plants, and slumping \nU.S. industries--the stability and viability of a number of individual \ncredit unions was threatened. Simultaneously, we started seeing the \nbeginnings of an upsurge in the number of\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\nsmall businesses. Those small businesses wanted access to credit union \nservices, even though many did not meet the 500 employee threshold for \na charter.\n  Thus, multiple group charters became a means of ensuring that those \nsmall businesses, as well as low-income consumers lacking access to \nmore traditional financial services, were able to access the services \nof credit unions. I believe that these groups should to continue to \nhave access to credit union services, whether through individual or \nmultiple group charters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2874-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRANSFORMATION IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Medical schools and teaching \nhospitals, the training ground for our nations' healthcare personnel \nand the centers for world class cutting-edge medical innovation, are \nfacing significant challenges as new efforts of cost containment force \nradical transformation in the healthcare market. There has been a \nsteady decrease in the pharmaceutical R performed at medical schools \nand teaching hospitals. A study by three pharmaceuticals companies \nrevealed that while pharmaceutical R is larger dollarwise than NIH, \nthe university-based portion of clinical trials fell from 82% in 1989 \nto 68% in 1993.\n  Given this fact, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of The \nMedical Innovation Tax Credit introduced by Senator D'Amato. This bill \nwould give a tax credit of up to 20% on qualified research expenses to \nfirms that conduct and expand their biopharmaceutical research \nactivities at medical schools and teaching hospitals.\n  In my home state of Texas, medical technology is poised to become a \nhigh-tech boom industry. Texas is currently home to more than 500 \nmedical technology companies with $5 billion in annual sales, according \nto a new report released by the Austin-based Texas Healthcare and \nBioscience Institute. Medical technology companies currently employ \nabout 38,000 people, making it a medium-sized manufacturing industry \ncomparable to the state's paper, lumber and aircraft industries.\n  Texas' growing presence in medical technology is firmly rooted in the \nstate's universities and health-related research institutes. Academic \nhealth centers such as The University of Texas Southwestern Medical \nCenter at Dallas, Baylor College of Medicine and MD Anderson Cancer \nCenter in Houston, and the University of North Texas Health Science \nCenter in Fort Worth position Texas as a world leader in biomedical \nresearch.\n  By stimulating more private-sector research at these institutions, \nthe Medical Innovation tax Credit will help ensure America's continued \npreeminence in bio pharmaceutical research; provide needed resources \nfor medical schools and teaching hospitals; and encourage more clinical \ntrials to be conducted in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator D'Amato and \nmembers of the Finance Committee to create an environment that will \nenable medical technology to grow and create jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2875-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT JOHN BADEEN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

EDWARD J. PISZEK\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nconstituent who has distinguished himself at home and abroad. This \nweek, Edward J. Piszek will be honored in Philadelphia for receiving \none of the Republic of Poland's highest civilian honors.\n  On March 16, 1998, President Aleksander Kwasniewski bestowed the \n``Polonia Restituta,'' or the ``Commander's Cross with a White Star'' \nupon Mr. Piszek. This medal is presented for extraordinary service to \nthe nation of Poland. Recipients of the Polonia Restituta are \ncelebrated for their achievements in government and public activities, \nfor contributions to promote Poland's independence, or for advancing \nPolish culture in the areas of education, literature and the arts.\n  The son of Polish immigrants, Ed exemplified his parents' strong work \nethic. It was a lesson well learned. In 1946, with $350 and the help of \na close friend, Ed founded Mrs. Paul's Kitchens, Inc. Under his \ndirection, the company became one of America's largest producers of \nprepared frozen seafood and vegetables.\n  Ed began his philanthropic work in Poland during the 1960s. After \nwitnessing the tremendous suffering caused by the high incidence of \ntuberculosis, he donated an ambulance to the hospital in Tarnow in \nmemory of his parents. Later, he would provide 11 mobile x-ray units \nand 42 support vehicles to transport technicians.\n  Mr. Piszek's commitment to the Polish people did not end with those \ninitial acts of kindness. When the country suffered from food shortages \nin the early 1980s, he donated 10 million pounds of fishcakes. After \nthe nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, Ed participated in an airlift of \npowdered milk and food to those who were affected in Poland. Mr. Piszek \nhas also worked to help the Polish people elevate their culture. He and \nauthor James A. Michener established a Young Polish Writer's workshop. \nSimilarly, Ed supported the ``United States Peace Corps Partners in \nTeaching English'' which has already trained 25,000 new English \nteachers in Poland.\n  On the home front, Ed has worked to elevate the image of Polish \nAmericans. He purchased the home of General Thaddeus Kosciuszko--a \nPolish engineer who came to fight in the American Revolution and then \nlater designed West Point--and donated the property to the National \nPark Service. In 1972, he founded the Copernicus Society of America. \nThis private non-profit foundation strives to promote and encourage \nartistic, scientific, and historical activities throughout the world.\n  In countless many ways, Ed Piszek has helped build a cultural bridge \nbetween the U.S. and Poland. For instance, he hosted a visit from Lech \nWalesa at the Copernicus Society's headquarters in Fort Washington, PA. \nHe was instrumental in making arrangements for ABC News to go ``behind \nthe walls'' of the Vatican and film John Paul II in his work day and \nprivate moments. The end result was The Pope and His Vatican, an ABC \nNews Special which aired Easter Night, 1983. Another of Ed's noteworthy \nachievements was coordinating with the Copernicus Society and Penn \nState University to hold Agricultural Economic Development Summits in \nthe Pzeszow Province of Poland. These one-week seminars allow \nagricultural experts from Poland and Penn State to share their \nknowledge and their expertise with neighboring countries. Finally, Mr. \nPiszek is working to promote the national pastime in Poland. A board \nmember of the Little League Baseball Foundation in Williamsport, PA, Ed \nis deeply involved in developing the Little League Baseball European \nTraining Center in Kutno, Poland. He hopes that baseball will teach \nchildren of all nations the concepts of teamwork, leadership, and \ncharacter. All things considered, Edward Piszek was an obvious choice \nto accompany President Clinton to Warsaw in support of NATO membership \nfor Poland.\n  Mr. President, one man can truly make a difference. Mr. Piszek's work \nhas touched thousands of lives. As he is\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\nhonored at the Kosciuszko House on April 2, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to \nEdward J. Piszek and his family. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2875-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE MINNESOTA TORNADOS\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few \nminutes about the violent storms of this past weekend in south-central \nMinnesota and to express my concern for the many, many victims of this \ntragedy. Tornados and severe thunderstorms ripped through Minnesota \nSunday evening, tearing through St. Peter, Hanska, and Lonsdale and \nforcing the evacuation of the small town of Comfrey.\n  In the wake of the devastation, my thoughts and prayers go out to the \npeople of south-central Minnesota. I would especially like to express \nmy condolences to the families of Dustin Schneider, the young boy whose \nlife was taken by the storm near St. Peter, and Louis Mosenden of \nHanska, who died Monday as a result of injuries he suffered when a \ntornado hit his home. Our thoughts and prayers are with their loves \nones.\n  Mr. President, along a 60-mile path, hundreds of houses, factories, \nbarns, silos, churches, and schools have been reduced to rubble. Most \nof the buildings in St. Peter were either destroyed or severely \ndamaged. The smaller community of Comfrey was almost completely \ndestroyed. Power is still out in both towns.\n  In all, more than 700 houses and apartments were destroyed or damaged \nto the point that they are now uninhabitable. Another 1,800 have \nsustained severe damage. Thousands of residents have been forced to go \nseek public shelters or the homes of friends or relatives. More than \n100 businesses have been damaged in the area.\n  Even with the massive damage, the initial response to this disaster \nby the State of Minnesota, the Minnesota National Guard, Minnesota \nrelief agencies, and local law enforcement has been swift and \nefficient. Because of this quick response, and the cooperation we are \nseeing between state, local, and federal officials, I am confident \nsouth-central Minnesota will recover from this natural disaster. I \nintend to survey the area this weekend, after state and local officials \nhave completed their damage assessments. My staff is already on the \nscene, and is meeting today with representatives of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency in St. Peter as they inspect the damage.\n  Since first receiving word of the storms, I have been working closely \nwith state and local officials to bring federal assistance to the \nregion and begin the recovery efforts. I want to assure my constituents \nthat the federal government will do whatever is needed to help the \npeople of our state cope with the devastation. Minnesota Governor Arne \nCarlson today forwarded to President Clinton his formal request for a \ndisaster declaration, and I have written to the President as well to \nreiterate the urgency of Governor Carlson's request.\n  Mr. President, the people of Minnesota have faced disaster before. It \nwas almost one year ago when the terrible spring floods swept through \nwestern Minnesota and devastated so many lives. We learned a lot about \neach other during the difficult months that followed, when it seemed \nthe clean-up would never end and life would never be the same again. We \nwere reminded what it means to be a community, and how communities come \ntogether during troubled times.\n  With that experience fresh in mind, I know that Minnesotans will once \nstep forward and help one another rebuild from this weekend's tornados. \nAnd I want the victims of this latest disaster to know that they will \nnot be forgotten. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2876-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY HIGDON--41 YEARS OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nextraordinary career of Mr. Anthony Higdon, who retired last month \nafter 41 years of service to his country and the people of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky as a member of the U.S. Air Force and as an \nemployee of the Social Security Administration .\n  After four years in the Air Force, Mr. Higdon spent the last 37 years \nworking for the Social Security Administration, serving the needs of \nKentucky's senior citizens. His career included 20 years as manager of \nthe 3 Social Security offices in Louisville. Before that, he served in \nother capacities in the Louisville offices, as well as at the Social \nSecurity branches in Elizabethtown, Hazard and Hopkinsville, Kentucky.\n  One of Mr. Higdon's most important legacy will be his tireless work \nwith national and community leaders in Kentucky to impress upon them an \nunderstanding of the dramatic importance of Social Security programs to \nall people throughout their lives.\n  Mr. President, Anthony Higdon will be sorely missed by all his \nfriends and colleagues at the Social Security Administration offices \nacross the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As he retires to the community \nwhich he has spent most of his life serving, we wish him best of luck \nand thank him for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2876-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BRIDGEPORT CHARTER TOWNSHIP SESQUICENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Knights of \nColumbus and join them in the celebration of 116 years of carrying out \ntheir mission of ``Unity, Service, and Patriotism.'' In the fall of \n1881, a group of men, under the direction of Father Michael J. \nMcGivney, met at St. Mary's Church in New Haven, Connecticut, for the \npurpose of establishing a fraternal benefit society within the Catholic \nChurch. That small meeting was the genesis for a movement which now \nclaims nearly 1.6 million members (4.5 million including family \nmembers) in countries throughout the Western Hemisphere and the \nPacific.\n  After being granted legal corporation on March 29, 1882, the Knights \nof Columbus began spreading their message of pride in faith and nation. \nIndeed, the very name Knights of Columbus was chosen to reflect this \npremise, as it signifies the importance of Christopher Columbus' \ndiscovery of America to the Catholic Church.\n  In times of national crisis, the Knights of Columbus have \nconsistently heeded the call for service and sacrifice. This was \nperhaps best exemplified during two of the most pivotal events in our \nNation's history which occurred this century: World War I and World War \nII. During these trying times, the Knights of Columbus offered an array \nof support programs for the men and women of our armed forces, \nincluding bond drives and blood donor programs.\n  In addition, at the conclusion of World War II and the onset of the \nCold War, the Knights of Columbus aided in the crusade against \nCommunist expansion by sponsoring 1,300 educational discussion groups, \nas well as speakers' bureaus, advertisements and radio addresses. The \nKnights of Columbus' efforts during the Cold War were acknowledged by \nPresident Harry S. Truman.\n  While those accomplishments are indeed admirable, equally impressive \nare the often unsung works undertaken by individual Knights of Columbus \nCouncils each day. In 1996, Knights of Columbus members reported \n48,966,132 hours of volunteer service and donated $105,976,102 to \ncharity.\n  Currently, 229 Knights of Columbus Councils serve parishes and \ncommunities throughout my home state of Minnesota. The services \nundertaken by each Council cover many areas and aid\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\na number of different charities and causes, ranging from providing \nloans for college students to assisting the sick and the elderly in \ngetting to Sunday Mass.\n  Other examples of service activities in Minnesota include: a fund \ndrive in support of the construction of Catholic schools conducted by \nCouncil 7604 in Eagan, Minnesota; the bowling team from Council 961 in \nSt. Cloud, Minnesota, which raised over $6,000 for Big Brothers-Big \nSisters; and the sponsoring of youth hockey by Council 3166 in Detroit \nLakes, Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to report that the ``World's Largest \nCatholic Family Fraternal Organization'' has a commanding presence in \nMinnesota and will continue to provide communities with an excellent \nexample of how to live a fulfilling life of maximum service to God and \ncountry. I am honored to have this opportunity to acknowledge and thank \nthe Knights of Columbus for all their work, and offer my sincerest \ncongratulations on the 116th anniversary of their founding. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2876-4", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO THE KENTUCKY WILDCATS: 1998 NCAA NATIONAL BASKETBALL \n                               CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 50 years ago this month, the \nUniversity of Kentucky accomplished a feat still unmatched in college \nbasketball history. As every backyard all-star in the Commonwealth can \ntell you, that was the year of the original Fabulous Five.\n  You see in Kentucky, we have a habit of naming our most special \nWildcat teams, and 1948 may have been the most special of the bunch. \nThat group, led by Alex Groza, Ralph Beard and Wah Wah Jones not only \nearned Kentucky's first NCAA men's college basketball championship \ntrophy but went on to bring home a gold medal from the 1948 Olympics.\n  Flash forward Fifty years into the future, to see another edition of \nthe Wildcats, and equally high expectations. Led by seniors Jeff \nSheppard, Allen Edwards, and Cameron Mills, the 1998 Cats came into the \nseason facing an uncertain future. While expectations are always high \nat Kentucky, this year's squad exceeded even the most optimistic fan's \nhopes.\n  Under the expert leadership of first-year head coach, Tubby Smith, \nthese Wildcats will be raising the school's 7th NCAA championship \nbanner to the rafters of Rupp Arena. But Mr. President, there is so \nmuch more to this story than wins and losses.\n  While the '48 team was appropriately known as the Fab Five, this \nyear's national champions will go down in Wildcat history as maybe the \nmost perfect embodiment of the word ``team'' in Kentucky's legacy of \nexcellence. Time after time when the odds seemed insurmountable this \nteam willed itself to victory.\n  A quick review of the final three games of this year's tournament \nreveals the heart of a lion. Down 17 points with less than 10 minutes \nto play against a Duke squad that had been ranked #1 for most of the \nyear, the Comeback Cats put together a frenzied charge, outscoring the \nBlue Devils 17 - 1 during a crucial stretch. What made the feat all the \nmore impressive was that every player contributed.\n  In the Final Four, the Cats squared off against the Stanford \nCardinal, the West Coast power that spent the majority of the season \nundefeated. Down by 5 at half, the Cats did what was natural for them, \nthey put together a rally, eventually winning the contest in overtime. \nThis victory was fueled by one of the most gritty performances in Final \nFour history, as senior Jeff Sheppard poured in 27 of the Cats 74 \npoints.\n  What could top this effort in the finals? How about the greatest \ncome-from-behind victory in the history of the NCAA championship. Down \n10 at the half, and 12 early in the second half, this selfless group of \nyoung men redoubled their efforts and chipped away at the Utah lead. \nSteadily the tide began to shift behind three point baskets from \nHeshimu Evans, and Kentucky natives Cameron Mills and Scott Padgett. \nRefusing to wilt under the pressure of facing the hottest team in the \nnation, Kentucky hammered away defensively and converted on the \noffensive end. In the end, Utah's game effort was not enough and the \nCats posted a 78 - 69 victory in seizing their second national title in \nthree years.\n  In what has become habit for the Comeback Cats, the team drew on its \nstrengths and refused to panic. Under the masterful eye of Coach Smith \nand the intelligent play of a host of stars, the team accomplished its \ndream of bringing home the title.\n  So, Mr. President, while we look back fondly on the Fabulous Five of \n1948, I am content to take senior Jeff Sheppard's advice to \n``appreciate the precious present,'' and embrace these Comeback Cats as \nthe greatest ``team'' to ever put on the Kentucky uniform. It is \nimpossible to appreciate the intensity and effort these young men put \nforth as they met and exceeded every challenge in their path during the \n1997-98 season.\n  Mr. President, I ask each of my colleagues to join me in honoring the \nUniversity of Kentucky, history-making coach Tubby Smith, athletic \ndirector C. M. Newton, and most importantly each and every talented \nplayer on the 1998 Championship Wildcat team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2877-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING MORTANA MCCORMICK\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to you \non behalf of the citizens of West Virginia. The West Virginia \nDepartment of Culture and History has named 1998 ``The Year of the \nQuilt.'' In the Appalachian Mountain region, and particularly in the \ngreat state of West Virginia, the tradition of native crafting, \nincluding quilting, has thrived uninterrupted for over two hundred \nyears.\n  In 1968, my wife, Sharon, along with a group of community-minded West \nVirginians assisted a talented group of quilters to form Mountain \nArtisans, a nonprofit group comprised of gifted quilt makers, to help \nin the preservation and exposure of this artful tradition of design and \ntalent. Many West Virginians considered quilting a part of the mountain \nstate's heritage. My wife and I are particularly fond of the Mountain \nArtisans. When we were expecting our first child, in the late 1960's, \nthe group graciously decided to create a quilt for our first-born. With \nthe assistance of the Sod Sewing Group from Sod, West Virginia, the \nquilt was completed in mid-September of 1970. The beautiful quilt, \nwhich is known as ``The Rockefeller Quilt'' was displayed at the \nRockefeller home and today, adorns the wall just outside my office in \nthe Hart Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C.\n  One master quilter I especially admire is Mortana McCormick of Sod, \nWest Virginia, who contributed to the creation of The Rockefeller \nQuilt. Ms. McCormick, a distinguished quilter, has represented the \nState well and helped put our state on the ``interior design and \nfashion'' map. She has contributed to fashion patchwork designs for \nBarbra Streisand and museum collections displayed in West Virginia and \ninternationally. Mortana McCormick is just one of the talented artisan-\nquilters that call West Virginia home. I ask my distinguished \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing this long standing tradition and \nart, and its many talented artists, including Ms. Mortana \nMcCormick.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2877-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2877-S2878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay \ntribute to a truly outstanding University in my home State of Missouri, \nLincoln University. Lincoln has played a large role in African American \neducation in my home State of Missouri, as well as across the nation.\n  Lincoln was founded in 1866 by the Caucasian officers and the African \nAmerican enlisted men of the 62nd and 65th United States Colored \nInfantries who fought for the Union during the Civil War. These men \nwanted to establish a school that would devote itself to educating \nfreed African Americans. By soliciting funds and donating their own \nsalaries, they raised $6,000 within a few days. With these funds, the \nsoldiers were able to open the doors of Lincoln Institute on September \n17, 1866. In 1869, Lincoln began to receive $5,000 in aid from the \nState of Missouri for teacher training. By 1940, Lincoln Institute had \nbecome Lincoln University and had evolved from a teacher training \nschool to a full University offering Graduate instruction. In each of \nthe decades Lincoln has continually added programs, expanded its \nfacilities and opened its\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\ndoors to all applicants that meet its entrance criteria.\n  This past year the University has come under the new leadership of \nDr. David Henson. Dr. Henson became the seventeenth President of \nLincoln on July 2, 1997. I am excited about continuing my close \nrelationship with this outstanding University by working with Dr. \nHenson. He has held many leadership positions during his 25 years of \nhigher education and I know he will continue to strengthen the \nUniversity's already impeccable reputation.\n  It is an honor for the entire State of Missouri to have a University \nlike Lincoln, whose service and character-building programs, along with \nthe new guidance of Dr. Henson, will continue down the road of success. \nI commend Lincoln's President, Dr. David Henson, for his commitment to \nexcellence and hope for continued prosperity in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2877-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    1998 DETROIT TIGERS OPENING DAY\n\n   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to send my best \nwishes to the Detroit Tigers for a successful 1998 season. This \nafternoon, on opening day, the Tigers will take the field for their \n97th year of play. Their opponents, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, will be \ntaking the field for their first regular season game ever.\n  I'm sure my colleagues from Florida are confident the Devil Rays are \na fine team who will fare well in today's contest. However, I would \nlike to remind them the Devil Rays are facing one of the most storied \nand successful franchises in major league baseball history. The Tigers \nwill be playing for their 7,623rd American League win while the Devil \nRays will be going for number one.\n  The history of Tigers' baseball in Detroit is replete with the names \nof current and future Hall of Famers like Ty Cobb, Charlie Gehringer, \nHank Greenberg, Hal Newhouser, George Kell, Al Kaline, Alan Trammell, \nLou Whitaker, Kirk Gibson, Sparky Anderson, and so forth. The Tigers \nhave won sport's most cherished prize, the World Series, four times, \nhaving savored victory in the Fall Classic in 1935, 1945, 1968 and \n1984.\n  I am hopeful the 1998 season will see the Tigers among the ranks of \nthe major league's elite teams where they belong. I, for one, will \ncertainly be watching the next 162 games with interest, hoping to see \nthe Detroit Tigers finish the season as champions of their new \ndivision, the American League Central, and from there go on to capture \nthe pennant and the World Series as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/31/senate-section/article/S2878-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S. 71\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
