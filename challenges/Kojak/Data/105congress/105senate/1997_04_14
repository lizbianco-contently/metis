Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until the hour of 12 noon to accommodate a number of \nSenators who have requested time to speak. By consent, at 12 noon the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 104, the Nuclear Policy Act. And \nby previous consent, all remaining amendments that are in order to the \nbill must be offered and debated today. As previously announced, no \nrollcall votes will occur during today's session. Any votes ordered on \nthe amendments will be stacked, and the votes will occur at 9 a.m. on \nTuesday. I emphasize that for all Senators' information. The votes will \nbegin at 9 a.m., and there will be a minimum I guess of three votes--\nprobably three votes at that hour. Therefore, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 104 at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, and Senators can expect \nto begin voting at that time.\n  Senators can expect rollcall votes on Tuesday morning, and then \nfollowing the disposition of this bill the Senate may turn to the \nAlexis Herman nomination to be the head of the Department of Labor, or \nlegislation dealing with the chemical weapons ban.\n  Now, as it stands at this time we probably will not vote on the \nAlexis Herman nomination until Wednesday. We hope to get an agreement, \nor if we do not get an agreement our intent is to proceed, if we can, \nto S. 495, the Kyl-Helms and others bill, on Thursday relating to the \nchemical weapons issue. This is the bill. This is not the convention. \nAnd I would expect that that would take up most of the time on \nThursday.\n\n  As always, we will notify Senators of the schedule and when \nanticipated votes will occur.\n  Again I would like to thank Senators on both sides of the aisle and \nboth sides of the issue for their cooperation on the Nuclear Policy \nAct. I think we are doing the right thing by getting this legislation \ncompleted without undue delay, and voting on it so that the House can \nact. And I understand they do plan to act on this legislation within \nthe next 30 days. We hope to get it to the President and hope for his \nsignature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3067-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3067-S3068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TAXES AND ABUSES AT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, also, I want to remind Senators again that \nthe American people are watching and waiting to see what we have to \nsay, in fact, about what we are going to do about taxes in this \ncountry. Tomorrow is the day that we all have to pay the taxes we owe. \nAnd the feeling I had gotten when I was home is that people are very \nupset with the tax burden, both the size of it, how much is taken from \nthem in taxes, the variety of ways that it is taken from them, the \nunfairness in what we take away from families with children that could \ndo more for and want to do more for their children. Also it discourages \nsavings and investments in the economy. And we even tax death. It is \ntime for us to do something about it. And this is the week to do it.\n  We will have a number of comments and some votes tomorrow, in fact, \non abuses at the Internal Revenue Service. When you have a computer \nsystem that has had millions of bucks spent on it that does not work, \nyou have to ask, you know, how long can this go on, because we have \nprovided millions of dollars. And also when you see that people are \nbeing fired for snooping through taxpayers' files, that is absolutely \nan unacceptable practice.\n  So we need to stop the abuses. Then we need to give some tax relief. \nAnd then we need to reform the entire system. At a very minimum, this \nyear we should give working people of this country some tax relief. And \nit is my hope we will be able to do that.\n  We are going to be working with the administration, with the White \nHouse specifically, this week to see if we can come to an agreement on \nthe tax cuts that we will have in our budget for this year. I hope we \ncan reach an agreement. If we cannot, we will just have to proceed to a \nprocess that would allow us to get to a vote on this important issue \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, I see no Senator seeking recognition at this time. I \ndo believe that a couple Senators are on the way. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, just for the information of my colleague, \nSenator Breaux is here. I have 20 minutes allocated. I will not take 20 \nminutes. I hope to be closer to 10 minutes. So the Senator from \nLouisiana will have an opportunity as well.\n  Mr. President, I have just returned from another trip to my home \nState of North Dakota to see firsthand the developing slow-motion \ndisaster that is occurring there. I call it a slow-motion disaster, Mr. \nPresident, because it is not one of those things that happens and then \nis over with. We have a slow-motion disaster. We have had the worst \nwinter on record in North Dakota. Then we were hit at the end by the \nmost powerful winter storm in 50 years, on top of the greatest flood \nthreat in 150 years.\n  Mr. President, you can imagine, people of my State are beginning to \nwonder what happened, what could have led to a series of events as \nextreme as these. I don't think anyone has the answer at this point. We \nare truly coping with an unprecedented series of disasters. We have \njust had a visit from the Vice President of the United States, Vice \nPresident Gore, the Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater, and the \nhead of FEMA, James Lee Witt, all in the State of North Dakota last \nThursday and Friday. We deeply appreciated the Federal response. We got \na Presidentially declared major disaster and we got it in very short \norder. We have also received unprecedented assistance from the Corps of \nEngineers, in terms of advanced measures, to hold down the catastrophe \nthat could have occurred without the really heroic efforts by the Corps \nof Engineers, by FEMA, and by local agencies, local leadership and, of \ncourse, the extraordinary efforts of volunteers.\n  We had people go 300 miles, from western North Dakota to eastern \nNorth Dakota, to help sandbag because they knew we were faced with an \nimminent disaster in eastern North Dakota. My own cousin, a professor \nat the University of Wisconsin, heard that Fargo, ND, was about to \nflood and they needed sandbaggers. He drove all night from Madison and \narrived at 3 in the morning and sandbagged from the time he got there \nall day and into the next evening. That is the kind of attitude North \nDakota has brought to this disaster.\n  I tell you, out of all this, the thing I am most proud of is the \nresponse of the people of our State, which has truly been \nextraordinary. Not only have all of the Federal agencies and State \nagencies pulled together, along with the volunteers, literally \nthousands of them across the State that helped out, but we also want to \nthank the Red Cross for their outstanding assistance across North \nDakota. We should also thank all of the other agencies. The mental \nhealth hotline tells me they are taking a dramatically increased level \nof calls.\n  I have been asked, ``What did you see out there, Senator Conrad?'' \nThis picture shows the power lines that are down. You can see that \npower pole after power pole snapped. They went down like tinker toys. \nWe had this massive ice storm, after we already had 100 inches of snow \nin North Dakota, the heaviest snowfall we have ever experienced. Then \nwe get this storm that dumped another 2 feet in parts of North Dakota. \nIt was combined with ice. Ice formed on the lines, and there were 70-\nmile-an-hour winds that came through. Those winds just took down these \nstructures all across North Dakota. Over 4,000 power poles were taken \ndown.\n  Mr. President, it didn't end there. This is a picture of one of the \nmost stunning events that occurred during this disaster. This is one of \nthe largest structures in North America. This is a 2,000-foot \ntelevision tower for KXJB television; it all went down, all 2,000 feet. \nYou can see that this structure is laid out just as if somebody came \nand knocked it over and laid it out perfectly across the snow. That, of \ncourse, took a lot of television stations and radio stations off the \nair in the midst of this crisis. So not only did you have horrible \nweather, you also had a communications problem.\n  Mr. President, this picture shows a farmer on his tractor. As you can \nsee, these are his silos in the back. His tractor is up to its wheel \nrims in water. He is just getting across the farm trying to move into a \nposition to rescue grain that would otherwise be destroyed by the \nrising flood waters.\n  Mr. President, we have another chart that tells the extent of this \ndisaster. We had 80,000 homes without power. From a week ago Saturday, \non into the week, many homes were not restored until last Friday. This \nis in the midst of zero temperatures with 40-degree-below-zero wind \nchill factors, people without heat--80,000 people without power. There \nwere over 600 people at emergency shelters, and that is as of Friday. \nMany more than that were in shelters during the peak. And 4,000 power \npoles were destroyed. Over 9\\1/2\\ feet of snow fell since November. \nThat really is an extraordinary set of circumstances, with not only the \nmost snowfall we have ever experienced, but they had the most powerful \nwinter storm in 50 years on top of the greatest flood threat in 150 \nyears.\n  The Red River to the north--I hear some of the national news media \ntalking about it as though it flows south. Of course, anyone that knows \ngeography knows the Red River flows north. The Red River has exceeded \nthe highest flood levels ever in four different locations. In the \nnorthern part of the State, it is still rising. We have had the crest \nin the southern part of the State, although we expect the second crest \nto come later when this snow that has just fallen melts. Nonetheless, \nthe peak crest has now hit the southern part of the State and is moving \nnorth. In the north, the river is still rising.\n  The livestock losses were running 60 percent above normal before this \nlatest storm hit. Because of the very severe weather conditions we have \nhad, we have had tens of thousands of cattle killed across the State of \nNorth Dakota. In fact, this shows losses of more than 70,000. As of \nthis morning, I have been notified that cattle losses, they now \nbelieve, are running well over 100,000 in the State of North Dakota. \nThe occupant of the chair, who is from the neighboring State of \nWyoming, understands what cattle losses mean in a State like ours. I \nthink even the occupant of the chair would find it hard to fully \nappreciate the loss of 100,000 head. That is a tremendous economic blow \nto the State of North Dakota. As the occupant of the Chair knows well, \nwe have been hurt by very low cattle prices as it is, and that industry \nis certainly struggling. To have piled on top a 100,000 loss of cattle \nacross the State--in fact, they tell us 112,000 head is perhaps the \nbest estimate. But that is an enormous economic blow to the State of \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I have come here this morning in order to share these \ncircumstances with my colleagues so that they can appreciate and \nunderstand what is happening across the State. I can tell you that \nresilient North Dakotans continue to battle their disaster. In many \nplaces it is an uphill battle. But North Dakota has a can do attitude, \nand--as I saw in town after town as I traveled across the State on \nThursday and Friday, the people are recovering. They understand what is \nat stake.\n  Mr. President, we very much appreciate the Federal assistance that \nthe\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nPresident has called for with his disaster declaration.\n  Again, we want to thank the North Dakota National Guard, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Let \nme just say that the Corps of Engineers is being praised from one end \nof the State to the other by local officials who are saying this was \nthe best prepared they have ever been for flooding disaster. That is a \ngood thing because this is the worst flooding that we have seen in the \nhistory of North Dakota.\n  I also again would like to thank the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, \nthe church organizations, and volunteer organizations that have pitched \nin. The response, as one of the disaster coordinators told me, has just \nbeen superb. It has been everything you could possibly ask for.\n  So we extend our appreciation to all of those who pitched in.\n  I also want to conclude by saying that I very much appreciate what my \ncolleagues have told me--that they will stand up and be supportive \nduring this time of need. We certainly have attempted to do that when \nthey were in a disaster situation. And I very much appreciate the words \nof support that we have received from literally dozens of our \ncolleagues.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes under the time \nallocated to the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me commend Kent Conrad for his good \nremarks on the situation in his State and in that part of the country, \nand also my part of the country. There is no doubt about it because as \nthe snow begins to melt eventually it finds its way down the \nMississippi River and causes problems for us. We sympathize with what \nis going on in his area, and certainly we are willing to participate \nand help as well.\n  So I commend him for his comments on the floor of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3068-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3069-S3071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE MEDICARE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, what I want to talk to the Senate this \nmorning and our colleagues about is the situation that I think is most \nserious in this Congress. If we balance the budget this year and also \ncome up with tax cuts, I think that this Congress will still go down as \na failure if we do nothing to address the very serious Medicare crisis \nthat is facing this country. I think that we must realize that we need \nto do more than we are attempting to do at this moment.\n  There is no question that Medicare has been a wonderful program for \nthe 38 million Americans that have come under the Medicare Program for \nall of these years. It has been a success story that I think is \nunparalleled in the history of government. Before Medicare was passed \nless than half of the seniors in this country had access to quality \nhealth care. Today 99 percent of all seniors in America have quality \nhealth care under the Medicare Program. The poverty rate among seniors \nhas dropped largely, on the part of Medicare and Social Security, from \nabout 35 percent of all seniors down to about 12 percent. The United \nStates has about the ninth highest life expectancy of any nation in the \nworld. That is not that great. When you look at the life expectancy of \nseniors in this country, the United States has the highest life \nexpectancy of all citizens over the age of 65 largely due to the fact \nthey have access to quality health care under the Medicare Program. The \nproblem, however, is that Medicare is about to go broke. We have talked \nabout it. Now I think more and more people are understanding that we \nmust do something to address the problem.\n  The first chart that I have up here really is an indication of how \npart A, which is the hospital trust fund which pays for the hospital \nservices for seniors, is projected by about the year 2001 to run out of \nmoney. We are right here starting to run out of money in the trust \nfund. And the red line shows that, indeed, this is a very serious \ncrisis that we cannot allow to continue. The President's budget extends \nthe life of the fund to the year 2007. That is a short-term fix when I \nsuggest we should be looking at long-term fixes.\n  Part B, which is the program that pays for physician services, is not \nin the same situation, obviously, because it is supported by general \nrevenues although the cost of Medicare physician services has increased \nby 53 percent over the past 5 years.\n  I would like to take a look at chart No. 2 which shows the number of \npeople that are working in order to pay for the Medicare beneficiaries. \nBack in 1967 there were about 4.4 workers paying for every Medicare \nbeneficiary. Today we are looking at a ratio of about 3.9 workers in \n1995 right here. It is a dramatic drop down to the year 2030 when we \nare talking about only 2.2 American workers working to pay for one \nbeneficiary. So while it started off in a very good ratio back in 1967 \nit is dropping as more and more people become eligible for Medicare and \nfewer and fewer workers are working to pay for those services.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that payroll taxes would \nhave to be increased 25 percent a year just to extend the trust fund \nsolvency to the year 2006. I don't know of any Member of Congress that \nis recommending a 25-percent increase in the payroll taxes, or \nsomething that is simply not going to occur.\n  Chart No. 3 shows you how much money we are spending on Medicare as a \npercentage of our overall Federal budget. In 1975 it is 5 percent, more \nthan double in 1995, and with 11.3 percent of the entire Federal budget \nnow being spent on Medicare. By the year 2020 the estimation is that it \nwill be almost 25 percent; 24-plus percent of our total budget \nexpenditures. That means when you are talking about education, roads, \nhighways, infrastructure, there is not going to be a lot of money left. \nWe will be spending 25 percent of everything we take in just on \nMedicare.\n  Why is this happening? There are two reasons. No. 1 is the growth of \nbeneficiaries. There are a lot more people on Medicare. People live \nlonger. The population is aging. We are glad they are. We are glad they \nare living longer. But we have a lot more beneficiaries than we used \nto. Between now and the year 2010 the number of people on Medicare will \ngrow by about 1\\1/2\\ percent a year. After that it is going to grow to \nalmost 2.5 percent a year, which is a rate of growth that is just \nincredible and unreasonable for the cost.\n  The second reason, as I point out on the chart, is the amount of \nmoney we are spending per beneficiary. We are spending a lot more. For \na self-insured man who earned average wages he will receive Medicare \nbenefits of over $44,000 a year in his lifetime. For these benefits he \nis only going to contribute about $13,000. He is getting about $32,000 \nmore than he is putting in. We are spending a lot more per beneficiary. \nIn 1995, the average benefit is $80,000 in a lifetime. Their \ncontribution is $30,000. So we are spending a lot more money per \nbeneficiary than we used to, and it is certainly a lot more money than \nthey are contributing.\n  So we know what is happening. Unfortunately, what we are talking \nabout so far in the President's budget and in most proposals is to \ntinker around the edges. We are talking about, ``Well, let's fix \nMedicare by cutting the amount of money we give to doctors and cutting \nthe amount of money we give to hospitals.'' I suggest that that is a \nBand-Aid type of an approach which we have tried time and time again. \nWhen we get into these great arguments about cutting or increasing \nMedicare, truly we aren't fixing anything. We are just tinkering around \nthe edges. We need some fundamental reform and change. If we continue \nto just reduce the amount we give to doctors and to the hospitals \npretty soon doctors and hospitals are going to say, ``Wait a minute. I \nam not going to treat Medicare patients anymore. You are giving me less \nthan it is costing me to provide these wonderful services that are \nimportant to seniors in this country. So I quit. I am out of here.'' \nYou are seeing that happen around the country. Unfortunately, the \nproposals we have on the board so far this year are simply just the \nsame old same old--simply reducing the amount we pay doctors and \nhospitals. I think we have to do something more fundamental than that.\n  What I am suggesting is that we restructure Medicare by modeling it \non\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\nwhat we have as Senators, what we have as Members of Congress, and what \n9 million Federal employees have for their health care package of \nbenefits. I think most people believe that if Congress wrote a plan for \nthemselves it must be pretty good. They are right. It is pretty good. \nIt is much better than what seniors have under the current Medicare \nplan. I am suggesting that we take the Medicare plan and give people \nwho are on Medicare--the beneficiary--at least the option of having the \nsame benefits that their Senator or their Congressman, or the rest of \nthe Federal work force has which is the Federal employee health benefit \nplan. With our plan the Federal Government finances about 71 percent of \nthe premium cost for the plan with the participants paying the other \nremaining 29 percent. We have the option of choosing a Cadillac plan \nfor which we will pay a little bit more, or a less expensive plan that \nwe pay a little bit less for, and the Government pays a little bit \nless. But you have the flexibility. It is sort of a combination of a \ndefined contribution and benefit plan where the Federal Government says \nwe want some people to offer us some option. It has to meet a minimum \nstandard. And depending on which plan you pick determines how much you \nare going to have to pay for it.\n\n  No. 1, the plan would give seniors a greater choice of health care \nplans than they currently have. It would give them better coverage than \nthey currently have while at the same time curbing the growth in \nMedicare costs by creating what Medicare doesn't have, and that is real \ncompetition.\n  The reason Medicare is increasing at twice the rate of private \ninsurance is because there is no real competition among Medicare \nbeneficiaries and the plan that they have. In the private sector, which \nis increasing about 4 percent or less, there is competition. They \nreceive more. They pay less under Medicare. We get less and pay more.\n  So I am suggesting that a plan based on the Federal employee health \nbenefit plan would give more competition, more benefits, more \ninformation, and more choice to Medicare recipients than they have \ntoday. There would be more competition because the current Medicare \nsystem of price fixing by the Government here in Washington I think is \na disaster. We have people in Washington that work very hard to try to \nfix prices. But it is not working. The costs are going up higher than \nthe private plans and they are fixing the price. It is not working. So \nwe are the only group that has lost money on managed care.\n  Medicare now offers HMO's because it is under a price structure and \nprice fixing. We are losing money on HMO's. Everybody else who is \ntrying HMO's is saving money because there is competition. But under \nMedicare, when somebody gets in an HMO, we are still controlling the \nprice. And the Government is losing money under HMO's because of price \nfixing, and everybody else is saving a substantial amount of money.\n  So we have to change the way we are doing business, and to bring in \nmore competition. The Federal Government OPM negotiates on behalf of 9 \nmillion employees. And there is a lot of competition because they can \ngo to the market and say, ``We are going to offer you 9 million \nworkers, and we want you to bid on what health care you are going to \nprovide them. And make sure it is a minimum standard, and see who \noffers the best deal.'' We have 38 million people in the system. The \npotential for negotiating a good price is astronomically increased, and \nit makes much more sense. Right now we are relying on Medicare and \narbitrary bureaucratic price regulations and price fixing. The private \nsector, which relies on competition, more information, and more \nflexibility, is working and the prices have not gone up.\n  The second thing is we would get more benefits. When we talk to \nseniors, we say that we want to change it. But we want to give you more \nbenefits than you have right now because what you have is a 1965 model \nthat is like a Chevrolet that has never been repaired since 1965. It \nwouldn't run very well today. But we are giving them a 1965 model. It \nwas great for a long period of time. But because of the change in the \nworld it is not giving the benefits that the private sector gives other \npeople.\n  Medicare doesn't cover most outpatient prescription drugs. For \ninstance, it doesn't cover generally dental care, or have any \ncatastrophic limits on catastrophic health care and out-of-pocket \ncontributions as private plans do. In fact, Medicare's benefit package \nis less generous than about 85 percent of private insurance and private \nsector plans. I think a lot of seniors think that they have a great \nplan when in truth it is less generous than 85 percent of the private \nsector health insurance plans. It is not that good of a plan by any \nstretch of the imagination. The program covers only about 45 percent of \nthe total annual health care bill of the elderly. That is not a \nparticularly good deal by any stretch, if your health care plan is only \ncovering about 45 percent of your annual out-of-pocket expenses. That \nis what Medicare currently does with our seniors.\n  The plan would also give them more information. They do not get a lot \nof information under Medicare. They get a card. They say, go to your \ndoctor under a fee-for-service plan, but you do not get a lot of \ninformation about which doctors are the best, which hospitals are the \nbest, which services are the most efficient and do the best job. To the \ncontrary, with the Federal plan, every year they publish a guide with \ninformation on benefits and premiums.\n  We can improve upon that. We should have a report card for all these \nplans so they can see how many people were treated, their success \nratio, what the failure rate is, and how the plans are working. So we \nneed to give them more information than they currently have. Medicare \ncurrently really gives seniors zero information on the quality of the \nplans under which they operate. That is not fair to the seniors, and it \nis not helpful to the system at large.\n  Then it gives them more choice. The 9 million Federal employees \nnationwide have the benefit of looking at about 388 different health \ninsurance plans to see which one that they would like that fits their \nneeds--388 different plans that they can take a look at and say, ``This \none is better'' or ``this one.'' That is nationwide. Most of us in \nWashington look at two or three or four, maybe five different plans and \nsay, ``This one fits my family; I will take this high option,'' or ``I \nwill take the low-option or standard plan.'' It is an easy choice with \na lot of information, and, most importantly, it has information that is \nneeded to make the correct choice.\n  All of these plans under Medicare simply continue to rely on the very \ninefficient Federal price fixing as opposed to how much the market is \ncharging. We have bureaucrats who are trying to do a wonderful job. I \ndo not criticize them. But it is impossible to do what they are \nattempting to do to make sure we have a better system.\n  Mr. President and my colleagues, I will be talking more about this. \nWe are still working on the details. But I suggest we need to be \nlooking at, fundamentally, restructuring Medicare to make it a better \nprogram for the seniors than they are now getting and at a price we can \nafford. Doing nothing is not an option, because then we destroy the \nsystem that has taken care of the needs of seniors for over 30 years in \nthis country.\n  We in Congress have an obligation to fix it and to be able to help \neducate the seniors that what they have now is not a good deal, it is \nnot as good as most private plans, and we can offer them more choice \nand more benefits, better information, and do it in a way that allows \nthe marketplace to determine the price.\n  The Office of Personnel Management looks at the top six health plans \nin the country and comes up with an average price and negotiates based \non that average price. It is not Washington fixing prices but the \nmarket. When we have that large of a pool of individuals, then you can \nhave the competition that is necessary to get the price down. So what \nthe private sector is getting is a lot more choice, more benefits, and \nthe price is increasing only at about 4 percent a year or less while \nMedicare has less of everything and the price is increasing at about \n8.6 percent a year.\n  So we are going to be talking more about the details. We do not have \nall the details yet, but this is a concept that I think makes sense. My \nproposal will allow the current fee-for-service system to stay in \nplace. If they wish to keep the whole system, they would\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nhave the option to do that. But I guarantee you, as more and more \npeople understand what this plan will offer them, I think very few will \nelect to go back to a 1965 model when they have the opportunity to \nselect a 1997 model which makes sense and gives them a great many more \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks by saying we will continue to \ntalk about this, to help educate our colleagues about what we are \nattempting to do. Others have come up with this plan. We have had \ngroups like the Progressive Policy Institute that has suggested this. \nThe Brookings Institution has suggested this type of approach. The \nHeritage Foundation has suggested this type of approach. We have \nliberals, conservatives, and moderates saying we have to fundamentally \nmake some changes. This is the way to go. This is the right approach. I \nagree with them. I think as we know more about it, more and more of our \ncolleagues will agree with this approach as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

I rise to speak about taxes and will be handling the time \nthat has been set aside for Senator Coverdell, if that is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, tomorrow is tax day. I guess every one \nof us knows that. Certainly some of us are a little sleepless from \nhaving dealt with it. So it is an appropriate time to talk, I think, \nabout taxes. There are lots of things to talk about in the area of \ntaxes, of course. One of them is the tax system. Obviously, most people \nbelieve the tax system needs to be changed, needs to be made simpler, \nneeds to be made more fair. We could talk about the IRS. A lot of \npeople talk about that, particularly in April. There need to be changes \nthere, clearly. On the other hand, most believe, and I do as well, that \nif we really expect something different from the enforcement and \ncollection agency for taxes, then we have to change the tax system \nwhich they enforce.\n  But, today I wanted to take this time, along with a number of my \ncolleagues--and I appreciate very much Senator Coverdell setting aside \nthis time; I expect there will be six of us here over the next number \nof minutes--to talk about taxes, what taxes mean to us and what they \nmean to our constituents. It is an appropriate time, also, not only to \ntalk about taxes, but to talk about the agenda that we have in the \nSenate, particularly the Republican agenda with respect to taxes: What \nour plans are, what we have on our menu with regard to taxes, to \nprovide some tax relief for American families, provide an opportunity \nfor American families and American businesses to spend the money that \nthey earn themselves; to talk a little bit about the fact that, on the \naverage, American families spend almost 40 percent of their total \nincome on taxes, all kinds of taxes--Federal, State, local--40 percent. \nThat is an awful lot of our labor that is paid to the government. So, \nlet me make it clear that Republicans want tax relief, we want tax \nrelief soon, we want tax relief this year, and I am hopeful--we want \ntax relief as part of this budget that is now being prepared.\n  We hear a lot--I hear it from my constituents and I am sure my \nassociate from Wyoming hears the same thing--that families are having \ndifficulties getting ahead, families are having difficulties in \nsavings, families are having difficulties paying their bills. Part of \nthe reason is the level of taxes. So, it seems to me that it is \nnecessary for us to respond. People in my State remind me that nearly \n40 percent of their income is paid in State and local taxes, as well as \nFederal taxes. That is an awful lot of our money.\n  Surveys have indicated that Americans are willing to pay taxes, but \nthey perceive that like 25 percent would be a more acceptable and \nreasonable figure. My constituents want to know what we are doing about \ntaxes in this Congress. Frankly, there is a great deal of opposition to \ndoing very much of anything. I think, really, if you want to be serious \nabout tax relief, you have to go back to the basic issue, the really \nbasic issue. The talk about taxes and balanced budgets is more than \ntalking about arithmetic, more than talking about balancing numbers. It \nrepresents a philosophy. It represents the point of view that people \nhave with respect to Government. There are those in this body who \nbelieve--certainly in this country there are those who believe--the \nGovernment spends money better than individuals, that more and more \nmoney ought to be brought into the central Government so it can be \ndisbursed for all kinds of ideas. There is a legitimate point of view \nthat the Federal Government should be involved in almost everything \nthat is troublesome to people in this country. As a matter of fact, I \nthink one could say that has been the President's political philosophy, \nto get involved in all kinds of things, some say the kinds of things \nthat ought to be done by the city council, that ought to be done by the \nschool board. But the President has found those to be politically \nviable. So it is a philosophy.\n  Those who want more and more Government, of course need to have more \nand more taxes. I do not agree with that point of view. I think our \nefforts ought to be designed toward reducing the role of the central \nGovernment in our lives. Those things that are inherently governmental, \nand there are some, ought to be done by government at the level closest \nto people. There is a role for the Federal Government. There are things \nthe Federal Government ought to be doing. But, conversely, there are \nthings that the Federal Government should not be doing. So my point is \nthat when you talk about budgets, when you talk about tax relief, the \nresponse is always, we--you--cannot balance the budget; we cannot cut \nspending enough to have tax relief for American families.\n  I suggest that we can. We have a $1.7 trillion budget, and in that \nbudget there are many things that could be reduced. There are many \nthings that could be combined. There are many things that could be, in \nfact, eliminated. It is possible to balance the budget and have tax \nrelief. The other alternative, of course, which again is the one the \nadministration has taken over the last several years, is let us balance \nthe budget but let us do it by continuing to increase spending and \nraise taxes. The President's budget that is out before us now raises \ntaxes by $23 billion. It has some tax relief in it but that is offset \nby more tax increases.\n\n  So that is really the issue. We will talk about all kinds of details \non the floor. Details are fine. We ought to talk about them. When you \nreally peel it all away, you are talking about a philosophical \ndifference of more Government versus less Government. Frankly, I think \nit would be sort of interesting and honest if those who want more \nGovernment would simply get up and say, ``Yes, I want more Government. \nI think we ought to have more spending.'' Seldom do you hear that. \nThere are a million other reasons for it, but that is really the bottom \nline.\n  So, that is what we talk about, I think, when we talk about the \nbudget. That is what we talk about when we talk about tax relief. It is \npossible to balance the budget, reduce taxes and get tax relief at the \nsame time. The two are not mutually exclusive in a $1.7 trillion \nbudget. Can you imagine what $1.7 trillion is? There are plenty of \nexamples of waste and abuse. There are plenty of examples and \nopportunities to create a smaller, more efficient Government. For a few \nexamples, the State Department has $500 million in unneeded real \nestate. How to dispose of that? Repeal of Davis-Bacon would save $2.5 \nbillion, so contracts in the Government sector are the same as they are \nin the private sector. There are 160 employment and job training \nprograms in 15 different agencies--160. I cannot imagine that we could \nnot be more efficient than to have 160 programs aimed at the same \nthing. In fact, we could get more money to the people who need the \nmoney if we would consolidate those, in addition to spending\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\nreductions. There are 73 Federal programs aimed at gathering \nstatistics.\n  I have introduced, along with a number of my associates, what we call \nthe Freedom From Government Competition Act. It is a simple idea, an \nidea that has been policy for a very long time. It has not been \nimplemented. That is, to identify those activities within the Federal \nGovernment that are commercial in nature and also those that are \ninherently Government; and those that are commercial, put them out for \na bid in the private sector so they could be accomplished in the \nprivate sector, substantially saving dollars, some say as much as $30 \nbillion, in the private sector. That is really what we all say we want \nto do, is to strengthen the private sector and limit the size of \nGovernment. Here is an opportunity to do that. Yet the administration \ndrags its feet and says, ``Oh, we are doing all this.'' The fact is, \nthey are not. The fact is, there are lots of things that can be \ncontracted out that are commercial in nature.\n  I happen to be chairman of the Parks Subcommittee. We are entering \ninto a long-term study of strengthening the parks and seeing how we can \nprovide more resources to protect the resources there, more dollar \nresources to protect the natural resources. One of the ways is to take \nsome of those functions and put them into the private sector. So, we \nhave introduced a bill to do that.\n  There are all kinds of ways in which efficiencies can be found, in \nwhich Government can be smaller. The result of that can be a balanced \nbudget and a reduced tax burden on American families. There are two \nthat particularly come from my constituents when I am in Wyoming. One \nof them has to do with the estate tax. As you might imagine, a lot of \nour folks are ranchers and farmers and small business people, families \nwho have worked all their lives, perhaps several generations, to put \ntogether a farm or a ranch which has asset value and, frankly, has \nrelatively little cash flow. Yet, quite often under our current estate \ntaxes, that family has to dispose of their assets, dispose of their \nranch, on the death of the senior person in order to pay the taxes. So \nhe or she cannot pass it on, that lifetime of work, to their family. \nThe fact is, we spend more money in this country avoiding estate taxes \nthan we do paying them--it is relatively minor.\n  Capital gains? We would like to have a good healthy economy, of \ncourse, and it seems to me there is nothing that would provide more \nstrength to the economy than to provide an opportunity for people to \ninvest in businesses without having all their growth taken in capital \ngains taxes. This is a direct result of reducing taxes, to have \ninvestments, and, indeed, for the first several years it increases \nrevenue.\n  So that is what we are talking about here. Again, let me say I get \nconcerned sometimes, when we seem to kind of trivialize the debate, \nwhether this is going to produce that. We get very involved in the \nnumbers game when beyond that, in a much broader sense, is a \nphilosophical direction. Where are we going with the Federal \nGovernment? Do we want more? Do we want less? Do we want people to have \nmore money to invest for themselves? Do we want to invest in the \nprivate sector to create jobs and therefore increase revenues?\n  We always hear about the 1980's in which the deficit grew, and, \nindeed, the deficit did grow. But if you take a look at it, revenue \ngrew exceedingly fast. It was the longest growth of revenue in history. \nThe problem was Congress continued to spend more. It was not a matter \nof not having enough revenues; it was a spending issue, and that is \nwhat we ought to face up to, it seems to me.\n\n  So we are talking here a great deal about the philosophy--philosophy. \nDo you want more Government? Do you want less? Do you want it more \nefficient? Do you want to continue as it is? It makes some sense to \nreduce the size of the budget and cause some of the agencies to have to \nfind some better ways to do things, and they can. Specific tax cuts, it \nseems to me, that are most important have to do with capital gains, \nwhich helps to increase jobs, helps to allow people to have a living \nwage and to take care of their own families; and estate tax, which \nallows people to work their lives to create an asset and to be able to \nkeep it; to provide $500 per youngster under 18 for families, so they \ncan take care of their own health insurance for young people. It seems \nto me that is the direction we ought to go and this is the time to make \nthose kinds of decisions.\n  I am joined by my friend and associate, the Senator from Nebraska. I \nwould like now to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I wish to thank my distinguished \ncolleague and fellow tax cutter, the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The people of the United States are drowning in a sea of taxes. \nReducing the tax burden on the American taxpayer was a principal reason \nI ran for the U.S. Senate last year. Tax relief is a top priority for \nmy State, for Nebraskans, and I believe for all Americans. We must make \nit a top priority in this Congress. We must make it a top priority in \nthis Congress for the American people.\n  American taxpayers are honest, hard-working people. They deserve to \nreap and to keep the benefits of their labors. Yet, the typical \nAmerican family pays more in taxes than it spends on food, clothing and \nshelter combined.\n  On average, nearly 40 percent of income goes for taxes; 28 percent \ngoes for those other necessities of life. I say other necessities \nbecause it seems in America today taxes are considered a necessity, a \nmore important necessity than food, shelter, and clothing. These \nnumbers are according to the Tax Foundation.\n  That is not what our forebears envisioned for America. That is not \nthe freedom that so many of our people have fought, sacrificed, and \ndied to defend. That is not the America we want to leave our children \nand our grandchildren. Our people, Madam President, deserve better. The \nAmerican people want less Government, less regulation, less spending, \nand less taxes. It is time for our leaders, the leaders of this body, \nthe leaders of the Congress of the United States of America to act on \nAmerica's wishes. It is time for significant tax relief.\n  Tomorrow is tax day 1997. We must make change happen. We must provide \nthe leadership to make tax relief happen now. The heavy burden of taxes \nmust be taken off the American people so they can enjoy the life they \nwork hard to provide their families and not have to worry if they will \nhave enough to be able to survive financially.\n  As we look down the road into the next generation, we know by any \nscoring of the budget that unless we make drastic changes in our \nspending habits, spending habits that now have given this country a \n$5.3 trillion debt, and we add $700 million a day to that debt, if we \ndo not change those spending habits and out of control fiscal policy in \nthis country, we know one thing: that within 10 years, every dollar in \nthe Federal budget will be consumed by four programs--interest on the \nnational debt and entitlements. There will be not $1 for national \ndefense, for roads, for scholarships, for the environment--not $1. It \nwill go to pay interest, not even the principal, interest on the \nnational debt and for entitlements.\n  This is the modern challenge. This is the modern challenge to our \nongoing quest to secure life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for \nall Americans. We need to look to the future, we need to look seriously \nto the future, and we need to look to the future now. We need to \ncompletely overhaul our present Tax Code. It is a sham, it is \nridiculous, it is an embarrassment.\n  Our system is too complicated, too punitive and too unfair. We need \nto make it flatter, fairer and simple, and we need to get at it now. We \nneed to look at all the options as we tackle this issue, but we must \nmake sure that a new Tax Code eases the burden on the American taxpayer \nand encourages--encourages--rather than inhibits or destroys growth, \ninvestment, and savings. Growth, investment and savings, that is our \nfuture. That is how we pay down this debt. That is how we continue to \ngive generation after generation in this country real opportunities, \nlike my generation has had and every preceding generation has had.\n  We have a very important stewardship here. This is a stewardship \nabout fiscal responsibility, that our children and our grandchildren \ninherit something worth inheriting, not a mound of debt, not a concern \nthat they will not have an opportunity to buy a home or send their \nchildren to college. We must\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\nensure that the American taxpayer is treated fairly and that any new \ntax system is managed correctly. The people who enforce our tax system \nmust always--always--act with respect for taxpaying men and women. We \nneed a smaller, leaner, more responsive Government. Americans are \nwilling to pay for the Government they need, but they are not willing \nto keep paying for the oversized, overreaching Government that we now \nhave.\n  The Omaha World Herald, the State daily newspaper in my State of \nNebraska, recently put the case very well, and I quote from the Omaha \nWorld Herald:\n\n       Taxation isn't evil. Without it, the Constitution's mandate \n     of providing for the common defense and promoting the general \n     welfare might well go unfulfilled. But there's a point at \n     which too much taxation makes Government the master of the \n     people instead of their servant.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       There's a point at which too much taxation makes Government \n     the master of the people instead of their servant. That point \n     comes nearer each year that Government figuratively gobbles \n     up more of the workday for its own needs, leaving Americans \n     less time to support themselves and provide for their \n     families.\n\n  Today, the typical worker works 2 hours 49 minutes of each 8-hour \nwork day just to pay taxes at every level of government. That is almost \nthree times as high as it was in 1930 when it took only 1 hour each day \nto earn enough to pay taxes at every level of government. This trend \nwill continue until something is done.\n  The time for tax relief is now. If we fail to provide that relief, \nour economy will weaken--it surely will weaken--our people will suffer \nand our role in a global economy will be lessened, and just at a time \nwhen America should be leading the world into a grand hopeful new \ncentury, a century that should be full of promise and hope and \nopportunity. We will have to forfeit the leadership and the \nopportunities that should be there for our young people. But if we meet \nthe challenge, we will open the door to an exciting new era in America \nand the world.\n\n  This country is great, not because of its Government, not because of \nthe country; the Government is great and the people are great and the \nNation is great because of our culture, because of our people. Let's \nnot hold our people back from their potential with a heavier and \nheavier tax burden. But rather, let's allow our citizens to flourish, \nprosper and soar, just as we have done in this country for over 200 \nyears. Americans deserve tax relief. I intend to do all I can to make \nthat happen. We need tax cuts and spending cuts now.\n  Madam President, I thank you for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I join my other colleagues this morning \nin talking about the dubious date of April 15, which comes upon us \ntomorrow. I rise today to speak briefly in support of what we call \nprofamily and progrowth tax relief. I will focus on two of the most \nfrequently asked questions, and that is: Why is it critical to provide \ntax relief this year, and then, can we do it while still trying to \nbalance the budget?\n  You always hear the question asked of the people: ``Do you want a \nbalanced budget, or do you want tax relief,'' just like they are two \nseparate questions and they cannot be one. I believe they are dual \ntrack and both have to be done at the same time.\n  Before I begin, let me set one fact straight, and that is, over the \nnext 5 years, the Federal Government will take away $8.6 trillion in \ntaxes from the pockets of working Americans. What we are asking is that \n2 cents of every dollar that the Government takes from the taxpayers--\nagain, I repeat, just 2 cents of every dollar--be returned to them in \nthe form of tax relief. That is what S. 2, the Family Tax Relief Act is \nall about. It is 2 cents worth of tax relief. Too much? Well, I don't \nthink so.\n  Madam President, tomorrow will be the cruelest day of the year for \nmillions of Americans as they rush to meet the April 15 tax filing \ndeadline, and cruel is not only an appropriate word to describe the tax \nburden faced by working Americans, it is perhaps the best word. Taxes \nimposed on American families are at an all-time high, as we have heard \nfrom other colleagues this morning, and this year, tax freedom day--\nthat is the day when Americans stop working for the Government and \nstart working for themselves--will be announced by the Tax Foundation \nthis morning and it could come as late as May 9, which would be later \nthan ever before.\n  The average American family today spends more on taxes than it does \nfor food, clothing, and housing combined. A typical median-income \nfamily can expect to pay nearly 40 percent of its income in Federal, \nState, and local taxes. This means, again, more than 3 hours of every \n8-hour working day are dedicated just to pay taxes. In 1996, an average \nhousehold with an annual income of between $22,500 and $30,000 paid an \naverage of about $9,073 for food, clothing and housing, but they paid \n$11,311 in taxes. Households with incomes ranging from $45,000 to \n$60,000 averaged about $16,000 for basic necessities but paid more than \n$25,000 in taxes.\n  If the hidden taxes that result from the high cost of Government \nregulations are factored in as well, a family today gives up more than \n50 percent of its annual income to the Government. If you want to put \nthat in context, 50 percent to taxes, if you go back to the Boston Tea \nParty, that was staged over a one-half of 1 percent tax when the \nRevolutionary War started and people thought they were being taxed too \nhigh at one-half of 1 percent.\n  When the Government takes more, families get less. Between 1989 and \n1995, the typical American family's real income fell by about 5.2 \npercent. Most economists point out that the decrease in income was the \nresult of slow economic growth, and that is a direct result of higher \nFederal taxes.\n  We all recognize the children are our future of our Nation and that \nfamilies are the foundation of our society, but Washington's deficit \nspending and high-tax policies have systematically ignored our \nchildren's future and severely have undermined the basic functions of \nthe family. We must abandon the policies and help restore the family to \nan economic position that is capable of fulfilling its vital \nresponsibilities and, therefore, we should provide American families \nwith meaningful tax relief, allowing them to keep more of their hard-\nearned money.\n  Again, S. 2, the Family Tax Relief Act, is truly a progrowth, \nprofamily tax-cut plan for working Americans. It will reduce taxes by \n$172 billion and with 95 percent of that tax relief going directly to \nmiddle-class families.\n\n  I am proud we have built our plan around the $500 per child tax \ncredit which the taxpayers in Minnesota have asked me to make a top \npriority. The $500 per child tax credit means real relief and will \nreturn nearly $500 million to overtaxed Minnesota families every year.\n  Our plan will also expand individual retirement accounts for spouses \nand allow penalty-free withdrawal from an IRA for education, business \nstartup and emergency expenses. It promotes savings in investment by \nlowering the antigrowth capital gains tax and takes on the damaging \nestate tax, or the death tax, that jeopardizes so many family \nbusinesses and farms.\n  By enacting these tax cuts, we can begin turning back the decades of \nabuse that taxpayers have suffered at the hands of their own \nGovernment, a Government that has been too often eager to spend the \ntaxpayers' money with reckless disrespect. As the Government takes \nmoney out of the hands of private citizens, the Government itself keeps \nexpanding. Even though President Clinton has proclaimed otherwise, he \nsaid the era of big Government is over, but the era of big Government \nis far from over. Despite a shrinking Federal deficit, the Government \nis getting bigger not smaller.\n  Total taxation is at an all-time high. So is total Government \nspending. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Government \nwill spend $9.4 trillion over the next 5 years, much of it going toward \nwasteful or unnecessary Government programs, and tax relief is the \nright solution because it takes power out of the hands of Washington's \nbig spenders and it puts it back where it can do the most good, and \nthat is with families.\n  By leaving $500 per child in the family bank account, taxpayers are \nthen empowered to use it to directly benefit\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\ntheir household. If you wonder what kind of impact that could have on a \nfamily budget, consider that for a family with two children, the $500 \nper child tax credit could pay for 3 months of groceries, nearly 20 \nmonths of clothing for the kids or your home mortgage for a month and a \nhalf.\n  The President's tax cut proposal, on the other hand, includes a mini-\nchild-tax credit that only begins with $300 per child and increases to \n$500 per child 2 years later, but only to be eliminated entirely after \nthat. Furthermore, the President's plan provides tax credit only to \nfamilies with children under the age of 13. So only up to the age of \n12, again greatly diluting its value.\n  We have 18.3 million teenagers age 14 to 18 in this country. As we \nall know, family expenses soar during those teenage years, so excluding \nthis age group from the benefits of family tax relief simply makes no \nsense.\n  Let me focus for a moment also on the estate tax. Today, when a small \nbusiness owner or a farm owner dies, the Federal estate tax confiscates \n37 percent of his or her assets valued between $600,000 and $1 \nmillion. That rises to 55 percent of assets valued at more than $3 \nmillion.\n\n  Gifts valued at more than $1 million to grandchildren are also taxed \nat 55 percent. Many, if not most, businesses are severely crippled or \nforced to close by this unfair tax hit.\n  Family-owned and closely held businesses are the backbone of \nAmerica's economy and a bedrock of the American culture. They must be \npreserved.\n  I am reminded constantly by proud family farmers in my home State of \nMinnesota--like Andy Quin, who is a corn farmer from Litchfield, and \nDon Buhl, a pork producers from Tracy--that if we are to preserve our \nproud, rural traditions, we must ensure that farming remains an \nattractive and viable profession.\n  Making it easier to pass the farm from one generation to the next \nshould be a priority in Congress. I am also pleased that S. 2 includes \na meaningful estate tax cut for small family business owners and for \nfarmers.\n  Beyond the direct benefits to families, tax cuts can have a \nsubstantial, positive impact on the economy as a whole.\n  It was John F. Kennedy who observed that ``an economy hampered with \nhigh tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget \njust as it will never produce enough output and enough jobs.'' It was \nPresident Kennedy who said that.\n  And he was able to put his theories to work in the early 1960's, when \nhe enacted significant tax cuts that encouraged one of the few periods \nof sustained growth we have experienced since the Second World War.\n  Twenty years later, President Ronald Reagan cut taxes once again. The \nreinvigorated economy responded enthusiastically as 19 million new jobs \nwere created and take-home pay grew 13 percent between 1982 and 1989.\n  Madam President, let me now turn to the other question of whether we \nare able to balance the budget and provide tax cuts at the same time. \nThe truth is we can absolutely do both at the same time, as long as we \nhave the political will to do it. Many States have already proved that \nthis can be done.\n  Some examples. While Washington was busy debating whether to give 2 \ncents of every dollar it collected back to working Americans, many \nStates took action to lower their taxes.\n  In the State of New York, Governor Pataki cut taxes 15 times, \nreturning more than $3.5 billion to New Yorkers in just 2 years. By the \nend of Governor Pataki's term, $13 billion will be returned to New \nYorkers.\n  What is remarkable about New York is that the Governor provided tax \ncuts while balancing the budget. What is more, New York ran a $400 \nmillion surplus and it put the money into the State's rainy day fund \nfor the first time since 1978.\n  Governor Rowland of Connecticut also cut taxes and balanced the \nbudget. He turned deficits into a $250 million budget surplus in only \nthe first full fiscal year of his term. Many other States, including \nNew Jersey, Mississippi, Michigan, Iowa, and Arizona, have done the \nsame.\n  My own State of Minnesota is another example. When Gov. Arne Carlson \nwas elected to office in 1990, he inherited a deficit greater than $1.8 \nbillion and a government that was spending 15 percent faster than the \nrate of inflation.\n  But the Governor cut spending by making the tough choices that \nelected officials are supposed to make, decisions that cut wasteful \nspending and cut taxes.\n  Thanks to that dedication, Minnesota today finds itself with a \nstronger economy, more jobs, and an unemployment rate of just 3.8 \npercent--that is well below the national average--and a $2.3 billion \nbudget surplus. Now the Governor is planning to cut income taxes by 22 \npercent.\n  By balancing the budget and lowering taxes, those States have \nproduced remarkable economic results: The 10 States that cut taxes the \nmost have seen strong job growth, a 10.8-percent increase compared to a \nnational average of 5.9 percent.\n  And also the top 10 tax-hiking States, they registered a zero job \ngrowth during that same period. No wonder even the State of Maryland \nhas recently adopted a plan to cut tax by 10 percent. Madam President, \nI strongly believe we should follow the tax-cutting trend at the \nFederal level.\n  By implementing profamily, progrowth tax relief and creating a tax \nsystem that is more friendly to working Americans and more conducive to \neconomic growth, Congress and the President can make our economy more \ndynamic, our businesses more competitive, and our families more \nprosperous as we approach that 21st century.\n  I strongly disagree with those who insist the deficit cannot be \nreduced as we simultaneously provide tax relief. The States have shown \nus that the deficit can be reduced, the budget can be balanced, and \ntaxes can be cut at the same time.\n  After eliminating wasteful, redundant, and needless spending from the \nFederal budget, we can still allow for a spending increase while \nproviding tax relief to working Americans.\n  To omit tax cuts from the budget resolution is not acceptable to \nRepublicans seeking to deliver on our commitment to return money to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Therefore, I support the alternative budget prepared by Senator \nGramm, a budget Democrats and President Clinton have supported that is \nbased on the President's own numbers. It is a compromise for us that \nincludes tax relief.\n  I also disagree with the suggestion that we should delay any tax cuts \nor separate our budget agreement from tax relief. Again, the taxpayers \nhave been very clear on this: A recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll shows \nthat 70 percent of Americans want us to keep tax relief in our budget \nplan.\n  Despite what you hear from the arguments on the other side, 70 \npercent of Americans want us to keep our pledge to cut taxes.\n  Madam President, as I close, I am certain there is nothing we can \never do to make tax day an occasion to celebrate. But it is within our \npower to make it a great deal less painful. So we have made a promise. \nWe must keep that promise. And let us give back that 2 cents on every \ndollar to America's hard-working families.\n  Madam President, thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I would like to \nget a copy of those remarks. They are very well stated.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  Madam President, earlier this year I joined Senator Roth and 32 of \nour colleagues in introducing Senate bill S. 2, legislation to provide \nAmerican taxpayers with a $500-per-child tax credit, a reduction in \ncapital gains taxes, an increase in the exemption from estate and gift \ntaxes, and full access to IRA's for nonworking spouses.\n  I support this and other efforts to reduce the tax burden on \nAmericans because, Madam President, we owe it to the American people. \nWe owe it to the hard-working families who have build this country, to \nwhom we owe our way of life and the honor and privilege of serving in \nthis House.\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\n  S. 2 is necessary for the well-being of our families, Madam President \nfor a number of reasons. Let me explain why.\n  To begin with, families today pay a higher proportion of their \nincomes in taxes than ever before in our history--almost 40 percent. \nThat is more than food, clothing, and shelter combined. And it means \nthat families have less money to spend on necessities, and less to save \nfor their retirement and for their children's education.\n  S. 2 would address this tragedy through a $500-per-child tax credit. \nIt would allow the typical American family to live better, and to save \nfor a better future.\n  But there is much more to S. 2 than just these specific family fax \nprovisions.\n  Suppose, for example, that your family, like most, is trying to save \nfor retirement. This bill would make that task much easier. How? By \ncutting our capital gains tax--one of the highest and most punitive in \nthe industrialized world.\n  By cutting the capital gains tax we would spur capital investment and \nincrease the value of the mutual funds in which so many Americans \ninvest, either directly or through their company pension plans.\n  Lest we forget, Madam President, well over half those who would \nbenefit from the capital gains tax cut in this bill earn under $50,000 \nper year. And all Americans would benefit from the increased economic \nactivity and competitiveness it would produce.\n  Now, let us say that your family owns a small business or a small \nfarm. Right now you probably live in fear that, when you die, your \nfamily will have to sell the farm or business just to pay the estate \ntaxes.\n  This bill will allow you to rest easy. It would do so by increasing \nthe exemption from estate taxes on family-owned businesses from the \ncurrent $600,000 to a more realistic $1 million.\n  Madam President, the Government should not be in the business of \nbreaking up the family farm, or the family business. Under this bill we \nhelp eliminate that problem.\n  Now, suppose you belong to a family in which you have small children. \nToday, unfortunately, too many such families require two paychecks just \nto make ends meet.\n  Mothers of young children too often are pushed into the workplace, \nnot by their own desire, but by economic necessity.\n  This bill would provide a full IRA deduction for nonworking spouses. \nThis will help some mothers who do not want to work outside the home \nstay with their children. It also will provide much needed financial \nsecurity to homemakers currently discriminated against by the tax laws.\n  A child tax credit that directly lowers income taxes. A capital gains \ntax cut that increases the value of retirement and other savings. An \nincrease in the estate and gift tax exemption to protect family farms \nand family-owned businesses. A spousal IRA to provide financial \nsecurity to spouses working in the home.\n  This, Madam President, is what our tax bill would provide. It grants \nmuch needed relief from a tax system that is out of control. It begins \nthe long road back toward frugal, manageable Government and toward \nprosperity for our working families.\n  I urge my colleagues to give their full support to this much needed \nlegislation.\n  I can assure this body that reducing taxes does not drain a \ngovernment of its resource base. I also can assure this body that \nreducing taxes will create prosperity.\n  In my own State of Michigan, over the last 6 years we have cut taxes \n21 times. The result has been dramatic. Six years ago Michigan had a \ndeficit of $1.8 billion. Today it not only has a balanced budget, but \nit has a rainy day fund in which $1 billion is available to our State \nfor tough times, should they come again.\n  Because of 21 tax cuts, we have an unemployment rate, for the first \ntime in 30 years, that is consistently below the national average and \nbelow that of other industrialized States. In fact, last month our \nunemployment rate in Michigan was the lowest it has ever been in the \nhistory of our State as long as we have been keeping records of \nunemployment.\n  That experience, to me, is the kind of model we ought to use in \nWashington. For that reason, I believe S. 2 sets us in the proper \ndirection.\n  Today, I noticed in my office there arrived, amid all the mail that \ncomes to us, one piece of mail that I was not anxious to see. It was \nthe tax returns that have been sent by my accountants for my wife and \nme. Our tax return is in there. I have not yet opened it. When I leave \nthe floor after my speech, I am going back to the office to do that. I \nam going to be quivering as my hands reach for that envelope to open it \nup, because I am not sure exactly what the consequences are going to \nbe.\n  But I am not going to be happy when I finally put in perspective \nexactly what the bottom line is, because whether we have, through \nwithholding, satisfied our obligations for this year, I do not know. \nBut I do and will soon know exactly how much we will be paying in \ntaxes.\n  Our family is obviously not the average American family. But when I \ntravel around my State and talk to average working families, the same \nkind of concerns, as April 15th approaches, are expressed to me time \nafter time; families who say, ``Look. We work hard. We play by the \nrules. And every year it seems we have less to show for it.''\n  One reason that families have less to show for it is because the \nbasis on which their taxes are calculated has continued to go up. As I \nindicated in my remarks, it is at an all-time high for the working \nfamily. As a collective, our country now takes more dollars to \nWashington as a percentage of gross domestic product than we ever have \nin the history of America.\n  We do not have the crises of a world war. We do not have the Vietnam \nwar. We do not have a depression. We do not have the sorts of things \nthat might justify an unusually high demand for the hard-working \ndollars of our taxpayers. But today we have 20.8 percent of the gross \ndomestic product sent to Washington. Madam President, that is too high. \nIt does not build the base for a strong economy in the long term.\n  The experiences in our State of Michigan, to me, make sense and ought \nto be emulated here in Washington. For that reason, I am glad to be \nhere today, not just to support S. 2, but to speak at a very timely \nmoment about taxes that are too high. It is time, as my colleague from \nMinnesota said, to balance the budget and do so in a way that lets the \nworking families of our country keep more of what they earn.\n  That is one of the reasons I came to Washington and is certainly \ngoing to be something that I continue to speak out on as long as I am \nhere.\n  I thank my colleague from the State of Georgia for putting together \ntoday's special order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I certainly thank the Senator from Michigan, not only \nfor the legislation he is proposing but for the common sense rationale \nhe brought to the floor today.\n  I would like to yield, if I might, Madam President, up to 10 minutes \nof my time to the distinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, thank you.\n  I rise today to address an issue that is of great concern to the \npeople of the State of Wyoming as well as the citizens of America.\n  During my campaign last summer and fall, and again since I have taken \noffice, I have traveled all across the great State of Wyoming. I have \ntraveled from Cheyenne in the south to Sheridan in the north and from \nEvanston in the west to Sundance in the east and all of the counties in \nbetween. One message came through loud and clear from the citizens of \nWyoming: Our tax system is too complicated and our taxes are too high.\n  Working families are forced to pay too much for their income to a \nbloated Federal Government. Small businesses, which are the backbone of \nthe American economy, are strangled by a complicated and often punitive \nTax Code. As the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, I have had to weed \nthrough a Tax Code which is frustratingly complex. And as a small \nbusinessman, I have experienced firsthand the Tax Code which all too \noften discourages individual enterprise and penalizes ingenuity. As a \nhusband and a father, I\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\nhave felt the burden of working for nearly half a year to pay all the \ntaxes levied by the Federal, State, and local governments. I promised \nthe people of Wyoming that I would work to make the tax system simpler \nand fairer so that the taxpayers of Wyoming and America could keep more \nof their hard-earned money.\n\n  I should note that it has been the Republicans who have long been \nsounding the battle cry for lower taxes and smaller Federal Government. \nIt was the Republicans who led the charge on the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. And it is the Republicans who have shown the \ndetermination to provide meaningful tax relief for America's families. \nI was proud to be an original cosponsor of the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of several \nbills that would get us closer to a simpler and fairer tax system.\n  With tax day now upon us, we are reminded of the impact our current \ntax system has on all of us. We are paying the price for a Government \nthat has too long lived beyond its means. Like a child in a candy shop, \nthe Federal Government hasn't met a sugar-coated spending project it \ndid not like. To pay for its appetite, Congress has left the American \npeople holding the tab with higher and higher taxes. It's time for \nCongress to rein in the Federal Government and ease the burden it \nplaces on America's taxpayers.\n  Since I was sworn in as a Member of the U.S. Senate, I have joined my \nRepublican colleagues in cosponsoring legislation that would allow \nAmerica's families to keep more of what they earn. The American Family \nTax Relief Act includes a $500-per-child tax credit, substantial cuts \nin the capital gains rate, and sizable reductions in the punitive \nestate tax. This legislation helps families with children by returning \nsome of their hard-earned money to them. The American Family Tax Relief \nAct encourages investment and frees up creative capital by lessening \nthe penalty of the capital gains transactions.\n  I have cosponsored legislation that would help small businesses by \nallowing them a 100-percent deduction on health insurance coverage for \ntheir employees. This home-based business tax relief would put small \nbusinesses on a similar footing with the larger competitors who \ncurrently enjoy full deductibility of their employee's health care \ncosts. It would also broaden the home office deduction so that parents \nand other individuals who choose to operate businesses out of their \nhomes can receive more benefit from their expenses. This legislation \nencourages economic growth and creativity and lessens the tax burden on \nAmerica's families. It would also take us another step closer to a Tax \nCode which sparks ingenuity and encourages family-owned business.\n  There remains little doubt in the minds of the American people that \nthe Tax Code is in need of serious surgery. The present Tax Code is \nneedlessly complicated and treats American businesses and individuals \nunfairly. One example of this is the alternative minimum tax. This tax \nsystem, first instituted in 1986, has imposed substantial hardships on \ncapital-intensive businesses, like mining and manufacturing, in Wyoming \nand across America. These businesses are forced to compute their taxes \nunder both the regular corporate method and the alternative minimum tax \nmethod. This affects the farms and ranches as well. And they have to \npay the greater of the two amounts. This compliance is expensive for \nbusinesses, and it ties up valuable capital that could be used to \nexpand their operations and provide new jobs.\n  The alternative minimum tax is a punitive tax because it effectively \npenalizes businesses that invest in equipment and structures necessary \nfor the operation of their businesses. The current alternative minimum \ntax system is yet another example of why it is time to inject some \ncommon sense into the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Reform of the alternative minimum tax would simplify the Tax Code and \nmake the accounting method more consistent with the regular corporate \ntax rules. This legislation would make the Tax Code fairer for \nthousands of businesses that are now at a serious tax disadvantage. It \nmarks an important step toward restoring simplicity and integrity to \nAmerica's tax system.\n  Reforming the alternative minimum tax depreciation allowance would \nwork wonders for the American economy. One recent study estimates that \nthe investment resulting from AMT reform would increase America's gross \ndomestic product by $15 billion over an 8-year period. This would spur \na surge in employment. Total jobs would roughly increase by 100,000 per \nyear during a 5-year period. These jobs would be largely concentrated \nin the high-paying manufacturing sector of the economy. That is why \nthis reform is needed so badly. The new high-paying jobs that would be \navailable in my home State of Wyoming and throughout America will do \nwonders to improve our economy and the strength of our families. It is \nhigh time we give the American people the commonsense tax relief they \nso strongly desire.\n\n  Right now, we tax anything that moves, we tax what doesn't move, we \ntax it when you buy it, we tax it when you sell it, we tax you for \nliving. One of the worst taxes of all is that we tax you for dying. We \nwant you to be able to keep more of your own money to do what you know \nhow to do best. As tax day quickly approaches, I urge my colleagues in \nthe U.S. Senate to join me in giving the American people meaningful tax \nreform.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has until 12 noon remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I believe that will be sufficient time.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming and all the others that have visited \nwith America this morning from the Senate floor about the consequences \nof tomorrow, April 15. I think perhaps that day resonates among more \nAmericans than even our more famous holidays.\n  I want to comment for a moment about the consequences of the data \nthat was presented this morning by the Senator from Minnesota. He was \ntalking about the impact of current taxation on American families and \ninferring that an average family forfeits about half of their income to \ntaxation and the cost of Government. Specifically, we have taken a good \nlook at this in Georgia. If you add up direct taxation--Federal \nGovernment, State and local government--and if you add on top of that \nthe share that each family pays for the cost of regulation today, which \nis now approaching $7,000 per family, and if you add in the cost that \nan average family pays because of higher interest rates due to the \nnational debt, which was created by the Federal Government over the \nlast 30 years, which has spent 5-trillion-plus more dollars than it \nhas, that adds up to 55 percent of their income. That is just stunning. \nAnd you wonder what is causing so much stress and behavioral changes in \nthe American family? I suggest that before you look to Hollywood, you \nlook to Washington. What else marches through their checking accounts \nand takes over half of what they earn?\n  To put it another way, I figure if somebody is taking over half of \nwhat I earn, they probably have more to do with my life than I do. And \nyou can see the impact on those families in the number of families that \nhave both spouses working and the fact that the average family isn't \nsaving any money--what would they have to save--and the fact that \nbankruptcies are up; the fact that consumer debt is at an all-time \nhigh; the fact that we find more children without adult supervision; \nthat the teenage suicide rate has quadrupled from 1960 to 1990; that \nSAT scores have plummeted, and the fact that families are smaller. \nThese are all phenomena that are as a result of an oppressive economic \npolicy from their own Government.\n  If you ask the American family what they think is a fair burden, it \nis real interesting that, no matter what economic strata they \nrepresent, they all come forward with the same answer: They think that \na fair contribution for the services they receive from Government is 25 \npercent. So, in other words, it is over double what they think is fair.\n  Madam President, let's, for a moment, say that it is at least \nreasonable that, at a minimum, an American family worker would be able \nto keep two-thirds of their paycheck. Most people think that is a \nminimum. But given today's circumstances, that is a large\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nreach. Let's put this into real dollars. An average family in the State \nof Georgia--and this would equate pretty much across the country--makes \nabout $40,000. So it makes it a lot more clear what our goal is. If we \nwere going to adopt as a principle that we need to return to the worker \nat least two-thirds of the fruits of their labor to manage his or her \nfamily, that means that the goal for the U.S. Congress is to return or \nlet them keep $8,000 more a year. That is a pretty significant \nundertaking. But if we set out to accomplish that, we will do enormous \ngood.\n\n  If we can figure out how to leave another 20 percent of that paycheck \nin their checking account to be talked about at their kitchen table, we \nwill see many, many positive results. We will see larger savings. We \nwill see new companies forming because there is capital to invest in \nthem. The job lines will be shorter. Interest payments will be less. \nThe family will have an opportunity to make sound judgments about \neducating their families. They won't have as high a consumer debt on \ntheir credit cards because they will have their own cash in their \naccounts. The list just goes on and on.\n  I want to reiterate, what do all these numbers mean? They mean that \nfor an average family in America, the Government is taking $8,000 out \nof their checking account that it really can't rationally claim and \nthat is doing severe damage to these families--severe damage. They \ncan't prepare for the future, for education, or retirement, or a health \ncrisis. There is nothing left. They can barely get through the ABC's of \nrunning that family. There is no margin. You can't pick up a newspaper \nwithout reading about the distress in middle America. This is what \ncauses it. We are choking the resources necessary for them to make \nhealthy decisions about running their families.\n  Madam President, I hope that more and more Members of Congress will \njust write a very simple goal on their ledger: Let's go to work and \nfight to ensure that an American worker can keep two-thirds of what he \nor she makes. Let's resolve that the fact that they keep less than half \ntoday is unconscionable. If we could line up our forefathers here and \nthey could see what we have done to the fruits of labor, they would be \nstunned and they would admonish us all.\n  Now is the time, in this 105th Congress, to start turning that around \nand leaving those resources in the checking accounts of American \nfamilies.\n  Madam President, I see that the hour of noon has arrived. I yield the \nfloor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3071-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE BILLINGS MONTANA STORY: ``NOT IN THIS TOWN''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to tell my colleagues about \nsome events that took place in Billings, MT, a few years ago. It is the \nstory of a town whose citizens decided that hatred and bigotry were not \nwelcome in their community.\n  The people of Billings enjoy the high quality of life that only \nMontana can provide. The magic city is the largest city in Montana, but \nit still has the feel of a small town. Folks still say hi to each other \non the street. Families go to the symphony in Pioneer Park during the \nsummer. And neighbors still go out of their way to help someone when \nthey need a hand.\n  That placid life was shattered in November 1993, when a group of \nskinheads threw a bottle through the glass door of a Jewish home. A few \ndays later they put a brick through the window of another Jewish home--\nwith a 5-year-old boy in the room. Then they smashed the windows of a \nCatholic high school that had a Happy Hanukkah sign on its marquee.\n  The events frightened and repulsed the citizens of Billings. They \nwere shocked to find that hatred and violence had penetrated their \npeaceful community.\n  But the people of Billings did not allow this outside menace to take \nroot. The community banded together. Thousands of people put menorahs \nin their homes. They showed the skinheads that they were united against \nhate. And that year, Billings held the largest Martin Luther King Day \nmarch ever in Montana. The skinheads left town. Billings showed that \nhatred can be overcome.\n  Madam President, the people of Billings didn't ask to be recognized. \nThey just did what came naturally. Recently, the USA network has \ndecided that the Billings story was worth telling to the world.

Madam President, I wanted to call the attention of my \ncolleagues and the people in the country to what I think is an \nimportant gathering here in the Nation's Capital. It is a gathering \nwhich focuses on the elimination of assistance for legal immigrants. \nThe sponsors of this gathering have done over the years a great deal of \nwork with the Soviet Jewry, and I guess we can now say Russia and other \nrepublics. And, of course, they are concerned about legal immigrants--\nJews that have come from Russia or the other new republics, many of \nwhom are elderly, many of whom have meager resources, and many of whom \nnow as a result of action taken last Congress in the welfare bill will \nbe without supplementary security income assistance and will be without \nfood nutrition assistance.\n  What is important about this gathering, this rally, that is now \ntaking place is that the sponsors have made it very clear that they \ndon't want to focus just on Jews who have come to our country or who \nhave fled persecution, but really on legal immigrants across the\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\nboard from many different nations. The message of this rally, I think, \nis that we are a nation of proud immigrants. We are talking about many \nof our parents and many of our grandparents. In my case we are talking \nabout my father who fled persecution from Russia. It really is shameful \nwhat we did, which I think was an overreach, which I hope we will \nrectify this Congress--I think we must--which is that we eliminated \nassistance to many people. As Mayor Giuliani said, by definition people \nwho are receiving supplementary security income assistance or food \nnutrition assistance because they are so low income and poor really \nneed this help. So what we are now faced with is a situation in our \ncountry where over 500,000 legal immigrants are going to be cut off \nsupplementary security income and over 1 million are going to be cut \noff from any food stamp assistance. In the State of Minnesota about \n35,000 legal immigrants are going to be cut off SSI and about 15,000 \noff food stamps.\n  This rally is the first of many gatherings. I think we are going to \nsee it all across the country, and it is going to be a combination of \npeople who are scared to death. They are elderly, they are disabled, \nthey can't work, and really all of the assistance is going to be cut \noff. The question is, What happens to them? The religious community is \ninvolved. Our county organizations are involved. Mayors are involved. \nMany Governors are now getting involved.\n  I want to say to colleagues that as a matter of what is right, as a \nmatter of elementary justice, as a matter of compassion, as a matter of \nconsidering our own tradition, our own roots, our own heritage, we have \nto restore this funding. It is simply unconscionable. It really is \nshameful what we did last Congress. I hope that we will make this a \nhuge priority when we go forward with our budget. Otherwise, we are \ngoing to see a lot of vulnerable people who came to our country, who \nhave worked, who have paid their taxes, who were legal immigrants, who \nmaybe have an income total of $525 a month, and they are going to see \nalmost all of that assistance eliminated. The question becomes, What \nhappens to these people? That is the question I have for my colleagues. \nWhat happens to these people? Are we willing to be so generous with the \nsuffering of others? I don't think we can just insulate ourselves here \nand act as if this isn't happening around the country.\n  People have now received letters that have notified them that they \nare going to be cut off; that this assistance which has been a lifeline \nof assistance is going to be eliminated.\n\n  I will tell you something. In my adult life--and this is not an \nexaggeration--I don't think I have ever seen people so frightened. I \nhave never met with a group of citizens nor have I have ever met with a \ngroup of people who are more frightened. I have never seen such fear in \nthe faces of people. I cannot believe that we don't have enough \ngoodness inside of us, enough compassion here to really fix this \nproblem, change the course, and make sure that we provide some \nassistance to many people in our country who deserve our assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3077-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3078-S3110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am going to for a moment, until the Senator from \nAlaska comes, suggest the absence of a quorum because the Senator is \nnot here.

My understanding is that we have an hour on this \namendment to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) for Mr. Wellstone \n     proposes an amendment numbered 29 to amendment No. 26.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 22 of the substitute, line 5, after ``(3)(B)'' \n     insert the Secretary has made a determination that personnel \n     in all State, local, and tribal jurisdictions on primary and \n     alternative shipping routes have met acceptable standards of \n     training for emergency responses to accidents involving spent \n     nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste, as established by \n     the Secretary, and''.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me start out by giving some context \nto this amendment. I feel strongly that the Federal Government should \nlive up to its obligation to take possession of nuclear waste. That is \nmy framework. I am with this amendment not operating outside of that \nframework.\n  I also add that Minnesotans and other customers of nuclear power have \nbeen paying into a nuclear waste fund over the years, and the reason \nwas and the understanding is that the Federal Government would make \nthis commitment and live up to this commitment. That part of this \nlegislation, that premise, I fully support.\n  Mr. President, I have been concerned in the past--and still am \nalthough I don't have an amendment today that deals with this--about \nwhat happens when the Federal Government actually takes title under \nthis bill because I do think that over the years you are going to have \na huge taxpayer liability. So while I want the Federal Government to be \nresponsible and live up to its national commitment to do something \nabout it, I worry about the transfer of over 10,000 years all of a \nsudden to the taxpayers. The GAO has estimated that the taxpayers' \nfuture burden could be about $77 billion. This is assuming a 100-year \nprogram. But we are talking about a program of nuclear waste that is \nover thousands of years.\n  Mr. President, concerns about this legislation. First of all, the \nlegislation still attempts to skirt some of the requirements of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act. There is a reason for that piece of \nlegislation, and I do think, when you are talking about the transport \nof highly radioactive nuclear waste material, this is a time, if there \never was a time, when you want to have full environmental review, when \nyou want to be absolutely certain that you are talking about the \ntransportation of this kind of material taking into full account the \nhealth and safety and protection of families all across the country.\n  My esteemed colleagues from Nevada have discussed some of the risks \nand problems associated with transporting highly radioactive nuclear \nwaste in their struggle against this bill. They also feel that Nevada \nhas been unfairly singled out, and I respect them for that. My \nframework is a little different. But I do want to point out there are \ngoing to be some 16,000 shipments on our highways and our railways over \nthe coming years. We are talking about some significant distance \ntraveled. There are legitimate concerns that people have about the \ntransportation of this highly radioactive nuclear waste material; \npeople are going to be concerned about it, and in addition there is \nsome debate about whether or not the containers themselves are safe.\n  We already transport hazardous materials, but I want to argue there \nis a significant difference when we are talking about nuclear waste \nmaterial, especially highly radioactive nuclear waste. Consider it this \nway. If you have an accident involving nuclear waste as opposed to many \nhazardous wastes, you can have a dramatically different outcome. \nRadiation, without doubt, kills people, and it is a different scale we \nare talking about. God forbid--worst case scenario--we have an \naccident. We have to do everything we can to guard against that \naccident. We could be talking about something catastrophic. We cannot \nafford to have such an accident in our country which results in\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\nthis kind of radiation leak that could have such dire consequences for \npeople, such dire consequences for our families, and therefore I think \nwe have to do everything possible to assure safety. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  Now, this bill calls for a transportation planning process, and I \nnote--and I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska--that part of \nthe amendment I proposed last week calling for more public \nparticipation has been incorporated. That is to say, there is some \nlanguage about public comment when it comes to these plans. But in \nMinnesota we currently have 641 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste \nand spent nuclear fuel. That is a conservative estimate. And by the \nyear 2014 we expect there will be around 987 metric tons, all of which \nwill travel the roads and rails of Minnesota and States between us and \nNevada, if this bill succeeds. So I think we have to do everything \npossible to ensure the safety and security of these shipments, and I \nwould add that I think to talk about public comment really does not go \nfar enough.\n  Initially, our amendment said that in the actual planning process, as \nyou chart out the routes, those citizens who are affected by the \ntransportation of this material ought to be able to be involved in the \nplanning process, as should local officials. They should at least be \nconsulted. I did not say they would have a veto because I know that \nwould not work. But I did talk about consultation. I did talk about \ninvolving citizens who will be affected, who are going to be worried \nabout themselves and their families, and local officials who are going \nto be worried, I talked about involving them in a more integral and \nreal and substantive way in the planning process. I wish that amendment \nhad been accepted.\n  My friends from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, and from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, \nhave made sure that this legislation really does take some steps \nforward from the last bill. Grants can be provided for training, and in \naddition there are going to be training standards which are going to be \nset. I still think, again, that we have to do everything possible to \nensure the safety of these shipments. We have to do everything \npossible, leave no stone unturned, in making sure that we prevent the \nworst case scenario, which could be a nightmare scenario for our \ncountry. If we do not do that, we are going to be asking ourselves, \nwhen such an accident takes place, did we do everything possible when \nwe transported this poisonous waste all across America.\n  The brave men and women who are likely to be first on the scene when \nan accident occurs, local firefighters, do not support this bill \nbecause they believe it inadequately provides for their needs such as \nthe training, funding, and technical assistance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the International \nAssociation of Firefighters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                             of Fire Fighters,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of the nation's more than \n     225,000 professional fire fighters, I wish to express our \n     enthusiastic support for your amendment to S.104 which would \n     ensure that emergency response personnel along the proposed \n     shipping routes are adequately trained to respond to an \n     emergency incident.\n       Currently, only a fraction of all emergency responders have \n     adequate training and equipment to respond to an incident \n     involving radiological material. Indeed, more than 40% of the \n     fire departments along the proposed routes do not even meet \n     minimum training requirements for basic hazardous materials \n     response. The training needed for radiological materials is \n     far more complex.\n       Put quite simply, America's emergency responders are \n     currently not equipped to deal with an incident along the \n     routes to the Yucca Mountain facility. If an incident were to \n     occur, whether it be an accident or a terrorist act, lives \n     would be unnecessarily lost because the local emergency \n     response personnel lack the necessary training and equipment \n     to effectively respond.\n       We are indebted to you, Senator, for your leadership on \n     this vital public safety issue. Please feel free to call on \n     us if we can be of any assistance to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alfred K. Whitehead,\n                                                General President.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, what the firefighters are saying is, look, you are \ngoing to have $150,000 which is going to be offered by each State that \nis to be affected by this along this transportation route but the \nquestion we are asking, says the firefighters, is how do we know that \nin 2 years or 5 years we are going to be ready? We want to make sure \nthere is enough funding for our training, and we want to make sure we \nare adequately prepared for this because it is our responsibility to \nprotect the citizens in our communities.\n  I am told that the International Association of Firefighters, which \nrepresents 95 percent of professional firefighters in the United \nStates, did a survey of departments along a potential test shipping \nroute in Ohio, and they found that 40 percent of the departments along \nthe route were not prepared, according to current standards, to deal \nwith hazardous material accidents. Let us face it. When it comes to \nhazardous material and when it comes to highly radioactive nuclear \nwaste, we are going to try, whether it be by rail or road, to go in the \nless populated of our rural areas. And by the way, all too often, \npeople in rural America are familiar with the saying let's go where \nfewer people live, but they say there may be fewer of us but we count \nas much as anybody living in any metropolitan area.\n  We are also hearing from a lot of communities: We are worried that we \nare not going to be trained; we don't feel we are even ready when it \ncomes to the transportation of hazardous materials.\n  So, Mr. President, let us assume the grants have been made and a \nState takes advantage of these funds. Two years pass and shipments of \nnuclear waste begin to pass through the State. What guarantee do we \nhave that local fire departments are fully trained and equipped and \nthat if the worst thing possible happens, they can respond in such a \nway as to minimize disaster.\n  What this amendment says is that the Department of Energy must \ndetermine--in other words, we talked about training. We have talked \nabout some grants, but nowhere in this piece of legislation do we have \nthe fail-safe, ironclad guarantee that as a matter of fact these local \nfire departments, these local emergency response personnel will have \nreceived adequate training. This amendment proposes that the Department \nof Energy must determine that emergency response personnel along the \nroutes where over 16,000 shipments of highly radioactive waste will \npass have met an acceptable standard of training before these shipments \nbegin. That is all this amendment says.\n  Again, what we want to do is to verify that these brave men and \nwomen--they are asking this. They are going to be on the frontline, the \nfirst line of response to an accident, people who are going to be \nputting their lives on the line--in fact have received the training \nthey need. This amendment says that no shipments will occur until the \nDepartment of Energy has determined that the emergency response \npersonnel in all jurisdictions along a given shipping route will have \nmet an acceptable level of training. It seems to me that is very \nreasonable. I think this is a logical extension of the Wyden amendment \nin committee.\n  Yes, we have some funding, although we do not know whether it is \ngoing to be enough. Most communities do not think it is. Yes, we have \nsome training standards. But what we are saying is we have to make \nsure, above and beyond some funding and some standards for acceptable \nlevels of training, that level of training is met before any deadly \ncargo under this bill hits the road. In other words, no training, no \nshipments. That is a pretty reasonable amendment.\n  This bill in its current form calls for training standards to be \nestablished by the Department of Transportation, but I am concerned \nthat the bill is ambiguous at best about who is really responsible for \nmaking sure these standards are met. That is what this amendment speaks \nto. By requiring the Secretary of the Department of Energy to determine \nthat every jurisdiction has met the standards, this amendment holds the \nprocessor of the waste responsible for making sure all safety \nprecautions have been taken.\n  If requiring a determination by the DOE just simply adds one \nadditional\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\nsignoff to this process, then I say this makes all the sense in the \nworld.\n  One more time. What we have is a situation where we are going to be \ntalking about the shipment of highly radioactive nuclear waste. This is \nof a different order than hazardous material. We have the firefighters \nand other people who are concerned about this living in the local \ncommunities saying we are worried about whether or not we are going to \nreceive adequate funding for training and whether or not we are in fact \ngoing to be trained.\n  There is some funding. I do not think it is going to be enough. We do \nnot want this to become an unfunded mandate. And there is some setting \nof the level of standards by the Department of Transportation but \nnowhere in this legislation do we have a clear line of accountability \nthat as a matter of fact firefighters and other local safety personnel \nwill be trained to deal with a crisis if they have to do so.\n  It seems to me that the very least we can do is to make sure that \nhappens.\n  Let me simply conclude by quoting the last part of this letter from \nthe International Association of Firefighters:\n\n       Put quite simply, America's emergency responders are not \n     equipped to deal with an incident along the routes to the \n     Yucca Mountain facility. If an incident were to occur, \n     whether it is an accident or terrorist act, lives would be \n     unnecessarily lost because the local emergency response \n     personnel lack the necessary training and equipment to \n     effectively respond.\n\n  All this amendment does is say let us make sure, Department of \nEnergy, you are accountable; you have to make a determination that \nbefore we ship this waste, the local fire departments, the local safety \npersonnel have, in fact, received the training and they are equipped to \ndeal with, if, God forbid, there is, a serious accident. I believe this \namendment should be accepted. It is imminently reasonable, and it seems \nto me we ought to take every step necessary to make sure we guarantee \nthe safety and security of people in our communities.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I reserve the rest of my time to \nrespond to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I very much appreciate the amendment from my friend from Minnesota, \nand I know of his interest in this matter because there is substantial \namounts of spent nuclear fuel from reactors in Minnesota. I am sure the \nSenator from Minnesota is aware of the transportation route where high-\nlevel nuclear waste has been transferred across the United States, some \n2,400 shipments, and I have a map here that shows the manner in which \nthese shipments have occurred from 1979 to 1995.\n  I think the Senator was out in his State Friday when we were talking \nabout this. This chart shows that shipments of nuclear waste have been \nmade over an extended period of time, all over the Nation. And during \nthose 2,400 shipments there have been seven accidents. Most of those \naccident were minor ones. In the most serious accident, the tractor \ntrailer swerved off the road to avoid another car that was out of \ncontrol, turned over and the cask rolled off. But there was no leakage \nof radioactivity. The cask did not break. It was not perforated in any \nmanner or form.\n\n  As the Senator from Minnesota knows, this type of nuclear waste, \nwhile it is highly radioactive, does not go up in the air and vaporize \nor move with the wind currents or whatever. It has a tendency, because \nof its weight and denseness, to stay wherever it occurs. And these are \nhigh-level waste rods from the reactors.\n  I think the intent of the Senator from Minnesota is parallel with my \nown intent. We want to safeguard, in every possible way, the \ntransportation of this material.\n  Here is an example of the type of truck and the cask. You can see the \ncask up on top. These have been designed to withstand any foreseeable \naccident of any kind that would be determined to be possible on a \nhighway. In testing, they have been dropped. They have been hit by \ntrains. They have been incinerated and so forth. I go into this detail, \nnot to suggest there could not be some type of accident that would \ncause a penetration but, clearly, the best scientists, the best \nengineers we have have concluded that these casks have been designed in \nsuch a way as to survive real-world accidents and ensure the public \nsafety.\n  The concern the Senator from Alaska has, relative to the amendment \noffered by my friend from Minnesota, is how to determine just what is \nadequate, relative to training? I think, if you look at the safeguards \nwe have attempted to put in S. 104, we have put in funding for \ntechnical assistance for emergency responders along the routes to be \nused to transport the fuel. The Wyden language, which we adopted, \nprovided more detail. Rigorous provisions regarding route selection and \ntraining for emergency responders were included. We had left it to the \nDepartment of Transportation to choose the preferred routes. Again, \nconsiderations in route selection would include concerns over \npopulation, hazards, shipping time, and so forth.\n  But I want to point out to my friend that this is nothing new. The \nonly reason these other 2,400 shipments were not news is because \nnothing happened. These were in connection with moving high-level \nmaterial from experimental reactors and other reactors around the \ncountry for disposition. So, to suggest that what we have had before \nwas adequate is inconsistent, I think, with reality. The question we \nare looking at now is, Can we do everything possible to ensure that we \nhave the safest possible transportation route and have made the maximum \neffort to protect public safety? It is also important to recognize that \nthis plan is fully integrated with State notification, inspection, \nemergency response plans, as well as should it go through any tribal or \nnative lands.\n  It also grants at least $150,000 in State and tribal funding. I think \nthis was something the Senator from Minnesota brought up in his debate. \nIf there is no training, there are no shipments. That is a provision of \nour bill. We make it clear the Department of Energy cannot transport \nfuel under this act unless the technical assistance and funding \nrequired by the bill have been provided for at least 3 years prior to \nthe shipments. As I understand the Wellstone amendment, it would add as \na requirement that the Department of Energy make a formal determination \nthat personnel along the routes have met acceptable standards of \ntraining for emergency response to accident. It does not provide \nadditional training. And it requires the Department of Energy to make \nan official determination.\n  My concern, and I am sure the concern of the Senator from Minnesota, \nis to get this stuff moved out of his State. That is a legitimate \nconcern that he and others have, other States have, where this material \nis piled up. So we have to make sure we do not tie this process up in \nlitigation so every State or every tribe or every local community could \ncome in under a determination of adequacy. I am concerned here as to \nhow I can meet the concerns of the Senator from Minnesota and still \nensure that we have a viable and practical situation where this \noversight does not throttle our objective here, and that is to move \nthis material to an appropriate repository.\n\n  I am concerned if this amendment is adopted as it is now, we might \nfind ourselves tied up in litigation and it would not be that the DOE \nhad or had not followed the Department of Transportation's regulations \nto the letter. I do not think it matters that the Department of Energy \nhas followed the NRC regulations with care and precision. It might not \nmatter the Department of Energy has integrated emergency response plans \nwith all the State tribes. And it will not matter the DOE has provided \nfunding for emergency responders. What will matter is we might have a \nlawyer along the way who has decided that a new volunteer fireman has \nnot had acceptable level of training. The next thing you know, the \nDepartment of Energy is in court trying to prove that every individual \nfirefighter along every single route has been trained to an acceptable \nlevel. I do not know how we are going to prove that. What is an \nacceptable level? That would be in the eyes of a court to determine.\n  I just wonder if we might confer a little bit, or perhaps here on the \nfloor, if the Senator wished, to discuss how we\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\nwould address that concern of what is acceptable, because I think we \nboth want to get there from here. I would defer to my colleague, on my \nown time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me thank the Senator from Alaska. I have some \nideas about how we might do that. I wonder whether I might yield some \nof my time to the Senator from Oregon. While he is speaking, the two of \nus might talk this over.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator from Oregon is not ready, I wonder \nwhether or not I could, just for a moment, call for a quorum call that \nwould not be charged to either side so we might be able to discuss \nthis. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have conferred with the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota with regard to the suggestion that has been made \nfor a change in the wording of the amendment, by adding the word \n``preliminary.'' That would be in line 2. It is my understanding the \namendment would read:\n\n       On page 22 of the substitute, line 5 after ``(3) (B)'' \n     insert, ``until the Secretary has made a'' [and the \n     additional would be ``preliminary''] ``determination. . . .''\n\n  The rest of the amendment would be the same.\n  That is satisfactory to our side. I leave it up to the other side for \ndiscussion and analysis, but we are prepared on this side to accept the \namendment in that form.\n  Mr. REID. We object to the modification. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to modify the \namendment. Objection is heard. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I understand I had been clear with \ncolleagues from Nevada about this amendment. I always--my own people \nhave their own goals here. I really do believe something has to be \ndone. The Federal Government has made a commitment and I want to see \nthe Federal Government live up to it.\n  What I was trying to do in this amendment is to assure the safety and \nsecurity of the shipments. I understand why my colleagues have taken \nthe position they have taken. I say to the Senator from Alaska that I \ndo think the change that we proposed on preliminary determination makes \ngood sense. I am sorry we cannot do this.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if it would satisfy the Senator from \nMinnesota if I gave him a commitment that we would accept his \namendment, at least I would attempt to accept his amendment, in \nconference, because, obviously, I will be on the conference committee.\n  I would accept the underlying amendment now with the provision that I \nwould give him my commitment to do my very best in conference to adopt \nhis amendment, but I am willing to accept the underlying amendment now.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to again suggest the absence of \na quorum for a moment. My concern is--I have no reason to doubt the \ngood work of my colleague from Alaska--but I sometimes have not fared \nso well in conference committee, and I am a little worried about it. I \nhave to make a decision. I think it would take unanimous consent to do \nit.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think there is a misunderstanding. I am prepared to \naccept the amendment with the commitment that I will try to get the \nSenator's revision which we talked about--adding the word \n``preliminary''--adopted in conference.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I see. Mr. President, I do not need time to confer \nwith my colleague from Alaska on that. I am pleased that he is willing \nto do so. We do not need a vote on it if the Senator from Alaska will \naccept this amendment. I have some additional time. Maybe my colleague \nfrom Oregon, who has done so much work on this, might want to speak on \nthis amendment for a moment. Does the Senator from Oregon want to speak \nfor a moment on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nyielding me time.\n  Transportation of defense- and commercial-grade nuclear fuel and \nhigh-level radioactive waste is a great concern to the people of \nOregon. Virtually every shipment to and from the Department of Energy's \nHanford site requires at least 200 miles of transport on the roads in \nour State. As we have heard these past several days, the transportation \nof spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste is a major \nconcern to many Senators on both sides of the aisle in this debate with \nrespect to how to handle nuclear waste in the next century.\n  During the Energy Committee markup on S. 104, my amendment on \ntransportation safety of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive \nwaste was adopted. A key component of that amendment is the no \nshipments if no training provision. It literally means what it says, \nthat there will be no shipment of spent nuclear fuel or high-level \nradioactive waste through the jurisdiction of any State or reservation \nlands of any Indian tribe eligible unless technical assistance and \nfunds to implement procedures for the safe routing transportation are \navailable for at least 3 years prior to any shipments.\n  This provision was carefully crafted to ensure safe transportation \nwhile also preventing anyone from using this provision to obstruct \nshipment by refusing to accept the grants or by failing to use the \ngrants for training.\n  Senator Wellstone's amendment further tightens this requirement, and, \nit seems to me, Mr. President, that our Government, built on checks and \nbalances, ought to be ensuring this kind of mechanism, the kind of \nmechanism envisaged by the Senator from Minnesota, to ensure \naccountability and to ensure public safety.\n  I also point out that it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel to \ntransport spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste. What this \namendment does, as did the amendment that I offered in committee, is to \nessentially build on the good system already in place to provide for \nthe safest method possible for the transportation of spent nuclear fuel \nand high-level radioactive waste. That is the system now being used for \nthe transportation of plutonium from the Hanford nuclear reservation \nand other Department of Energy facilities to the WIPP facility in New \nMexico.\n  For the past 5 years, the Department of Energy has worked \ncooperatively with States and Indian tribes to develop the WIPP Land \nWithdrawal Act transportation system. It has been applied with success \nto a variety of shipments of nuclear materials moving literally from \ncoast to coast. The Department of Energy has been working well with \nWestern States in preparing shipments of transuranic wastes to the WIPP \nfacility.\n  I believe the WIPP Act, which the Senator from Minnesota builds on \nwith his amendment, takes the right approach to address issues such as \nadvance notification to the States of shipments, agreement of avoiding \nadverse weather conditions, qualification of carriers and emergency \ntraining and response of emergency responders. I do believe that this \nissue is one of bipartisan concern.\n  In the Senate Energy Committee, my colleague from Oregon, Senator \nSmith, joined me in offering the amendment that was adopted in \ncommittee, now strengthened by the Wellstone amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding me this time, and I \nam very hopeful that it will be possible on a bipartisan basis to \naccept the Wellstone amendment, which I believe builds on the progress \nthat was made in committee with respect to tightening safety measures, \nto proving accountability for moving these dangerous wastes across the \ncountry.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding me time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I probably only have a couple of \nminutes left. Let me thank the Senator from Oregon and also, again, my \ncolleague from Alaska. I do think this is a logical extension of what \nthe Senator from Oregon had done in committee. I do think, again, what \nwe want to make sure of is that there is enough funding, and, of \ncourse, we are talking about setting standards by the Department of \nTransportation, and the Department of Energy will be involved in it. We \nwant to make sure, in fact, those standards have been met.\n  I would like to thank the National Association of Firefighters and \nthe firefighters of Minnesota. What they have said is, ``Look, we want \nto make sure you have some kind of process, some kind of fail-safe \nmechanism to make sure we are adequately trained to deal with this \ndisaster.'' That is what this amendment does. It holds someone \naccountable--the Department of Energy. It says the Department of Energy \nis going to make a preliminary determination, whatever the operative \nlanguage is, that, in fact, before we have the actual transportation of \nthis highly radioactive nuclear waste material, that the local \npersonnel, firefighters, and others, are ready, trained and equipped to \ndeal with an emergency if they have to do so.\n  I am very pleased that my colleagues have accepted the amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator from Minnesota have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield me 3 or 4 minutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield the final 7 minutes to the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from Minnesota and \nmy colleagues, I think this amendment improves the bill, but it is \nstill a lousy bill. This bill is opposed by every environmental \norganization in America. We know from the record that has been laid \nbefore this body that you cannot transport nuclear waste at this stage \nsafely. The dry cask storage containers simply will not allow it. If \nyou go 30 miles an hour, have an accident and there is a fire, you are \nin big trouble carrying this product.\n  This is a bad bill. It is a bad bill for the environment. As \nindicated by the experience in Germany, you cannot transport nuclear \nwaste. I say to anyone who has any care about the environment, listen \nto what the environmental community is saying about this legislation. \nThis legislation is bad. This amendment, while directed toward safety \nprocedures for transporting nuclear waste, is a pinpoint in the \nuniverse. It does not help the legislation. This is bad legislation, as \nindicated by the scientific community and the environmental community.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thought the Senator left the floor. \nWhatever time is left is under the control of the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Before I go forward with the second amendment that I \nthink is next in order, previously agreed to, I would like to suggest \nthe absence of a quorum just for a few minutes, no more than 5 minutes, \nand then I will be ready to offer that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum without it being \ncharged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is the intent of this side to not \nprolong this discussion. Therefore, I am willing to yield back the \nremainder of our time on this side. It will be my intention to have a \nvoice vote, I believe, to dispose of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 5 minutes \nremaining on his time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been informed that my colleague from \nMinnesota is willing to yield back the remainder of his time. So I \nyield back, on behalf of Senator Wellstone, the remainder of his time. \nIt is my understanding that there is no time left on either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 29) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, if he would be \ngracious enough to give me 2 more minutes, I will be ready with the \nsecond amendment. I have looked at the second-degree amendment, and I \nthink we will be able to work together. If I could have 2 more minutes. \nI suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time not to be charged to \neither side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 30 To Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside and that the Senate now consider \namendment No. 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 30.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR \n                   ELDERLY AND DISABLED LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should take \n     steps to ensure that elderly and disabled legal immigrants \n     who are unable to work, will not be left without Federal \n     assistance essential to their well-being.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me start off by reading a March 19, \n1997, article in the New York Times about Luz Gross, 88 years old, a \nwidow who resides in New York City. She is from the Dominican Republic \nand is suffering from severe Alzheimer's.\n  When asked when she was born, Mrs. Gross says, ``When I came to the \nUnited States, I wasn't born.'' Asked if she wanted to become a \ncitizen, she began talking about her childhood when she lived close to \nthe sea in Santo Domingo.\n  Mrs. Gross' only child Felix is 72 himself, retired and living on \n$10,320 a year from Social Security and a small union pension earned \nafter working 18 years as a building handyman in Manhattan. He visits \nhis mother every day repairing whatever breaks in her apartment and \nwatching television with her. But he said he cannot afford to support \nher, and there is no room for her to live in his small one-bedroom \napartment. ``I feel in denial,'' he said. ``I can't believe this is \nhappening.''\n  Mr. President, Nouphanh is 65 years old, and she has been in the \nUnited States since 1984. Before she left Laos, she had no access to \neducation because her parents moved from place to place to get away \nfrom the war. She does not understand English and has no family here. \nShe is alone. She is on disability income, $484 a month, and she lives \nin a housing project. She is severely depressed and currently \nundergoing treatment. She says, ``Sometimes in this country I feel like \nI am deaf, I am\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\nblind, I am mute, because I cannot learn English.'' Every day she lives \nin fear, and every day she asks herself what will happen to her if she \ndoes not have SSI and food stamps.\n  Mr. President, let me, one more time, bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues this amendment. I am hoping for a good, strong, positive \nvote. It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should take steps to \nensure that elderly and disabled legal immigrants who are unable to \nwork will not be left without Federal assistance essential to their \nwell-being.\n  Mr. President, I said it earlier before my colleague arrived. The \nreason that I bring this sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate today is because I think we are confronted with the \nfierce urgency of now--Arizona being one good example of one State in \nthe country--we have all heard from legal immigrants and we have all \nheard from 80-year-old women living alone, and partially disabled. They \nhave received letters. They are now, as a result of the legislation we \npassed last year, going to be cut off assistance. They are terrified. \nThey live in fear.\n  I said earlier, and I am not being melodramatic, I was a community \norganizer for 20 years before I was fortunate enough to become a U.S. \nSenator from Minnesota. I have worked with lots of people who have been \nstruggling with lots of different issues, many of them very poor, and I \nhave never in my whole life seen people with such fear in their faces. \nI have never seen people so terrified.\n\n  Mr. President, what in God's name does eliminating supplemental \nsecurity income and food nutrition assistance for an 80-year-old Hmong \nwoman, partially disabled, living alone in Minnesota have to do with \nreform? It is not reform. It is unconscionable. It is shameful.\n  Mr. President, I said earlier I am going to have a chance to speak at \na rally this afternoon, going on right now, organized by groups and \norganizations that have worked with Soviet Jewry over the years. I am \nthe son of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution in Russia. Maybe \nthat is why I feel so strongly about this. But, Mr. President, it is \nnot just Jewish immigrants from Russia or Eastern Europe; it is legal \nimmigrants, people who have come to our country, many of whom have \nworked and paid taxes.\n  There have been reports by the Urban Institute and others that show \nthat these legal immigrants have given much more to our country in \ntaxes than any benefit that they have ever received.\n  Mr. President, last Congress we passed a piece of legislation, all in \nthe name of deficit reduction, that eliminated $22 billion worth of \nassistance to these vulnerable citizens. Mr. President, it was easy to \ndo. They are among the most vulnerable citizens in this country with \nthe least amount of political power and, therefore, we chose to make \nthe cuts there.\n  But, Mr. President, I think there is goodness--I am sorry--in my \ncolleagues. I think we did not realize what we were doing. That happens \noften. I have voted for legislation for which I did not fully \nunderstand all of the consequences, and later on I changed my mind. \nPlease, let us change our minds.\n  We are hearing from our Governors, Mr. President. We are hearing from \nour mayors. We are hearing from our county officials. They are all \nsaying, ``Wait a minute. These people, by definition, on supplemental \nsecurity income are not going to make it to self-sufficiency.'' By \ndefinition we are talking about people who are either very elderly or \npeople who are disabled and people who need the support.\n  Mr. President, at one of many community meetings I attended in \nMinnesota there was a man who came up to me who was a Hmong. He fought \non our side during the Vietnam war. He has--I know this is hard to \nbelieve; but it is true--he has one bullet still in his brain and one \nbullet still in his knee. He is disabled. We are going to eliminate his \nsupplemental security income assistance. What does that have to do with \nreform?\n  Mr. President, I was at a gathering on the west side of St. Paul. I \nwill never forget it. It sent chills down my spine. A woman came up to \nme. I thought that she was 80. She was bent over. Certainly she looked \nevery bit 80 years of age. She came up to me, and her hands were \nshaking, and she began to wail. That was the kind of crying that she \nwas doing. She began to wail. And she had in her hands a picture of her \nhusband, and then I realized he was my age and, therefore, she was \nprobably about my age. Her husband fought in the Vietnam war.\n  Again, she was a Hmong who came over to our country. We have a large \nHmong community in Minnesota. Her husband apparently had just passed \naway about a month earlier.\n  Mr. President, this woman is not going to learn our language. She is \nnot going to become a citizen. But these people fought the war in \nIndochina. They came to our country. We made a commitment that there \nwould be some assistance for them. She has nowhere to go. She has \nnowhere to go.\n  What I hated about that community meeting, and what I hate about all \nof these meetings, is that I keep thinking to myself, people really \nthink that as a Senator from Minnesota I can change this. It scares me, \nbecause I am afraid we will not do anything at all.\n  Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is an amendment \nthat I think all of my colleagues can vote for. It does not specify a \ncourse of action that we should take. But it at least gives the \nreligious community, all of the legal immigrants, and many local \nofficials who feel like we are dumping the cost on them some \nassurances. Much less it gives us some reassurance that we have \nrediscovered part of our soul again if we would at least go on record \nsaying it is the sense of the Senate that Congress should take steps to \nensure that elderly and disabled legal immigrants who are unable to \nwork will not be left without Federal assistance essential to their \nwell-being.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it would be a very important statement for us \nto make. I think this is a very important position for us to take. We \nare heading into the budget negotiations. We are hearing from people in \nour States. We are hearing from people in the country. And that is why \nI come to the floor of the Senate.\n  I told that Hmong woman, who was about 50 years of age, though she \nlooked like she was going on 80--she has had such a difficult life, \nholding the picture of her husband, no longer alive, who served on our \nside during the war in Vietnam--I told her, through a translator, \nbecause she does not speak English, all these people who have come to \nthese community meetings, that although I did not know whether I would \nwin or not, I would come to the floor and fight for people.\n  This is just the beginning of this effort. I am lucky to have a \nstrong colleague, Luis Gutierrez, in the House who is pushing very \nhard. I am really hoping Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nwill accept this amendment or will vote for this amendment. It is time \nthat we correct this.\n  We did the wrong thing, colleagues. You may not agree with me on all \nissues, and I know quite often you do not, but we did the wrong thing. \nThese are people that we should not literally throw out in the cold. \nThese are people who really need this assistance. These are some very \ngood people. These are, for many of us, our parents or our \ngrandparents.\n  Mr. President, we have to do something. We have to take some \ncorrective action, and this amendment, I think, is the beginning of our \ndoing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Moira \nShea, a congressional fellow in my office who is visually impaired, be \ngranted floor access during the course of debate on S. 104, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, and that Ms. Shea's guide dog also be granted floor \naccess during the course of debate on S. 104.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I shall not personally object because I have \nno personal objection to the request of my friend from Oregon, but on \nbehalf of another Member who just called the cloakroom, I do voice an \nobjection.\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in light of the objection, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to proceed for 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness for the purpose of submitting a resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden pertaining to the submission of Senate \nResolution 71 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of \nConcurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 44 to Amendment No. 30\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding assistance for \n                elderly and disabled legal immigrants.)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment to the \nWellstone amendment, which I understand may be acceptable. Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent to offer the second-degree amendment at this time \non behalf of Senator Lott. The only change it would make to the \nWellstone amendment would be to add the words ``the President'' on line \n2--* * * that the President, Congress, the States, and faith-based and \nother organizations * * *'' et cetera. I send this second-degree \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be in \norder at this time.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 44 to amendment No. 30.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the pending amendment, strike all after ``Sec.  .'' and \n     insert the following:\n\n     ``SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ASSISTANCE FOR ELDERLY AND \n                   DISABLED LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.\n\n       ``It is the sense of the Senate that elderly and disabled \n     legal immigrants who are unable to work should receive \n     assistance essential to their well-being, and that the \n     President, Congress, the States, and faith-based and other \n     organizations should continue to work together toward that \n     end.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be included as an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I came to the \nfloor of the Senate today to try to make sure that we make a \ncommitment, albeit a preliminary commitment. I will read the operative \nlanguage. ``* * * take steps to ensure that elderly and disabled legal \nimmigrants who are unable to work, will not be left without Federal \nassistance essential to their well-being.''\n  I believe that, ``It is the sense of the Senate that elderly and \ndisabled legal immigrants who are unable to work should receive \nassistance essential to their well-being, and that the President, \nCongress, the States, and faith-based and other organizations should \ncontinue to work together toward that end,'' is in the same spirit.\n  We are going to have to define this with concrete language and with a \ndecision made about investment of resources. I think it is an important \nstep forward. I thank my colleague from Alaska. I would be pleased if \nwe could have a voice vote if that is what my colleague wants to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is time yielded back on the amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 44) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 30\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, has the first-degree amendment been \nadopted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first-degree amendment has not been \nadopted. The question is whether Senators yield back their time on that \namendment if they wish to vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield back my time and urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 30) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe we are waiting for another \nMember to come down to the Chamber. We have two more amendments, is my \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. President, I think it is fair to say that no Member of this body \nintended, by any means, that last year's welfare bill would place the \nelderly and the disabled legal immigrants out of their residence and \ninto the streets of this country. I am sure that when our President \nsigned the reform bill, that certainly was not his intention.\n  Since the bill was signed into law, many State Governors have \nattempted to address the concerns raised by my good friend from \nMinnesota. Many of the State's Governors and representatives have large \nbudget surpluses that can be used to alleviate some of the potential \nproblems that have surfaced. That is not in all States, by any means, \nbut in those that have that capability, I think there is an appropriate \nexpenditure suggested. In addition, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService has recently issued new guidelines that should facilitate \ncitizenship applications by many elderly disabled immigrants.\n\n  Mr. President, I am certain that Congress, working with the \nadministration, State Governors, and other organizations, will surely \ncome up with a solution that ensures the well-being and safety of all \nlegal immigrants, especially the elderly and the disabled. This is not \nto suggest, however, that we are going to rewrite the historic welfare \nlegislation we passed last year. As many colleagues stated on the floor \nlast year, if and when unanticipated problems arise resulting from the \nwelfare bill, we will address those problems in an appropriate fashion.\n  There are some in this body who want to restore, piecemeal, the old \nAFDC welfare entitlement. That program has been unanimously adjudged a \ndismal failure. Piecemeal attempts to restore that failed system are \nsimply not going to happen. I want to assure my friend from Minnesota \nthat I am committed to working with my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee, along with the help of the administration and Governors, to \nensure that necessary assistance is made available to resolve this \nunintended problem.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 43\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understand amendment No. 43 to S. 104 \nis pending.\n  Mr. President, let me go into the purpose of the amendment. It is \nestablishing a fee cap and is a second-degree amendment to protect the \nratepayers. These are the ratepayers who pay into a special fund and \nuse and generate power from nuclear reactors. It is to protect the \nratepayers who are the ones who ultimately pay the nuclear waste fee by \nmaking it clear that the nuclear waste user fee cannot exceed 1 mill \nper kilowatt hour without specific congressional authorization.\n  The spent fuel disposal program is paid for with a fee collected from \nthe consumers of nuclear energy. This fee is currently set at 1 mill \nper kilowatt hour. While the nuclear waste program has had problems, \ncollecting sufficient amount of money from the ratepayers certainly \nhasn't been one of them. After all, we collected over $13 billion and \nhave expended only $6 billion on a\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\npermanent repository at Yucca Mountain. But we have a problem created \nby the fact that our budgetary system forces the program to compete \nagainst other DOE programs for funding even though this fee is \nearmarked for nuclear waste disposal. This situation has contributed to \nthe problem where ratepayers have spent some $13 billion in the fund \nbut have only received excuses in return.\n\n  Our budget system also creates an incentive to use nuclear waste fund \nreceipts to disguise the size of the budget. Senate bill S. 104 \naddresses these problems by providing for two fees. One is a user fee \nthat is equal to the appropriations provided to the program. The other \nis mandatorily created that makes up the difference between \nappropriations and the current level of the fee which is 1 mill per \nkilowatt-hour. The user fee goes directly to fund the ongoing programs. \nThe mandatory fee goes into the nuclear waste fund to continue to bill \nthe balance to ensure there will still be money in the fund to deal \nwith the waste even after the reactors stop operating.\n  With that background, let me briefly explain what my amendment does. \nMy amendment simply makes it clear that the user fee cannot exceed 1 \nmill without congressional authorization. This is designed to protect \nratepayers. Critics will say perhaps that this is designed to protect \nutilities. But it is really the ratepayers who pay the fee, don't they? \nCertainly not the utilities. Some may argue that a 1 mill fee is \ninsufficient to pay for both interim storage and permanent repository. \nDOE's own budget projections show that this is not the case. The 1 mill \nfee generates $630 million per year.\n  Because defense waste will also be placed in the permanent \nrepository, a portion of the cost, therefore, must be appropriated from \nthe national defense budget account to the nuclear waste fee each year. \nIn the last few years this has been some $200 million. That is a \ncombined total of $830 million each year. Is $830 million per year \ncombined with the roughly $6 to $7 billion in the waste fund today \nsufficient to fund both the permanent repository and the interim \nstorage facility? This is a key question. According to the Department \nof Energy's own budget plan, the answer is yes. It is plenty. The fact \nis the budgetary provisions in the Department of Energy's own program \nplan assume an interim storage facility is named in 1998.\n  To quote from the DOE plan, ``Fiscal year 1999 through the year 2002 \namounts for the program assume the enactment of legislation authorizing \nand siting an interim storage facility and providing appropriate \nfunding arrangements.'' So there we have it. DOE's own plan reflects \nexactly the same schedule for siting and constructing an interim \nfacility as that set out in Senate bill S. 104. The Department of \nEnergy's own plan shows that the cost of both the permanent repository \nand interim facility will range from $535 to $698 million per year. \nThat is well under the $830 million going in the fund from the \nratepayer contributions and defense appropriations. So lack of money is \nnot the problem. But if changed circumstances or other factors make the \ncost of the programming to go up, then Senate bill S. 104 provides \nexpedited procedures to consider a change in the 1 mill cap.\n  Under Senate bill S. 104 the Secretary determines each year whether \nthe DOE has collected too little or too much money. The Secretary then \ntransmits his or her recommendations to Congress, and a joint \nresolution to raise or lower the fee is introduced and considered on an \nexpedited basis. This is another way to ensure that this program will \nbe adequately funded for its entire life. But by requiring Congress to \nact to raise the fee we protect the ratepayers, and that is the purpose \nof the language of Senate bill S. 104 and the amendment before us now. \nWe carefully balance the needs of the program while protecting the \nratepayers.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the pending second-degree amendment caps \nthe fee paid by the utilities for nuclear waste disposal services. That \nsounds simple enough, but to understand the amendment we must first \nunderstand the funding provisions in both the Murkowski substitute, \nwhich the pending amendment amends, and how both will affect the \nnuclear waste program's current funding mechanism.\n  One of the fundamental principles of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1982 is that the full cost of disposing of nuclear waste should be \nborne by the waste's generators. In the case of the military waste, \nthat means the Treasury and the taxpayers. In the case of commercial \npower plant waste, that means the utilities and their ratepayers.\n  The existing nuclear waste program will cost about $34 billion. Of \nthis amount, the utilities are responsible for $27 billion and the \ndefense program is responsible for $7 billion.\n  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the utilities' share is \nrecovered through a fee on electricity generated by nuclear power. The \n1982 law set the fee at 1 mill, which is one tenth of a cent, per \nkilowatt-hour.\n  Congress assumed in 1982 that the fee would need to be adjusted from \ntime to time for inflation, to meet higher than expected costs, of if \nthe number of plants paying the fee changed. Thus, the existing law \ngives the Secretary of Energy the power to adjust the fee.\n  The Secretary has never used his adjustment authority. The fee \nremains at 1 mill despite 14 years of inflation and despite GAO \nconcerns that the fee is not recovering the program's full cost. DOE \nadmits that the fee will only collect about $19 billion of the $27 \nbillion the utilities will owe. DOE is counting on interest on the \nunspent balance in the Nuclear Waste Fund to make up the shortfall. The \nutilities will contribute even less than $19 billion if any nuclear \npower plants shut down before the end of their useful lives, as many \nare expected to do as the electricity industry becomes more \ncompetitive.\n  Because of budget scoring roles, the fees collected from the \nutilities do not offset spending on the program. As a result, the \nnuclear waste fee takes in more money than is appropriated to the \nprogram each year. In fiscal year 1997, for example, the utilities are \nexpected to pay $649 million compared to $182 million appropriated to \nthe waste program.\n  The Murkowski substitute tries to get around these budget constraints \nwithout violating the Budget Act. The approach taken in the substitute, \nwhile convoluted, works. First, the substitute preserves the existing 1 \nmil mandatory fee. Second, it creates a new offsetting fee, which will \nbe set at whatever amount is needed to recover the amount appropriated \nto the program each year. The amount of the offsetting fee will \nfluctuate from year to year. To prevent double recovery from the two \nfees, the amount of the mandatory fee will be reduced by the amount of \nthe offsetting fee collected. Thus, the combined fees may total more \nthan 1 mill but will never be less than 1 mill.\n  The substitute eliminates the Secretary of Energy's existing \nauthority to adjust the fee, but it makes up for it by allowing \nCongress to raise the fee to keep up with program spending through the \nannual appropriations process.\n  The Murkowski substitute requires the Secretary of Energy to propose \nan increase or decrease to the mandatory 1-mill fee if he finds that \nthe combined fees are collecting too little or too much money. The \nSecretary's proposal would not take effect until approved by a joint \nresolution adopted under expedited procedures. The expedited procedures \nprovided under the substitute waive Budget Act points of order.\n  The Domenici first-degree amendment reinstates any applicable Budget \nAct points of order. That's only fair.\n  The Murkowski second-degree amendment, however, has nothing to do \nwith the points of order restored by the Domenici amendment. The \nMurkowski second-degree amendment caps the combined total of the two \nfees in the underlying substitute at 1 mill.\n  The Murkowski amendment repudiates the full-cost recovery principle \nof the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and shifts part of the cost of \nthe nuclear waste program from the utilities and their ratepayers to \nthe Treasury and the taxpayers.\n  How much of the program's cost will be shifted to the taxpayers is \nunclear but the 1-mill fee will certainly be inadequate to pay the \nprogram's full cost. GAO already says it is inadequate. DOE says it \nwill be inadequate if future interest rates are not high enough to \noffset the current shortfall\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\nbetween what the utilities will pay--$19 billion--and what their share \nof the program will cost--$27 billion. The underlying bill, S. 104, \nwill increase the cost of the program by $2 billion for interim \nstorage. Competition will cause utilities to shut down some nuclear \nplants before the end of their useful lives, thereby decreasing the \namount of the fees paid.\n  Under current law, the Secretary of Energy can correct any shortfall \nby raising the fee, but S. 104 and the Murkowski substitute strips the \nSecretary of that power. Even under the Murkowski substitute, though, \nCongress could still correct any shortfall in future appropriations \nacts. But the Murkowski second-degree amendment forecloses any \nopportunity for DOE or Congress to address a future shortfall except by \njoint resolution.\n  The pending amendment fundamentally alters the bargain the Government \nstruck with the utilities in 1982. That bargain was that the Federal \nGovernment would take on the responsibility for disposing of the \nutilities' waste in a permanent repository and, in return, the \nutilities would pay the program's full cost or the repository program \nand, in the meantime, fulfill their responsibility for storing their \nown waste at their reactors until the repository was ready or else pay \nthe Government extra to store it at a Federal site.\n  The nuclear industry and its Republican supporters have made much of \nthe sanctity of the nuclear waste contracts. They have complained \nloudly about DOE's inability to meet the 1998 waste acceptance date in \nthe contract and have alleged the Government owes the utilities \nbillions of dollars in damages for this failure.\n  The Murkowski substitute already rewrites the bargain struck in 1982 \nby making the Government responsible for temporary storage. The \nMurkowski second-degree amendment further alters the bargain struck in \n1982 by relieving the utilities of their obligation to pay the full \ncost of the now expanded program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the issue of disposal of spent nuclear \nfuels and high-level radioactive waste has been debated in this Senate \nin one form or another ever since I arrived here some 14\\1/2\\ years \nago. Nuclear waste is a serious issue. It demands serious attention by \nall Senators. It is a problem that is national in scope.\n  It is also a particular responsibility of the Federal Government. \nAfter all, it was the Federal Government that proposed, beginning with \nthe Atoms for Peace Program in the Eisenhower administration, to \ndevelop the peaceful uses of nuclear power. The problems of disposal of \nspent nuclear fuel that we face today are the legacy of our past laws \nand decisions.\n  I am not going to characterize the current situation as a crisis. \nThere is too much hype already about disposal of nuclear waste, from \nall sides of the debate.\n  But there are serious problems facing the program that merit \nattention now, in this Congress. I have an important disagreement with \nthe chairman of the Senate Energy Committee about the substitute \namendment that is before the Senate today. I believe that it is fatally \nflawed on two counts, and my amendment is intended to address this \nfatal flaw. But I also believe that the chairman is right when he says \nthat simply continuing with the current situation is not acceptable.\n  Let me point out a number of issues that call out for congressional \naction at this time.\n  First, ratepayers have paid over $8 billion in fees to the nuclear \nwaste fund and earned about $2 billion in interest. Only about $5 \nbillion of this money has been spent on the program.\n  Our current budget rules and accounting principles make it nearly \nimpossible to give the program, each year, the appropriations that it \ndeserves. For example, in fiscal year 1996, the President asked for \n$640 million for the DOE Yucca Mountain Program. Congress appropriated \nonly $315 million--half of the request. As a result, the program had to \nabandon a comprehensive program plan that was less than 2 years old, \nand go through yet one more strategic planning exercise to figure out \nhow to cope with an inadequate funding base.\n\n  There is no incentive for the President to even make a reasonable \nbudget request at this point. Not surprisingly, the utilities and \npublic utility commissions, who are paying in $600 million each year \nand seeing only a fraction of that getting spent, are upset with this \nstate of affairs. They have every right to be.\n  A second reason why action is required in this Congress is that DOE \nwon't meet its January 31, 1998, deadline to dispose of spent nuclear \nreactor fuel and is way behind schedule in building a repository. \nUtilities and ratepayers will have to pay for onsite storage for spent \nfuel after 1998 in addition to what they would otherwise have needed if \nDOE had met its 1998 deadline. While many thought that 1998 was \nunrealistic when it was first picked as a target date, no one thought \nthat we would be missing it by so wide a margin. Some relief is now in \norder.\n  A third problem that needs to be addressed in this Congress is that \nthere will never be a repository if EPA doesn't issue a radiation \nstandard for it. EPA is right in the middle of the critical path for \nthis program, and keeps missing deadline after deadline.\n  Part of the blame lies at EPA--it is hard to detect any sense of \nurgency on their part. But an important part of the blame lies in the \ninherent difficulty of writing this standard and having it stand up to \nscrutiny in the courts. Let me remind my colleagues that in 1985, EPA \ndid promulgate a radiation standard for the repository. Two years \nlater, it was stuck down in court. Without some statutory help to\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\nclarify issues, I believe that EPA is destined to face the same fate \nagain.\n  For example, according to the National Academy of Sciences, there is \nno technical basis for incorporating human intrusion into a repository \nstandard, because any analysis of human intrusion, in their words, is \n``driven by unknowable factors.'' How will EPA successfully defend a \nnew standard in court, if it has to depend on the unknowable?\n  Further, the underlying law governing EPA's development of a \nrepository standard currently places EPA in a legal catch-22. The law \nrequires EPA both to promulgate a dose-based standard and to follow the \nrecommendations of the National Academy of Sciences. But the National \nAcademy of Sciences has recommended against promulgating a does-based \nstandard. Without additional statutory guidance, how does EPA get out \nof that box?\n\n  If we sit by and do nothing, we are setting EPA up for certain \nfailure in developing a repository standard over the next few years.\n  The final problem that I want to cite which justifies action and \nleads me to conclude that we need to have action in this Congress is \nthat there is a lawsuit pending against DOE that seeks to escrow the \ncurrent nuclear waste fee outside the Government. If the court decides \nthat there is liability on DOE's part, there may be other payments for \ndamages that no one can put a price tag on right now. No one can say \nwhat the court will do--but it has surprised the Government twice \nalready with its rulings in favor of the utilities. One thing is clear \nthough. There is a sizable potential for major damage, and perhaps \nfatal damage, to the nuclear waste program over the next 12 months.\n  The administration has taken the view that it is premature to \nconsider legislation on this topic at this time, and that Congress \nshould wait until 1999, when the viability assessment of the Yucca \nMountain site is complete.\n  The list of problems that I have just gone through, and it is far \nfrom a complete list, won't age gracefully during the next 2 years. If \nwe don't fix some of them fairly quickly, I believe that we will be \nwasting a substantial amount of taxpayers' money. I cannot support a \nsame time, next Congress approach to clear and serious difficulties in \nthis program.\n  Further, the administration's emphasis on the viability assessment as \nsome sort of touchstone for further congressional action greatly \nexaggerates the value of the viability assessment. The senior Senator \nfrom Nevada has reminded us repeatedly, in this debate, that the \nviability assessment is not a suitability determination. He is \nabsolutely right. All the scientists involved in the viability \nassessment agree with him. The viability assessment will not tell us if \nYucca Mountain is a good place for a geologic repository.\n  The viability assessment will only be useful as a decisionmaking \nguide if Yucca Mountain is so terrible a site for a repository that \neven a small amount of scientific data is sufficient to make an \noverwhelming case that we should give up at that site and look \nelsewhere.\n  If the viability assessment will not tell us much, if anything, about \nthe suitability of Yucca Mountain for a repository, then why is the \nviability assessment in the critical path for deciding what we should \nlegislate here in this Congress?\n  I think the problems facing the Yucca Mountain Program speak for \nthemselves. They will not wait another 2 years to be resolved and \nneither should we.\n  Having agreed with the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee on the \nneed for legislation at this time, let me say that in one important \nrespect I cannot support the proposal he has presented to the Senate. I \nopposed S. 1936 last year, and I opposed S. 104 this year in its \noriginal form when we voted on it in committee. Although the chairman's \nsubstitute amendment today is a vast improvement over last year's bill, \nit still contains fatal flaws that force me to continue to oppose it.\n  Before I talk about the fatal flaws in the bill, it is only fair to \nacknowledge the good-faith cooperation that we have had from the \nchairman of the Senate Energy Committee in addressing, since the \ncommittee's markup, many of the problems that the administration \nidentified in last year's bill.\n  The chairman said at the markup that he was open to suggestions as to \nhow to make the bill better and that he wanted to have a constructive \ndialog, and he meant it. I am glad that I took him at his word for he \nand his staff have negotiated with me and my staff in very good faith, \nand anyone who looks at the substitute amendment that is before us \ntoday and compares it to the original bill has to admit that, while \ncrucial flaws remain, major progress has been made on a number of \ntopics toward getting a good bill on this topic.\n  Almost all the problems that have been aired in the Chamber in this \ndebate and in the veto threat issued by the administration have been \naddressed in one way or another.\n  Mr. President, I would like to describe eight areas in which the \nchairman proved to be open and flexible to my suggestions for how to \nimprove S. 104 and address major areas of concern raised by the \nadministration and others.\n  First, radiation standard. Few provisions of last years nuclear waste \nbill, S. 1936, and this year's bill, S. 104, have received more \ncriticism than the statutory radiation standard of 100 millirems. Every \nMember of the Senate has received, over the last week, numerous letters \nopposing S. 104 from environmental, religious, and public advocacy \ngroups. These letters consistently emphasize the fact that the 100 \nmillirem standard in S.104 is 4 times higher than similar radiation \nstandards for other nuclear facilities. The new radiation standard in \nthe substitute amendment, which is identical to the proposal I offered \nin the Energy Committee, resolves this issue. It is a risk-based \nstandard that is equivalent to about 25 millirems. It gives statutory \nexpression to the major recommendations of the National Academy of \nSciences on every issue except one. The National Academy recommended \nthat the radiation standard be applied at the time of maximum risk, but \nthis is 80,000 to 250,000 years from now. In a licensing proceeding, \nwhich is the venue in which any standard will be applied, proving \nanything with certainty about the world 80,000 years from now--160 \ntimes greater than all of recorded history--is a virtual impossibility. \nSo the substitute amendment uses a timeframe for assessing compliance \nin the licensing proceeding of 10,000 years, the same timeframe that \nEPA has proposed to use in the past. The substitute also requires a \nreport to Congress from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the \npredicted compliance of the repository at the time of maximum risk, and \ndelays the effective date of the construction license until Congress \nhas had 90 days to review the commission's report. A similar approach \nis taken to the question of human intrusion, which the Academy states \nis ``driven by unknowable factors.'' I believe that any objective \nobserver would conclude that the radiation standard in the substitute \namendment resolves all of the objections that were raised against the \nold 100 millirem standard.\n  Second, NEPA. S. 104 was criticized for running roughshod over the \nNEPA process. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the licensing \nprocedure for the interim storage facility. NRC regulations require it \nto prepare an environmental impact statement for any interim storage \nfacility. Yet the time lines in the S. 104, as introduced, would have \nprecluded the commission from carrying out a meaningful EIS. NRC \nregulations also clearly state that beginning construction of an \ninterim storage facility prior to completion, by the NRC, of its NEPA \nprocess is, all by itself, grounds for the commission to refuse to \nissue such a license. Yet S. 104, as introduced, instructed DOE to \nstart construction as soon as it submits a license application. In \ncommittee, I offered an amendment to correct these problems. The \nsubstitute amendment adopts my approach. Under the substitute \namendment, no construction of an interim storage facility occurs until \nthe NRC has completed the NEPA process called for under its \nregulations.\n  Third, transportation planning. We have heard a lot of discussion \nabout transportation risks in this debate so far. Senator Wyden \nproposed an amendment that was accepted in the committee's markup that \nstrengthened the provisions of the bill relating to transportation \nplanning. I supported his amendment and he deserves great\n\n[[Page S3088]]\n\ncredit for working closely with his own State of Oregon and with the \nWestern Governors Association, which includes New Mexico as a member, \nin strengthening the bill in this important area. One goal that he was \nunable to achieve prior to committee markup was to provide for 3 years \nof funding and assistance to States and localities, to enable them to \nbe up-to-speed to handle any contingencies related to transportation, \nno matter how remote their probability. The reason that it was rejected \nwas because it would have conflicted with the headlines in the bill as \nit stood at that time. After his staff was briefed about progress in my \ndiscussions on timing issues, he requested that I explore getting them \nthe third year of training and assistance. Senator Murkowski was \nagreeable to Senator Wyden's new request, and as a result, every place \nthrough which nuclear waste may be shipped will now have 50 percent \nmore training and assistance. I think this is a real improvement.\n  Fourth, timing. S. 104 was criticized for its unrealistic deadlines \nthat were virtually impossible to meet. The new deadlines in the \nsubstitute amendment are virtually the same as those in the proposal \nthat I offered in committee. They are drawn from the current DOE \nprogram plan and from technical discussions by my staff with the actual \npersons at DOE and the NRC who would be responsible for meeting those \ndeadlines. The resulting deadlines are very realistic, and in some \ncases have extra scheduling cushion built in.\n  Providing enough time for DOE and the NRC to do their work properly \nhas the advantage of postponing construction and operation of an \ninterim storage site in Nevada until after the scheduled record of \ndecision on the permanent repository--September 2000. Under my \nproposal, which Senator Murkowski agreed to, the interim storage \nfacility license is issued 9 months after DOE has applied for \nconstruction authorization for the permanent repository. In other \nwords, we don't put the waste on the road to Nevada until well after \nthe time at which DOE has determined, as part of its own NEPA process, \nthat Yucca Mountain is suitable.\n\n  A final advantage of the way my proposal sequences the interim \nstorage facility and the permanent repository is the elimination of \nmuch of the competition between the two for financial resources.\n  In the period 1999-2001, DOE can concentrate on repository \ncharacterization and on putting together a high-quality repository EIS \nand license application, while the NRC is working on the interim \nstorage facility license application.\n  In the period 2002-2005, DOE can concentrate on interim storage \nfacility construction and initial operation while the NRC is reviewing \nthe repository license application.\n  Fifth, size of the interim storage facility. In S. 104, as \nintroduced, the capacity of the interim storage facility grows to \neither 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel in December of 2002, or, if the \nSecretary is late in submitting a license application for the permanent \nrepository or in opening the repository for operations, 60,000 metric \ntons of spent fuel. This extra 20,000 metric tons of capacity is added \neven if the Secretary of Energy does not ask for it or think it is \nnecessary. We accumulated 32,000 metric tons of spent fuel over the \nlast 40 years. I was concerned that an aboveground storage facility \nthat had a capacity of twice today's spent fuel inventory, and a \nlicensing term of 100 years, with indefinite renewals into the 22d and \n23d centuries, would be, in reality, more like a permanent aboveground \nrepository, than an interim facility.\n  I proposed, and Senator Murkowski accepted, a linkage between the \nsize of the interim storage facility and the status of the permanent \nrepository. Before the permanent repository is in operation, the \ninterim storage facility capacity is limited to just what is needed to \nget to that date. It is a bridge, not a replacement. A second part of \nmy proposal was to allow the capacity limit of the interim storage \nfacility to grow, only after the repository is licensed to operate by \nthe NRC, and only for the purposes of operating the interim storage \nfacility as an integral part of a total system with the repository. \nThis, too, was accepted.\n  The adoption of these changes improve the bill, but only represent a \npartial success in terms of establishing the correct relationship \nbetween the interim storage facility and the permanent repository. My \nremaining amendment to this substitute amendment is intended to finish \nthe job on getting the right relationship between the two facilities.\n  Sixth, preemption. S. 104, as introduced, contained a very worrisome \nprovision preempting all Federal, State, and local laws on the basis of \na novel standard of ``inconsistent or duplicative.'' Removing this \npreemption provision was a key demand in the administration's veto \nthreat. At my suggestion, we have moved to a preemption provision that \nrestates the status quo in this area of law. The first part of the \nprovision restates the two fundamental Supreme Court rulings on \npreemption of State requirements by Federal law. Its language is \nidentical to that found in the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. \nThe second part of the provision is also modeled after the HAZMAT Act. \nIt lists five areas where Congress intends this act to be the last \nword. Three of the five are modeled after the areas listed in the \nHAZMAT Act. The other two topic areas for preemption are the land \ntransfer provisions of the Act and the siting and licensing of the \nrepository and interim storage facility. Neither topic breaks new \nground. Thus, we have taken a very objectionable provision and removed \neverything that was objectionable about it.\n  Seventh, financing. We have heard a lot, over the last few days, \nabout the problems of S. 104 in terms of how it pays for the nuclear \nwaste program. The junior Senator from Nevada has made some pretty good \npoints about how the bill, as introduced, transfers the burden of \npaying for the repository from the beneficiaries of nuclear power to \nthe general taxpayer. This issue has been of deep concern to me, as \nwell. Fixing this problem is not easy, as has been evidenced by the \nfact that we have had additional amendments on this topic during the \nfloor debate. The Nuclear Waste Fund is caught, along with other trust \nfunds, in a trap of budgetary rules and accounting principles that have \ngrown up over the years and that, in cases like this one, yield results \nthat defy common sense. Getting completely out of the trap requires \ncooperation from either the administration or the Budget Committee, and \nneither is willing to help. There is a partial solution, though, that \nputs the program on a sound financial basis outside the current scoring \nwindow and that can be implemented for 4 years during the scoring \nwindow. This solution has three parts.\n  The first part is a fee that is tied to appropriations, to remove the \ndisincentive that now exists to fully fund the program. In the original \nsubstitute amendment, there was no cap on this fee. Thus, if the \nCongress were to appropriate $800 million of civilian spending to the \nprogram, the fee would rise to about 1.3 mills per kilowatt-hour. I \nbelieve that it is appropriate to go over the 1-mill limit, if the \nratepayers are getting what they are paying for.\n\n  The second part of the partial solution is a second fee that kicks in \nif the level appropriated is less than 1 mill per kilowatt-hour. This \nsecond fee is set at the difference between the appropriations-based \nfee and the 1.0 mill per kilowatt-hour level. The second fee goes into \nthe nuclear waste fund, to build the needed surplus for the last 40 \nyears of the program.\n  The third part of the partial solution is an expedited procedure to \napprove any recommendation by the Secretary to adjust the 1.0 mill per \nkilowatt-hour level used to calculate the second fee. If we need to be \ncollecting a larger second fee to ensure the integrity of the Nuclear \nWaste Fund, the Secretary's proposal will make it to the floor for \nexpeditious consideration.\n  This agreement, as I originally proposed it, completely answers the \nconcerns raised by the junior Senator from Nevada. Instead of a 1.0 \nmill per kilowatt-hour cap, we have a floor that the Secretary can \npropose to raise, to ensure that the funds needed to keep the nuclear \nwaste fund solvent are always there. Instead of transferring liability \nto the general taxpayer and providing corporate welfare to the nuclear \nindustry, my original proposal ensures that the industry continues to \npay its fair share of the costs of the repository.\n  Eighth, lawsuit. The last area of agreement that I want to discuss is \na\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\ncommitment to discuss the current lawsuit by the nuclear industry in \nany conference on the bill. The commitment is in the form of a sense of \nthe Senate that the DOE, the utilities, and the public utility \ncommissions should settle the lawsuit before we enact this bill into \nlaw. The idea behind this sense of the Senate language is simple. The \nutilities and public utility commissions have a two-track strategy to \nsolve their problems. One is legislative. The other is judicial. There \nis nothing wrong with pursuing both tracks at this time, since it is \nnot clear that the legislative track will produce a public law anytime \nsoon.\n  But if the utilities and the public utility commissions do succeed in \ngetting relief from Congress and the President, in the form of nuclear \nwaste legislation that delivers an interim storage facility on a \nreasonable timeframe and that fixes the nuclear waste fee problem, then \nthe lawsuit against the Federal Government should go away.\n  The principle that I believe that the Senate should take to \nconference, then, is that you can't have your cake and eat it too. You \ncan't get a complete legislative overhaul of the nuclear waste program \nand then go and try to improve on it, or blow it up, in the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I recognize that we are dealing, in the \nlawsuit, with vested contractual rights, and that our options to deal \nwith the lawsuit in legislation may ultimately be somewhat limited. But \nI believe that we should put all parties on notice that the Senate is \nserious about a cooperative solution to the problem, and that they \nshould be, too.\n  Mr. President, I cannot say if the administration thinks that its \nconcerns have been resolved. I am still waiting to hear some definitive \nstatement from the administration on the amendments that we offered in \ncommittee a month ago and also a definitive statement on their position \nwith regard to the amendment I am offering today.\n  Despite the substantial progress toward making S. 104 a better bill, \na key flaw remains in the substitute. It is an issue of the highest \nimportance. It is an issue of whether S. 104, if enacted, would lead to \nthe abandonment of our fundamental policy of geologic storage of \nnuclear waste in the circumstance where Yucca Mountain would fail as a \ncandidate for a repository.\n  This scenario can occur and it does occur in the substitute amendment \nif the proper relationship between the interim storage facility and the \npermanent geologic repository is not maintained.\n  So what is this proper relationship that I think is so important? The \ncurrent Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provides for a facility \nsimilar to the interim storage facility that is provided for in this \nbill. In the 1982 act it was called the monitored retrievable storage \nfacility or MRS. We never found a place to put an MRS, but the \nrestrictions on the MRS in current law--which we passed in 1982--are \ninstructive as a guide to how we need to think about such facilities.\n  In current law, construction of an MRS cannot begin until the \npermanent repository has a construction license. In current law, \nconstruction of the MRS or acceptance of spent nuclear fuel at the MRS \nis prohibited during any time in which the repository license is \nrevoked or construction of the repository, that is, the permanent \nrepository, ceases. In current law, the MRS has a capacity limit tied \nto the opening of the repository.\n  These restrictions are all safeguards to prevent the MRS from turning \ninto a de facto permanent above-ground repository.\n  In the case of the current bill, we are allowing the interim storage \nfacility to proceed in advance of the licensing of the Yucca Mountain \nfacility, and I agree with that. This is a defensible step in light of \nthe delays in the repository program and the need for such a facility \nto be in full operation 10 years from now.\n  But the decision to allow the interim storage facility to get ahead \nof the permanent repository makes the issue of safeguards to prevent \nthe interim storage facility from turning into a de facto permanent \nrepository all the more important.\n  On the issue of tying the capacity limit of the interim storage \nfacility to the opening of the permanent repository, there is a \nprovision in the substitute amendment that works providing that the \nsubstitute also addresses the issue of what happens to the interim \nstorage facility if Yucca Mountain fails to pass muster at some point \nin the process. And here is where the rub is. The substitute does not \naddress the issue in a complete fashion.\n  As I see it, there are four points in the process where Yucca \nMountain can fail. There must be clarity on what happens to any interim \nstorage facility in each of those cases.\n  The first point in the process is already covered in the bill. It is \nthe viability assessment. As I mentioned earlier, if Yucca Mountain is \nan absolutely terrible place technically to put a repository, we will \nprobably find out at this stage. The substitute amendment provides that \nif the President finds, based on the viability assessment, that the \nYucca Mountain site is unsuitable for a repository, then he and the \nCongress have 24 months to find another interim storage facility site \nor the site in Nevada right next to Yucca Mountain is chosen by \noperation of law. I will come back to the automatic default to Nevada \nin just a moment.\n  The second point in the process where Yucca Mountain can possibly \nfail as a candidate repository occurs before the Secretary submits the \nlicense application to the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \nDuring the NEPA process for the repository, the Secretary will have to \nmake and defend a suitability determination. If the Secretary \ndetermines that Yucca Mountain is unsuitable or cannot meet NRC \nlicensing standards, then, according to the substitute amendment, the \nSecretary must notify Congress and the State of Nevada to cease all \nactivities at the repository site and report to the Congress within 6 \nmonths on the need for additional legislation dealing with nuclear \nwaste.\n  What the substitute amendment remains silent on is this question: \nWhat happens to the interim storage facility in this case? The \nSecretary has already submitted a license application to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, but no construction has started as yet. In that \ncase, the silence in the substitute amendment means that the Secretary \nis authorized and in fact is required to go forward in Nevada. In fact, \nthe provisions of the substitute amendment, perhaps unintentionally, \nturn the interim storage facility into a runaway train. Recall that the \nstatutory limit for the interim storage facility in the substitute is \ntied to what is needed to get you to the date when the permanent \nrepository opens. If the permanent repository suddenly moves 30 years \ninto the future because of a decision that Yucca Mountain is \nunsuitable, these provisions could be construed as sanctioning moving \nan extra 90,000 metric tons of spent fuel to Nevada. This is \nunacceptable.\n\n  The first provision added to the substitute by my amendment would fix \nthis problem. It terminates the Secretary's authority to move forward \non an interim storage facility at the site in Nevada if Yucca Mountain \nfails as a candidate for a permanent repository during the process of \nmaking the suitability determination. The Secretary must then make a \npreliminary designation of one or more alternative sites within the \nnext 24 months.\n  The third and fourth points for potential failure of Yucca Mountain \nas a repository candidate is during the two-step Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission licensing process. Suppose that during this process the NRC \nconcludes it is not possible to issue a license for a repository at \nYucca Mountain. Under the substitute amendment, the construction and \noperation of the interim storage facility continue unabated.\n  So the second provision added to the substitute by the amendment that \nI am offering today would try to fix this problem. If Yucca Mountain \nfails to pass muster at the NRC, then all construction and operation of \nthe interim storage facility is stopped except for safety-related \nsurveillance and maintenance.\n  As with the previous case, the Secretary must then make a preliminary \ndesignation of one or more sites within the next 24 months and must, in \naddition, make recommendations to Congress about what to do with the \ninterim storage facility. But in this case, it takes the enactment of \nanother law by Congress to restore any authority to\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\nresume construction or resume shipments to the interim storage \nfacility.\n  Could there be nuclear waste stored at the interim storage facility \nat this point? Yes, there could. If the NRC concludes that Yucca \nMountain cannot be licensed after the first 20 months of its \ndeliberations on DOE's license application for the repository, then the \ninterim storage facility will contain some amount of spent nuclear \nfuel. The same situation can also occur under current law. It is \npossible for the MRS to have its operation suspended because of failure \nto license a permanent repository after the MRS has received spent \nnuclear fuel.\n  But if you are troubled by the fact that there is a possibility that \nwaste could be shipped to Nevada before the geologic repository is open \nfor shipments, then you are against one of the fundamental premises of \nthis bill; that is, that it is acceptable to provide for an interim \nstorage solution linked to the repository prior to the opening of the \nrepository. Whether or not you think this is acceptable is, of course, \nfor each Senator to decide. If the program were close to a successful \nopening of the repository today, I would personally be in favor of \nwaiting a few more years. But since the date is now 2010 or potentially \nbeyond that date if we do not fix some of the other problems with the \nprogram in this bill, I believe that an interim storage solution is \nacceptable with the right safeguards.\n  In the case of the amendment that I am offering here, one of the \nsafeguards is to face this issue squarely and to make Congress decide \nwhat to do and then to enact another law before the Secretary can act. \nIn this way at every stage in the process where Yucca Mountain can \nfail, my amendment would stop the interim storage facility in its \ntracks or cancel it outright.\n  The probability of Yucca Mountain failing is probably not great, \nparticularly after the suitability determination by the Department of \nEnergy in the year 2000. But that probability is also not zero. The 5-\nmile tunnel has been dug through the mountain. There is more water \ninside the mountain than was previously thought to be the case. Maybe \nthis is significant; maybe it is not. There is a second east-west \ntunnel that will go through the exact area under the western side of \nthe mountain where most of the waste will be placed. The east-west \ncrossing will not occur until after the viability assessment but is \ncritical to the suitability determination. The western slope of the \nmountain receives more rainfall than the eastern side. Does this mean \nthat there will be even more water under the mountain where the waste \nwill be placed? Enough pause to make the mountain fail as a repository \nsite? No one knows at this point. That is why we are characterizing the \nmountain in the first place. The ultimate answer will not be known \nuntil after the window, in the current substitute amendment, for making \na final and irrevocable decision on proceeding with the interim storage \nfacility in Nevada.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the problem in the substitute of not \npermitting us to deal with the failure of Yucca Mountain as a candidate \nsite at any point at which it can occur, there is the problem of the \nautomatic default to Nevada if another site for an interim storage \nfacility is not picked within 24 months. Under the substitute \namendment, an interim storage site in Nevada is established regardless \nof whether the Yucca Mountain site is suitable or not, and the site is \nchanged only if Congress and the President can produce another law \nproviding for an alternative site within 24 months.\n  Realistically, Mr. President, passing another nuclear waste law from \nscratch in 24 months is not going to happen. Consider that we have been \nworking on this bill and its predecessors for substantially longer than \nthat. The nuclear industry spent a great deal lobbying this effort in \nthe last Congress and came up with no solution. Does anybody believe \nthat they would make any kind of effort like that if there was an easy \nanswer to their problem, which this bill now provides no matter what \nhappens? So, the provision contained in subsection 204(C)(2) of the \nbill is fatally flawed on two counts. If Yucca Mountain fails, the \npractical result is that the waste goes to Nevada, no matter what.\n\n  I do not think that any reasonable person should vote for the \nsubstitute amendment with this provision in it. It is not sound policy \nand it is certainly not fair to the people of Nevada.\n  There are lots of ways to ensure that the President acts \nexpeditiously in finding an alternative site and proposing legislation \nto Congress. The chairman of the Senate Energy Committee has alluded, \nin previous remarks, to discussions that we have had as to whether a \nmechanism such as a base closure or realignment commission could \ndevelop a set of recommendations that would be forwarded to Congress \nfor action. There are, no doubt, other mechanisms that could work \nequally well. But I think the principle has to be that any default \nmechanism we propose has to be workable and has to be fair, if it is \nactually invoked. I think the scheme in S. 104, the substitute for S. \n104, fails on that point.\n  I will conclude these remarks by reiterating the basic principles \nbehind the amendment with respect to how interim storage should relate \nto the permanent repository. First, siting an interim storage facility \nnext to the Yucca Mountain site is acceptable, but--and this is \ncrucial--only as long as that is where the permanent repository is \ngoing to be built.\n  Second, we should not start construction on an interim storage site \nin Nevada until Yucca Mountain has passed the suitability determination \nphase of site characterization. That phase ends with the completion of \nthe environmental impact statement for the repository and issuance of \nthe record of decision.\n  Third, if Yucca Mountain is disqualified as a repository site at any \npoint during the process, we should stop any interim storage facility \nat the site in its tracks. The search for a new interim storage site \nshould then be part of an overall process of looking for a new \nrepository site as well.\n  I do not expect my colleagues from Nevada to agree with all these \nprinciples. I realize they are implacable in their opposition to the \nidea of interim storage in Nevada. I oppose the proposition as set \nforth in the substitute amendment, unless my amendment being offered \ntoday is agreed to. But I urge Senators who, like me, would like to \nhave the chance to vote for a good nuclear waste bill, one that has \nwhat I think is the right relationship between the two facilities, to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we set aside \nthe Bingaman amendment and go back to the pending Domenici amendment, \nwhich has been brought before the Senate previously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 42\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that the parliamentary \nsituation is that the Domenici amendment has been offered in my behalf \nby the chairman, and that it has had an amendment added to it, so that \npending before the Senate is the Domenici amendment with an amendment \nthereto, and also the Bingaman amendment, and others? And that at some \npoint we will vote on the amendment to the Domenici amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe whatever needs to be said about my amendment, \nwhich is clearly a budget issue, has been said. From what I understand, \nmy amendment is not controversial. If there is controversy, it has to \ndo with the amendment to my amendment; not with it. So I would like to \ntake no longer than 10 minutes, and if the Chair will tell me when I \nhave used the time, I would not want to take any more time than that, \nof the Senate, to speak on the bill.\n  When Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, we created \na contract with the country's taxpayers that the Government of the \nUnited States would accept responsibility for waste from the reactors \nproviding them with power across these United States. We have now \nwatched for 15 years while the date for this permanent geological \nrepository has moved from an original target of 1998 to the current \nearliest possible date of 2010. Even though progress at Yucca Mountain \nin\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\nthe last few years has finally been significant, the taxpayers impacted \nby their regional utilities are faced with continued storage of high-\nlevel waste at 80 sites in 41 States. Many of those storage sites are \nnear population centers and significant funds are now being expended to \nkeep those multiple sites safe and secure. Many of those sites are \nnearly full; 23 will be full in 1998, 1 year from now.\n  Incidentally, nuclear energy is still important in the United States. \nWhile we are not adding any nuclear capacity to our electric generating \nsystem, about 20 percent of the Nation's electrical power is nuclear \nenergy and a failure to promptly act in that regard could, indeed, \naffect the viability of one-fifth of our Nation's electrical supply. \nThat is not a small amount.\n  Senate bill S. 104, the bill before us, provides a comprehensive plan \nfor the Federal Government to meet its obligation to provide a safe \nplace for the Nation's spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste. It \ncontinues the path toward a permanent geological repository that is \nbeing explored at Yucca Mountain, and provides a critical intermediate \nstep to relieve the pressure at those 80 sites by building an interim \nstorage facility near Yucca Mountain. I voted last year for S. 1936, \nand S. 104 traces its parentage to S. 1936. But, when S. 104 was \nintroduced in the Energy Committee this year, it contained improvements \nover S. 1936. I commend Chairman Murkowski, and those who have worked \nwith him, for their diligent, bipartisan efforts over the last few \nweeks to work with many of our colleagues to further improve S. 104.\n  S. 104 was a good bill in February and it is a better bill in April. \nS. 104 now includes realistic dates for action on the interim storage \nsite. This bill now provides even more time, after the department has \nfinalized its viability decision on Yucca Mountain, before the start of \nconstruction of the interim site. S. 104 now includes improved risk-\nbased radiation standards that involve the Environmental Protection \nAgency in the process.\n  S. 104 applies a HAZMAT-type approach to transportation. The \nhazardous material processes of our law and procedures are going to \nhold true in the transportation arena. And a careful balancing of State \nand Federal laws allowing preemption by State and local laws only where \nState intransigence prevents the Federal purpose from being \naccomplished.\n  The new transportation provision in this bill, coupled with years of \nimpressive demonstrations on the safety of nuclear waste shipments, \nshould completely address the concerns that some continue to express on \ntransportation issues. These and other changes make the current version \nof S. 104 significantly better than our previous approaches. S. 104 is \nnow truly a bipartisan approach to solving this problem of immense \nnational impact. At a time in our history when fiscal responsibility is \nunder intense scrutiny, passage of S. 104 is critical, from a financial \nperspective as well as the contractual responsibilities and safety \nissues that it addresses. The current suit against the Department of \nEnergy by States and utilities may require the payment of significant \npenalties. Taxpayers will bear the burden for all these penalties. If \nthe court rules that the Department of Energy, thus the U.S. \nGovernment, has breached its contractual obligation and penalties are \nassessed, they will come from the taxpayers of this country. And the \nratepayers, who happen to also be taxpayers, are already bearing the \nburden for storage of waste at the present 80 sites in this country. \nThe financial impact of not moving ahead with S. 104 is very, very \nsignificant.\n  I have been very critical, not alone, with many others, of the \nadministration and the Department of Energy in recent years, for their \ninaction and lack of leadership on the critical issues surrounding \nnuclear waste policy. The Department has taken the view that they are \nfree of any obligation until a repository is ready. At the same time, \nutility companies are collecting fees from ratepayers to ensure the \nreadiness of the storage capability. This is simply bad faith on the \npart of the Department. S. 104 resolves the gridlock which has \nparalyzed the Department and the nuclear industry in this country for \nmany years.\n  S. 104 continues the evaluation of the repository as an ultimate and \nfinal solution. But the creation of a monitored retrievable storage \ncapability and capacity might also allow the Department to consider \nsome of the suggestions developed in 1993 by the Department's task \nforce on an alternative program strategy for Yucca Mountain. I hope the \nDepartment will review that study and even view the monitored \nretrievable storage as providing some time to enable consideration of \nsome of the research proposals for approaches like transmutation, the \nchanging of the high-level waste to something less energy-possessed, \nand thus, perhaps, provide for some utility rather than storage \nforever. That could reduce the toxicity of the material, which is \nfinally emplaced in the repository.\n  I hope the administration will reevaluate their stated resistance to \nearlier versions of S. 104. This bill represents a bipartisan approach \nto a national problem. It now addresses the concerns stated by the \nadministration with previous versions. S. 104 would give the country \nwhat it has sought for 15 years, a well-defined path on the nuclear \nwaste issue, one that we can truly do, do safely, and do within a \nreasonable period of time. Furthermore, we honor the commitments made \nin 1982 to the citizens who depend upon nuclear power, who have been \npaying for this solution ever since then.\n  Incidentally, just as an aside, it is not as if we have not been \ntrying for the permanent repository. We have spent in excess of $6 \nbillion and we have not yet finished the characterization of the site. \nAlthough some real headway was made in the last 18 months, for which we \ncan be grateful to the man who led that, Mr. Dan Dreyfus, who is no \nlonger with the Department of Energy--but, essentially, after about $6 \nbillion and continued spending at a very elaborate amount each year, we \nare still a few years away from that permanent, long-lasting \nrepository. In the meantime, problems with the short-term storage \ncontinue to mount.\n  I compliment the chairman of the Energy Committee. This is a good \nsolution. I hope it passes with sufficient votes for the President's \nthreatened veto not to be sustained. But, in any event, it is worth his \neffort to see that we have found a good, bipartisan, American solution \nto a truly big American problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the status? How much \ntime is remaining on the amendment we are debating?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 25 minutes on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. On the other side of the proposition, if I might inquire \nof the distinguished Senator who is presiding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 19 minutes and \n46 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am wondering, since I speak in opposition, if I might \nget time either yielded from the time of the Senator from Alaska or the \nSenator from New Mexico? I was not aware that there was not time \nallocated to those who oppose the amendment. If that is the state of \nthe parliamentary situation, I ask for 10 minutes, if there is that \nmuch time available. I do not think I will need that much time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I perhaps will not require all the \ntime.\n  I do not, Mr. President, want to take much time to talk about the \nmerits of S. 104 because, as we will point out later, S. 104 is a very \nbad piece of legislation and, in my view, is a policy disaster. It is \nunnecessary. There are provisions that would preempt Federal and State \nlaw, standards, viability, transportation--there are many, many things \nthat could be said about the legislation, and I will address each of \nthose arguments with some particularity.\n  I must say that I am constrained to address the issue of the lawsuit, \nbecause we hear a lot about the lawsuit. The lawsuit was decided before \nour votes were cast last year on S. 1936, but I think it is curious and \nrevealing, revealing as to the true motives of this bill. Nothing in S. \n104 deals with the lawsuits.\n  This Senator believes that ratepayers who are in a position where \nthey may\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\nincur additional expense for storage because of the unavailability of a \npermanent repository in 1998 are entitled to relief. I do not think \nratepayers ought to pay twice. I have introduced legislation each year \nthat I have been a Member of Congress to express that view. It is \ncurious, Mr. President, the utilities who drive the policy in this--\nthis is the nuclear utilities bill--do not want to talk about that. As \nrecently as a couple of weeks ago, the Secretary of the Department of \nEnergy acknowledged that the Department wanted to talk about \ncompensation to utilities who will incur additional expense because \nthey will be storing beyond what was contemplated in 1982 as a 1998 \nacceptance date. So this legislation does nothing with respect to \ncompensation or to provide relief for ratepayers, and the fact that it \ndoes not makes the motive so abundantly clear. This is all about \ngetting the waste out to Nevada, irrespective of environmental or other \npolicy considerations.\n  Let me talk, if I may, very briefly, about the substitute as it deals \nwith the mill tax levy. Current law provides that the utilities must \npay into the nuclear waste trust fund on the basis of 1 mill per \nkilowatt hour of nuclear power generated. It goes into a trust fund. \nThat is paid only so long as that utility generates nuclear power.\n  If you look at this line, Mr. President, the mill fee payment line, \nyou will notice it rapidly declines between now and the year 2033, and \nthe reason for that is because every currently licensed nuclear reactor \nin America will be closed by 2033. Their license period will expire. So \nwith each closure of a reactor, less is being paid into the fund.\n  The obligation, however, in terms of dealing with the issue of \nnuclear waste goes out to the year 2071, so that you can see that there \nis another 38 years beyond 2033 that there is a responsibility to make \npayments dealing with the waste, and there will be no money coming in.\n  Currently, the Department estimates that the nuclear waste trust fund \nis underfunded between $4 billion and $8 billion currently. If it is \nunderfunded, I respectfully submit that you do not need a degree from \nthe Wharton School of Finance to know who is going to make up the \nshortfall. It is the American taxpayers who are going to make it up. So \nthe current law says with respect to the mill levy and how much it will \nbe, is that the Secretary will make a recommendation when it needs to \nbe adjusted, and unless the Congress or one House rejects that \nrecommendation, that will go into effect. It was a law not written by \nthe Nevada delegation. It dates back to the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct.\n  Here is what is done to change all of that. In the original \nsubstitute, we changed the burden so that now any change to increase \nthe rate of mill-tax collection, rather than being enacted unless there \nis a rejection by one House, it requires an affirmative burden to pass \nboth Houses of Congress.\n  As the distinguished occupant of the Chair knows, based upon his \nconsiderable legislative experience, it is far more difficult to pass a \npiece of legislation than to object to it.\n  So that is the nub of this. It will be virtually impossible if the \nutilities object to an increase in the mill levy to get that on because \nit will require both Houses of Congress to affirmatively act on a \nresolution.\n  In the substitute that was offered by the able chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, all budget points of order were waived. So the Senator from \nNew Mexico, and appropriately so, sought an amendment in the first \ndegree to restore a budget point of order, and I have no quarrel with \nthat.\n  The second degree, in effect, provides that still both Houses must \napprove any increase, and so, in my judgment, this is a provision that \nis designed to provide relief for the utilities to leave the nuclear \nwaste fund underfunded by billions and billions of dollars, and long \nafter any Member who currently serves in this body or the other body \nleaves, the American taxpayer is going to get the short end of the \nstick.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, that no one would disagree if they are \nhonest with their original position that it was understood that the \nnuclear utilities would undertake an expense of all of the cost of \nnuclear waste disposal. That was an obligation they agreed to do and \nthat is why the mill tax on each kilowatt hour was imposed, that is why \nthe nuclear waste trust fund. But through this substitute, we have a \nsituation that will exacerbate the shortfall. It is said there is $8 \nbillion in the trust fund, but, Mr. President, from 2033 until 2071, \nnothing comes into the trust fund because all of the reactors that are \ncurrently licensed are shut down. That is the buildup, and that is what \nthis yellow line indicates, because it begins to build up and it, too, \ndeclines as the expenses are incurred and the revenues into the fund \ndecrease.\n  So this is a bad, bad amendment, and I urge that it be rejected. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And the other side has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 19 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not have need for further discussion. I wonder if \nthe other side would consider yielding back their time since we are \ngoing to have a rollcall vote on this tomorrow.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me ask my colleague if he cares to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield back time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am wondering, I might say to the chairman, at one point \nwe had been told that one of our other colleagues may want to speak, \nand I refer to the ranking member on the committee. I do not know if \nthat is still the case. May we suggest the absence of a quorum and \ncheck with him?\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if we can withhold that. Maybe we can set \nthis aside and go ahead and work on the Bingaman amendment. Would that \nsave time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Anything that moves us saves time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and we return to the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may, I would appreciate it if we could find out \nif there is going to be any further Members wishing to speak on the \nDomenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 31\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, first of all, let me spend a little \ntime thanking the efforts of Senator Bingaman from New Mexico for his \nefforts on this bill. He and his staff have worked very, very hard. I \nthink what we have up to this point is a much better piece of \nlegislation as a consequence of the efforts of Senator Bingaman and his \nstaff. In the committee markup, as I recall, Senator Bingaman had \namendments touching about eight different issues, and we were able to \neventually accommodate the Senator from New Mexico on seven of those. \nWe unfortunately could not accept all the amendments, but we certainly \nresolved to work with him and his staff and continue to do so as we \ndebate the substitution, and the Bingaman amendment that is before us.\n\n  I think we have made progress. Progress was made on licensing \nrequirements for the temporary storage facility. Progress was made in \nthe application of NEPA. Progress was made on leasing standards for a \npermanent repository. Progress was made on preemption of other laws, \nand certainly progress was made on nuclear waste fee requirements.\n  I think it is fair that we agree that Nevada should be chosen as the \npermanent repository. I was a little confused in his statement where he \nimplied that it was unfair that Nevada would necessarily be chosen as \nthe last, I guess the last possible choice or the choice of last \nresort, or words to that effect.\n  We have 50 States out there and nobody wants it. I have said time and \ntime again, you can't throw it up in the air, it is going to come down \nsomewhere. So I think it is imperative that\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\nwe recognize that we have to choose a site, and that site is going to \nbe objected to by the delegation from that State.\n  We have chosen a permanent repository in Nevada, assuming that it \nmeets the requirements. Yucca Mountain was chosen after looking at \nother sites, other sites in other States.\n  Nevada is the preferred site for a repository. Nevada has been \nselected and, as a consequence, we have 5 miles of tunnel that have \nbeen completed there. We have expended $6 billion. We are committed, \nprobably, by the time we are complete to spend up to $30 billion. So \nthat is a given. I would say we agree Nevada should be chosen for an \ninterim facility if the viability assessment for the permanent \nrepository at Yucca Mountain is positive, and I think that is, more or \nless, the opinion of my friend from New Mexico.\n  I think it is further apparent we agree that the President should \nhave time to pick an alternative site, even in the event that Yucca \nMountain is determined not to be viable as a permanent repository.\n  We have come a remarkable distance toward total agreement. \nUnfortunately, we have this one area where we have not been able to \nagree and I think that is, of course,the substance of the Bingaman \namendment.\n  I think what we have here, in our opinion, and I tried to cite this \nearly in our debate, is an effort to try and get this resolved informed \nby past debates on this subject and the history of the issue. If there \nis any way out of a conclusion to address the disposition of this \nwaste, somebody is going to find it, Mr. President.\n  We clearly see a lack of direction from the administration on this. I \npersonally communicated in three specific letters to the President \nasking what the administration's position is. The administration, in \nall fairness, simply does not have a position.\n  You can look at some of the rhetoric that has come out of some of the \nnewspapers relative to the administration's position. It is kind of \nsurprising to comment on whether they are a little bit naive or not \nwell informed, but from the Thursday, April 10, Congress Daily, White \nHouse Council on Environmental Quality Chairwoman Kathleen McGinty said \nyesterday that the administration would be ``loathe to consider'' \nlegislation that would force the Energy Department's hand in building \nthe temporary storage facility before it knows the waste would be able \nto stay at Yucca Mountain. ``Loathe to consider'' legislation that \nwould force the Energy Department's hand in building the temporary \nstorage facility before it knows the waste would be able to stay at \nYucca Mountain.\n  That is totally inaccurate because if one looks at the schedule in \nthe bill, in my substitute, if Yucca is viable by December 1998, a \nviability assessment will go to the President. March 1999 would be the \ndeadline for a Presidential determination on viability.\n  If there is no negative determination, the Nevada test site is \ndetermined to be the site. The reason for that is obvious. If we do not \nname a site, we are going to be drifting around here where we are \ntoday.\n  April 30, 1999, the Secretary files licensing application with NRC.\n  Approximately August of the year 2000, construction begins when the \nEIS is complete.\n  No later than June 30 in the year 2003, fuel acceptance begins.\n  Now, how can the administration interpret that this legislation would \nforce the Energy Department's hand in building a temporary storage \nbefore it knows the waste would be able to stay at Yucca Mountain?\n  Construction cannot begin until August in the year 2000. Somebody \nmight say, ``Well, Senator, what's the big deal here? Why not wait for \nYucca Mountain to be done?'' Well, we are told by the Secretary of \nEnergy, Hazel O'Leary, that it will be the year 2015 before Yucca is \ncompleted, certified, licensed, and ready to take fuel.\n  That is why, Mr. President. The ``why'' is that the time is now. We \nhave a contractual commitment to take this waste beginning next year, \n1998. We made a contract with the nuclear power industry. We have \ncollected $13 billion from the ratepayers of this country. They are \nexpecting performance, and the Government has not any capability. The \nGovernment is not going to be able to accept that waste. And the \nGovernment is going to be liable for damages.\n  Every Member of this body has an obligation to minimize the \nGovernment's liability associated with those damages. That is what a \ntemporary repository at Yucca Mountain is all about: expediting the \nprocess. So if there is anybody in anybody's office who is \nmisconstruing the timing of this--Katie McGinty, of the White House \nCouncil on Environmental Quality, has somehow gotten an interpretation \nthat we would force the Energy Department's hand in building a \ntemporary storage facility before it knows the waste would be able to \nstay at Yucca Mountain. It is totally inaccurate; and that is an \nunderstatement, Mr. President.\n  Let us talk about Yucca not being viable.\n  If Yucca is not viable, September of the year 2000 would be the \ndeadline for the President to designate a site.\n  February of the year 2001 would be the deadline for Congress to \napprove a site.\n  And if no site is designated and approved, the Nevada test site is \nthe site.\n  March 2001 the Secretary files a license. July 2002, construction \nbegins.\n  September 2005, fuel acceptance begins.\n  So this is where Senator Bingaman and I have our departure. We feel \nwe have to have a bottom line on this debate. We feel that we must \nfirmly chart a predictable and sure course to a safe, interim storage \nfacility and get it done now, not next year, not in 2 years or 5 years \nor 2001 or 2010 or 2011. I do not want to be standing here in another 4 \nour 5 years and have to find that we are still hung up on a decision.\n  Congress dealt with this issue in 1982. We thought it had resolved \nthe problem forever. In 1987, we had to deal with it again. At that \ntime we were told we had resolved nuclear waste once and for all.\n  This is the problem, Mr. President. This is the legacy of the \nprogram. If it is possible to delay a decision, a decision gets \ndelayed. It has been in progress so far. If it is possible to push the \ndecision off to somebody else's watch, that is what is going to happen. \nAnd that has been suggested time and time again. If the process is \nvulnerable to political pressure, then political pressure will be used.\n  We have learned the hard way that any trap door left anywhere in the \nprocess inevitably, Mr. President, gets used. And it will happen in \nthis case. Any weakness in the approach gets exploited. That is why we \nhave spent $6 billion over 15 years and the Federal Government is still \nunable to meet its promise to take the waste in 1998. I implore my \ncolleagues, let us not be fooled again. Let us face up to our \nobligation.\n  Our bill, Senate bill 104, is destined to make sure there are no trap \ndoors here, no copouts, no more delays. This chart shows our selection \nprocess. No matter what happens, the loop is closed. It is a box. Every \ndecision leads to a safe, central storage facility.\n  Let me explain to you this effort. Here we sit in 1997, as you see \nover in the left-hand corner of the chart, with the status quo. We have \nwaste in 81 sites in 40 States. That is just the harsh reality. If we \ndo not do anything, that is where it will remain. Your reactors may go \ndown for lack of storage. Your waste is going to remain.\n  If you want the waste to move, it has to be transported. That is a \ngiven. We can do that safely. We have transported 2,400 individual \nshipments.\n  So let me follow the red line from next year when we are under \ncontract, the Federal Government, to accept the waste. If Yucca \nMountain is viable for a permanent repository, then we have one safe \ncentral storage site, it is over. That is one end of the square.\n  Let us go up. If Yucca Mountain is not viable for a permanent \nrepository, what happens then? Well, then the President can pick an \nalternative site. OK. And Congress will ratify it, and we come right \nback with a square box, one safe, central storage site.\n  If the President does not select an alternative site; in other words, \nif the President says--``Well, I just won't act''--our bill deals with \nthat possibility. If the President does not act, then where does it go? \nIt defaults. It defaults to the Nevada test site. That is\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\nevidently a problem for my friend from New Mexico.\n  But on the other hand, history of this matter suggests that if we \nleave it to the Bingaman amendment--and let me refer to the next \nchart--this is the exposure. And this is where Senator Bingaman and I \npart company, because, if Yucca Mountain is viable, we are fine. If \nYucca Mountain is not viable, then the Secretary picks an alternative \nsite. But if he does not, if he does not do that, no site is chosen and \nwe are right back to where we are. We are leaving it where it is. Let \nme run through that again to make sure everybody understands it.\n  This is the difference between the Bingaman and our particular \napproach with S. 104. If Yucca Mountain is viable, we have a central \nstorage site, no problem. But if Yucca Mountain is not, the Secretary \npicks an alternative storage site. That is fine if he does--if he \ndoes--Mr. President. But if he does not, we are right back where we \nwere.\n\n  Look at the other chart.\n  That is the difference between the two particular versions of this \namendment. We give the President the authority to pick an alternative \nsite. Congress ratifies the site, and we are all right. But if the \nPresident does not select an alternative site, it goes back to the \nNevada test site.\n  That is where we are, Mr. President. I think it is fair to say that \nour concern with the Bingaman amendment is that in our opinion it \ncreates the trap door, it opens the process to political pressure. It \ninvites indecision, and it invites pressures that will be apparent to \ndo nothing so we will all be back where we are now, 40 States, 81 \nsites, reactors potentially shutting down because storage sites are \nfilled up, and the stuff sits. It still is not moving.\n  The Department of Energy tells us that the odds of Yucca Mountain \nbeing suitable as a permanent repository are good. I think that they \nused the odds currently of 90 percent. Well, that is pretty good around \nhere. So the President's finding of suitability looks pretty good. But \nit is still at his own discretion. I ask all of my colleagues and those \nin their offices who listen, do you think the Senators, our good \nfriends from Nevada, will try to influence the President's decision? \nSure they will. They should. We acknowledge that. Wouldn't you if you \nwere placed in that situation?\n  If the President decides Yucca Mountain is not viable, not a viable \nsite for a permanent repository, the need for an interim repository \nbecomes even more desperate. The waste simply cannot stay where it is, \nMr. President, in 80 sites in 41 States. We cannot afford to start \nclosing nuclear plants that have run out of room for spent fuel \nbecause, remember, Yucca, if it is viable, if it is licensable, is not \ngoing to be ready until the year 2015.\n  Under the Bingaman amendment, if the President were to determine that \nYucca Mountain is not viable, then all the Secretary needs to do to \nprevent the designation of a central storage site is to simply fall \nback to another site; that is my point, leave the waste where it is.\n  There is another area that I am concerned about in the Bingaman \namendment, and that is even if the Secretary does pick a site, the \ntools provided to make that site a reality are somewhat limited.\n  Of course, we know that the Secretary does not have the authority to \nwithdraw land for an interim repository. The Secretary does not have \nthe authority to condemn land for an interim repository. I am fearful, \nunder Senator Bingaman's amendment, under this goal, we would not be \nable to reach our mutual goal, which is something where we are both on \nthe same track. We want this waste to move. But we both want it to move \nnow.\n  With the loopholes in here, I am just convinced they would be used. \nWith the U.S. court of appeals ruling that DOE has a binding legal \nobligation to take the spent fuel, Mr. President, I just cannot believe \nthat we can accept more failures, more runaround, more delays. We \ncannot expose the taxpayer to the liability of more damages resulting \nfrom the court cases that are going to come up when we are not able to \ntake this spent fuel next year.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to settle for a failure.\n  The U.S. Senate should not settle for a failure. I think we can do \nbetter, and I hope that we can work out, if you will, some way to \naddress the concerns of my friend from New Mexico. As we look at this \nchart and recognize--here they are, Mr. President. These are the 80 \nsites throughout the Nation, in 41 States. They are the sites that have \na problem. If we don't relieve this problem with meaningful legislation \nand if we do it with legislation that provides a trapdoor or a copout \nor an exit that is convenient, politically or otherwise, it is going to \nbe used. So our liability and our damages are going to be higher, and \nthe fuel is going to stay right where it is now, at 80 sites in 41 \nStates, instead of getting on with the process that we have outlined in \nS. 104, which is to close the loop.\n  Let me show you one more time, Mr. President, what we have attempted \nto do here. We have attempted to force this body to make a decision \nonce and for all. All the safeguards are in here, Mr. President. I want \nto refer to them again. Under the substitute, if Yucca Mountain is \nviable, OK, starting in 1998, in December, the viability assessment \ngoes to the President. March 1999 is the deadline for the viability \ndetermination by the President. If there is no negative determination, \nthe Nevada test site is the site. That is, if Yucca is viable. On March \n30, 1999, the Secretary files license application with NRC. In \napproximately August 2000 construction begins when the EIS is \ncompleted.\n  The importance of that, Mr. President, is to begin to allay the \nconcerns of the White House and Katie McGinty. They have been loath to \nconsider building a temporary storage site before it knows that the \nwaste would be able to stay at Yucca Mountain. I think that takes care \nof that.\n  If Yucca Mountain is not viable, September 2000 is the deadline the \nPresident has to designate a site. So he has time. Then another \ndeadline for Congress, February 2001, is the deadline for Congress to \napprove the site. If no site is designated or approved, OK, it goes \nback to the Nevada test site. But, even then, there are more delays. In \nMarch 2001, the Secretary files a license. In July 2002, construction \nbegins. In September 2005, fuel acceptance begins.\n  But, Mr. President, I swear that if we do not close in this loop, we \nwon't get the job done. We know that's what the administration \nprefers--not to address it at this time. We have already seen the smoke \nand mirrors relative to their side of the story.\n  I will run through the difference I have with Senator Bingaman's \namendment. If Yucca is viable, OK, the same, except that Senator \nBingaman would add a new provision, which is that after the Department \nof Energy files a licensing application in the year 2001 and NRC finds \nthat Yucca cannot be licensed for some reason, they suspend operations \nat the interim facility and the NRC has 24 months to recommend another \ninterim site or restart operations at the NTS.\n  But if Yucca Mountain is not viable, Mr. President--here is where the \nbear goes through the buckwheat--the deadline for the Secretary to \ndesignate an alternate site up here is February 2001. But what happens \nif he doesn't do it, Mr. President? I will tell you what happens. \nNothing. If he doesn't do his job in February of the year 2001, and no \nsite is designated, the stuff stays where it is, at 81 sites in 41 \nStates.\n  I think that should identify sufficiently for the Members the \ndifferences relative to Senator Bingaman's view of how to resolve this \nproblem and the view of the Senator from Alaska. I have the deepest \nrespect for my friend, but I am firmly convinced that we have to get it \nresolved, and if we don't do it now, it isn't going to be done. That \nloophole out there will be utilized and we will be back here another \nday, another month, another year on this same process.\n  Mr. President, I will be happy to try to work out some way to \naccommodate my friend from New Mexico. I reserve the remainder of my \ntime. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 3 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Alaska has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will need a few more minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Alaska, \nof course, be given equal time, if he would like that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I didn't hear that unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request was that the \nSenator from New Mexico be allowed to have an additional 3 minutes, \ntotaling 6 minutes, and also that the Senator from Alaska also have up \nto 6 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me clarify my understanding of the \nsituation. First of all, I agree with much of what was said by the \nSenator from Alaska. The amendment that I am offering here today does \nnot, in any way, interfere with the end result, as long as the \ndetermination is made at every step of the process that the Yucca \nMountain site is the appropriate site for a permanent repository of \nnuclear waste. If that decision is made, then we are in agreement. Then \nthe problem does not exist. It is only if a contrary decision is made \nthat we get into disagreement.\n  Let me clarify here that there is a difference in my understanding \nbetween the viability assessment, which is due to be completed on \nDecember 1, 1998, and the suitability determination, which is due to be \ncompleted on October 31 of the year 2000. I agree that as long as Yucca \nMountain is a suitable site and that suitability determination is made \nin the year 2000, then that is the site we ought to go forward with. So \nwe are in agreement there.\n  I think the question is, if we want to look at a permanent \nrepository, I think we choose Yucca Mountain, if it is suitable. If it \nis determined not to be suitable, then the question is, what do we do \nabout an interim facility?\n  Now, the only reason for putting an interim facility in Nevada is \nthat that is where the permanent repository is going to be. The Nuclear \nWaste Technical Review Board said in its report, ``If Yucca Mountain \nproves suitable for permanent repository development, then the \ncentralized storage facility should be located there as well.'' That \nmakes eminent sense to me. Let's have an interim storage facility \nthere, as long as it is decided that we are going to have a permanent \nrepository there. If we decide not to have a permanent repository \nthere, then, in my view, we ought to have the issue come back to \nCongress, come back to the President to make a decision on what we are \ngoing to do.\n  The reason I think it is so important that we do that is that I think \nthe end result is a different end result than the Senator from Alaska \nhas in mind. The Senator from Alaska is saying the end result is we \nhave to get this waste out of the present locations at these nuclear \npowerplants and move it to a central site. That is the end result he is \nlooking for. The end result I am looking for is that we need to have \ngeologic storage, permanent storage, of this waste. In my view, my \namendment has a much greater chance of getting us to geologic permanent \nstorage of this waste than his solution does.\n  His solution says that, regardless of what we decide about Yucca \nMountain as a permanent repository, we are going to put the waste in \nNevada in this interim site, and that's going to happen. There is no \nway to wiggle out of that. Once the suitability of the Yucca Mountain \nsite is determined, we are going to put the waste in Nevada. It is \ngoing to be on an interim site there, and there is no way to wiggle \nout. So we have accomplished our end result.\n  My view is that, fine, we moved the waste to Nevada, but it is on a \nslab of cement out in the middle of the desert. It is not in geologic \nstorage, not in safe storage, not in permanent storage. Therefore, we \nhave not solved the problem that we set out to solve for all these many \ndecades with regard to nuclear waste. The only way to get us to a \ngeologic repository for that waste, a permanent repository for that \nwaste, if the Yucca Mountain proves unsuitable, is to bring it back to \nCongress and the President and say, ``Choose another permanent \nrepository for this waste.'' That is what is going to have to happen. \nThat is what ought to have to happen. At that time, we also can decide \nwhat to do about an interim site.\n  But it makes no sense to me to be saying, look, if we decide Yucca \nMountain is not suitable, we decide we can't put the waste there in a \npermanent repository, we are still going to put all the waste there; we \nare going to put it in a central repository, and it is going to be in \nNevada because we earlier said it was going to be in Nevada. Granted, \nthe only reason we said that is because we are going to have a \npermanent repository there. Now we have decided if we can't have a \npermanent repository there, we can still put the waste there and get it \nout of these other States. I don't think that is fair to Nevada. I \ndon't think it is good public policy. So I say let's keep the two \nissues tied together. Let's say, if the permanent repository at Yucca \nMountain in Nevada is determined not to be a suitable facility, if we \ndecide that that site, Yucca Mountain, is not a suitable site for a \npermanent repository, then we need to put the brakes on with regard to \nusing this interim facility in Nevada and say, wait a minute, we have \nto pick another permanent repository. Let's also make a decision about \nan appropriate interim storage site.\n  So that's the difference that we have. I think it is a good-faith \ndifference. The great failing that I see with the substitute the way it \nnow stands is that if Yucca Mountain is determined not to be an \nappropriate permanent repository, then all of the pressures, the course \nof least resistance will be to move the waste to an interim site in \nNevada, put it on a cement slab out in the middle of the desert. That \nwill be the end of it. The pressure will be off. Congress will be under \nno obligation to do anything else. The President will be under no \nobligation to do anything else. The only people who will suffer, or \npotentially suffer, from this are the people of Nevada. I think that is \nnot a responsible public policy position for us to take. We need to \nfind another permanent repository if Yucca Mountain proves not to be \nthe right permanent repository.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Alaska has up to 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are so close, yet so far away in our \ndifferences here. I think it is fair to say that when the viability \nassessment is completely at the discretion of the President, we would \nall agree that it is subject to political pressures. I think we all \nagree that we have an obligation to make a decision. We have agreed to \nwithhold on a decision until the viability assessment is available. My \nfriend from New Mexico has indicated a concern about the viability and \nthe suitability. I am told that the suitability is 80 percent likely. \nViability is 90 percent. Those are very high odds.\n  The problem of how we resolve this and whether or not we are going to \nbe delaying this action again, I think, has to be related to the fact \nthat when we get the viability assessment, we either choose Nevada if \nit is positive, or give the President time to choose another site if it \nis negative.\n  Only if we are unable to choose another site--only then--would it go \nto Nevada. That would imply that the President wasn't doing his job, \nand that Congress wasn't capable of doing their job. And I think we \nboth agree that there would be a significant shirking of an obligation \nor duty. I am just fearful with the history of this that without some \nkind of closure that might happen. I believe my friend from New Mexico \nhas stated that the only reason for putting interim in Nevada is if \nYucca is permanent. But if Yucca doesn't pan out then we desperately \nneed an interim site, and I think we need it quickly because Yucca is \nthe year 2015 from being ready to accept waste. We have 80 sites in 41 \nStates, and we have lawsuits coming on, and damages coming on. From the \nlooks of this place, Congress doesn't make decisions very quickly.\n  Let me just say one more thing with regard to delay. Although we may \nnot know the ultimate site of an interim facility, there is one \nindisputable fact. We need a central temporary storage facility for our \nNation's nuclear waste. If Yucca Mountain is viable then it makes sense \nto put the material at the Nevada test site. If Yucca Mountain is not \nviable, it will take 50 or 60 years of process at a minimum to find and \nlicense another permanent repository site under our present permitting \nprocess. We cannot leave nuclear waste at\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\n80 sites around the country over this period of time. That is why the \ncrisis is here. The spent fuel pools at nuclear reactors were not \ndesigned for long-term storage.\n  Mr. President, in all due respect, Senate bill 104 was designed to \nmake sure there were no trapdoors, and that no matter what happens this \nloop is closed. And this decision has to lead to a safe central storage \nfacility ultimately at a permanent repository in Yucca Mountain.\n  So, Mr. President, the decision is ours. The time is now. Let's not \nshirk this duty and this responsibility by leaving an open-end \nalternative that I guarantee will be used.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time is up. I yield the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n\n\n                             SECTION 101(F)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to address a specific provision of \nthe Murkowski substitute amendment to Senate bill 104, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1997. This provision is also in the bill as \nintroduced, and was in similar legislation passed by this body in the \nlast session of Congress. This provision is of special importance to my \nState and I wish, therefore, to clarify its appearance in this \nimportant legislation. I refer specifically to section 101, entitled \n``Obligations of the Secretary of Energy,'' paragraph (f), which \nstates, ``Nothing in this act is intended to or shall be construed to \nmodify . . . obligations imposed upon the Federal Government by the \nU.S. District Court of Idaho in an order entered on October 17, 1995, \nin United States v. Batt (No. 91-0054-S-EJL).''\n  Mr. President, the consent order referred to in section 101 of S. 104 \nbinds the State of Idaho, through the Attorney General, and Gov. Philip \nE. Batt in his official capacity; the Department of Energy, through the \ngeneral counsel and assistant secretary for environmental management; \nand the Department of the Navy, through the general counsel and \ndirector, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program to certain terms and \nconditions to fully resolve all issues in the actions Public Service \nCo. of Colorado versus Batt and United States versus Batt.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the senior Senator from Idaho, my colleague, \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank my colleague for bringing the attention of \nthis body to an important provision of Senate bill 104; a provision of \nsignificance to the State of Idaho. Could you elaborate on the \nparticular relevance of this consent order settlement agreement to this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The consent order has a number of compliance points \nrequiring action by the U.S. Department of Energy at the Idaho National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory, which have bearing on the \noverall spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste management \nstorage and disposal program as structured in Senate bill 104. In \ngeneral terms, the consent order requires specific actions for \ntreatment, storage, disposal, or shipment offsite for disposal of spent \nfuel and waste at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \nLaboratory, and requires these actions to be performed according to a \ntimetable set down in the consent order.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to my colleague from Alaska for a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I understand that this consent order contains \nprovisions relating to transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, and high-\nlevel waste. Could you please describe the requirements that \nspecifically relate to commercial spent nuclear fuel?\n  Mr. CRAIG. As I know my colleague from Alaska is aware, the Idaho \nNational Engineering and Environmental Laboratory has, over the course \nof its history, received commercial spent nuclear fuel for research and \ndevelopment purposes. One of the largest receipts was the receipt of \nthe discharged core from the Three Mile Island nuclear powerplant in \nthe 1980's. Idaho has also received, and continues to store, expended \nfuel from naval nuclear reactors. One of the key provisions of the \nconsent order is that the DOE is ordered to remove all spent fuel, \nincluding naval spent fuel and Three Mile Island spent fuel from Idaho \nby January 1, 2035.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will my colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho, \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to my colleague for a question.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nam familiar with the important national security contribution made by \nthe Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program. The Idaho National Engineering \nand Environmental Laboratory contains a Navy facility called the \nexpended core facility. This facility receives the expended, or spent, \nnuclear cores from Navy vessels for examination and storage. I wonder \nif my colleague from Idaho will explain, for the benefit of our fellow \nSenators, how the consent order affects this important national \nsecurity mission.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The consent order limits shipments of naval spent nuclear \nfuel into Idaho. Specifically, the total number of shipments of naval \nspent fuel to Idaho through 2035 shall not exceed 575 shipments and \nshall not exceed 55 metric tons. Most relevant to our discussion of \nSenate bill 104, however, is the Department of Energy's commitment, \nthrough this settlement agreement, that naval spent fuel stored at the \nIdaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory on the date of \nthe opening of a permanent repository or interim storage facility shall \nbe among the early shipments of spent fuel to the first permanent \nrepository or interim storage facility.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to my colleague for a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In the course of deliberations on Senate bill 104, we \nhave debated the merits of exclusions for a number of Department of \nEnergy sites. Specifically, I am referring to exclusion from \nconsideration for selection as the interim storage site for commercial \nspent nuclear fuel under the provisions of this legislation. Does the \nconsent order we are discussing have any bearing on this question for \nIdaho?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Alaska is correct. The consent order \nsettlement agreement contains a provision that, except for a narrow \nexception for the treatment of graphite fuel from the Fort St. Vrain \nreactor in Colorado, the Department of Energy will make no shipments of \nspent fuel from commercial nuclear powerplants to the Idaho National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory. Therefore, selection of Idaho \nfor further commercial fuel storage would be inconsistent with and in \nviolation of the consent order.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to my colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho, \nfor bringing to the attention of this body the significance of the \nsection 101 reference to the Idaho settlement agreement consent order \nand its relevance to the legislation before us, Senate bill 104. I also \nwish to thank my colleague for his continued leadership, along with the \nSenator from Alaska, on this Nation's nuclear waste problem and for \nproposing the common sense solution embodied in this legislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Idaho for his contribution. \nIdaho and its citizens have been addressing the legacy of this Nation's \nnuclear defense missions and the products of its ongoing operations in \nthe Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program for many decades at the Idaho \nNational Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. I believe it is \nimportant to explain to my colleagues the relationship of this history, \nand its pending commitments, to the legislation before us.\n\n\n                             Section 101(g)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at page 11, lines 2-5 of the manager's \nsubstitute amendment, section 101(g) provides that ``subject to \nsubsection (f), nothing in this act shall be construed to subject the \nUnited States to financial liability for the Secretary's failure to \nmeet any deadline for the acceptance or emplacement of spent nuclear \nfuel or high-level radioactive waste.'' Is it the manager's intention \nthat this language prevent contract holders from recovering damages or \nother financial relief from the Government on account of DOE's failure \nto comply with the 1998 deadline established in section 302(a) of the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982?\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not the manager's intention that section 101(g) \nlimit in any way the rights of contract holders, their ratepayers, or \nthose agencies of the State governments that represent ratepayers, from \nenforcing any right they might have, including the right to hold the \nFederal Government liable financially, under the 1982 act and the \ncontracts executed pursuant thereto. Section 101(g) is expressly \nsubject to section 101(f), which makes clear that rights conferred by \nsection 302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 or by the \ncontracts executed thereunder are not affected by this bill, including \nsection 101(g). To the extent that act or the contracts established a \n1998 deadline and the DOE fails to meet that deadline, it is not the \nmanager's intent that the substitute amendment in any way restrict the \nrelief available to those damaged by the failure to meet the deadline.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it correct then that the manager does not intend that \nthe amendment would restrict the scope of remedies available to the \nplaintiffs in the litigation in which the Court of Appeals of the \nDistrict of Columbia has held that the 1998 deadline is a binding \nobligations of the Federal Government?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct. It is not the manager's intent that \nthe language of section 101(g) proscribe the court of appeals or any \nother court from awarding monetary relief or other financial remedies \nto those who have paid fees to the Government under the 1982 act and \nthe contracts, or those who will incur additional expense on account of \nthe DOE's failure to comply with any right conferred by 1982 act or the \ncontracts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If a deadline were imposed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nof 1997, as reflected by the substitute amendment, as well as by the \nNuclear Waste Policy of 1982 or the contracts executed thereunder, is \nit the manager's intention that section 101(g) would proscribe \nfinancial liability for failure to meet the deadline to the extent it \nis imposed by the 1982 act? For instance, if DOE were to fail to \ncommence the acceptance and emplacement of spent nuclear fuel and high \nlevel radioactive waste by November 30, 1999 or thereafter, would the \namendment proscribe a court from imposing financial liability on DOE if \na court ruled that DOE's inaction constituted a failure to comply with \nthe deadline established in section 302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct of 1982 and the contracts?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not the manager's intention that section 101(g) \nlimit the rights or remedies available under the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct of 1982 or the contracts executed thereunder. If a failure by DOE \nto comply with any deadline established in the amendment also \nconstituted a failure to comply with a deadline established by the 1982 \nact or a contract under that act, it is not the manager's intent that \nsection 101(g) modify the right of any contract holder to see any and \nall remedies otherwise available for the violation of the 1982 act or \nfor breach of the contract. It is the manager's intention that section \n101(f) preserve all of those rights, regardless of whether the same or \na similar obligation is expressed in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1997.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With respect to a deadline imposed for the first time in \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, is it the manager's intention \nthat section 101(g) proscribe a court order that the Secretary of \nEnergy comply with such deadline, or granting relief other than money \ndamages to contract holders?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not the manager's intent that section 101(g) \nproscribe anything other than financial liability for failure to meet a \ndeadline imposed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. To the extent \nother forms of relief are available for the Government's failure to \ncomply with a deadline imposed by the amendment, the manager does not \nintend that such a remedy be prohibited.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the manager's intention that section 101(g) limit \nthe liability of the United States for anything other than a failure to \nmeet a deadline? For instance, if the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 \nimposes an obligation which is not a deadline, such as the requirement \nto reimburse contract holders for transportable storage systems if DOE \nuses such systems as part of the integrated management system, is it \nthe manager's intention that that obligation not constitute a financial \nliability of the United States?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not the manager's intention that section 101(g) \nlimit the liability of the Federal Government for anything other than a \ndeadline. The manager does not intend that any other obligation imposed \nby the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 be affected by section 101(g).\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my understanding is that the \ndisposition of the S. 104 will take place tomorrow. We will have a vote \non Domenici, we will have a vote on Bingaman, and a vote on final \npassage. The Parliamentarian has set down I believe on Friday the \nvoting procedure. I might ask for the benefit of Members when we could \nanticipate votes to occur and the time between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the orders the votes are to occur \nbeginning at 9 a.m. and there will be 3 minutes between each vote. The \nvotes subsequent to the first vote will be 10 minutes in length.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I might be recognized in morning business for no more than 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith of New Hampshire pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 567 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am sure that most of my colleagues who \nhave watched this debate for the last week are of the opinion that \nafter some 5 days of debate that everything that can ultimately be said \nabout this legislation has been said, and I hate to disabuse them of \nthe notion but my colleague from Nevada and I are going to beg their \nindulgence and talk a little bit more about the substitute that has \nbeen offered by the Senator from Alaska.\n  It is my firm conviction that the belief of the scientific community \nis that this legislation for interim storage is unnecessary. That is \nthe conclusion advanced by the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. We \nhave talked about that a great deal. But the reason this is important \nis that this is the scientific community. This is not the Senator from \nNevada debating with our friends from Alaska, Idaho, or any other State \ndelegation. Not a single member of this Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard is a Nevadan. That is their position; that it is a fundamental \nflaw in this legislation. It is not necessary. It is not being \nrequested by the scientific community. It is not being supported by the \nscientific community, and quite to the contrary. The 1996 report says \nthat the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was reconstituted with \nnew members in 1997, a new chairman, and a number of new members. And \nthey reaffirmed the position of the technical review board a year ago \nin concluding that it is not necessary. It is not necessary. So it is \npremature. It is unwise. It is the worst of policy.\n  I only wish I were capable, Mr. President, of articulating with more \ninsight, more capacity, and with more persuasive force because it has \nbeen said here on the floor of the Senate over and over again that the \nNevada test site is the preferred alternative. Mr. President, there is \nnot one scintilla of evidence to suggest that.\n  Yucca Mountain is being characterized or studied for the permanent \nrepository. But there has been no scientific evaluation or judgment \nmade that the Nevada test site is a preferred alternative--none--\nbecause under the current law an interim storage facility cannot be \nestablished in Nevada, nor the State of the distinguished occupant\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\nof the chair, nor any other State until application is made for \nlicensure under the permanent site.\n  So there has been no search in a scientific sense to have a \ndetermination made as to an interim site. So anyone who thinks that \nthis is the product of analytical scientific reasoning needs to be \naware of the fact that there has been no study, no evaluation, no \nscientific analysis, nothing--absolutely nothing--that suggests that \nthe Nevada test site is a preferred alternative or a desired \nalternative; absolutely not because the focus in terms of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1982 is the permanent geological storage. And Yucca \nMountain, much to my dismay--I don't like this fact--but Yucca Mountain \nis being studied or characterized. And that is where the focus has been \nin terms of scientific study and analysis.\n  So I think it is important to make that clear distinction. It has \nbeen said that the Nevada test site has been used for previous testing \nprograms. That is true. But that is not to suggest that makes it a \npreferred or a better site than any one of a number of other \npossibilities around the country. I think we need to try to drive that \npoint home to my colleagues who are studying this issue and who are \ntrying to make some rational judgments based upon the debate we have \nhad over the last 5 days.\n  The substitute: It has been said that it is a better piece of \nlegislation than the one last year.\n  I suppose if a terminally ill man is told that he has 6 months to \nlive rather than 3 months to live, that is better news, but it is still \nnot a desirable result and certainly something that would cause little \nrejoicing.\n  This is a bad piece of legislation because it destroys a carefully \ncrafted, carefully constructed environmental protection legislative \nframework that has served America under both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents exceedingly well for the last 28 years or so.\n  It has been said by our friends who are arguing for this that we have \ntaken care of the problem of preemption. Those who followed the debate \nin the last Congress will recall that preemption was at the heart of \nthe issue, and it continues to remain so.\n  Here is what the law says. Let me just say that the nuclear utility \nlawyers ought to get an A-plus for being clever and disingenuous, \nbecause this is an exceedingly skillful bit of legalistic drafting that \nproduces a consequence that I think no fair-minded person could \nconclude. The substitute says that except as provided in a couple \nsections a law, regulation, order, or other requirement of a State, \npolitical subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe is preempted.\n  So the argument that is made in the Chamber is that we are only \npreempting State law. Not true, not true, not true, because under the \nlegislative system we have established for the environmental acts that \nhave been passed over the last nearly three decades, Federal \nlegislation is enacted whether we are talking about safe drinking \nwater, clean air, clean water, RCRA, in which the States are delegated \nthe ability to enforce if they enact legislation that is equal to or \ngreater than the Federal legislation.\n  It has been suggested the language that is used now in the new \nsection 501, found on page 59, of S. 104, the substitute, is just what \nwe have in HAZMAT. Not true, Mr. President, not true, not true. HAZMAT \nhas a provision that says except as provided in the appropriate \nsubsections unless authorized by another law of the United States, a \nrequirement of a State, political subdivision of a State, or an Indian \ntribe is preempted. The operative language ``unless authorized by \nanother law of the U.S.'' It is not by omission, inadvertence or \nhappenstance that operative language ``unless authorized by the U.S.'' \nhas been dropped, because it is that provision of law in the HAZMAT \ncode that says ``unless authorized by another law of the U.S.'' that \nenables a State statute responding to the delegation of authority given \nto it under Federal environmental law, that those State laws are \nprotected because they are authorized by Federal law.\n  So here is what we have. Let us forget for a moment what kind of \npassion one might have for nuclear waste and a sense, yes, gosh, it \nought to be sent somewhere. But let us just talk about policy. If this \nlegislation passes, Nevada will be the only State in the Union that \nwill be unable to enforce a State law enacted pursuant to an \nenvironmental delegation of authority.\n  Now, what conceivable rationale could possibly lead to that \nconclusion? It is very clear that this is nothing less than a \npreemption, and so we are talking about safe drinking water, clean air, \nclean water, RCRA, much as we did in the last session of the Congress \nwhen this was debated.\n  Another provision is kind of interesting as well if HAZMAT be the \nstandard. Under HAZMAT, a State has the ability to make application for \na waiver to that preemption of a State law--a law that would not be \nenacted pursuant to the delegation of Federal authority under our \nenvironmental law--but let's just say another provision of State law. A \nState would have the ability to seek a waiver and a judgment would be \nmade as to whether or not a waiver should be granted.\n  That provision is not included, not included, not included in S. 104. \nFurthermore, under the waiver provision, if a State is denied a waiver \nprovision under the HAZMAT legislation, which is again asserted by the \nsupporters of S. 104, S. 104 is virtually--and we will come back to the \nword ``virtually'' in a moment--identical to HAZMAT. We already have \nit. No reason to be concerned. This is something that we have \nestablished, a precedent. The policy is there. We are just simply \nasking you to do no more in S. 104 than we have all agreed to be done \nin HAZMAT.\n  Not true, Mr. President, not true, not true, because in HAZMAT a \nState that makes an application for a waiver, that provision that is \nnot available under S. 104, also has the ability for judicial review, \nto have the denial reviewed in a court of law consistent with the \nAdministrative Procedures Act that exists at the Federal level and \nState level. But under S. 104 there is no mechanism provided for \njudicial review.\n  Another provision ever so subtle is a provision that goes on to say \nthat any law that is not the same as or substantially the same as--this \nwould also be on page 9. I read as follows:\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this act, a law, \n     regulation, order or other requirement of a State, political \n     subdivision of a State or Indian tribe about any of \nthe following subjects that is not substantially the same as--\n\n  ``Not substantially the same as.'' That, too, differs from what we \nhave previously had in HAZMAT where we are talking about as long as it \nis not inconsistent with. A totally different standard. Under S. 104, \nyour State law is preempted if it is not substantially the same. Under \nHAZMAT, it would be preempted if it was inconsistent with. A big, big \ndifference.\n  Now, here is what that means. The Senator that presides is from a \nWestern State, and he knows the importance of water law to those of us \nin the West. He also knows, because his State, like my own, is \nrelatively arid and ground water resources are of critical concern to \nthe viability and the integrity of the economy of his State as well as \nmy own. Under this provision in S. 104, the ground water quality \ncontrol provisions of State law are preempted, even though those ground \nwater provisions have long predated the debate about nuclear waste, \nbecause they are not substantially the same as the provisions of this \nact. So, in effect, the State of Nevada would be unable to exercise \ncontrol of its own ground water based upon the standards established by \nlaw or regulation because those statements, standards or regulations \nare not substantially the same as a provision of this act.\n  So, in effect, we do have a preemption, a preemption in the first \ninstance that gives us the inability to enforce State statutes enacted \npursuant to an environmental delegation--the whole raft of Federal \nenvironmental legislation which has as its premise to allow States to \nenforce those standards so long as they enact statutes or regulations \nthat would be equal to or greater than the Federal standard. We have no \nprovision to apply for a waiver, and we have no ability for judicial \nreview. Add to that not only do we preempt those provisions in State \nlaw that would be inconsistent with the enactment of S. 104, but those \nprovisions that are not substantially the same. So a whole host of \nlegislative enactments that\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\nhave had nothing to do with the debate and Yucca Mountain or nuclear \nwaste could be preempted.\n  Now, I have to tell you, what possible policy would justify that \nconclusion? Well, it is our friends to the nuclear utilities who, \nindeed, want to tie our hands, who, indeed, want to trample upon the \nenvironmental protection provisions that all Americans enjoy \nirrespective of State and to say to one State those provisions shall \nnot be available to your citizens.\n  I want to talk about the viability assessment because that has been \ndiscussed at some length during the course of this debate. I think in \norder to do so we need to recount a little history.\n  Currently, a standard is being developed by the Environmental \nProtection Agency. That direction was part of the Energy Policy Act of \n1992. The 1992 Energy Policy Act directs the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to develop and promulgate a standard \nthat is consistent with, and I shall read it:\n\n       The administrator shall, based upon and consistent with the \n     findings and recommendation of the National Academy of \n     Sciences promulgate by rule public health and safety \n     standards for protection of the public from releases from \n     radioactive materials stored or to be disposed of in the \n     repository at Yucca Mountain.\n\n  This was not a provision insisted upon by the Nevada delegation. This \nhappens to be a decent policy that directs the EPA to develop a \nstandard consistent with the National Academy of Sciences.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has come up with its recommendation, \nand the EPA is about ready to promulgate that standard. So what do we \nhave now? We have legislation now in S. 104 that says the following. It \nis kind of now we give it to you and now we take it back. Now it says \nin S. 104 that the Administrator shall achieve consistency with the \nfindings and recommendations of the National Academies of Science and \nthe Commission shall amend its regulations accordingly.\n  All right, that sounds like basically we are talking about the \nstandards that the Congress directed NAS to come up with the \nrecommendations and the Environmental Protection Agency to adopt.\n  Not so, Mr. President, not so. Because the following text goes on to \nchange those standards considerably. The risk standard, in terms of the \ngroup that is to be examined, in terms of the possibility of risk due \nto death from cancer, is changed; assumptions are made that are not \npart of the National Academy of Sciences, particularly the length of \nperiod for which the standard shall apply. It is assumed, for purposes \nof S. 104, that the standard has a premise that there is no population \nmigration into or near or adjacent to the area, that we establish the \nstandard based upon those people who currently live in the vicinity. \nThat is certainly an unrealistic premise, and one that the academy of \nsciences would certainly reject, particularly in an area, as southern \nNevada is, the fastest-growing place in America with a population that \nnow exceeds 1 million people and in which the relentless movement of \npeople in the southern Nevada area each month, and each year, moves to \nthe north and toward Yucca Mountain. So, why would you freeze or limit \nthe ability of those who are to promulgate the standards to only those \npeople who are living where they are living today as opposed to those \nwho would reflect reasonable migration changes?\n  Another provision is the assumption that there will be no human \nintrusion. Again, that is something specifically rejected by the \nNational Academy of Sciences. So, we have a standard that is now being \nchanged. It is now being changed. This standard was about ready to be \npromulgated based upon the 1992 Energy Act directives with respect to \nthe National Academy of Sciences, and requiring the Environmental \nProtection Agency to adopt a standard that is consistent with those \nfindings. Now we are given a whole additional subset of limitations and \nrestrictions. It is as if one said: I want you to follow with great \nmeticulous care and detail the Constitution of the United States, but \nyou shall not consider the first amendment, you shall not consider the \nfifth amendment, or the sixth amendment. That is about what we have \nhere. Follow the standards, but you cannot do this, you must not \nconsider this, and you must put a limitation on the period of time for \nwhich that evaluation is being given in terms of prospective safety.\n  So we have a mockery of the standards. The standards are important \nfor a number of reasons, but a lot of debate occurred here earlier this \nafternoon about the assessment--the viability assessment, as it is \ncalled--and the timeline. That is very, very important because the \nPresident of the United States is directed to make a viability \nassessment by no later than March 1, 1999. What is the problem? First \nof all, we expected that there would, in fact, be a standard \npromulgated, as I have indicated, because the Environmental Protection \nAgency, after some 5 years working with the National Academy of \nSciences, is about ready to come forth with one. But as I have also \nindicated in my previous comment, no such standard is going to be \napproved because, if S. 104 becomes the law, a very different standard \nwill emerge; a very different standard will emerge. So the President of \nthe United States is going to have to make the viability determination. \nHe is told, in the first instance, that he should rely upon the \nstandard promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency but I must \nsay, in view of the fact that the standard is being changed totally, \nnobody believes that new standard will be ready by March 1, 1999, when \nthe President has to make his viability assessment.\n  So, what does this legislation say? I have never seen anything like \nthis. Once upon a time I practiced a little law, I read some statutes, \nexamined some regulations. This provision goes on to say if the \nstandard under section 206(F), that is what we have been talking about, \nhas not been promulgated, and I reiterate I don't believe anybody \nbelieves that it will be, because they are being asked now to draft a \nnew standard with all the limitations that we have previously \nrecommended, then, in effect the President shall make this \ndetermination relative to an estimate--rather, the Secretary, excuse \nme--``relative to an estimate by the Secretary of an overall \nperformance standard that is consistent with section 206 (F).''--an \nestimate, a guess; March 1, 1999, because S. 104 directs that a new \nstandard be prepared, and it has taken essentially the better part of 5 \nyears to develop the standard that was about to be promulgated. So, not \nonly must the President make a viability assessment on a standard that \nis not in existence, he is directed to make a viability assessment \nbased upon an estimate of what that standard might be--an estimate. \nThat is just a very nice legalism for a guess. How in the world would \nhe be able to make that determination when the technical people, the \nenvironmental agency, working with the National Academy of Sciences, \nwould not have such a standard available to him for a determination? \nSo, any suggestion of a standard, any suggestion of a viability \nassessment that is based upon a standard, is simply not going to occur.\n\n  I want to comment on this lawsuit, if I may, before yielding the \nfloor to my senior colleague. We have heard it argued 500 different \nways, in every conceivable mood, tense, that this lawsuit, with the \ndecision that the Department of Energy has liability, that this is such \na dreadful thing, that this will cause the ratepayers to endure all \nkinds of hardship, that they will be denied the benefit of that \nbargain, that it is a terrible, terrible thing and in fairness to the \nratepayers we need to get S. 104 enacted.\n  There is not one word in this legislation that provides any relief to \nthe ratepayers. I happen to think that the ratepayers are entitled to \nsome protection because, in 1998, under no conceivable scenario will \nany kind of facility be open to which high-level nuclear waste can be \ntransported. But I have to tell you, all of this wringing of hands, all \nof this gnashing of teeth, all of this great empathy for the \nratepayer--and I happen to believe the ratepayer ought to be \nprotected--not a single word in S. 104 provides benefits to the \nratepayer because of additional costs which they might incur if, come \n1998, they need to provide for additional storage on-site.\n  Indeed, as has been pointed out time and time again, the Secretary of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\nDepartment of Energy has made it very clear that compensation needs to \nbe made. We have heard all kinds of things: It is going to cost $80 \nbillion, $59 billion, $30 billion--the numbers are as elusive as a \nshooting star. But the measure of damages that the utilities, on behalf \nof their ratepayers, are entitled to is spelled out in the contract. It \nis spelled out in the contract that each utility was required to enter \ninto in 1982 or shortly thereafter, when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nwas entered into. It is clearly laid out in article 9, ``delays.'' It \nis apparently a well-drafted contract.\n\n       If the delays are unavoidable, then in such instances the \n     schedule for delivery of nuclear waste is simply modified in \n     accordance with the exigencies as they are in light of the \n     delay.\n\n  No monetary damages are assessed. If, however, a determination is \nmade that the delays were avoidable and that, indeed, the Department of \nEnergy bears a responsibility for that delay, then specifically the \ncontract provides:\n\n       The charges and schedules specified by this contract will \n     be equitably adjusted to reflect any estimated additional \n     costs incurred by the party not responsible for or \n     contributing to the delay.\n\n  Mr. President, that is fair and that is reasonable. If, indeed, a \ndetermination is made that this is a delay that is at the fault of the \nDepartment of Energy, the ratepayer and the utility is entitled to have \nthe sums paid into the Nuclear Waste Trust Fund equitably adjusted to \nreflect any estimated additional cost incurred by the party not \nresponsible for or contributing to the delay. Mr. President, I agree \nwith that. That is fair to the ratepayer. Indeed, in legislation that I \nhave introduced in each Congress since 1989, I have essentially \nproposed that kind of remedy.\n  So, if my colleagues are concerned about the additional cost that the \nratepayer may incur because of the unavailability of a repository in \n1998, S. 104 provides no comfort for them or their constituents. There \nis no relief with respect to any additional cost that may be incurred.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to stop here and yield the floor and give \nmy colleague an opportunity to make some comments and then I will \nconclude my remarks thereafter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 104 is a bad bill in the form it was \noriginally introduced. The bill in its substitute form is bad--for a \nlot of different reasons. No one in this body that I know of is more in \ntune with the substance of legislation than is the junior Senator from \nNew Mexico. This man, who graduated from Stanford University among \nother schools such as Harvard, is a person who understands the merits \nof legislation. He has worked for years to try to improve this piece of \nlegislation. He has worked on it because he believes in good public \npolicy. He has failed. He has tried, he has tried, but when it comes \nright down to it, the proponents of this legislation will not give the \njunior Senator from New Mexico anything that will really substantively \nimprove the bill. They have tried at the edges to play with it a little \nbit, but they have not been willing to change the substance of this \npoor legislation.\n  The Senator from New Mexico summed up this legislation best in his \nclosing few minutes of remarks today when he said, and I am \nparaphrasing: It is very obvious what is happening. Once the system is \nshort-circuited and they go around the law that now exists and \nestablish a temporary repository, that will end good science and good \nlaw.\n  In effect, what he was saying is once interim storage is established, \nthe billions, the billions of dollars spent trying to determine if \nYucca Mountain is suitable would be wasted. That is what it amounts to. \nS. 104 is bad. It does not deal with transportation. We do not have the \nmeans of safely transporting nuclear waste today anywhere in the world, \nas evidenced by what happened recently in Germany. We will talk about \nthat later.\n  Why do all environmental groups--I repeat, all environmental groups, \nnot 65 percent of them, not a majority, not a vast majority, not 85 \npercent--100 percent of environmental groups oppose this legislation? \nNot a single group favors this legislation. Why? Because it would be \ndifficult to dream up a scenario that would be worse than this for the \nenvironment.\n  One of the things we have not talked about is terrorism.\n  We will talk about terrorism in a few minutes, but this legislation \ndoes not do anything to address the terrorism that is sweeping this \nworld and is sweeping this country, and this bill leaves the terrorists \na sitting duck.\n  To show how insincere proponents of this legislation are, let's take \none amendment that was offered and defeated. We have heard on this \nSenate floor for the past week how safe it is to transport nuclear \nwaste, how safe it is generally. In fact, we were told by one of the \nproponents of this legislation that it was safer to transport nuclear \nwaste than it was to pick up a carton of milk at a grocery store and \ntake it to your home. That is not a paraphrase, that is a statement \nthat was made.\n  If, in fact, that is true--and, of course, it is not--but if it is \ntrue and the proponents of this legislation really believe that, why \nwouldn't they accept an amendment we offered that simply said, if you \nwant to transport nuclear waste through a State, the Governor of that \nState should agree to let it pass through the State? If this material \ncan be transported safely and the material is as benign as they say, if \nit is like picking up a carton of milk at 7-Eleven and taking it home, \nthen they should have supported our amendment, but they did not do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, what is happening can best be illustrated by virtue of \nan editorial that appeared last week in the Washington Post newspaper. \nThis editorial said, among other things, that this was not the \nappropriate thing to do, this is not the time to bring up this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 8, 1997]\n\n                        Waste Vote in the Senate\n\n       The Senate is scheduled to take a cloture vote today on a \n     bill to create an ``interim'' national nuclear waste \n     repository in Nevada. The outcome is likely to be the same as \n     last year: votes enough to limit debate and pass the bill, \n     but not to overcome the president's promised veto. Our own \n     sense is that the bill is the wrong solution to a genuine \n     problem. The president is right to keep it from passing, but \n     then the administration owes a real alternative, not just lip \n     service to a process that is a pretext for deferral.\n       Waste disposal always has been the great unsolved problem \n     of nuclear power. Proponents like to say the nuclear \n     alternative is clean when compared with such other sources of \n     power as coal. It is until you get to the disposal issue: \n     what to do with the spent fuel rods. Then it's the dirtiest \n     of all.\n       The expectation always has been that government would play \n     a major part in the disposal issue. In 1982 Congress spelled \n     out the process. A fee would be imposed on consumers of \n     electricity to create a fund; the fund would be used to plan, \n     build and fill a permanent national nuclear waste repository. \n     By a process of elimination having at least as much to do \n     with congressional politics as with science, Yucca Mountain \n     in Nevada was subsequently chosen, over the protests of \n     Nevadans, as the likeliest site. Safety, environmental and \n     all manner of other studies have been underway ever since.\n       The government was supposed to start accepting the spent \n     fuel in 1998. There isn't a prayer it will be ready, and \n     meanwhile the material is building up in the storage \n     facilities at the power plants. The bill to create the \n     interim facility is an effort by the industry to force the \n     government's hand on the theory that, absent a forcing move, \n     nothing will ever be done. The utilities are entitled to feel \n     that way. But the interim facility would be adjacent to Yucca \n     Mountain, and the fear on the other side is that that would \n     be it: Yucca Mountain would become the permanent site whether \n     the studies showed it to be best suited or not.\n       The permanent storage decision is too important to be made \n     under that kind of pressure. At the same time, the \n     administration needs to give the industry some assurance that \n     the process won't drag on forever. There are critics of the \n     industry who would like to see it choke on its own waste, but \n     that's not a solution. Whatever the future of the industry, \n     the waste is here. There needs to be a policy of something \n     other than deferral to deal with it.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, ``Waste Vote in the Senate'' is the \nheadline. The Washington Post said:\n\n       Our own sense is that the bill is the wrong solution to a \n     genuine problem . . . Proponents like to say the nuclear \n     alternative is\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\n     clean when compared with such other sources of power as coal. \n     It is until you get to the disposal issue: what to do with \n     the spent fuel rods. Then it's the dirtiest of all . . . .\n       The permanent storage decision is too important to be made \n     under that kind of pressure.\n\n  The Washington Post, Mr. President, said that we are being stampeded \ninto a decision that will have long-term detrimental effects on this \ncountry. I believe the Washington Post.\n  We also know that the President of the United States is going to veto \nthis bill. He is going to veto this bill if it gets 100 votes, which it \nwill not. He is going to veto this legislation no matter how many votes \nit gets, because Bill Clinton believes this is bad policy.\n  The President has said in a statement of policy earlier this month, \nabout a week ago, that this was bad policy for our country. This \nstatement has been coordinated with all the Federal agencies. We should \nremember that the President is going to veto this for good reasons: It \nis bad policy.\n  The easiest thing for the President of the United States to do would \nbe to join with a vast majority who support this legislation, not the \nmajority of people, because the President is helping to set public \npolicy to oppose this legislation, but it would be easy for him, less \ncontroversial for him, if he would go along with the madding crowd here \nthat says, ``Let's support this legislation.'' He won't do that for a \nnumber of reasons, not the least of which, as I indicated, it is bad \npublic policy.\n  We also know that the Secretary of Energy, Federico Pena, opposes \nthis legislation, with a letter directed to us on April 8, 1997.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement of administration policy be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1997.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies.)\n\n\n   S. 104--Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997--Murkowski (R-AK) and 27 \n                              cosponsors)\n\n       If S. 104 were presented to the President in its current \n     form, the President would veto the bill. S. 104 would \n     undermine the credibility of the Nation's nuclear waste \n     disposal program by, in effect, designating a specified site \n     for an interim storage facility before the viability of that \n     site as a permanent geological repository has been assessed. \n     The bill would also undermine the ongoing work on the \n     permanent disposal site by siphoning away resources for an \n     interim site.\n       The Administration is committed to resolving the complex \n     and important issue of nuclear waste storage in a timely and \n     sensible manner. The Federal government's long-standing \n     commitment to permanent, geological disposal should remain \n     the basic goal of high-level radioactive waste management \n     policy. This Administration has instituted planning and \n     management initiatives to accelerate progress on assessing \n     Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a permanent geologic disposal \n     site, and urges the Congress to provide sufficient resources \n     to allow the Administration to complete the Yucca Mountain \n     viability assessment in 1998.\n       S. 104, however, would effectively establish Nevada as the \n     site of an interim nuclear waste storage facility before the \n     viability assessment of Yucca Mountain as a permanent \n     geologic repository is completed. Moreover, even if Yucca \n     Mountain is determined not to be viable for a permanent \n     repository, the bill would provide no plausible opportunity \n     to designate a viable alternative as an interim storage site. \n     Any potential siting decision concerning such a facility \n     ultimately should be based on objective, science-based \n     criteria and informed by the likelihood of the success of the \n     Yucca Mountain site.\n       In addition, the Administration strongly objects to the \n     bill's weakening of existing environmental standards by \n     preempting all Federal, State, and local laws inconsistent \n     with the environmental requirements of this bill and the \n     Atomic Energy Act. This preemption would effectively replace \n     EPA's authority to set acceptable radiation release standards \n     with a statutory standard and would create loopholes in the \n     National Environmental Policy Act.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from \nthe Secretary of Energy to the Honorable Tom Daschle setting forth the \nDepartment of Energy's policy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, April 8, 1997\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing to inform you of the \n     Department of Energy's views on S. 104, the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act of 1997, as reported by the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n       The Administration's position on nuclear waste is clear: we \n     are committed to resolving the complex and important issue of \n     nuclear waste disposal in a timely and sensible manner, \n     consistent with sound science and protection of public \n     health, safety, and the environment. The Administration \n     believes that the federal government's longstanding \n     commitment to permanent, geologic disposal should remain the \n     basic goal of high-level radioactive waste management policy.\n       The Administration's position on S. 104 is also very \n     straightforward. The Administration believes that a decision \n     on the siting of an interim storage facility should be based \n     on objective, science-based criteria and should be informed \n     by the viability assessment of Yucca Mountain. Therefore, as \n     the President has stated, he would veto any legislation that \n     would designate an interim storage facility at a specific \n     site before the viability assessment at Yucca Mountain has \n     been completed.\n       I believe that one of the premier challenges the Department \n     of Energy faces is that of nuclear waste disposal. This \n     challenge requires that we develop the scientific data for \n     the viability assessment of Yucca Mountain as the repository \n     of the Nation's radioactive waste. The repository effort is \n     essential not only for commercial spent fuel disposal but \n     also for the cleanup of the nuclear weapons complex and \n     disposal of weapons-grade materials in furtherance of our \n     nuclear non-proliferation goals.\n       I am sensitive to the frustrations expressed over the \n     Department's inability to accept spent nuclear fuel by \n     January 31, 1998. As I committed during the confirmation \n     process, I have met with representatives of both the utility \n     industry and environmental organizations to discuss ways of \n     mitigating the impacts of this delay. I will also be meeting \n     in the near future with representatives of the state public \n     utility commissions.\n       Last week, I began a cooperative process with \n     representatives of the utility industry to address the \n     difficult and controversial issues of how the Department will \n     meet its 1998 contractual commitment. I believe we had a \n     constructive discussion of these issues, and we agreed to set \n     up working groups to continue the discussion in the next \n     several weeks. We discussed a number of options for meeting \n     the 1998 commitment, ranging from compensation, to taking \n     title to utilities' spent fuel, to moving the fuel. I also \n     expressed my personal commitment to fill the position of \n     Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste \n     Management as soon as possible and committed to provide \n     more frequent technical updates on the progress of work at \n     Yucca Mountain to stakeholders.\n       Unfortunately, the legislation now pending before the \n     Senate, S. 104, contains elements that undermine the Federal \n     government's longstanding commitment to seeking a permanent \n     solution to the nuclear waste problem. The bill would \n     effectively establish the Nevada Test Site as the site for an \n     interim storage facility before the Yucca Mountain viability \n     assessment is completed. If the Yucca Mountain site is found \n     not to be viable, the provisions of the bill do not provide \n     sufficient time to designate, license, and construct a \n     facility at any alternative to the Nevada Test Site, thereby \n     forcing the siting of an interim facility in Nevada \n     regardless of the outcome of the viability assessment. This \n     would be an unwise rush to judgment. Furthermore, designating \n     an interim storage site, before the government can be \n     informed by the repository viability assessment, would \n     jeopardize the long-term strategy for the ultimate disposal \n     of nuclear waste and undermine public confidence in the near-\n     term transportation and storage activities.\n       S. 104 also contains unrealistic schedules for beginning \n     interim storage facility operations, which, could not be met \n     even if a site were available today. It would repeat the \n     mistakes of the past with regard to unrealistic schedules for \n     completing actions without regard to generating public \n     support. Such schedules would result in excessively curtailed \n     regulatory processes and potential competition for funding \n     between the repository program and interim storage project.\n       Finally, I want to emphasize that the Department of Energy \n     has, in fact, made significant progress in this program over \n     the last four years and will be in a position by late 1998 to \n     assess the viability of the Yucca Mountain site for a \n     geologic repository. The Department has underway an \n     aggressive site characterization program at Yucca Mountain \n     focusing on the most critical technical questions (e.g., \n     hydrology, waste package lifetime, and the effects of heat on \n     the repository block). The Department has reduced the cost of \n     the technical and scientific work associated with preparing a \n     license application by approximately 40 percent. The \n     Department also has excavated over four miles of the five-\n     mile underground loop of the Exploratory Studies Facility and \n     expects to complete the tunnel this spring and complete seven \n     test alcoves by the end of this year. Following completion of \n     the tunnel, the Department will collect additional scientific \n     and engineering data in order to prepare the materials \n     necessary to complete the viability assessment. Designation \n     of an interim storage site prior to completion of this\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\n     work is likely to undermine public confidence that a \n     repository evaluation will be objective and technically \n     sound.\n       For all of these reasons, I urge you and your colleagues to \n     join the President and the Administration in opposing this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Federico Pena.\n\n  Mr. REID. Also, Mr. President, I have from the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality--and let me explain to the viewers what this is. \nThe President has, and it has been in the last 20 years, an agency \nwithin the Executive Office of the President that gives the President \nadvice on environmental issues. The chairperson of that very important \noffice is Katie McGinty. Her office has advised the President this \nlegislation is bad legislation. She has advised the minority leader and \nthe majority leader of the U.S. Senate that it is bad policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated April 7, 1997, indicating \nKatie McGinty's absolute opposition to this legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Council on \n           Environmental Quality,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: The purpose of this letter is to \n     express my opposition to S. 104, which effectively mandates \n     construction of an interim storage facility for nuclear \n     wastes at the Nevada Test Site, near the location under \n     consideration as a permanent geologic repository at Yucca \n     Mountain. This Administration supports a long-term solution \n     for the disposal of nuclear wastes, but not, as would be the \n     case with S. 104, at the expense of sound science and public \n     health, safety and environmental protection. While I am \n     troubled by a number of provisions in the bill that would \n     undermine such safeguards, I am particularly concerned over \n     the dismantling of the environmental impact assessment \n     process under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).\n       Congress passed NEPA in 1969 to ensure that federal \n     agencies integrate environmental values, as well as social, \n     economic and technical factors, into the decision making \n     process. To that end, section 102 of NEPA establishes an \n     ``action forcing device,'' known as an environmental impact \n     statement (EIS), for proposed major federal actions \n     significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. \n     At the heart of the EIS process is the alternatives analysis, \n     in which reasonable alternatives to the proposed action are \n     addressed in an effort to provide a clear basis of choice by \n     decision makers and the public, and to ensure that the most \n     environmentally sound course of action is taken.\n       S. 104 renders the NEPA process meaningless by precluding \n     the incorporation of NEPA's core values which are necessary \n     for making informed and timely decisions essential for \n     protecting public health, safety and environmental quality. \n     Consequently, the bill all but locks into place both interim \n     and permanent storage sites by giving decision makers no \n     reasonable options in the event that Yucca Mountain is found \n     unsuitable.\n       If Yucca Mountain is found unsuitable for permanent \n     geologic disposal, the time lines in the bill virtually \n     ensure there will not be enough time for the President to \n     designate, and the Secretary of Energy to construct, an \n     interim site. Further, since the EIS for both the interim and \n     permanent facilities are not required until well after the \n     critical decisions have been made--including site selection, \n     design, and some construction--either or both facilities may \n     well be so far into development that if health, safety or \n     environmental problems are identified, there would be no \n     time, nor would it be economically feasible, to look to other \n     sites. This is even more compelling since the bill prevents \n     actions taken by the Secretary and the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission from being challenged in court until after these \n     critical decisions have been made.\n       Finally, S. 104 precludes the EIS from addressing potential \n     long-term environmental impacts of interim storage; only the \n     initial term of the license or subsequent renewal periods may \n     be considered. In addition, the bill tends to downplay health \n     and safety concerns of state and local communities by stating \n     that the EIS may address the environmental impacts of the \n     transportation of the nuclear wastes to the interim storage \n     facility, only ``in a generic manner.''\n       The permanent disposal of nuclear waste is critical to all \n     Americans, and to future generations. When Congress passed \n     NEPA in 1969, it envisioned a decision making process that \n     would ensure that federal agencies ``look before they leap.'' \n     This can occur only if reasonable alternatives to a proposed \n     action are explored earlier in the planning stages, with \n     meaningful public involvement. Only then can an agency make a \n     fully informed decision, one which provides assurances for \n     the maximum possible protection of human health and the \n     environment.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter. Please do \n     not hesitate to contact me or members of my staff if we can \n     be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Kathleen A. McGinty,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, not only do we have Government agencies \nopposing this legislation, we have already established that the \nscientific community opposes this legislation. When this legislation \nwas established, it was determined that there should be some \nnonpartisan, scientific group that could give the Congress and the \nPresident a scientific view as to what was happening on nuclear waste.\n  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was established, and a group \nof scientists were selected. The chairman of this group is from \nprestigious Yale University. He is a dean at one of the schools there. \nThey have said, do not support this legislation, interim storage of \nnuclear waste should not be.\n  Mr. President, in addition to scientists, we also have environmental \ngroups all over the country who oppose this legislation.\n  So I guess I would say to the Chair and those within the sound of my \nvoice, which position would you support? The position of the \nmonopolistic nuclear utilities, the nuclear power lobby? Or the \nscientific community unions, like the United Transportation Union, \nenvironmentalists, and churches? I would say, first glance and second \nglance and third glance, you would go along with the churches, \nscientists and the environmentalists.\n  I am not going to read and have printed in the Record the statements \nfrom almost 200 environmental groups, but let me just give a brief \nstatement from an environmental group in Atlanta, GA. This group is \ncalled WAND from Atlanta, GA, W-A-N-D. I have a letter written to every \nSenator:\n\n       [We strongly urge] you to oppose S. 104, the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act . . . vote against final passage [of this bill].\n       S. 104 paves the way for a new era of disregard for public \n     health and safety. The bill carves loopholes in the National \n     Environmental Policy Act, preempts other environmental laws, \n     and eliminates licensing standards for permanent repository. \n     The radiation release standard set by the bill for the \n     permanent repository of 100 millirems would allow individuals \n     to receive four times as much radiation as permitted by \n     current regulations for nuclear waste storage. . . .\n       S. 104 mandates interim storage. . .despite the lack of \n     justifiable rationale for interim storage and safety concerns \n     with that site. In the process this bill weakens \n     environmental standards that protect the public, preempts \n     states' rights, and limits public participation in the \n     decisionmaking process.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Women's Action for \nNew Directions in Atlanta, GA, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            Women's Action for New Directions,\n\n                                      Atlanta, GA, March 28, 1997.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Women's Action for New Directions (WAND) \n     strongly urges you to oppose S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act of 1997, support a likely filibuster by Senators Bryan \n     and Reid, and vote against final passage should this bill \n     come to the floor.\n       S. 104 paves the way for a new era of disregard for public \n     health and safety. The bill carves loopholes in the National \n     Environmental Policy Act, preempts other environmental laws, \n     and eliminates licensing standards for the permanent \n     repository. The radiation release standards set by the bill \n     for the permanent repository on 100 millirems would allow \n     individuals to receive four times as much radiation as \n     permitted by current regulations for nuclear waste storage. \n     By setting aside important regulations and standards for \n     short-term expediency, the bill sets the stage for future \n     exemptions when other radioactive waste problems, such as \n     cleanup of the nation's nuclear weapons complex, become too \n     perplexing or expensive.\n       S. 104 mandates interim storage for high-level waste at the \n     Yucca Mountain Nevada site, the proposed permanent \n     repository, despite the lack of justifiable rationale for \n     interim storage and safety concerns with that site. In the \n     process this bill weakens environmental standards that \n     protect the public, preempts states' rights, and limits \n     public participation in the decision-making process. It would \n     set into motion the largest nuclear waste transportation \n     project in human history, sending thousands of tons of \n     radioactive waste onto the roads and railways in 43 states, \n     without safety standards. It imposes an unrealistic November \n     1999 date for the beginning of high-level waste \n     transportation, despite Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     conclusions that the waste can stay where it is for 100 \n     years.\n       Even amendments added to change some items in the bill, \n     such as Senator Wyden's amendments protecting Hanford from \n     becoming an interim dump site, and some\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\n     transportation provisions, do not address the overall \n     failures of the bill and its mockery of environmental \n     protection.\n       We believe the nation's current nuclear waste policy is \n     fundamentally flawed. It places an unfair burden on \n     politically isolated, often indigenous people, endangers \n     public health and safety, . . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, native Americans have joined together almost \nin unison against this legislation. Native Americans also have an \norganization called National Environmental Coalition of Native \nAmericans, NECONA. They have said this legislation is extremely bad. \nThey have done this in the form of a letter written on March 31 of this \nyear:\n\n       [D]eveloping a storage facility now would jeopardize the \n     repository program and has the added risk of prejudicing any \n     future decision about the suitability of that site. . .\n       The DOE lists 109 cities of over 100,000 people which would \n     be impacted. Dozens of our tribes would also be impacted, and \n     the most recent DOE survey of tribal and state capabilities \n     to deal with nuclear transportation accidents revealed many \n     serious gaps in preparedness.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the NECONA statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            National Environmental\n\n\n                                Coalition of Native Americans,\n\n                                       Prague, OK, March 31, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to you as a non-profit, \n     educational coalition of Indian people who have been long \n     concerned about national and international nuclear waste \n     policy. Some of us live near current nuclear waste sites, and \n     others are threatened with massive transportation impacts if \n     plans for future nuclear waste sites are implemented. \n     Seventy-one tribes in North America have declared their lands \n     to be Nuclear Free Zones.\n       We urge you to oppose the current Senate bill S. 104 which \n     calls for centralized interim storage of high level nuclear \n     waste and nuclear irradiated fuel at the Nevada site at Yucca \n     Mountain. NECONA, with other environmental groups, views this \n     bill as an unwise re-direction of U.S. nuclear waste policy.\n       Congress's own Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board in \n     March 1996 released a report which stated forcefully that \n     ``there are no compelling technical or safety reasons to \n     begin moving spent fuel from reactor sites for the next \n     several years, so the development of a centralized storage \n     facility should be linked to the decision about the \n     suitability of Yucca Mountain,'' in about five years. \n     ``[D]eveloping a storage facility now would jeopardize the \n     repository program'' and ``has the added risk of prejudicing \n     any future decision about the suitability of that site . . \n     .''\n       The industry's bills, for example S. 104, to the contrary \n     would direct DOE to place its ``highest priority'' effort on \n     a temporary ``interim storage facility'' in Nevada. While we \n     have serious concerns about the DOE program at the Yucca \n     Mountain site, we do not wish to see a reversal of the \n     current policy, since the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, of \n     placing highest priority on a continued search for long-term \n     disposition of nuclear waste.\n       The nuclear utility industry is pushing in these bills an \n     irresponsible and phony ``solution'' to the problem of \n     nuclear waste. The U.S. Department of Energy in 1996 produced \n     new national maps depicting the national and state routes, by \n     highway and rail, over which massive numbers of irradiated \n     fuel shipments will move beginning around 1999 if the \n     legislation is enacted. The DOE lists 109 cities over 100,000 \n     which would be impacted. Dozens of our tribes would also be \n     impacted, and the most recent DOE survey of tribal and state \n     capabilities to deal with nuclear transportation accidents \n     revealed many serious gaps in preparedness.\n       The nuclear industry should not be allowed to wash their \n     hands of their ever-mounting nuclear wastes by merely putting \n     the wastes on the rails and highways for thirty years on the \n     way to an interim storage facility--which will most nearly \n     resemble a parking lot--in Nevada.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will also state that the Physicians for \nSocial Responsibility, a group consisting of 16,000 American \nphysicians, oppose this legislation. We have a letter from their \nexecutive director, Dr. Musil, who says to every Senator:\n\n       We . . . oppose Senate bill 104 . . . because it mandates a \n     badly flawed nuclear waste management strategy which \n     potentially endangers public health.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                         Physicians for Social Responsibility,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: Physicians for Social Responsibility is one \n     of the nation's largest organized medical societies, with \n     more than 16,000 members and supporters nationwide, \n     representing all major fields of medicine. We write to urge \n     you to oppose Senate bill 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \n     of 1997, because it mandates a badly flawed nuclear waste \n     management strategy which potentially endangers public \n     health.\n       S. 104 would allow construction of an ``interim'' nuclear \n     waste dump near Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Storing highly \n     radioactive waste at the site presents a potentially serious \n     public health danger. The Geological Society of America has \n     reported at least 15 small earthquakes since May 1995 at \n     Yucca Mountain, which sits atop two earthquake faults. \n     Moreover, transporting waste where long-term isolation cannot \n     be assured is irresponsible and creates new and possibly \n     greater dangers.\n       S. 104 would require the greatest nuclear waste \n     transportation project in history. It would put 95% of the \n     radioactivity of U.S. nuclear waste on our nation's roads and \n     railways in casks of questionable safety. The bill would send \n     highly radioactive nuclear waste through 43 states within \n     one-half mile of 52 million people, providing minimal \n     protection to local communities.\n       S. 104 would exempt nuclear waste from most environmental \n     laws. The bill would exempt site selection, license \n     application, and construction from the Environmental Impact \n     Statement (public participation) process normally required by \n     the National Environmental Policy Act. It would also set \n     radiation release standards far higher than any other \n     standard, presenting greater risks to public health and \n     safety.\n       Alternatives should be explored. Our organization seeks a \n     thorough examination and review of all national nuclear waste \n     policies and programs. Such a process should include \n     meaningful and effective public participation to ensure a \n     program that is safe and acceptable to the American public.\n       We, as health professionals, are deeply concerned about the \n     grave dangers S. 104 would pose to public health and safety. \n     Please do not trade protection of human health and the \n     environment for a short-term non-solution to the nuclear \n     waste problem. Please vote no on S. 104.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Robert K. Musil, Ph.D.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in short, this legislation is bad. The \ntechnical experts say it is bad. There is no technical or safety reason \nto move spent nuclear fuel. It is before us for one simple reason, and \nthat is the power of the nuclear utilities. The motive of the nuclear \nutilities is more money. We have already established the huge profits \nthey make. I compared their 17 percent average profit to what I learned \nin a case that I handled against Safeway Stores. They make a little \nover 1 percent on their volume. The nuclear utilities make 17 percent. \nThis legislation is here, it is motivated by money, and they want more \nmoney. Their greed is endangering the American public, our fragile \nenvironment and the Nation's policy to develop a permanent repository \nfor spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.\n  This bill, S. 104, is antienvironmental. The bill is opposed by every \nenvironmental group in America, as I have stated several times. This \nbill is a disaster for the environment. The public opposes this \nlegislation because they see the facade of S. 104's hysterical claims \nof crisis for onsite storage. This is not true.\n  The real motivation, we have established, is money. The best option \nis to leave it on site, right where it is today, Mr. President. We \nwould save billions of dollars, and it would be safe. Everyone should \nbe outraged by this legislation. No better evidence of bad legislation \nexists than that the provisions of the legislation prohibit discussion \nand full and open disclosure of the bill's consequences and its \nalternatives.\n  S. 104 is proposing to violate the intent of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, because the nuclear power industry \nwould fail in its efforts if the law were obeyed. The nuclear power \nindustry is indifferent to environmental quality, especially when it \ncomes to money.\n  This legislation would try--and I underline ``try''--to prematurely \nship tens of thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel needlessly before \nthe country is ready to do that. Past shipments of nuclear waste showed \nthere would be about one accident on the road or rail for every 300 \nshipments. That suggests, under S. 104, we would have at least 50 \naccidents involving high-level nuclear waste.\n  That is only part of the story, because in the examples that they \nused, we are talking about very short hauls of nuclear waste. Here we \nare talking about hauling nuclear waste thousands of miles.\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\n  Most of the shipments under this legislation would be \ntranscontinental. Truck transport statistics predict about six \naccidents every million miles, while rail statistics predict about 12 \naccidents per million miles.\n  Using these statistics, the Nation should expect more than 160 \naccidents involving spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste. \nEach of these accidents would risk radioactive dispersal from \ncanisters, each of which contain the radiological equivalent of 200 \nNagasaki bombs. They are talking about hauling this poison, and the \ncanisters have not even been designed. The only thing they designed are \nrequirements that canisters survive only if you are going less than 30 \nmiles an hour and have fire temperatures of only 1,475 degrees.\n  We all know that most accidents occur going more than 30 miles per \nhour. The technical community knows that diesel burns on the average at \n1,800 degrees. The canisters survive only 1,400-plus degrees, 1,475 at \nthe most. Under some conditions, Mr. President, diesel fuel burns at \ntemperatures exceeding 3,000 degrees, more than twice what the \ncanisters would withstand.\n  So if this is not enough, the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board also opposed this plan, as I have already mentioned, \nbecause the country is not ready yet to ship nuclear waste.\n  Truck crews have not been trained. There is no integrated emergency \nresponse plan for these accidents. Police, fire, emergency, medical, \nhazardous material management, radioactive material management--all \nthese teams must be developed, and once they are developed become an \nintegrated capable force.\n  The response force needs an accepted and capable command and control \nstructure to organize their action. They do not have one.\n  The response force needs to be equipped with technical gear peculiar \nto radioactive material management. They do not have it.\n  The response force needs to train together so they can work together \nwhen it becomes necessary. Integrated training has not been done or \neven contemplated.\n  It could not be more obvious that we are not ready to move spent \nnuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste across this country.\n  S. 104 is an open invitation to terrorists. We know that terrorists \nwill do anything to grab a headline. Terrorists exist both at home and \nabroad. Terrorists can move freely through this country. Everybody \nknows the routes and schedules of waste shipments. Weaponry exists that \ncan breach waste containers. Everybody knows that terrorists with a \nlittle bit of money and determination can get these weapons.\n  Places exist along those routes where shipments could be stopped \nwhere we know there would be time enough to breach the canisters and \ndisperse the waste, to say the least.\n  We must do something to prevent terrorists from attacking these \nirresistible targets. We have done nothing. We continue to not do \nanything to prevent this kind of threat.\n  We need to be prepared to respond with effective and overwhelming \ncapability in a very short time if our prevention tactics fail.\n  We are not planning for prevention. We are not planning for response. \nWe are sitting around with our heads in the sand hoping that this will \nnot happen. That is just what terrorists count on.\n  S. 104 spends not one bit of its energy or money on this critical \nissue because the nuclear power industry does not care that much. They \nonly care about money. That is the only thing they care about.\n  They would risk the lives and health of tens of millions of citizens \nliving and working within 10 miles of the routes of this transportation \nsystem.\n  The nuclear power industry and the sponsors of S. 104 have not \nconvinced the American people that spent nuclear fuel is safe.\n  I have said previously on this floor--and I think it speaks volumes--\nthey tried this recently in Germany. They could not do it, Mr. \nPresident. We are talking about moving this waste thousands and \nthousands of miles. They tried in Germany to move it less than 300 \nmiles.\n  What did it take to move six canisters 300 miles? It took 30,000 \npolice, 170 injuries, 500 arrests, $150 million. Germany has said, \n``We're backing off. This is a program that won't work.''\n  So now, Mr. President, that orderly and conservative region of \nGermany has become a hotbed of protest and hatred for the government. \nThe transportation program has been stopped. The police have refused to \ncontinue with arrests and suppression. The German parliament, as I \nmentioned, is reconsidering its decision to move the waste. All that \nfor six casks moving just a short distance.\n  We have talked, Mr. President, about terrorism. I want everyone to \nunderstand that this is not something that is just being made up.\n  In fact, one organization from North Carolina, just last year, \ndecided how hard it would be to commit an act of terrorism with a \nnuclear waste shipment. They determined it would be as easy as falling \noff a log.\n  Referring to a letter to the U.S. Senate about a year ago, the Blue \nRidge Environmental Defense League, which is an old organization, in \nexistence for 15 years thereabouts, decided to see if they could find a \nload of nuclear waste and follow it. They could follow it. It was real \neasy.\n  They said:\n\n       In the wake of Oklahoma City and Atlanta the dangers posed \n     by domestic or international terrorists armed with explosives \n     make the transport of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel \n     too dangerous to contemplate for the foreseeable future.\n\n  My friend, the manager of this bill, the senior Senator from Alaska, \nsaid: ``What are we going to do? Just throw it in the air? If we do, it \nis going to come down some place.''\n  That's the whole point of the terrorists. It won't just come down \nsome place; it will come down all over the place--with no control over \nwhere it will come down, according to the Blue Ridge Environmental \nDefense League.\n  They have said that ``Our work''--and they only looked in three \nStates, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia--``takes us to many \nrural communities. Emergency management personal in these areas are \ndedicated volunteers, but they are unprepared for nuclear waste. \nVolunteer fire departments in rural counties are very good at putting \nout house fires and brush fires,'' but that is about all.\n  ``The remote river valleys and steep grades of Appalachia are \nlegendary. At Saluda, NC the steepest standard gauge mainline railroad \ngrade in the United States drops 253 feet/mile,'' or a 4.8-percent \ngrade. ``The CSX and Norfolk Southern lines trace the French Broad \nRiver Valley and the Nolichucky Gorge west through the Appalachian \nMountains along remote stretches of rivers famous among whitewater \nrafters for their steep drops and their distance from civilization. The \nNorfolk Southern [Railroad] crosses the French Broad River at Deep \nWater Bridge where the mountains rise 2,200 feet above the river. These \nare the transport routes through western North Carolina that will be \nused for high level nuclear waste'' if this legislation passes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Blue Ridge Environmental\n\n\n                                               Defense League,\n\n                                      Marshall, NC, July 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996 (S 1936) \n     would place in jeopardy the lives of millions of American \n     citizens by transporting 15,638 casks of highly radioactive \n     material over railways and highways of this nation. This \n     attempt at a quick-fix for the nuclear waste dilemma would \n     cause more problems than it attempts to solve. The people who \n     would bear the greatest burden would be the 172 million \n     Americans who live nearest the transportation corridors. S \n     1936 is a legislative short-circuit that will make us less \n     secure as a nation and which will dump the costs of emergency \n     response on the states and local governments.\n       The Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League began in 1984: \n     our work takes us throughout the southeast. Since 1994 we \n     have observed the international shipments of spent nuclear \n     fuel (SNF) from foreign research reactors (FRR) to a disposal \n     site at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. Two \n     shipments arrived at the Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny \n     Point (MOTSU) in North Carolina, were loaded\n\n[[Page S3105]]\n\n     onto rail cars, and then transported overland to SRS. We were \n     able to track both of these shipments from their ports of \n     origin in Denmark, Greece, France, and Sweden across the \n     Atlantic to North Carolina to SRS. We observed the fuel \n     shipments when they arrived at MOTSU. We watched the SNF \n     transfer from ship to train and followed it through the \n     countryside of coastal North and South Carolina. Our reason \n     for doing this was to alert people along the transport route \n     about the shipments through their communities. We rented a \n     light plane and flew out over the SNF ships when they reached \n     the three-mile limit. Television news cameras accompanied us \n     and transmitted pictures for broadcast on the evening news. \n     If we can track such shipments, anyone can. These shipments \n     cannot be kept secret so long as we live in a free society. \n     Our actions were peaceful, but we proved that determined \n     individuals on a shoestring budget can precisely track \n     international and domestic shipments of strategic materials. \n     In the wake of Oklahoma City and Atlanta the dangers posed by \n     domestic or international terrorists armed with explosives \n     make the transport of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel \n     too dangerous to contemplate for the foreseeable future.\n       Our work in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia takes \n     us to many rural communities. Emergency management personnel \n     in these areas are dedicated volunteers, but they are \n     unprepared for nuclear waste. Volunteer fire departments in \n     rural counties are very good at putting out house fires and \n     brush fires. While serving as a volunteer fire fighter in \n     Madison County, NC, I had the privilege of working with these \n     men and women. We took special training to handle propane \n     tank emergencies utilizing locally-built water pumper trucks. \n     More sophisticated training or equipment was prohibitively \n     expensive and beyond our financial means. Traffic control is \n     a consideration at an emergency scene. Any fire or \n     accident tends to draw a crowd. Onlookers arrive as soon \n     as the fire department--sometimes sooner in remote areas. \n     There are always traffic jams reducing traffic flow to a \n     one-lane crawl day or night, fair weather or foul. The \n     remote river valleys and steep grades of Appalachia are \n     legendary. At Saluda, NC the steepest standard gauge \n     mainline railroad grade in the United States drops 253 \n     feet/mile (4.8% grade). The CSX and Norfolk Southern lines \n     trace the French Broad River Valley and the Nolichucky \n     Gorge west through the Appalachian Mountains along remote \n     stretches of rivers famous among whitewater rafters for \n     their steep drops and their distance from civilization. \n     The Norfolk Southern RR crosses the French Broad River at \n     Deep Water Bridge where the mountains rise 2,200 feet \n     above the river. These are the transport routes through \n     western North Carolina that will be used for high level \n     nuclear waste transport as soon as 1998 according to S. \n     1936.\n       County emergency management personnel are entrusted with \n     early response to hazards to the public in western North \n     Carolina communities. When we asked about their readiness to \n     respond to a nuclear transport accident, they answered \n     professionally saying, ``We'll just go out there and keep \n     people away until state or federal officials arrive.'' This \n     may be the best that can be done while a fire burns or \n     radiation leaks from a damaged cask. In a recent interview, \n     one western NC emergency coordinator said. ``There is no \n     response team anywhere in this part of the state and, for the \n     foreseeable future, there is no money in local budgets to \n     equip us with any first response to radioactive spills.''\n       The concerns of local officials reflect their on-the-scene \n     responsibility while state officials, faced with limited \n     budgets and staff, make plans based on current bureaucratic \n     realities. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act and Amendments of \n     1982 and 1987 place large-scale nuclear transportation \n     scenarios decades in the future. This fact and the limited \n     resources of existing emergency planning departments make the \n     timeline for preparation for nuclear accident response \n     completely inadequate for shipments beginning as soon as \n     1998. In North Carolina's Division of Emergency Management, \n     the lead REP planner has four staffers and a whole state to \n     cover. It is not possible, under these circumstances, to be \n     ready with credible emergency response plans, training, and \n     equipment in two years.\n       I am asking you to oppose this expensive and dangerous \n     legislation which would place an unfair and unnecessary \n     financial burden on communities and which would place at risk \n     the health and safety of millions of American citizens.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     Louis Zeller.\n\n  Mr. REID. I would just say that terrorists' modus operandi is to find \nareas of weakness so that they can spread terror. This, believe me, Mr. \nPresident, would spread terror. And that is an understatement.\n  As my colleague from Nevada pointed out, S. 104 is not improved with \nthe substitute.\n  This substitute amendment is no better than S. 104 as originally \nsubmitted.\n  The bottom line of this substitute is that the nuclear power industry \nand its allies insist that spent nuclear fuel be stored in Nevada no \nmatter what.\n  They did not address their real concern, they say, and that is \ntransportation. They did not address environmental concerns.\n  The bill now says that if Yucca Mountain is found unsuitable by the \nPresident, then a different interim storage site must be designated \nwithin 24 months. If that is not bad public policy, I cannot believe \nwhat would be.\n  If a different interim site is not designated within that period, \nthen Nevada would become the default storage site, even though it has \nalready been determined scientifically to be inadequate for that \npurpose.\n  Everybody knows that no alternative site can be designated in 24 \nmonths. Everybody knows we spent well over 15 years trying to decide \nwhether Yucca Mountain is suitable. At least that much time would be \nrequired before another interim site could be designated.\n  Yucca Mountain must be designated as interim storage site under S. \n104 regardless of the suitability assessment. That is wrong. That makes \na mockery of the scientific and objective process of site \ncharacterization at Yucca Mountain.\n  S. 104 makes worthless the more than $2.5 billion spent on developing \nthe Exploratory Studies Facility at Yucca Mountain.\n  S. 104 makes worthless all the preceding legislation and all the \nscientific investments for developing a permanent repository in accord \nwith national policy for dealing with spent nuclear fuel and high-level \nradioactive waste.\n  Everybody knows that once the waste is moved from its generator sites \nto a centralized site, it will never be moved again.\n  And, just as surely, once a centralized site is designated, the \nnuclear power lobby and its allies will insist that repository \nresources be diverted to the development and construction of the \ninterim facility and away from development of a permanent site.\n  So designation of an interim site will terminate the permanent \nrepository.\n  What does that mean?\n  That means that waste that was once meant to be stored in emplacement \ncanisters, yet to be proven, in an underground repository, yet to be \ndesigned, would be instead stored in transportation containers on a \ncement pad, exposed to the weather and damage from human activity or \nnatural events.\n  That means that any difficult issues that arise with regard to the \ninterpretation of data from the Yucca Mountain characterization will \nnot be pursued and will not be resolved.\n  That means that Yucca Mountain will never be designated as a \npermanent repository under the law, and so spent nuclear fuel will be \nstored indefinitely in a temporary configuration. There will be no \nemplacement casks to provide engineered barriers for waste isolation.\n  There will be no natural barriers to inhibit migration of waste that \nescapes the containers.\n  There will be no possible promise of public health and safety.\n  These are the reasons, Mr. President, I say that S. 104 is a ploy by \nthe nuclear power industry to terminate the permanent repository \nprogram. Because S. 104 will do that, the nuclear power industry is \nbehind S. 104.\n  A number of years ago, we laid out a logical path that \nwould guarantee a permanent disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel. \nWe in Nevada, Mr. President, fought that. We thought it was unfair to \ncharacterize one site. But that has been ongoing. And what the nuclear \nindustry now realizes is that it is taking a little longer than they \nthought. Therefore, they want to chuck the experience, money, and \nefforts out and go and pour it on top of the ground, dump nuclear waste \non top of the ground.\n\n  The architects of that process to develop a permanent repository \nrecognized that interim storage at a candidate site for the permanent \nrepository would hopelessly compromise the quality, the completeness, \nand the funding of site suitability studies.\n  These architects also recognized that such a compromise would \nultimately negate the whole notion of a permanent repository at that \nsite.\n  So they prohibited the designation of an interim storage site in any \nState in which a candidate repository site was being evaluated.\n  That prohibition extended until the candidate site was deemed \nsuitable for permanent disposition of spent nuclear fuel.\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\n  The strategy developed by the architects of the current law would \nguarantee that a suitable permanent disposal site existed before the \nwaste was moved, thereby preventing what S. 104 would guarantee--\npermanent storage of nuclear waste in a temporary configuration.\n  It is this absolute determination by S. 104 to establish an interim \nstorage facility at the Nevada Test Site before determining the \nsuitability of Yucca Mountain that compels us to state that S. 104 is \nreally all about sabotaging this country's avowed policy to permanently \ndispose of spent nuclear fuel in a geologic repository.\n  Think about it. S. 104 would move nuclear waste and store it \npermanently at a site that has been found scientifically to be \nunsuitable for that purpose.\n  If Yucca Mountain is found unsuitable, this legislation directs the \ntemporary repository to go there. What could be more outrageous? Such a \nfolly goes beyond being deceptive or stupid. It is just outrageous.\n  S. 104 would knowingly risk public health and safety by storing \nnuclear waste at a location that is determined to be an unsafe storage \nsite.\n  S. 104 would knowingly risk public health and safety by storing \nnuclear waste on an open concrete pad, exposed to weather and to all \nmanner of damage from human activity or natural events, like \nearthquakes, rain, lightning.\n  S. 104 would knowingly risk public health and safety by abandoning \nthe requirement for the engineered barriers of emplacement casks to \nensure waste isolation from the environment.\n  S. 104 would knowingly risk public health and safety by abandoning \nthe requirement for natural barriers of geologic disposal that would \nprohibit migration of waste that escaped from the emplacement casks.\n  Supporting S. 104 in its determination to permanently store nuclear \nwaste in a temporary site would be about the worst decision this Senate \ncould make.\n  Mr. President, this is bad public policy. I repeat, to my colleagues, \nwho should you support, those that take the position saying this \nlegislation is good, supported by the nuclear utilities, or those who \ntake the position supported by churches, scientists, doctors, Indian \ntribes, and everyone in the environmental community? I think the choice \nis pretty easy. But sometimes easy choices are not determined about the \nsubstance of legislation, but by the politics of legislation. We \nsubmit, Mr. President, that good public policy supports a ``no'' vote \non this legislation.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nBryan] is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague for his \nextraordinary review of this piece of legislation, in pointing out its \npitfalls. We are concluding a week's debate on this, Mr. President. I \nwant to make just a couple of more points, and then tomorrow we will \nhave a vote and we will either do the right thing, or we will impose \nupon the American public a terrible public policy consequence.\n  Mr. President, I have reviewed in an earlier part of my statement the \nvarious provisions in this bill, which, in my view, represent the most \natrocious policy options that one could conjure up. As my senior \ncolleague mentioned, who would you trust and rely upon to give you \nadvice on an issue that, obviously, is very technical, very \ncomplicated? For those of us who do not deal with these kinds of issues \nevery day, this is not something that is intuitive judgment.\n  I want to return to the starting point for just a moment to talk \nabout this being unnecessary legislation--unnecessary in that the \npolicy and the scientific community disagree with its very premise. \nNow, when you look at the various groups that are playing a role in \nthis debate, one thing stands out: The only people that are advocating \nthis legislation are the nuclear utilities and their supporters. It is \nnot the environmental community.\n  My colleague recited that every major organization in America that \nhas an environmental constituency has opposed this legislation, and for \ngood reason. It is not the scientific community. We frequently hear \nscience invoked as the governing beacon that ought to guide us in this \npolicy debate. If that were true, there would not be a single vote for \nS. 104, because the scientific community is not urging us to enact this \nlegislation. This is legislation that has been generated, fomented by \nthe nuclear utility industry and is part of the history that we have \nfaced in America in dealing with this very complicated, troublesome, \nand very, very dangerous electrical generation source.\n  More than 15 years ago, we were confronted with policy debates that \nsound very much like those on the floor today, in which the utilities \nsaid that we are going to be without energy, we will have brownouts, \nand the utilities will be forced to close because they will run out of \nreactor space. This was all generating hysteria. It was not true then \nand it is not true now. But that has been the legacy that we have in \nthis debate, in trying to make our way through the very sound judgments \nthat ought to control our decisionmaking process in reaching the proper \nconclusion.\n  So, essentially, you have the policymakers, the scientific community, \nthe President of the United States all saying, look, this is \nunnecessary. They are allied against the utilities who have made this \nargument, as I say, for several decades. It has been said that this is \na better piece of legislation. I think that is very questionable, Mr. \nPresident. When one looks at what is done, we wreak havoc upon the \nenvironmental legislation in America. Only by the most tortured and \ntwisted and convoluted logic could S. 104 be considered sound \nenvironmental policy.\n  The preemption provisions, which I have discussed at some length, \ndeprive a State of its ability to enforce environmental laws by the \nFederal Government. It eliminates waiver provisions that are part and \nparcel of our environmental legislation that provides judicial review. \nWe talked about what is done to standards. Those have greatly been \ndiminished. We are talking about something, Mr. President, that isn't \njust temporarily inconvenient or needs to be cleaned up because it \nwould be a nuisance in the community. We are talking about something \nthat is lethal, deadly, for 10,000 years and beyond. That is beyond the \nperiod of recorded history. We have never dealt with that kind of a \npolicy issue. I can understand the frustration that some of my \ncolleagues experience, that it may be another 4, 5, 6 years before this \ndetermination or that. But when you are talking about 10,000 years, and \nbeyond, 4 or 5 years more to get it right, to do the right thing, to \nprotect the health and safety of the American public seems rather \nlittle to ask when you are dealing with something as dangerous as this.\n\n  We have talked about the flaw in the viability assessment of the \nPresident of the United States. He has to make his assessment based on \na standard that is not going to exist. Charitably, it would have to be \na guess. How can one make a sound policy judgment based upon a standard \nthat is yet to be developed and is nonexistent? Whatever one thinks \nabout the politics of this administration, one would have to conclude \nthat it is the ultimate irresponsibility to ask any Chief Executive to \nmake a judgment based upon his or her assessment, when the standard \nupon which the benchmarks are to be measured don't exist.\n  My colleague talked at great length about the transportation dangers. \nI understand that we all in this Chamber are candidates who have faced \nthe people in our States respectively. I understand that the utilities \nin a number of States have leaned very heavily and have been to the \noffices and advocated and raised all kinds of specters. Let me just \nsuggest for a moment that what is happening in California as we speak, \nI think, is very instructive. There, as many of you may be aware, \nnuclear waste is going to be shipped from the Pacific in the Concorde \nand then transported over the Sierra Nevada from California into Nevada \nand, ultimately, to be stored in Idaho. If you think that the pressures \nthat the utilities have brought to bear are heavy, when the first \nseries of 17,000 shipments of high-level waste traversing the highways \nand rail systems of 43 States, in which 51 million people live within 1 \nmile or less--when that begins to occur, much as my senior colleague \nhas pointed out with graphic detail about what has occurred fairly \nrecently in Germany, that\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\nis going to be a real constituent concern, and rightly so, because an \naccident can have a devastating impact upon the health of that \ncommunity.\n  So this is not just a Nevada issue. This is an issue which will \naffect many millions of people in this country. We have talked about \nthe lawsuit, how there is this great empathy and understanding about \nthe ratepayers and the consequences for them, how they paid $8 billion \nover the years into the nuclear waste trust fund. Nothing in this \nlegislation provides 1 cent of relief for the ratepayers. That, to me, \nis the true indicator of what this is all about. This isn't trying to \nprovide equity for the ratepayers. This is not trying to provide or \nprevent ratepayers from paying twice for something that they have \nalready paid once for. It has nothing to do with that, or you would see \nrelief in S. 104. There is nothing. Nothing provides any relief for a \nlawsuit. The lawsuit remedy, as I have indicated, under section 9 of \nthe contract, provides for an equitable adjustment of payments made \ninto the nuclear waste fund. I think that is fine. But nothing in this \nlegislation deals with the ratepayers, because nothing is contained \nthat provides any kind of equitable relief for the ratepayers.\n  Finally, let me talk about one other section of this legislation, \nwhich I think, again, would indicate how corrupting it is in terms of \ndoing great violence to the environmental laws of America, laws that \nhave, by and large, survived the test of time for nearly three decades \nand have enjoyed bipartisan support. It was during the Nixon \nadministration that most of these pieces of legislation first saw the \nlight of day.\n  I want to talk about the National Environmental Policy Act, as it is \nreferred to as NEPA. We are told in one instance that NEPA must be \nfollowed. It sounds good, doesn't it? But then we are told that the \nfollowing activities will be deemed preliminary activities. That just \nmight seem like words--``preliminary.'' That is a very precise term \nbecause preliminary activities are not subject to judicial review. And \nin most instances, the courts themselves make a judgment as to whether \nsomething is deemed preliminary or final for the purposes of review. \nBut just as a further indication of how this stacks the deck against \nanything that provides environmental protection, you have a whole \nseries of actions at page 90 under this act--transportation \nrequirements; viability assessment, and that is section 204; 205(a) is \ngeneric design, submitted for interim storage; 205 is site-specific \ndesign standards; 205 is license application for interim storage; 206 \nis repository characterizations. Each of those sections are deemed to \nbe preliminary, so as to preclude the opportunity for independent \njudgment as to whether or not they do, in fact, comply with the law and \nmake good sense. So, in effect, what we do in those sections, if 104 \npasses, we gut NEPA, eviscerate it. We proclaim our great devotion to \nit in the first section, but then say that it shall not include the \nfollowing.\n\n  Let me further go on to indicate that the essence of NEPA is to \nconsider the various options or choices that are available. That is the \nunderlying premise, the theory being that if you look at all of the \noptions on the table, we will rule out, through some rational, \nthoughtful process, those that are the least compelling from a policy \npoint of view and reach a conclusion as to the best of the options \navailable. But we are told here, with respect to the environmental \nimpact statement, that is part of the NEPA requirement, that this \ncommission shall not be required to consider the need for an interim \nstorage facility, the time of initial availability of a repository or \ninterim storage facility, the alternatives to geological disposal or \ncentralized interim storage or alternatives to the interim storage \nfacility site. So to profess that we do give any kind of meaningful \nadherence to the National Environmental Policy Act--NEPA--is itself a \ntravesty.\n  Finally, let me say that when the vote comes tomorrow, I hope that my \ncolleagues, putting aside all of the technical arguments for a moment, \nmight consider policy. What is the right policy for America? What \nprotects public health and safety? What is the most thoughtful way to \nproceed? Mr. President, the most thoughtful way to proceed is to reject \nS. 104. It has been asserted that we have no policy with respect to the \ndisposal of nuclear waste. That is simply not true. The policy that we \nhave was essentially designed in 1982 with the enactment of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, and that policy first is to site permanent \nrepository. I am not ecstatic about, I do not like it, and I wish it \nwere not the case that Yucca Mountain in my own State was chosen. But \nthat is a policy that came down as a result of the things that were \ndone and I believe were highly politicized in terms of the way it was \ndone. But nevertheless that is where we are. Yucca Mountain is being \ncharacterized as an interim storage. This legislation would change the \nexisting law, which says that we ought to seek first if a permanent \nrepository can pass muster, is it suitable, before making a \ndetermination as to interim storage. This legislation reverses that \nprocess and says, in effect, that we will make decisions with respect \nto interim storage irrespective of what happens with respect to the \npermanent repository. That makes no sense at all.\n\n  Finally, I think, just as an admonition, that this has been a very \ndifficult time for Nevada. I believe that it is without precedent in \nthe years that I have been a Member of this body that a State has been \nso imposed upon, so unconsidered, so rejected of a rational policy \nargument to acquiesce to the requests of a special interest group--the \nnuclear utilities in America.\n  But let me say that if we pass S. 104, what a dreadful precedent that \nmay be. No other State can be heard to say thereafter, ``Gee, this is \nterrible policy for us as it affects my State.'' In effect, we \nestablish a precedent in which a State's rights are imposed upon in \nwhich the State's ability to protect its own citizens' health and \nsafety by way of Federal environmental standards being limited, and in \nwhich those very basic provisions of the ability to review and get \njudicial determination before something as horrendous as this is \nimposed upon a State, are for all intents and purposes emasculated. \nThat is the dreadful policy, and we will rue the day that occurs.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject S. 104. Let's stay the course. It \nmay not be perfect in every respect, but at least we are moving on a \nbasis of permanent repository in a rational context without getting \ninvolved in the emotionalism that has been present with respect to this \nfrantic effort to have interim storage placed at the Nevada test site, \na site, as we pointed out, which has not been recommended as a site to \nbe preferred. Never, to the best of my knowledge, has it ever been \nstudied for interim storage, and it was kind of picked out of the air. \n``You have Yucca Mountain over there, and Yucca Mountain may take it. \nSo let's put it here.'' That is not a very rational basis to make a \npolicy judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. This much needed \nlegislation will help protect the American taxpayers and ratepayers and \nresolve our Nation's growing nuclear waste storage problem.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Department of Energy will not live \nup to its 15-year promise to collect commercial nuclear waste into a \ncentralized repository. Unfortunately, with over $6 billion of \nratepayer's money already spent by the Federal Government, a permanent \nrepository will still not be completed until well into the next \ncentury.\n  The map behind me illustrates the result of this failed policy: The \ncreation of over 80 nuclear waste storage sites across our Nation. From \ncoast to coast and from one international border to another, over 41 \nStates have been affected by the lack of action. As my colleagues can \nsee, this is not a regional problem; it's a national problem demanding \na Federal solution.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government should no longer be allowed to \nforget its commitment to the American public. Last year, the Federal \ncourt of appeals agreed that this was a Federal problem when it ruled \nthat the Department of Energy will be liable for damages if it does not \naccept commercial nuclear waste by January 31, 1998.\n  Under current law, no one at the DOE will be held personally liable \nfor any\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\nassessed damages; the bill will go to the American taxpayers at an \nestimated cost between $40 and $80 billion. Such a tremendous liability \nburden on taxpayers would make the public bailout of the savings and \nloan collapse seem small in comparison.\n  Many others agree that a Federal solution is needed immediately. \nFrustrated with the DOE's inability to resolve our nuclear storage \nproblem, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, \n48 State agencies, and 38 utilities have joined forces to ask the \nFederal courts to suspend ratepayer's payments into the nuclear waste \nfund, which finances the Federal Government's commercial nuclear waste \nprogram.\n  They are concerned that their constituents and customers are being \nasked to pay too many times for a failed policy.\n  Take, for instance, the situation facing ratepayers in my home State \nof Minnesota. Since 1982, Minnesota's nuclear energy consumers have \npaid over $250 million into the nuclear waste fund believing that the \nFederal Government would fulfill its obligation to transport nuclear \nwaste out of Minnesota.\n  But as time went on and the DOE continued to ignore its \nresponsibilities, utilities in Minnesota and around the country were \nforced to temporarily store their waste within the confines of their \nown facilities.\n  When it became clear to many utilities that storage space was running \nout and the Department of Energy would not accept waste by the \nestablished deadline, utilities then had to go to their States to ask \nfor additional onsite storage or else be forced to shut down their \noperations.\n  For example, ratepayers in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and \nWisconsin were forced to pay for onsite storage in cooling pools at \nPrairie Island in southeastern Minnesota. In 1994, with storage space \nrunning out, the Minnesota Legislature--after a bruising battle--voted \nto allow for limited onsite dry cask storage until the year 2004.\n  Mr. President, the cost associated with this onsite storage is \nstaggering. Ratepayers in the midwestern service area alone have paid \nover $25 million in storage costs and will pay an estimated $100 \nmillion more by the year 2015, in addition to the required payments to \nthe Federal Government.\n  To make matters worse, storage space will run out at Prairie Island \njust after the turn of the century, forcing the plant to close unless \nthe State legislature once again makes up for the DOE's inaction. This \nwill threaten over 30 percent of Minnesota's overall energy resources \nand will likely lead to even higher costs for Minnesota's ratepayers.\n  In fact, the Minnesota Department of Public Service estimates that \nthe increase in costs could reach as high as 17 percent, forcing \nratepayers to eventually pay three times: once to the nuclear waste \nfund, again for onsite storage, and yet again for increased energy \ncosts.\n  And Minnesota is not alone in facing this unacceptable situation; 36 \nother States across the Nation are facing similar circumstances of \neither shutting down and losing their energy-generating capacity or \ncontinuing to bail out the Federal Government for its failure to act.\n  So, Mr. President, when some of my colleagues speak about how well \nthe status quo is working, I would simply point them to my home State \nof Minnesota where the status quo has failed dismally--to the detriment \nof the ratepayers and soon to the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record \nrecent letters from Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson and Minnesota \nDepartment of Public Service Commissioner Kris Sanda on the need to \npass legislation correcting our Nation's nuclear waste program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Minnesota Department\n\n\n                                            of Public Service,\n\n                                     St. Paul, MN, April 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: Your leadership on the need to address \n     high-level nuclear waste at the nation's nuclear power plants \n     is greatly appreciated. I will continue to do everything in \n     my power to ensure a successful outcome to the vote tomorrow \n     morning and assist you in your efforts on behalf of all \n     Americans who face the costly burden of continuing to delay \n     reform of the U.S. civilian nuclear waste program.\n       Attached is a letter from Governor Carlson sent this \n     morning to individual Senators urging their vote for S. 104, \n     the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. I hope it helps them to \n     understand the urgency for action.\n       Once again, thank you for your powerful advocacy on this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Kris Sanda,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                           State of Minnesota,\n\n                                     St. Paul, MN, April 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: I am writing to strongly urge your \n     support for S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. \n     This Act addresses the glaring deficiencies and failures of \n     this country's civilian nuclear waste program and is of the \n     utmost importance to all American electric consumers and \n     taxpayers.\n       In brief summary, S. 104:\n       ensures adequate funding for the permanent disposal \n     program.\n       eliminates the need for individual high-level waste storage \n     sites at 73 nuclear power plants in 34 states.\n       provides centralized waste storage for which DOE is legally \n     responsible under contracts signed with individual utilities.\n       ensures the scientific integrity of the disposal program. \n     It authorizes the President to locate the centralized storage \n     site away from Yucca Mountain if, at the President's \n     discretion, it is found to be an unsuitable site.\n       subjects waste transportation to Federal hazardous \n     materials regulations and NRC oversight.\n       ensures National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews \n     are prepared for licensing. Only those issues already \n     addressed by Congress (i.e., facility need and program \n     alternatives) are not revisited under NEPA.\n       averts tens of billions of dollars of U.S. Judgments Fund \n     payments as well as related budget and appropriations \n     problems that will result from program failure.\n       American consumers have paid $13 billion to meet their \n     obligation for funding waste disposal under contracts with \n     the federal government. Over half that money has been spent \n     for something else. Now is the time to end this consumer \n     fraud.\n       Please support S. 104.\n           Warmest regards,\n                                         Governor Arne H. Carlson.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, if there's one part of the status \nquo that is working within our Nation's overall nuclear waste disposal \nprogram, it is the way in which the Federal Government is actively \nmeeting the needs of foreign countries. It is not working for domestic \nspent fuel, but our program seems to be working very well in meeting \nthe needs of spent nuclear fuel from foreign countries.\n\n  As this map shows, the DOE has resumed collecting spent nuclear fuel \nfrom a total of 41 countries under the Atoms for Peace Program.\n  Similar to the large number of our States which are facing nuclear \nwaste storage problems, countries from around the world are \nexperiencing the same problems. The only difference is that their \nneeds--not our own ratepayers' needs--are being met by our Federal \nGovernment.\n  In fact, the DOE has completed urgent relief shipments of 252 spent \nnuclear fuel assemblies from European nations to the agency's facility \nat Savannah River. It has also accepted nuclear spent fuel from Latin \nAmerican countries. Ultimately, as I learned during a recent trip to \nthe Savannah River site, up to 890 foreign research reactor cores will \nbe accepted by the DOE over a 13-year period.\n  So they can take it from foreign countries and handle it safely, but \nsomehow they cannot handle domestic spent nuclear fuels.\n  Mr. President, an important point to discuss when it comes to these \nforeign nuclear waste shipments is how they are transported once they \nreach the continental United States. Nuclear assemblies from these 41 \ncountries have been and will continue to be transported by rail and \ntruck to the Savannah River facility. These photographs illustrate just \none of the means by which shipments of foreign-generated fuel are being \ntransported to the DOE's facility. Here, my colleagues can clearly see \nhow foreign nuclear waste is being loaded on to railcars at Charleston \nHarbor and then shipped to the Savannah River facility. The safety \nrecord of these shipments speaks for itself.\n  The Federal Government is also actively accepting nuclear waste from \nmany of our universities nationwide. As this map indicates, nuclear \nwaste from research reactors at our finest\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\neducational institutions is being accepted at the DOE's Savannah River \nfacility. Again, this nuclear waste is being safely transported by rail \nand truck across the Nation. Chairman Murkowski also spoke extensively \non this safety record earlier today.\n  There has not been one accident nor any release of nuclear \nfuel. These shipments serve as a very small portion of the 2,400 \nshipments of high-level nuclear waste that has already been shipped \nacross the United States, including naval spent fuel. So, Mr. \nPresident, as the distinguished chairman of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee has indicated, transportation is no longer \na question of technology but becomes one of politics.\n\n  I understand the rationale behind reducing our international nuclear \ndangers by collecting and transporting spent fuel within our borders. \nBut what I and many others cannot comprehend is how our Government has \nmade it a priority to help foreign countries with their nuclear waste \nproblems while simultaneously ignoring the concerns right here in our \nown country.\n  Under this scheme, our Nation will have a disjointed nuclear waste \nstorage policy: one that works for our universities and foreign nations \nand another that has failed and will soon be partially administered by \nthe actions of the Federal Court of Appeals. It seems clear to me that \nwhile States, utilities, and ratepayers have kept their end of the \nbargain, the DOE has not. That sends the wrong message to the American \npeople about trusting the promises of the Federal Government.\n  The Federal Government is living up to its promises in the Atoms for \nPeace Program. It is accepting spent nuclear fuel from 41 countries. \nThey have lived up to that policy, that agreement, and that contract, \nbut somehow they can't live up to contracts with the American \nratepayers.\n  Despite widespread support for action to create an interim storage \nsite--including support from former DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary and Dan \nDreyfus, the former administrator of the civilian nuclear waste program \nunder the Clinton administration--the DOE has failed to offer a \nsubstantive alternative to our legislation. Although the Department's \nnew Secretary, Federico Pena, now admits that a Federal solution is \nneeded to resolve our interim storage problems, he recently indicated \nin a meeting with nuclear utility executives that the DOE is still \nunwilling to move commercial spent fuel. Instead, the DOE offered a \nproposal to compensate utilities for on-site storage.\n  In other words, they will not accept it. But the DOE says it is \nwilling and offered a proposal to compensate utilities for on-site \nstorage.\n  Unfortunately, this proposed compensation scheme does little but \nneedlessly spend the taxpayers' money while continuing the failed \nstatus quo. In other words, it just wants to collect more money from \nthe taxpayers and then pay it out as compensation. So you are going to \ntake it from one pocket and put it into another. It is still the \ntaxpayers who are going to be left holding the bag, not the Department \nof Energy, not their budget, not the Secretary of Energy Mr. Pena, but \nthe taxpayers. In other words, they don't want to solve the problem. \nThey just want taxpayers to continue to pay for their mistakes. It \nsignals to the ratepayers that the Federal Government has no intention \nof moving commercial nuclear waste in the near future, despite a \nFederal court mandate.\n\n  Moreover, continuing the policy of noncentralized storage facilities \nmay lead to the premature shutdown of one nuclear plant in Minnesota--\ncompromising 30 percent of the State's energy needs and significantly \nincreasing ratepayer costs.\n  Again, this is not only typical to Minnesota. Many other States face \nthe same problem. Many utilities are facing the same problem. \nRatepayers could be paying the same increase in power because, again, \nof the lack of action by the DOE.\n  In recent communications to the Senate, DOE Secretary Pena and the \nPresident's Office of Management and Budget yet again indicated the \nClinton administration's opposition to our legislation to move nuclear \nwaste from the over 80 sites around the Nation.\n  Speaking of the need for a long-term, permanent repository, the \nletters failed to address any specific alternatives to our legislation \nor how the Federal Government will address future taxpayer liability in \nlight of the DOE's failure to live up to its 1998 contractual deadline. \nThey offer no alternative except to sit back and say, yes, they will \nadhere to any court-ordered compensation because it is no money out of \ntheir pocket. They can just delay or defer any kind of an agreement or \nanswer and will not live up to their contractual deadline.\n  In the last week of debate on this legislation, we have negotiated \nwith Senator Bingaman and others who want to resolve our interim \nnuclear waste storage needs. Some important and constructive changes to \nour bill have resulted from that. Although I oppose one change that \nmoves the construction of the interim storage facility back 1 or 2 \nyears, a number of reforms have been made to address the concerns of \nthe administration. Among them are helpful provisions strengthening \nradiation protection standards, preemption of State and Federal laws, \nenvironmental concerns, and funding for the civilian nuclear waste \nprogram.\n  These important changes should help persuade some of my colleagues to \nsupport this commonsense environmental protection bill, and it should \nalso help pave the way for the President to sign this legislation based \non sound policy and not to veto it due to political concerns. Again, \nthis is not oversight. It is not over technology. It is not over the \nsafety record of transportation of spent fuel. It is basic, raw \npolitics. And above all, Congress has an obligation to protect the \nAmerican public from the estimated $40 to $80 billion they face in \nliability expenses. Our bill will reform our current civilian nuclear \nwaste program to help avoid the squandering of billions of dollars of \nratepayers' and taxpayers' money--not that the Federal Government \nhasn't wasted enough recently, but with tax day tomorrow, this should \nalso come as more important to taxpayers to say they don't want \nbillions more dollars squandered.\n  It will eliminate the current need for onsite storage at our Nation's \nnuclear plants, keep plants from shutting down prematurely due to the \nlack of storage space, and maintain stable energy prices.\n  Mr. President, for too long our States, our ratepayers and taxpayers \nhave been threatened by a policy of inaction. As reported out of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee and amended in the Chamber, this \nlegislation sets up a time line for the DOE to finally live up to its \npromises again while helping to protect our environment. As a result, \nthis bill has broad bipartisan support across the Nation. It deserves \nto be passed overwhelmingly on behalf of the American public. In \nclosing, I urge my colleagues to cast politics aside and to take a \ngiant step forward by voting for this very much-needed legislation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Minnesota, as we have laid across \nthe Record here in these proceedings this past week, this legislation \nis bad legislation. If they, the proponents of this legislation, were \ntruly concerned about the ratepayers and the fact that there is a court \ndecision that says that the Federal Government is responsible under the \ncontractual provisions that they entered into with the utilities, it \nwould seem there should be something in the legislation agreeing to \ncompensate utilities. Nothing. That shows how disingenuous the \nproponents of this legislation are. They talk about problems, but the \nlegislation does not meet that.\n  Some have complained, Mr. President, as has my friend from Minnesota, \nabout the rate of progress toward determining Yucca Mountain's \nsuitability for permanent disposition of this waste material. Others \nhave complained about the returns from the investments in the Yucca \nMountain characterization. Those who complain about the Yucca Mountain \nschedule should remember that the Congress has consistently underfunded \nthe project budget. Requested levels for funding have never been met. \nIn fact, allocations have been less than 75 percent of requested \nlevels.\n\n  Perhaps more importantly, this job of developing a permanent \nrepository\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\nof nuclear waste is far more difficult than critics are willing to \nadmit. It is far more difficult than even the technical community \nthought it would be when they started. That difficulty should not be a \nmystery. We are undertaking a mission that has never been done before. \nWe are starting down a path to completely isolate from the environment \nthe most dangerous material in human history for a period longer than \nrecorded human history.\n  We have no experience with such an assignment, so a lot of options \nmust be explored to provide a foundation for the assumptions we must \nmake to evaluate effectiveness of final design. Utilities have pushed \nthese time lines. The reality of a permanent repository demands a \nresearch program in which many unforeseen obstacles must be understood \nand resolved.\n  These things take time and money. The Congress has seen fit to deny \nthe money, so more time has been required than was initially estimated.\n  Complaints about returns on the investment in Yucca Mountain have no \nbasis in fact either. Those who benefit from nuclear power have been \npaying into the nuclear waste repository at the rate of 1 mill per \nkilowatt hour. Those collections today amount to nearly $12 billion, \nmuch of which has yet to be spent.\n  So there is a lot of talk about abuse of this fund by inappropriate \napplication of its resources. It is true that more has been collected \nfrom the ratepayers than has been appropriated for waste disposal to \ndate, but the final bill for a permanent repository is estimated to be \nbetween $34 billion and $50 billion. That is more than the current plan \nproposes to collect, so it is likely the ratepayers will come out \nahead.\n  That means the general public will contribute to the waste repository \nso that ratepayers will get a break before all is said and done.\n  I agree that the waste fund should not be applied to inappropriate \nactivities, and I do not think it has. I agree that we should be \nvigilant to see that all the ratepayers' contributions are used for the \npermanent disposition of spent nuclear fuel. But I also believe that \nthe general taxpayers should not have to pick up the tab for a \nrepository except for that fraction dedicated to disposition of defense \nnuclear waste from whose generation we all benefited through assurance \nof our national security.\n  S. 104 provides no improving legislation with regard to funding the \nrepository, and none is needed now. The returns on Yucca Mountain \ninvestments will be realized when the characterization is complete and \nnot before. Site characterization must be completed before we see \nclearly the path of future actions.\n  In short, my friend from Minnesota has not addressed the problems \nthat we face. Those problems are the environmental laws are not being \nmet. The transportation problems are certainly not being met. And the \nfact is that there are many, many problems still in existence.\n  The parties to the current litigation regarding DOE's contracts with \nwaste holders are using on-site storage costs to justify their threats \nto seek damages from the Government. We have gone into this on many \noccasions.\n  Sponsors of S. 104 stood and argued on this floor that only passage \nof this bill will relieve every American of this huge obligation. The \nactual incremental costs of on-site storage at the generator sites is \nminimal. That cost is negligible when compared to the costs of \ntransportation and the costs that the permanent or temporary repository \nwould cost.\n  I believe that we should understand that we are here as a result of \nthe nuclear power industry, and that reason only. There are certainly, \nMr. President, many reasons why the statement of the Senator from \nMinnesota was without fact. Those are spread across this record. We \nhave answered such statements on many occasions these past 7 days.\n\n\n                      hanford nuclear reservation\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like a clarification of the scope \nand intent of the committee's third amendment to S. 104. That \namendment, which is incorporated into section 204(b)(1)(D) of the act, \nstates that the President shall not designate the Hanford Nuclear \nReservation in the State of Washington as the site for construction of \nan interim storage facility.\n  Am I correct in my belief that this amendment defines interim storage \nfacility in a way that would not preclude steps that the Washington \nPublic Power Supply System might need to take with regard to the \nstorage of the spent nuclear fuel generated at the WNP-2 facility?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct. The intent of the committee in \nadopting the third committee amendment was to prevent the President \nfrom designating the Hanford Nuclear Reservation as the site of the \nnationwide interim storage facility for all civilian and spent nuclear \nfuel and high-level radioactive waste from U.S. commercial reactors. \nThis amendment is not intended to preclude steps that an individual \nutility, such as the supply system, might need to take to manage the \nstorage of its own spent nuclear fuel.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nickles pertaining to the introduction of S. 570 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about a difficulty that we \nhave had this winter in Wyoming and Montana in the Yellowstone Park \narea with respect to buffalo. Many of you, of course, have read about \nthe problem as a result of an extremely difficult winter, freezing rain \nand snow, lack of feed, and I think also an excessive number of \nbuffalo. As chairman of the Senate Energy Committee Subcommittee on \nNational Parks, I come to the floor today to announce that we plan to \nhold hearings on the prospective plan for bison in Yellowstone Park \nnext year. It is not our purpose to particularly pick apart what \nhappened last year, but what we want to do is avoid the same thing \nhappening in the year that is to come.\n  Many of you have probably read in this weekend's New York Times some \ndetails about the conflicting and contentious perspectives regarding \nbison and the issue of brucellosis. The hearing I plan to have will be \nto spur the Interior Department to set a plan for the upcoming year. If \nwe do not, then we might very well end up with another year of the same \nkinds of difficulties.\n  Many buffalo in Yellowstone Park are afflicted with brucellosis, \nwhich is a major threat to the surrounding livestock States that border \non Yellowstone Park, particularly, in this case, Montana. \nUnfortunately, the only solution that has been developed so far for the \nPark Service in the State of Montana is to shoot the buffalo as they \ncome out of Yellowstone. Clearly, that solution is not acceptable. We \nhave to find one that is a long-term solution to the problem.\n  Management of the bison herd in Yellowstone is not a brand new idea. \nClearly, there has to be some kind of management to a herd of this \nkind. There has been a great deal of interest in having a natural, \nfree-roaming herd, which would be a nice thing. Up until about 1967, \nhowever, it was managed very closely. Then the decision was made to let \nthe herd simply act as it would in a natural situation and be \ncontrolled by the lack of feed and predators and all those kinds of \nthings. Unfortunately, that is not very workable in a park that is \nvisited by 3 million people a year, in a park where other kinds of \ncontrols are not in place. So the result is the herd had grown from \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 1,500 bison to nearly 4,000. There are \nover 3,500. As long as the weather circumstances and the grazing \ncircumstances were excellent, they were able to get by, even though \nmost observers did note that the grazing there was damaged considerably \nby that number of bison.\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\n  So the Park Service has made some efforts to address the matter. But \nthe fact is that there has not been any real leadership for doing \nsomething over a period of time. Instead of facing the problem, the \nPark Service focused on the theory of natural regulation. As you can \nsee by the events of last year, that natural regulation did not resolve \nthe matter. Natural regulation does not work well when one Federal \nagency holds the threat over ranchers in the State that they will be \nstripped of their brucellosis-free status if bison cross into their \nState. At the same time, another Federal agency encourages wildlife to \nmigrate from the park by not developing a proper management plan. This \nis precisely, of course, what happened.\n  It is more a problem in Montana than it is in Wyoming. You at least \nhave a buffer in Wyoming, on both the south and east sides of the park, \nof a forest wilderness area; whereas, in fact, private property grazing \ntakes place immediately outside of the park on the Montana side.\n\n  So, in order to avoid repeating that unfortunate situation, where a \ngood number of bison starved to death in the park and another number \nwas shot as they went out of the park to avoid the problem of \nbrucellosis, we think we need to find a more innovative solution. The \ntime for finger pointing is over. It has been sort of a tough deal out \nthere, with everybody being involved.\n  What we need is some strong leadership to face the issue. \nUnfortunately, the President has still not appointed a new Director of \nthe Park Service. It is a little difficult to deal with the Park \nService and Interior Department in terms of policy, in terms of the \nfuture, when there really is not a permanent Director there. So we \nclearly need, and it is very vital that we have, focused and solid \nleadership in the National Park Service. In fact, I have sent a letter \ntoday to the President urging he do that.\n  Along with Chairman Murkowski, I and others on the Senate Energy \nCommittee are willing to work with the administration to develop \npositive and constructive solutions. As a matter of fact, we have held \na couple of general hearings on the park. Our purpose in the next \nseveral months will be to take a look at the park to find a way, a very \npositive way, to strengthen the National Park System. We have about 375 \nparks. I think they are among the most important elements of our \nculture and our history, and our effort ought to be increased to \nmaintain those natural resources as well as providing an opportunity \nfor visitors to enjoy them.\n  So, we are ready to address the tough issues and launch a proparks \nagenda for this next year to try to make some moves to ensure that this \nbuffalo incident does not occur next year and that we find a solution \nthat protects not only the buffalo, protects not only the resource, but \nalso protects the surrounding States and their very important livestock \nindustries and allows them to remain in a brucellosis-free \ncertification area. So we will be moving forward on that, Mr. \nPresident. I appreciate the opportunity, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3110-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3111-S3113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senate has before it at this moment, \nand has for some days, through tomorrow, the consideration of Senate \nbill 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997.\n  Senator Frank Murkowski, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and myself, along with a good number of others of our \ncolleagues, have recognized the need for this Government and this \nCongress to clarify its position on high-level nuclear waste and spent \nfuel in compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as \namended in 1987.\n  As a result of that recognition, that is exactly what we are doing. \nWe are certainly encouraging at this moment a resounding passage of \nthis bill tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, last week my colleague from Alaska, the chairman of \nthe committee, introduced the substitute. I am discouraged that in \nspite of all the work we have done, the administration has not \nwithdrawn its veto threat of this legislation.\n  We have listened to the other side. We have incorporated amendments \nfrom the other side. We have now picked up substantially more Members \nfrom the other side who are supporting this bill.\n  I have recently reviewed, once again, the basis for the veto threat \nand I find no remaining legitimate reason for this administration to be \nin opposition.\n  Let me address just a couple of specifics for just a few moments.\n  The statement of administration policy states that S. 104 would \neffectively establish Nevada as the site of an interim nuclear storage \nfacility before a viability assessment of Yucca Mountain is completed. \nNot true. Mr. President, let me repeat, that is an untrue statement.\n  S. 104 designates the Nevada site as the location for the interim \nstorage facility after--after--the DOE completes the viability \nassessment in 1998.\n  The statement of administration policy states that S. 104 would \ncreate loopholes in the National Environmental Policy Act. The truth is \nthat the substitute has lengthened the duration of both licensing and \npublic participation opportunities. Again, what the President said and \nwhat is in fact in the legislation simply do not relate.\n  The statement of administration policy states that S. 104 replaces \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's authority to set acceptable \nradiation release standards with a statutory standard. Again, we have \nfully addressed this concern. Our substitute reverses the approach on \nsetting an environmental standard for the deep geologic repository. S. \n104, as introduced, set a standard of 100 millirem. Last week, I \naddressed this body and set this 100 millirem in the proper context of \neveryday risk from everyday living. I noted for my colleagues that we \nreceive an annual radiation dosage of 80 millirem simply by spending \nmost of our time inside the U.S. Senate. Why? It is a product of the \nradiation that comes from the granite structure around the Senate body \nitself. In other words, the normal decay of stone that is part of the \nstructure of this Capitol.\n  We have listened, however, to the concerns of our opponents and the \nadministration, that this legislation should contain a risk-based \nstandard. We have heard discussions. We have listened to those \nsuggestions and adopted the recommendations of the National Academy of \nScience.\n  In our openness to enhance the broad bipartisan support already \nenjoyed by this legislation, we have listened to all of those \nsuggestions. Therefore, our substitute now requires that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency determine a risk-based radiation \nstandard for the repository.\n  In other words, we tried to utilize all national and international \nstandards that are acceptable to the public, based on science, but were \nforced to say, OK, you won't believe the truth, then we will allow the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency latitude in developing those standards. \nOur substitute directs that the Environmental Protection Agency set \nthis radiation standard in accordance with the National Academy of \nScience's recommendations.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleague, the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, the Senator from Alaska, for conducting a \nprocess for developing this legislation and this substitute, in what I \nbelieve to be an unprecedented character of openness and willingness to \nhear and respond to the concerns of our opponents. There is simply, Mr. \nPresident, no legitimate remaining basis for the administration's \nopposition to this legislation. I urge the President of the United \nStates not to fight this Congress. This Congress will soon express its \nwill on the issue and, most likely, the outcome will be the same broad, \nbipartisan consensus that we developed in the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, I said a few days ago on this floor that this \nlegislation was\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\ngood science and good engineering and good technology, and that there \nwould be one simple reason to oppose it, and that would be political. I \nstand here today with the amendments the chairman has accepted and the \ncharacter of this legislation when it comes to final passage. I now can \nsay in fact that there are no impediments for this administration to \naccept this legislation, except for politics, and politics alone.\n  I am amazed that the President of the United States can say that, \nbecause of his politics, he is willing to ask the American people to \npay an additional $80 billion--or potentially that amount--in a \nnegative environmental situation, when we are standing here today with \na very positive environmental move that would cost less than about $3 \nbillion to develop an interim storage facility. This facility would \nallow the Congress of the United States and the administration to say \nto the American people that we will abide by the law, we will adhere to \nthe courts and the laws that have already been passed by past \nCongresses to develop a deep geologic repository, and we will do so in \na timely fashion. That is the issue before the Congress when it \nconsiders S. 104.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with us in a resounding bipartisan \nvote as we deal with this critical national major environmental issue. \nWe have worked to resolve it in a balanced approach that all can agree \nwith. I think the efforts of Senator Murkowski will be demonstrated in \na vote that we see cast on this legislation tomorrow.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, in 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act and tasked the Federal Government with the handling of spent \nnuclear waste from commercial powerplants and military usages. Despite \nthe clear congressional intent of the act, the Department of Energy has \navoided and delayed positive action regarding temporary and permanent \nstorage of nuclear waste.\n  The 1982 act called for a permanent waste repository to be built by \n1998. But DOE now says the earliest a repository will be ready is 2010. \nGiven 15 years of relative inaction, this delay and avoidance history \ndoes not engender faith that the current administration will address \nthis issue in a timely manner absent congressional action. Regrettably, \nthe country that harnessed energy of the atom can't seem to accomplish \nthe basic task of storing and disposing of waste.\n  The Federal Government promised nuclear energy consumers that it \nwould develop a plan to dispose of the waste. Congress obligated the \nFederal Government to begin the waste collection program in 1998. A \nFederal court of appeals ruled in 1996 that this is a binding legal \nobligation.\n  The Federal Government, therefore, has a binding, legal obligation to \npick up the nuclear waste scattered throughout the Nation's coastal \ncommunities, farm lands and industrial centers. It must remove used \nnuclear fuel from 34 States that now store used fuel at nuclear \npowerplants that were never intended to hold the waste until the end of \ntime.\n  Due to the foresight of 15 Senators who reported the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1997 out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nand in particularly its architects, Senators Frank Murkowski and Larry \nCraig, we are here today to put this program back on the road to \nrecovering used fuel from commercial powerplants and DOE facilities \nthat store high-level radioactive waste from defense-related projects. \nIn 30 years of operation, that waste has amounted to a relatively small \nsum, given that nuclear electricity powers 65 million homes at any \ngiven time in the United States. All of the used fuel produced from \nnuclear electricity during its history, if stacked end to end, would \nspan a football field to a depth of almost 4 yards.\n  While a permanent repository is the ultimate requirement, no one can \nlegitimately deny that an interim storage facility is an absolute \nnecessity.\n  Let's talk for a minute about the cost to the public. America's \nelectricity consumers have relied upon the availability of nuclear \nenergy. But such consumption did not occur in a vacuum and without \ncost. These energy users have already committed nearly $13 billion to \npay for the Federal waste disposal program--a staggering figure \nconsidering there's nothing to show for such costs to date except for a \nfew feasibility studies. The bill continues to climb, even as the \nDepartment of Energy says it will be unable to start taking used fuel \nby the 1998 deadline.\n  Some States are so frustrated by the Federal Government's failure on \nthis program that they are considering withholding their share of the \nmore than $600 million a year that flows from electricity customers to \nthe U.S. Treasury. How can we blame them?\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, would put an end to \nbureaucratic delays and spiraling program costs by integrating three \ncomponents:\n  First, a Federal storage facility for centralized management of used \nfuel until a permanent disposal facility is ready;\n  Second, a continued scientific study on a permanent disposal site at \nYucca Mountain, NV; and,\n  Third, a transportation network to move used fuel safely from nuclear \npowerplants, research reactors and DOE sites to storage and disposal \nfacilities.\n  It has been argued by some that we cannot safely transport spent or \nused nuclear fuel waste from nuclear powerplants to a central storage \nfacility. Certainly the naysayers recognize that we do not intend to \nthrow used nuclear fuel on a truckbed or in a boxcar.\n  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has rigid standards about the types \nof containers it permits nuclear waste to be transported in. All such \ncontainers must receive their stamp of approval. Before such approval, \ncontainers must undergo an onslaught of tests without breaking open and \nallowing radiation to escape. They must successively withstand a 30-\nfoot drop onto a flat, unyielding surface; a drop of 40 inches onto a \nsteel spike; and a fully engulfing fire burning at 1,475 degrees \nFahrenheit.\n  For proof of the canisters' performance, look at the safety record of \nthe 2,400-plus shipments of used nuclear fuel that have taken place in \nthe United States during the past three decades. Not one used fuel \ncontainer has ever ruptured during those trips. Radioactive fuel has \nnever been released, harmed the environment, or caused any injury or \npublic safety threat.\n  By shipping to a single storage spot, we are reducing the level of \nrisk. A remote, desert location would provide an added margin of \nsafety. Logically, used fuel can be managed more efficiently and \neffectively at an individual site than it can at multiple sites.\n  S. 104 goes further to alleviate safety concerns by ensuring that \nFederal funds and resources are channeled to State and tribal officials \nfor public safety training to handle and manage used fuel long before \nthe first shipment enters their area.\n  Many of my colleagues know what it's like to have nuclear waste \nsitting in their backyards. Pennsylvania, for instance, currently \nstores 2,920 metric tons of uranium at nine nuclear powerplant sites \nnext door to dairy farms and the fourth largest apple producing region \nin the country. Failure to adopt S. 104 would be irresponsible in the \nface of current storage arrangements and limitations. By passing S. \n104, my colleagues can prove our resolve to end the Nation's nuclear \nwaste dilemma.\n  Nuclear waste disposal must not become mired in petty politics. There \nis no better time to act on nuclear waste disposal than now. It's the \nonly prudent and economic course. The greater delay, the greater the \ncosts to taxpayers and electricity consumers. A new user fee mechanism \nproposed in S. 104 would continue funding nuclear waste disposal on a \nself-financing basis and adapt the nuclear waste fund to recent changes \nin the Federal budget process.\n  Funds originally intended to cover the cost of the nuclear waste \ndisposal program have been diverted elsewhere to offset deficit \nspending. Detouring waste fund payments may help counteract the \ndeficit, but it does little to further the Federal Government's \nobligation to managed used nuclear fuel. In\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\nreality, even though consumers have committed more than $13 billion to \nthe nuclear waste fund, the Energy Department has spent only about $6 \nbillion. That's about 30 cents on the dollar being spent on the waste \nprogram. In America, we live under the premise that you ought to get \nwhat you pay for. Our constituents aren't getting what they paid for.\n  Inaction on the part of Congress in ordering the Energy Department to \nact could force other complications, including whether State utility \nregulators will permit additional on-site storage. In Minnesota, the \nState legislature was forced to settle the issue and established new, \nhigh-priced requirements for the utility to meet before securing more \nwaste containers. That costly burden may force utilities to consider \nshutting down nuclear plants prematurely. Is nuclear electricity to \nbecome a casualty of misguided DOE planning or continue, through this \nlegislation, to be a reliable, clean energy source.\n  Don't forget that this legislation isn't just about finding a \nsuitable spot for commercial nuclear waste. States like Idaho must \nworry about permanent storage for high-level radioactive waste from \ndefense-related activities and used fuel from research reactors. Idaho \nis host to a wide range of defense facility wastes at the Idaho \nNational Engineering Laboratory. Cleanup of INEL is likely to take \ndecades. But how does the Federal Government plan to clean up this site \nif it has no place to dispose of the high-level waste? Leaving it in \nthe vicinity of the Snake River and Sun Valley hardly qualifies as \nproper action on the part of the Federal Government.\n  That's why S. 104 calls for DOE to factor those types of used fuel \ninto its capacity at an interim storage facility and ultimately at a \npermanent underground repository. This amount of waste from defense \nactivities, naval reactors, universities, and foreign research \nreactors, at a minimum, must be no less than 5 percent of total \nacceptance during a given year.\n  At Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, the Department of Energy \ncollects fuel from naval and research reactor projects like \nConnecticut, and Illinois' Argonne National Laboratory, New Mexico, \nMaryland, Colorado, and California's Aerotest and General Atomics \nsites.\n  DOE is also sending used nuclear fuel to Idaho from foreign research \nreactors. Idaho National Engineering Laboratory will accept used fuel \nassemblies from the Pacific rim this year, even though the Federal \nGovernment will not commit to taking used fuel from commercial reactors \nas it is obligated to next year. And while our taxpaying, electricity \nconsuming constituents are shouldering the entire burden to develop a \nnational waste disposal plan, the Department of Energy and the Clinton \nadministration are willing to have our constituents assume the full \ncost of transporting and managing the spent nuclear fuel from foreign \ncountries with research reactors that can't afford to pay for the \nservice. Why should we be debating this storage issue with Clinton \nadministration opposition when the Department of Energy's position is \nto help foreign countries with their nuclear waste storage problems \nbefore that Department is willing to address our country's own storage \nproblems in a meaningful way?\n  Most importantly, perhaps, let me say that this legislation is \nwithout question the most environmentally sound bill this Congress has \nthe opportunity to approve.\n  S. 104 fully complies with the National Environmental Policy Act. It \ncalls for environmental impact statements for an interim central \nstorage facility and a permanent, underground repository. Judicial \nreview of both impact statements ensures acceptable health and safety \nstandards. It is designed to choose transportation routes that minimize \nimpact on the environment and population centers--by avoiding densely \npopulated areas and shipping only along specified rail and highway \nroutes. States can also participate in the route selection.\n  By finding a suitable place to store nuclear waste, it ensures that \nAmericans will continue to enjoy clean, cost-effective nuclear \nelectricity that is part of the U.S. diverse blend of energy sources. \nSince 1973, our Nation's nuclear powerplants have reduce the cumulative \namount of emissions from carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, by \n1.9 billion metric tons of carbon. In fact, it many reasonably be \nasserted that S. 104 furthers the Clinton administration's climate \nchange action plan, which is intended to achieve a Presidentially \nimposed U.S. limit to carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. \nThat's a reduction of 108 million metric tons of carbon.\n  Madam President, I would like to address our attempts to work with \nthe Clinton administration and the Department of Energy to reach an \nagreement on how we can expeditiously proceed to resolve this problem. \nThe plain fact of the matter is that little progress was made during \nthe past 4 years, and the current position of the administration holds \nlittle hope for much progress during the President's current term of \noffice. The administration and the Department of Energy continue to \nonly pay lip service to the problem without offering any meaningful \nalternative to the solutions proposed in S. 104.\n  S. 104 is the fulfillment of the promise of Congress to the American \npeople and will begin the process of putting in place storage \nfacilities for spent nuclear fuel. We must continue to find solutions \nto potential problems created in the 20th century before we begin to \nbuild bridges to the 21st century. In preparing for our future, we must \nclearly remained focused on the present.\n  The fact is, simply stated, that this country has 109 nuclear \npowerplants operating and providing more than 20 percent of our \nelectricity in a process that produces no harmful air emissions. We \nhave the responsibility, in return, to ensure that the nuclear waste \nfrom those facilities and from defense-related activities is \nsafeguarded and managed in a reasonable and reliable manner. This isn't \na decision to impose upon future generations. It is a decision that is \nour responsibility to make now.\n  In closing, I would like to commend Senators Murkowski, Craig, and \nall those who cosponsored and worked for the passage of S. 104 for \ntheir diligence in pressing forward and recognizing the importance of \nachieving bipartisan support to enact meaningful reform for the benefit \nof the American people. Finally it appears that we are going to pass \nthe legislation which would carry out the intent of that act. If we do \nnot, it would be another 15 years before we would get a final result \nand billions more dollars. We need to act on this legislation. I am \nassured that the House is going to act this year, and we can send this \nlegislation to the President for his hoped-for signature or his veto, \nif he feels so inclined. But I think it is a very important issue. This \nis in my opinion the most important environmental issue that faces this \ncountry. We have nuclear waste in temporary sites in cooling ponds in \nStates, buried in South Carolina, Vermont, in my own State of \nMississippi, Idaho, Minnesota, and from the shores of the Atlantic to \nthe shores of the Pacific. This waste is there and we need action. We \nneed it now.\n\n  This legislation has been carefully drafted. The concerns that have \nbeen raised about transportation are properly addressed here.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support this very carefully \ncrafted legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3111-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President, just across the street from the east \nfront of the U.S. Capitol stands the Minute Man Memorial building, \nwhich houses the Reserve Officers Association of the United States, one \nof the most patriotic and self-sacrificing organizations in the Nation. \nThis year marks the association's 75th anniversary, and its origins, \nhistory, and accomplishments are all well worth remembering.\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\n  At the beginning of World War I, America found herself unprepared to \nenter the fight in Europe because we had an inadequate supply of \ntrained military leaders for our Armed Forces. Confusion prevailed at \nthe War Department while recruiters rushed to select, and the military \nhastened to train, an officer corps that would be large enough to lead \n``Doughboys'' and ``Devil Dogs'' on the battlefields of France and \nGermany. Despite the lack of initial preparation, the United States' \nentry into World War I proved to be the decisive factor in securing \nvictory against our enemies and bringing peace to the continent. After \nthe armistice was signed and our troops came home, American military \nleaders were wisely determined to never be faced with another shortage \nof commissioned officers, and on October 2, 1922, 140 reserve officers, \nat the suggestion of General of the Army John J. Pershing, met at the \nWillard Hotel in Washington, DC. At that meeting, General Pershing \nsaid, ``I consider this gathering perhaps one of the most important, \nfrom a military point of view, that has assembled in Washington or \nanywhere else within the confines of this country within my time,'' and \nthe Reserve Officers Association of the United States [ROA] was \norganized.\n  The new found commitment to a well-trained and equipped force got off \nto a positive start with the passage of the National Defense Act of \n1920 which created a 2 million member ``Citizens Army,'' to be led by a \n200,000 member Officers Reserve Corps. However, it was clear that the \nsuccess of this civilian army and reserve corps of officers would \ndepend entirely upon the patriotic and voluntary spirit of Americans. \nWith this understanding, General Pershing charged ROA with the \nresponsibility to recruit the corps, develop public support for it, and \npetition Congress to appropriate adequate funds to train these citizen \nservice members.\n  As the United States grappled with recovering from the Depression and \ngetting its economy back on its feet, the seeds of war were being sowed \nin Europe and Asia, and on December 7, 1941, a surprise attack on \nAmerican Navy facilities at Pearl Harbor finally pushed our Nation back \ninto another global conflict, World War II. Though still under-prepared \nfor war, we thankfully had an Officer Reserve Corps that had grown to \n115,000 and the chaotic rush to recruit officers that took place in the \nFirst World War was not repeated. General George C. Marshall said, ``In \ncontrast with the hectic days of 1917 * * * with no adequate reservoir \nof officers to draw upon * * * we now have available in the Officers \nReserve Corps a great pool of trained men available for instant \nservice.'' Clearly, the R.O.A. had done their job.\n\n  During the war, the ROA suspended its activities as its members were \noff serving in the branches of the various armed services; once, \nhowever, the hostilities ceased and the troops came home, the ROA \nresumed its activities as advocates for the Reserve forces and a strong \nnational defense. That the founder of one of the first ROA chapters in \nKansas City, Harry S. Truman, was now President of the United States \nsignalled that the reserve structure was to grow and grow stronger in \nthe post-World War II/cold war era. During his administration, \nPresident Truman ordered his Secretary of Defense to aggressively build \na reserve military structure, and the Chief Executive took personal \npride in the passage of a strong Armed Forces Reserve Act.\n  It was also during this period that Congress took the unusual step of \ngranting the ROA a charter mandating the organization ``to support a \nmilitary policy of the United States that will provide adequate \nnational security, and to promote the development and execution \nthereof''. With this infrequently granted charter, Congress, in effect, \nwas telling ROA that it respected its expertise and desired the \nassociation's advice on legislation affecting national security, as \nwell as matters involving the military, both Reserve and Active.\n  Over the years, the ROA has taken its charter and congressional \nmandate seriously. Its positions are without partisanship and are based \nsolely on promoting a strong defense. The officers and members of the \nROA have supported initiatives they thought would strengthen our \nNation's military, and opposed those which would undermine America's \npreparedness. The ROA helped block attempts to eliminate the Coast \nGuard and Air Force Reserves, and to cut the Navy Reserve in half; and, \nthey stood strong against the Panama Canal and the SALT II treaties, as \nwell as any budget or manpower cuts to our Reserve forces. On the other \nhand, revitalizing the Selective Service System, lifting the embargo on \narms sales to Turkey, selling AWACS to Saudi Arabia, and activating the \nReserves during the early days of the gulf war all were supported by \nthe ROA During the Clinton administration, the Association has been out \nfront in seeking postwar benefits for military personnel including \nmedical treatment for victims of gulf war illnesses, and it is most \nnotable that since 1982, the ROA has successfully supported more than \n$15 billion in equipment procurement and construction for the Reserve \nand National Guard.\n\n  Madam President, the ROA of today is a strong and vibrant association \nwhose 100,000 strong membership includes active, retired, and honorably \ndischarged officers of all the services; cadets and midshipmen from the \nservice academies and ROTC programs; and officers of the Public Health \nService, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That \nmore than half of these individuals are life members is an indication \nof the amount of support the ROA has among the Reserve community, and \nthe credibility it has as representatives of our Nation's truest \n``citizen-soldiers''. Obviously, such a dynamic organization requires \ndynamic leadership and I am proud to note that my friend and fellow \nSouth Carolinian, Maj. Gen. Herbert Koger, Jr., USAR, is serving as the \npresident of the ROA this year, an office that is rotated annually \namong each of the services. Additionally, retired Maj. Gen. Roger W. \nSandler, who was Chief of the Army Reserve prior to his 1994 \nretirement, very capably serves as the association's chief of staff. I \ncommend both these men for the excellent jobs they do, especially for \nthe input they give Congress on matters related to our national \nsecurity.\n  Madam President, as the Reserve Officers Association prepares to \nenter its fourth quarter of a century of service, I think it is \nappropriate to cite another quote by General Pershing, who said, ``It \nwould be false economy to save a few dollars by neglecting commonsense \npreparation in peace times, and then to spend billions to make up for \nthe deficiency when war comes.'' These are the watchwords of the men \nand women who makeup the ROA, and words each of us should bear in mind \nas we approach the 21st century and begin to consider the future needs, \nroles, and missions of our armed services.\n  Congratulations to the Reserve Officers Association of the United \nStates on its 75th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3113-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, during the recent congressional recess I \nvisited the U.S. Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin, CA, \nwith Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis Reimer. The purpose of my visit \nwas to observe the culmination of the Army's brigade-size Task Force \nXXI warfighting experiment. I want to take a few moments\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\ntoday to describe this important and far-reaching exercise for my \ncolleagues.\n  The Army's National Training Center is probably the best training \ncenter for mechanized ground combat forces in the world. Army brigades \nrotate through the NTC to test their skills in a 2-week exercise \nagainst the NTC's vaunted opposing force, or OPFOR--the 11th Armored \nCavalry Regiment, currently commanded by Col. Guy Swan. This opposing \nforce uses equipment and tactics similar to those used by the military \nforces of the former Warsaw Pact. Many in the Army consider this force \nto be the best-trained brigade-size force of any army in the world.\n  The exercise I observed with General Reimer was part of the Army's \nTask Force XXI advanced warfighting experiment. It involved the so-\ncalled experimental force of the 1st Brigade of the 4th Infantry \nDivision, Mechanized--the EXFOR--commanded by Col. Tom Goedkoop. This \nwas a long anticipated exercise, Mr. President, because it was the \nfirst brigade-level test of a range of digital technology capabilities \ndesigned to bring the power of information warfare to ground combat \nforces.\n  The goal of the Army's Task Force XXI advanced warfighting experiment \nis to increase the combat power of Army divisions and to make them more \nversatile, more deployable and more agile across a broad range of \nmissions. Some people have even compared the 2-week exercise at the \nNational Training Center with the historic Louisiana maneuvers of the \n1930's which established the structure and warfighting doctrine of our \nWorld War II Army.\n  The Army began this experiment with digitization with the decision \nover a year ago to use the 4th Infantry Division, Mechanized, stationed \nat Fort Hood as a testbed for this technology. The Army established a \nfactory-like operation at Fort Hood to modify over 900 vehicles into \nover 180 different configurations. The EXFOR was equipped with 87 \ndifferent digital systems--over 5,000 individual pieces of equipment in \ntotal. This digital equipment included unmanned aerial vehicles, a \nnetworked computer system, global positioning satellite receivers, \nposition reporting transmitters, digital radios, and the most advanced \nnight vision and thermal imaging equipment.\n  This equipment was developed and designed to dramatically improve the \nsituational awareness capability of the experimental force. Situational \nawareness refers to the ability to determine and track the location of \nall forces on the battlefield at a given time. It is the ability to \nanswer the three questions--Where am I? Where are my buddies? Where is \nthe enemy?--which are critical to success on the modern battlefield. \nEach vehicle in the EXFOR brigade was outfitted with a computer \nterminal that gave the members of the brigade unprecedented and real-\ntime friendly situational awareness from the individual infantry \nfighting vehicles and tanks all the way up to division level, as well \nas unprecedented intelligence on enemy, or OPFOR, operations.\n  The digital equipment also provided the EXFOR with integrated and \nautomated mission planning, mission execution, and command and control \ncapabilities never before available to any army in the world. For \nintelligence information, commanders down to battalion level could \naccess all levels of support, including national satellite systems, \noverhead reconnaissance aircraft like the U-2, the SR-71, and JSTARS, \nthe Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System.\n  During my visit to the NTC, I observed the combat battalions of the \nexperimental force in a deep attack against the opposing force. I \nwatched as the EXFOR conducted breach operations against the OPFOR's \nformidable obstacle system as the OPFOR fought to defend its battle \nposition. While this specific engagement turned out to be a tactical \ndraw, there were many instances where the technology available to the \nexperimental force demonstrated the potential for greatly enhanced \ncapabilities in the Army of the future.\n  Before a combat operation the commander generally conducts what is \ncalled the intelligence preparation of the battlefield. In the case of \noffensive operations, the commander and his staff compare a doctrinal \ntemplate of the way they expect the enemy to array his forces in the \ndefense to that dictated by the actual terrain in the area of \noperations. The resultant situational template allows the commander to \ntarget his reconnaissance effort against the suspected enemy defensive \npositions to confirm or deny the accuracy of the template. He then \nadjusts his scheme of firing and maneuvering to effectively attack and \ndestroy the enemy in his confirmed positions.\n  Today, Army units rely principally on their integral aerial and \nground scouts with their current optical, thermal, or radar systems to \nconduct this reconnaissance. Very often scouts are destroyed before \nreaching their positions, or are unable to send back accurate or timely \nspot reports for any number of reasons. In that case a commander is \nforced to attack against an unconfirmed or incomplete situational \ntemplate of the enemy defense, or is forced to change his scheme of \nmaneuver at the last minute--a particularly difficult and dangerous \nendeavor.\n\n  With its enhanced situational awareness capability, the EXFOR was \nable to conduct the intelligence preparation of the battlefield much \nquicker and with greater accuracy than normal Army brigades. The \nsituational template was developed and transmitted digitally to all \nechelons of command. The commander used all reconnaissance assets, \nincluding national satellite systems, overhead aircraft, UAV \nreconnaissance, and the Joint Surveillance Target Attack System, as \nwell as his integral aerial and ground scouts who were equipped with \nenhanced sights and other surveillance equipment. OPFOR positions were \ndetected and transmitted digitally to all of the EXFOR vehicle computer \nsystems to update the situational template. With such accurate and \ntimely intelligence the commander was able to quickly change the scheme \nof fires and maneuver for his attack with ample time and information \nfor subordinate commanders to plan and react effectively.\n  During the EXFOR attack the OPFOR employed an artillery delivered \nminefield across the EXFOR's avenue of approach in an attempt to \nconfuse and slow the EXFOR attack. With its superior situational \nawareness provided by its digital systems, the EXFOR was able to \ntransmit the locations of the minefield quickly and accurately to \nfollow-on attacking battalions. These battalions were able to avoid the \nminefield and resort to an alternate route of attack. Likewise, \nsuperior situational awareness permitted those battalions, in the dead \nof night, to rapidly traverse the more difficult terrain of the \nalternate route and surprise an OPFOR unaccustomed to such a rapid \nresponse on the part of a training unit.\n  During this attack highly accurate situational awareness permitted \nrapid and effective EXFOR response in other situations as well. In the \nbattle I observed, the EXFOR placed very accurate counter-battery radar \ncoverage zones around its units that needed priority protection. This \nproved critical when the EXFOR combat engineers were breaching the \nobstacles in front of the OPFOR defensive position and came under OPFOR \nmortar attack. The counter-battery radars detected the first incoming \nrounds and alerted EXFOR artillery, which immediately responded with \ncounter-battery fires that destroyed the OPFOR mortars before they \ncould fire another round against the engineers.\n  During the later stages of the battle I visited the brigade and \ndivisional tactical operations centers and saw the soldiers and \nofficers of the EXFOR using the digital equipment in the most realistic \ncombat environment the Army can simulate short of actual war. I \nobserved the unmanned aerial vehicle--or UAV--being flown from a van \nattached to the brigade tactical operations center under the direction \nof one of the brigade operations officers, providing the brigade with \nreal-time intelligence and tremendous targeting information. The \ncommander of the OPFOR brigade later told me that he had to devote \nsignificantly more resources to protecting his own forces in this \nexercise compared to others. He said that all of his soldiers, for \nexample, spent a lot of time during the 2-week exercise looking up in \nthe sky and watching for the EXFOR's UAV's.\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\n  Madam President, an important aspect of the Army's effort to \nincorporate digital technology into its divisions is the unprecedented \ncooperation between the Army and the contractor community. This \ncooperation extended to the exercise at the National Training Center. \nDuring my visit I toured what the Army calls the Central Technical \nSupport Facility, a facility jointly manned by Army personnel and \ncontractor personnel. The Army established this unique organization to \nact as an enabler for rapid integration of software and hardware \nsystems through interaction of soldiers, contractors, and program \nmanagers. Any problems identified by the soldier-users of the tactical \ninternet and digital systems were immediately dealt with by hardware \nand software engineers at the Central Technical Support Facility. In \nsome cases, their solutions resulted in design changes which were \nimmediately incorporated into the experiment, shaving months or years \noff the normal time-lines for the testing and acquisition process. \nSenior Army officials believe this concept is a prototype which holds \ngreat potential for changing the way users and contractors interact in \nthe future. I share the Army's interest in further development of this \narrangement.\n  I have inevitably been asked who won the 2-week exercise--was it the \nEXFOR with its new technology, or was it the OPFOR who lacked the newer \ntechnology but had a tremendous home-field advantage with its intimate \nknowledge of the terrain and long experience of fighting together? The \nanswer to that question is not nearly as important as the answer to the \nquestion of how effective were the various new technologies used by the \nEXFOR.\n  The answer to both will have to wait for the results of the \ncomprehensive after-action review that is being conducted by the Army. \nMy own discussions during my visit left me with the overall impression \nthat this digitization technology can be a tremendously powerful tool \nfor the Army. UAV's--unmanned aerial vehicles--were a great force \nmultiplier, as were the latest generation night vision equipment and \nthe situational awareness technology. The Apache Longbow helicopter, \nthe new Javelin antitank weapon and the Paladin howitzer were all \ncombat systems available to the EXFOR which gave them a clear advantage \nover the OPFOR, and these systems were made even more effective by \nUAV's and other systems that provided real-time targeting data.\n  In some significant instances, the NTC exercise did not reflect the \nfull potential of some new technologies that are already reaching the \ndeployed forces. For example, the M1A2 tank is in such short supply at \nthis time that the Army is fielding this system only with the early \ndeploying combat forces. The EXFOR was using M1A1 tanks with internally \nmounted computer terminals to provide situational awareness. Although \nthese internally mounted terminals are a great help, they are not a \nlong-term solution and do not adequately represent the target \nacquisition and situational awareness capability of the embedded \ninformation warfare systems fielded with the M1A2.\n\n  The technologies that the Army is testing under their advanced \nwarfighting experiments are not without bugs and problems. Some \nechelons of command, for example, were reluctant to rely on the real-\ntime situational awareness reported digitally over the EXFOR's tactical \ninternet and preferred instead to rely on traditional acetate maps and \nvoice communications. With much of the technology still in development, \nthis reliance on traditional methods of command and control was \nunderstandable, and some backup capability to the tactical internet \nwill need to be retained in the future. In general, though, much of the \ntechnology that I saw on display during the exercise can be \nincorporated into systems that will significantly improve the \nsurvivability and lethality of our Army combat forces. The commander of \nthe OPFOR brigade acknowledged that his brigade had been tested more \nthan usual by the EXFOR brigade. He also said that he would not like to \nfight the EXFOR brigade after they had a year to train with their new \nequipment.\n  There is an old saying that knowledge is power. The advanced \nwarfighting experiment at the National Training Center demonstrated \nthat knowledge is also military power--particularly the knowledge of \nthe battlefield that comes from the tremendous situational awareness \navailable through the digital technology of information warfare. No \namount of technology is going to change the basic requirement for Army \ncombat forces to be able to close with and destroy the enemy. But the \ninformation dominance that the Army is developing through the Force XXI \neffort can be a tremendous force multiplier.\n  Earlier this year General Shalikashvili told the Armed Services \nCommittee that the Defense Department will have to change the way it \ndoes business. ``Where possible,'' General Shalikashvili stated, ``we \nwill also have to trim personnel end strength especially where \ntechnological changes such as improved weapons systems afford us the \npossibility to consider fewer and smaller units.'' The technology of \ninformation warfare tested at the National Training Center last month \nis a good example of technology that may in fact allow a smaller force \nto have the same or even greater lethality and combat effectiveness as \nthe forces we have today.\n  Madam President, I want to congratulate General Reimer, the Army \nChief of Staff and his predecessor Gen. Gordon Sullivan; Gen. William \nHartzog, the commander of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command; and \nMaj. Gen. Paul Kern, the commander of the 4th Infantry Division for \ntheir vision and determination to make information technology a force \nmultiplier for the Army of the future. I also want to congratulate the \nthousands of soldiers, Department of the Army civilians, and civilian \ncontractors responsible for their contributions to this important \neffort.\n\n  The job, however, is not complete. There are a number of challenges \nthat must be addressed before the decision is made to expand this \ntechnology throughout the Army, including questions of cost; the \nintegration of new technology into existing systems; the impact of this \ntechnology on the Army's organizational structure and doctrine, and on \nthe tactics, techniques and procedures to execute this doctrine; the \nimpact on the training base; and the impact on personnel systems, \nincluding leader development.\n  Madam President, the Armed Services Committee will look closely at \nthe results and lessons learned from the advanced warfighting \nexperiment in the coming weeks and months. I look forward to working \nwith the Army and with my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee to \nbring the best of this experiment to the rest of the Army in a timely \nmanner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3114-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3116-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3116-S3117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC 1501.

A bill to limit the civil liability of business entities that \nprovide facility tours; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            LEGISLATION TO LIMIT CIVIL LIABILITY OF BUSINESS\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I introduce four related pieces \nof legislation all aimed at increasing donations of goods and services \nto charities. Collectively called the charity empowerment project, I \nurge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring these bills.\n  Over the past 30 years, courts have consistently expanded what \nconstitutes tortious conduct. Regrettably, fault is often not a factor \nwhen deciding who should compensate an individual for damages incurred. \nThis has had an impact on charitable giving. Today, individuals and \nbusinesses are wary of giving goods, services, and time to charities \nfor fear of frivolous lawsuits.\n  The charity empowerment project is designed to free up resources for \ncharities by providing legal protections for donors. Generally, these \nbills raise the tort liability standard for donors, whereby they are \nliable only in cases of gross negligence, hence eliminating strict \nliability and returning to a fault based legal standard. By allowing \nbusinesses to once again become good Samaritans, I look forward to \nseeing a massive increase in the donation of goods and services to \ncharities.\n  Specifically, I am introducing four bills each of which accomplishes \none of the following four objectives: First, to limit the civil \nliability of business entities that donate equipment to nonprofit \norganizations; second, to limit the civil liability of business \nentities that provide use of their facilities to nonprofit \norganizations; third, to limit the civil liability of business entities \nthat provide facility tours; and fourth, to limit the civil liability \nof business entities that make available to nonprofit organizations the \nuse of motor vehicles or aircraft.\n  Clearly, where an organization is grossly negligent when providing \ngoods or the use of its facilities to charity, that organization should \nbe fully liable for injuries caused. These bills merely require this to \nbe the standard in cases arising from certain donations to charities.\n  Last autumn, the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act was passed into \nlaw. This law now protects donors of foodstuffs to charities from \nliability except in cases where the donor was grossly negligent in \nmaking the donation. I was proud to join Senator Bond in his successful \nefforts to pass this act. The bills I introduce today draw from my \nsuccessful work with Senator Bond last year. Each of these bills is \nmodeled on the legal framework of the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act. \nI hope my distinguished colleagues who supported the Food Donation Act \nwill help further these efforts by supporting the charity empowerment \nproject.\n  Mr. President, I wish to note additional efforts by my colleagues to \nenhance charitable giving. Senator Coverdell and Senator Ashcroft have \nrecently introduced legislation which\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\nprotects volunteers from frivolous and damaging litigation. I am proud \nto be an original cosponsor of Senator Coverdell's Volunteer Protection \nAct of 1997, and I anticipate supporting Senator Ashcroft's bill with \nequal vigor. Collectively, I look forward to our legislation freeing up \nmassive resources for charities through increased volunteerism and \nincreased giving.\n  At the end of this month, the Summit for America's Future will \nassemble in Philadelphia. The Senate now has the opportunity to \nconsider the Santorum, Coverdell, and Ashcroft bills prior to the \nconvening of this century's greatest gathering on voluntarism.

A bill to permit revocation by members of the clergy of their \nexemption from Social Security coverage; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  social security coverage legislation\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nwhat I believe to be a very sensible piece of legislation which will \nallow a number of members of the clergy of all faiths to participate in \nthe Social Security Program. Before 1968 a minister was exempt from \nSocial Security coverage unless he or she chose to elect that coverage, \nand in 1968 ministers were covered by Social Security unless they filed \nan irrevocable exemption from the IRS on the grounds that they were \nopposed on basic religious principles to participate in any public \ninsurance program. So a member of the clergy who is eligible for this \nexemption is an ``individual who is duly ordained, commissioned, or \nlicensed member of a church, or a member of a religious order which has \nnot taken a vow of poverty.''\n  About 260,000 ministers are affected by this exclusion. This \nlegislation which I have offered would simply permit ministers and the \nfew members of religious orders who have not taken a vow of poverty to \nsecure that coverage. Modestly paid clergy would be among those most \nlikely to need Social Security benefits when they retire. But earlier \nin their careers many chose not to participate in the program. They had \ngood intentions. They were doing it on principle. But they didn't fully \nunderstand the ramifications of the exemption. Since 1968--once in 1977 \nand another time in 1986--ministers were given a temporary opportunity \nto revoke their exemption from Social Security; that is, they would \nhave the opportunity to have a window whereby they could come back \nunder the Social Security System.\n  This was brought to my attention by the distinguished bishop in \nManchester, NH, Reverend Bishop O'Neil.\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\n He brought this matter to my attention--that there are a number of \nhardships for individuals who may or may not have any retirement income \nas a result of this.\n  So this legislation simply provides another open season, a 2-year \nperiod whereby those who are clergy who may wish now to be under the \nSocial Security System may take advantage of this opportunity to revoke \ntheir exemption.\n  That is all the bill does, and I think it is fair in that again these \nare very principled members of the cloth who have decided now that they \nwould like to have the opportunity to get into the program.\n  So it is a 2-year open season during which the members of the clergy \ncould opt into the system. The application for benefits must be filed \nbefore the clergy member can become entitled to benefits, and those who \nchoose coverage would be subject to self-employment taxes. And their \nearnings would be credited for Social Security and for Medicare \npurposes. And, of course, no one who is at retirement age now would be \nallowed in. These would be people who are not yet at the retirement \nage.\n  Based on the experience in 1986 and the trends in the number of \nclergy since then, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that maybe \nas many as 1,500 to 1,600 members of the clergy would take advantage of \nthe open season and enroll in Social Security. That is based on past \nperformance. That is what happened in 1986. The bill was scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office. I have had it scored. It is a short-time \nrevenue raiser because people would be paying into the system but, of \ncourse, it is going to ultimately be like any other Social Security \nbeneficiary in the sense that we will be paying out more than comes in.\n  This legislation has the endorsement of the National Conference of \nCatholic Bishops. It is an issue of fairness. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in support of this legislation which I would like to see passed \nthis year so that we could begin the open season process so that \nmembers of the clergy could opt in now to the Social Security System. I \nhope that many of my colleagues will join me as quickly as possible in \ncosponsoring the legislation so that we can get it out of the Finance \nCommittee and here on the floor so that we can begin to correct this \ninadequacy, this unfairness where many members of the clergy are \naffected.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. \n        Dorgan):\n  S. 569. A bill to amend the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n            the indian child welfare act amendments of 1997\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to \namend the Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA] of 1978 to make the process \nthat applies to voluntary Indian child custody and adoption proceedings \nmore fair, consistent, and certain. The provisions of this legislation \nwould further advance the best interests of Indian children without \neroding tribal sovereignty and the fundamental principles of Federal-\nIndian law.\n  I want to thank my principal cosponsors, Senators Campbell, Domenici, \nand Dorgan, for their continued support of this much-needed \nlegislation. Let me point out also that this bill is identical to \nlegislation which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on September \n26, 1996. It is the result of nearly 2 years of discussions and debates \namong representatives of the adoption community, Indian tribal \ngovernments, and the Congress to address some of the problems with the \nimplementation of ICWA since its enactment in 1978.\n  Mr. President, ICWA was originally enacted to provide for procedural \nand substantive protection for Indian children and families and to \nrecognize and formalize a substantial role for Indian tribes in cases \ninvolving involuntary and voluntary child custody proceedings, whether \non or off the Indian reservation. Although implementation of ICWA has \nbeen less than perfect, in the vast majority of cases ICWA has \neffectively provided such protection. It has compelled greater efforts \nand more painstaking analysis by State and private adoption agencies \nand State courts before removing Indian children from their homes and \ncommunities. It has required recognition by all parties that an Indian \nchild has a vital interest in retaining a connection with his or her \nIndian tribe.\n  Nonetheless, particularly in the voluntary adoption context, there \nhave been occasional, high-profile cases which have resulted in \nlengthy, protracted litigation causing great anguish for the children, \ntheir adoptive families, their birth families, and their Indian tribes. \nThis bill takes a measured and limited approach, crafted by \nrepresentatives of tribal governments and the adoption community, to \naddress the problems of implementing ICWA in voluntary adoption \nproceedings.\n  This legislation would achieve greater certainty and speed in the \nadoption process for Indian children by providing new guarantees of \nearly and effective notice in all cases involving Indian children. The \nbill also establishes new, strict time restrictions on both the right \nof Indian tribes and families to intervene and the right of Indian \nbirth parents to revoke their consent to an adoptive placement. \nFinally, the bill includes a provision which would encourage early \nidentification of the relatively few cases involving controversy and \npromote the settlement of cases by making visitation agreements \nenforceable.\n  For a full analysis of the provisions of the bill, I respectfully \nrefer my colleagues to the report accompanying the legislation as it \nwas reported to the Senate on July 26, 1996, which is Senate Report No. \n104-335.\n  Mr. President, nothing is more sacred and more important to our \nfuture than our children. The issues surrounding Indian child welfare \nstir deep emotions. I am thankful that, in formulating the compromise \nthat led to the introduction of this bill in the last Congress, the \nrepresentatives of both the adoption community and tribal governments \nwere able to put aside their individual desires and focus on the best \ninterests of Indian children.\n  Mr. President, last year, proposals were put forth in the House which \nwould have gone too far in restricting the application of ICWA. Those \nproposals, which were considered by the Senate as title III of H.R. \n3286, the Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996, were deleted by \nthe Indian Affairs Committee because of our concern about the breadth \nof the language and the fundamental changes the provisions would have \nmade to the government-to-government relationship between the United \nStates and Indian tribes.\n  I believe this bill represents an appropriate and fair-minded \ncompromise proposal which would enhance the best interests of Indian \nchildren by guaranteeing speed, certainty, and stability in the \nadoption process. At the same time, the provisions of this bill \npreserve fundamental principles of tribal government by recognizing the \nappropriate role of tribal governments in the lives of Indian children.\n  Mr. President, this bill has been thoroughly analyzed and debated in \nthe Senate, as well as in the adoption community and Indian tribal \ngovernments. I believe it is time for the Congress to act in the best \ninterests of Indian children by approving these amendments to the \nvoluntary adoption procedures in the 1978 ICWA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nlegislation I am introducing today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, today I join Senator McCain in introducing the Indian Child \nWelfare Act Amendments of 1997. This legislation will amend the 1978 \nIndian Child Welfare Act [ICWA] and will serve the best interests of \nIndian children across the United States in the process. The ICWA is a \nprocedural statute and this legislation clarifies and strengthens the \nprocedures contained in it. The bill strengthens the statute by \nproviding certainty, stability, and finality to adoptions and other \nplacements involving Indian children.\n  In the 104th Congress, this legislation received the support of \nparties affected by and knowledgeable of ICWA-related adoptions: tribal \norganizations, and non-Indian adoption attorneys. The bill I am \ncosponsoring today addresses the major concerns of these parties in a \nway that strengthens the existing ICWA, and provides certainty and \nfinality to non-Indian adoptive families. Most important, this bill \nserves the best interests of Indian children and enhances the integrity \nof Indian families.\n  Adoption and child custody proceedings are delicate and emotional \nmatters for all involved: for the Indian child; for the birth parents; \nfor the Indian tribe; and for the adoptive parents. My own experience \nas a youth is helpful in providing a context for ICWA and why it was \nenacted. I grew up in California, many miles from the Northern Cheyenne \nReservation in Montana where my tribe and relatives lived. I am lucky \nin that even though I was not raised on the reservation, I still cling \nto my tribal identity, my culture, and the spiritual traditions that \nmake me a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. Many Indian youth are \nnot so lucky, and once removed from their Indian families, tribes and \ncultures, never regain what they have lost.\n  The 1978 statute has worked well since its inception, and the reasons \nit was introduced are crucial to understanding the act and the \nlegislation we introduce today. After exhaustive congressional \ntestimony and many years of hard work the Indian Child Welfare Act was \nenacted in 1978. Prior to 1978 there were no available protections for \nIndian children, families, or tribes in situations involving the \nunwarranted and forced removal of Indian children from their families, \ntribes, and rich cultures. The cold fact is that prior to ICWA between \n25 percent and 35 percent of all Indian children were separated from \ntheir families and given to adoptive families or placed in foster care \nor in institutions.\n  Through exhaustive hearings prior to enactment of the 1978 act, the \nCongress realized that at the staggering rate of Indian child removal, \nit would have been simply a matter of time before Indian families and \ntribes would literally be sapped of their futures--their precious \nchildren.\n  The ICWA is procedural in nature and is designed to protect the best \ninterests of Indian children by reinforcing the strong interests Indian \nfamilies and tribes have in maintaining their relationships with their \nchildren. The act also recognizes that tribal authorities and tribal \ncourts are the appropriate authorities over Indian adoptions and \nplacements. Just as we in the majority often speak of maintaining \nfamilies and traditions and of respecting the rights of local \ngovernments, this act is one of the few Indian statutes that actually \ndoes both.\n\n  Non-Indian institutions, including State courts, do not and cannot \ncompletely understand the unique culture and relationships that make up \ntribal life. Because they cannot know these facts and these \nrelationships, they should not be given authority to make child custody \ndecisions involving Indian children. Practically, State authorities are \nnot in a position to make these decisions. Legally, they should not be \nallowed to make these decisions. The right of any sovereign nation, \nincluding Indian nations, includes the right to determine who is and \nwho is not a member or citizen. The legislation we introduce today \npreserves those most basic rights of Indian tribes: tribal self-\npreservation and self-determination.\n  Mr. President, I want to say a word about adoptive parents and \nfamilies. The decision to adopt a child or children is one that is done \nout of the noblest motives, and with much love and affection. It is \noften a process fraught with many obstacles, both emotional and \nfinancial. I have nothing but the greatest respect and admiration for \nadoptive parents. This legislation will provide adoptive parents with \nthe security they sometimes lack under current law. The bill will \nprovide what many have complained of: finality and security in cases \ninvolving Indian children. For the past several years, there have been \nhighly publicized cases involving Indian children and what some felt \nwere late interventions by tribes in these proceedings.\n  By strengthening the procedures of ICWA this bill will make cases \nlike the ones we saw last year a thing of the past. Parties seeking \nplacement of Indian children would be required to file detailed notices \nwith the tribe that includes biographical information on the child, as \nwell as information regarding the rights of the tribe in responding to \nthe notice. With the notice in hand, the\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\ntribe must decide if it wants to intervene or not, and to inform the \nparty seeking placement of its intentions.\n  By requiring tribes to file written notice of intervention and \nproviding time limits within which tribes can intervene in proceedings, \nadoptive parents can be assured that they will not face the prospect of \nhaving final or near final. These procedural demands are not unduly \nburdensome and fall equally on both the parties seeking placement and \ntribal governments.\n  The truth is that many of these inflammatory and well-publicized \ncases involved unethical attorneys and other adoption professionals who \nadvised their Indian clients to conceal or not reveal their Indian \nheritage in an effort to expedite the adoption. Because ICWA-related \nadoptions and proceedings involve procedural requirements, some \nattorneys and professionals seek to cut corners and save time and \nmoney. Not only is this shortsighted, but is damaging to all parties \ninvolved in an adoption or custody proceeding.\n\n  By expediting these adoptions, the attorneys interests were served. \nBut what about the Indian children, Indian families, Indian tribes, and \nnon-Indian adoptive families?\n  As we have seen, these people have had to endure long, bitter, and \ncostly court battles some of which continue to this day. The \nlegislation we introduce today will provide tough civil and criminal \npenalties to any person that willfully falsifies facts regarding \nwhether a child is Indian or whether a parent is Indian; makes false or \nfraudulent statements; or falsifies documents containing facts related \nto the proceeding.\n  These provisions are not radical notions. They simply provide that if \nyou are involved in an ICWA-related proceeding, and if you do not want \nto lose your money and your freedom, follow the law. No good adoption \nattorney worth his salt will fear these penalties if he or she follows \nthe law and is forthright with the facts.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in enacting this crucial legislation to \nbring stability and certainty to adoptions and other proceedings \ninvolving Indian children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Mack, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Bond, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Hagel, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 570. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \ncertain small businesses from the mandatory electronic fund transfer \nsystem; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         MANDATORY ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER SYSTEM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation with \nmy colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, to address the ever-\nrecurring problem of Federal mandates on small business. Our bill will \nprohibit the Internal Revenue Service from forcing thousands of small \nbusinesses to deposit payroll taxes by electronic funds transfer under \nthreat of penalty. In addition to Senator Breaux, I would like to thank \nseveral other Senators who have agreed to cosponsor this legislation, \nincluding Senator Mack, Senator Baucus, Senator D'Amato, Senator Bond, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Cochran, and Senator Enzi.\n  Legislation enacted in 1993 to implement the North American Free-\nTrade Agreement directed the IRS to begin collecting a progressively \nlarger percentage of payroll tax deposits from employers by electronic \nfunds transfer, in lieu of the Federal tax deposit coupon system. \nCongress' intent was to simplify the tax deposit system and reduce \npaperwork for taxpayers, financial institutions, and the IRS. The \nSenate report accompanying this bill recommended that the \nimplementation of this mandate not create hardships for small \nbusinesses, and that no small business should be required to purchase \ncomputers or gain access to any electronic equipment other than a \ntouch-tone telephone. Further, the report urged Treasury to take into \naccount the specific needs of small employers, including possible \nexemption for the very smallest businesses from the electronic deposit \nsystem.\n  Unfortunately, the IRS has done little to mitigate the impact on \nsmall business. Instead, they sent notices to 1.2 million small \nbusinesses last summer stating that they must begin using the new \nelectronic Federal tax payment System, or EFTPS, to make payroll tax \ndeposits on January 1, 1997. Further, the IRS told these taxpayers that \ncontinued use of the Federal tax deposit coupon system would result in \npenalties equal to 10 percent of each deposit. The IRS targeted this \nmandate on any business which deposited more than $50,000 in payroll \ntaxes in 1995. Prior to this time, the threshold for mandatory \nelectronic deposits was $47 million. If the IRS is not stopped, Mr. \nPresident, the threshold will drop to $20,000 next year.\n  The reaction from the small business community to this mandate last \nyear was adverse and vocal, Mr. President. Fortunately, Congress acted \nto delay the EFTPS mandate until July 1, 1997. However, that date is \nquickly approaching, and thousands of small business owners are no more \ncomfortable with the mandate now than they were last year. Business \nowners who have used the coupon system for years to diligently pay \ntheir taxes on time are incensed to learn that they can be forced from \nthat system against their will. Some fear IRS access to their bank \naccounts, and others fear the additional costs which may arise if their \nbank begins charging fees for these transactions. Finally, many small \nbusinesses are discovering that their current bank does not participate \nfully in the electronic transaction system.\n  Mr. President, small business owners should not have a new tax \ndeposit system forced down their throats without alternatives and \nwithout enough time or information to make an orderly transition to the \nnew system. Further, they should not be forced to incur fees or other \nadditional costs in order to pay their taxes. While I agree that many \ntaxpayers will come to prefer an electronic deposit system, I do not \nbelieve such a change should be mandated under threat of penalty. If a \nsmall business prefers to use the coupon system and continues to pay \ntheir taxes on time, they should not be penalized for doing so.\n  Mr. President, the legislation Senator Breaux and I are introducing \ntoday will phase in the requirement to pay depository taxes \nelectronically in manageable increments and exempt most small \nbusinesses permanently. Under our bill, only businesses who annually \ndeposit over $5 million in payroll taxes will ever be mandated to use \nthe electronic deposit system. Further, the bill directs the Secretary \nof the Treasury to establish a program to encourage all business \ntaxpayers to voluntarily participate in the electronic deposit system.\n  Enactment of this legislation will free small business owners from \nyet another heavyhanded Federal mandate and preserve their right to pay \ntheir taxes in a manner which best suits their business needs. I \nencourage all Senators to join in this effort.\n  Mr. President, again I wish to thank the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate at this time, the Senator from Wyoming, for cosponsoring this \nlegislation. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel be added \nas an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to summarize again for the benefit of my \ncolleagues, effective July 1, if we do not change this current--I \nstarted to say ``law,'' but this is not a law. The IRS came up with a \nregulation. We passed a law. Congress passed a law that says we want to \nencourage electronic fund transfers of payroll taxes. A good idea. It \nmakes sense. It will work for a lot of people.\n  IRS, to implement this, and maybe with some direction of Congress--\nCongress said put most of the taxpayers in. The IRS did so, and then \nthey came up with a 10-percent penalty. That is a big inducement, \nencouragement. Congress did not put on the 10-percent penalty; the IRS \ndid--it puts a gun to the taxpayer's head--and then said, ``You have to \ndo this.'' Then they said, ``This is not too much of a challenge for \nbigger employers.'' As a matter of fact, the current requirement, the \nthreshold is $47 million of payroll taxes. If you have payroll taxes of \n$47 million, that is a big operation. And they are doing that now. That \nactually applies to 1,500 taxpayers in the country today.\n  The next threshold level drops from $47 million to $50,000. Now you \nare talking about a lot of companies. You\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\nare talking about a lot of businesses. You do not have to be very big \nto have payroll taxes of $50,000. You might have total payroll of a \nquarter of a million or $300,000. That deadline is July 1. It was to be \nJanuary 1. We postponed it for 6 months.\n  The legislation we have introduced today, it phases down the $47 \nmillion threshold to $30 million, to $10 million, to $5 million, and \nsays, ``If you have payroll taxes of less than $5 million, you do not \nhave to do this. You can still do it, you still have the option to do \nit.''\n  I met with some representatives from the IRS. They said, ``We are \nconcerned, if we pass this legislation, a lot of people might not get \ninto the system. Maybe that would not be fair for the people already in \nthe system.''\n  I said I want them to have the option. In our legislation, we want to \nencourage people to move into the electronic fund transfer. We think \nthat would be good. A lot of people pay their home notes--I do that. \nWhen I pay my home mortgage, I do it by electronic fund transfer where \nyou used to have the coupon system. I am happy with that. I think a lot \nof taxpayers will be happy paying payroll taxes this way, and we want \nthis to be an option.\n  We want to eliminate the 10-percent penalty for noncompliance, \nespecially for small business.\n  So that is what we have done. I ask unanimous consent Senator Thomas \nalso be included as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record immediately following my statement a copy of this \nlegislation and, in addition to the legislation, a letter from the \nSmall Business Legislative Council and a letter from the National \nRestaurant Association endorsing the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 570\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       (a) In General.--Section 6302(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to use of electronic fund transfer \n     system for collection of certain taxes) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(2) Taxpayers subject to system.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The regulations referred to in paragraph \n     (1) shall only require taxpayers to use the electronic funds \n     transfer system for a calendar year if the aggregate amount \n     of depository taxes of such taxpayer for the second preceding \n     calendar year exceeded the applicable dollar amount.\n       ``(B) Applicable dollar amount.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (A)--\n\n``If the 2d preceding calendar year is:The applicable dollar amount is:\n    1995....................................................$47,000,000\n    1996.....................................................30,000,000\n    1997.....................................................20,000,000\n    1998.....................................................10,000,000\n    1999 or later............................................5,000,000.\n\n       ``(C) Aggregation rule.--All persons treated as a single \n     employer under subsections (a) and (b) of section 52 shall be \n     treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of subparagraph \n     (A).\n       ``(D) Voluntary compliance.--The Secretary shall encourage \n     taxpayers not described in subparagraph (A) to participate in \n     the electronic funds transfer system.

Starting \n     July 1, all businesses that deposit over $50,000 in federal \n     payroll taxes will have to start wiring their tax deposits to \n     the Internal Revenue Service. This is the first phase-in that \n     will truly affect the small businesses, including thousands \n     of restaurant owners. For months, the National Restaurant \n     Association and other employer groups have been warning the \n     government that many businesses don't know about the mandate \n     and could face penalties beginning in July for not complying.\n       We strongly support this bipartisan legislation which will \n     allow small businesses the option of filing electronically, \n     and will provide a reasonable phase-in of the mandate for \n     larger businesses. Thank you for your leadership on this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Elaine Z. Graham,\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                Government Affairs and Membership.\n     Kathleen O'Leary,\n     Legislative Representative.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                          Legislative Council,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: On behalf of the members of the Small \n     Business Legislative Council (SBLC), I wish to commend your \n     efforts to address the concerns of the small business \n     community with respect to the Electronic Federal Tax Payment \n     System (EFTPS).\n       The EFTPS has proven to be a source of great frustration \n     for us. On one hand, we applaud the movement towards an \n     electronic funds transfer system. Any small business owner \n     can vouch for the inherent flaws in the current paper coupon-\n     based deposit system. Errors and inadvertent late payments \n     are still all too frequent. And, while the IRS has become \n     more reasonable in ultimately absolving small businesses of \n     blame, it is difficult to turn off the IRS paper spigot. It \n     can take several unnecessary exchanges to resolve the \n     problem.\n       The electronic age is upon us and, ultimately, most small \n     businesses will embrace it fully. But the small business \n     community is not ready yet and, more importantly, neither is \n     the technology and structure to implement this concept. As \n     you know, we secured one delay in implementation in the hopes \n     everything would work out.\n       It appears we still have a long way to go, and until such \n     time as the small business community's confidence is secured, \n     it appears a voluntary approach is in everyone's best \n     interest. If the technology does work, it would seem foolish \n     for small business' owners not to embrace it. But, rather \n     than work everyone up into a ``tizzy'' as each new deadline \n     approaches, it may be better to take the longer view, and \n     make sure everyone comes on-board at their own pace and \n     comfort level. We'd rather see the program make it on its own \n     merits. And it does have merit, if done properly.\n       Therefore, we support your effort. Once again, you have \n     demonstrated your strong commitment to small business.\n       As you know, The Small Business Legislative Council (SBLC) \n     is a permanent, independent coalition of nearly one hundred \n     trade and professional associations that share a common \n     commitment to the future of small business. Our members \n     represent the interests of small businesses in such diverse \n     economic sectors as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, \n     professional, and technical services, construction, \n     transportation, tourism, and agriculture. For your \n     information, a list of our members is enclosed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Benhamin Y. Cooper,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my \ncolleagues Senator Nickles and Senator Breaux in introducing \nlegislation to help support America's small businesses. This bill will \naddress the problem created for the small business community by the \nInternal Revenue Services' requirement that they convert to a system of \ndepositing payroll taxes by electronic funds transfer.\n  IRS has been implementing legislation directing the agency to begin \ncollecting a progressively larger percentage of Federal tax deposits \nfrom employers by electronic funds transfer, rather than the current \nFederal tax deposit coupon system. The intent behind the legislation \nwas to simplify the tax\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\ndeposit system and reduce paperwork for taxpayers, financial \ninstitutions, and the Internal Revenue Service itself. The Senate \nreport accompanying the bill recommended that the implementation of \nthis mandate not create hardships for small businesses, and that no \nsmall business should be required to purchase computers or gain access \nto any electronic equipment other than a touch-tone telephone. The \nreport also urged Treasury to take into account the specific needs of \nsmall employers, including possible exemption for the very smallest \nbusinesses from the electronic deposit system.\n  We do not believe the Treasury Department has accomplished this goal. \nWhile a timetable for compliance has been established, there is little \nevidence that the concerns of the small business community have been \nalleviated as July 1, 1997, the deadline for implementation, draws \nnear. Business owners who have used the coupon system for years to \ndiligently pay their taxes on time do not understand why they are being \nrequired to convert to an electronic funds transfer system. Many small \nbusiness owners I have spoken with in Montana fear IRS access to their \nbank accounts, particularly in light of recent reported incidences of \nIRS employee browsing through taxpayer records without a valid reason. \nOther small business owners are concerned, and not unreasonably, that \nbanks may begin charging fees for these transactions, adding to their \ncosts of doing business. Finally, many small businesses are discovering \nthat their current banks do not even participate fully in the \nelectronic transfer system, forcing them to find a new bank through \nwhich to send in their deposit payments.\n  Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues that small businesses have \nnot been given enough time or information to make an orderly transition \nto the new electronic funds transfer system. I also agree that they \nshould not be required to pay a fee in order to pay their taxes. The \nbill we are introducing today will exempt businesses who annually \ndeposit under $5 million in payroll taxes from the electronic payment \nrequirement permanently, and phase it in for the rest at a much more \nmanageable rate.\n  I believe this bill will preserve the right of small business owners \nto pay their taxes in a manner which best suites their business needs. \nI commend Senators Nickels and Breaux for the work they have done on \nthis bill, and encourage our other colleagues to join in our effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 571. A bill to establish a uniform poll closing time throughout \nthe continental United States for Presidential general elections; to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                  the uniform poll closing act of 1997\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwill set a uniform poll closing time for the continental United States. \nElection officials and political scientists for years have believed \nthat early announcements, based on exit polls, discourage thousands of \npeople from voting and affect the outcome of close races for other \nFederal, State and local offices. Less than 50 percent of eligible \nvoters actually voted last year. As public officials, we have a \nresponsibility to do everything we can to encourage voting, not \ndissuade it. Uniform poll closing times is a step in this direction.\n  We are all aware that the controversy over early network projections \nis not a new one. Senator Barry Goldwater introduced a bill after the \n1960 election prohibiting radio broadcast of any Presidential election \nreturns until after midnight on election day. Network predictions 4 \nyears later of Goldwater's landslide loss, and of Richard Nixon's \nlandslide victory in 1972, spawned several Senate bills to muzzle radio \nand television. But none were enacted.\n  In 1980, when new technology made it unnecessary for networks to wait \nfor actual returns, the furor over early projections was brought to its \nhighest pitch. In that year, voters in the West were told at 5 p.m., \nhours before their polls closed, who the next President of the United \nStates would be. The three major networks trumpeted Ronald Reagan's \nvictory long before the polls had closed in their States. After the \nelection, our colleagues, Representatives Tim Wirth and Al Swift began \na congressional search for a way to prevent early calls of elections. \nNumerous ideas were discussed as solutions to the problem of early \nprojections based on exit polls, but there was no consensus. In \naddition to uniform poll closing times, shifting election day to \nSunday, spreading voting over 2 days, making election day a national \nholiday and forbidding the networks from issuing predictions were \nproposed. Of course the best solution would be voluntary restraint on \nthe part of the networks, but that has proven to be a failure.\n  My legislation simply states that each polling place in the \ncontinental United States must close, with respect to a Presidential \ngeneral election, at 10 p.m. eastern standard time. This means the \npolls with close at 7 p.m. Pacific time, 8 p.m. mountain time and 9 \np.m. central time. I do not believe these times are unreasonable. It is \nmy hope that this legislation will revive the debate over the use of \nexit polls. I welcome my colleagues to work with me for a solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

71--RELATIVE TO THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Murkowski, and \nMr. Bryan) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                               S. Res. 71\n\n       Resolved, That (a) an individual with a disability (as \n     defined in section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102)) who has or is granted the \n     privilege of the Senate floor may bring those supporting \n     services (including service dogs, wheelchairs, and \n     interpreters) on the Senate floor the employing or \n     supervising office determines are necessary to assist the \n     disabled individual in discharging the official duties of his \n     or her position.\n       (b) The employing or supervising office of a disabled \n     individual shall administer the provisions of this \n     resolution.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the resolution that I submit today would \nchange the Senate rules that deny floor access to those individuals who \nare visually impaired and need to use guide dogs to carry out their \nofficial duties.\n  By denying floor access to Ms. Shea and her guide dog, the Senate, in \nmy view, is violating the Congressional Accountability Act, which \nrequires that Congress abide by the requirements and intent of the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act. A guide dog is a person's vision. A \nguide dog is a working dog, not a pet. This guide dog is with Ms. Shea \nall the time. He is with her in meetings in my office. He goes with her \nto energy committee hearings and has even gone with her to nuclear \nweapons facilities.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I had hoped that there would be no need \nto\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\noffer this resolution, but I am forced to because discrimination still \npersists here. Ms. Shea is being treated differently simply because she \nis visually impaired and needs to use a guide dog.\n  Now, some may believe that the Senate fulfills its obligations under \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act--\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor of \nthe Senator's resolution.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \nmade a cosponsor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that I also be added as a \ncosponsor to the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senators will be added \nas cosponsors.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, some believe that the Senate is fulfilling its \nobligations under the Americans With Disabilities Act if they provide \nsomeone to accompany Ms. Shea to the Senate floor. But let me say that \nan unknown staff person is no substitute for a working guide dog.\n  The relevant language from the Americans With Disabilities Act says \nthat an employer must provide reasonable accommodation for an \nindividual with a disability. The Equal Employment Opportunity Office \nhas said, ``reasonable accommodation [is] when an employer permits a \nperson who is blind to use a guide dog at work.''\n  Let us put ourselves in Ms. Shea's situation. Imagine that you need \nto go on the Senate floor to carry out your official duties, but, wait, \nyou must first check your ability to see with the doorkeeper, or go to \nthe Rules Committee to get a resolution. I fail to see the logic of \nthis, and I fail to see the justice behind it. Miss Shea's situation \ndoesn't require extra financial resources nor special treatment. She \njust wants to do her job as a professional.\n  A large part of the problem seems to be a lack of understanding. So \nlet me tell the Senate a little bit about what guide dogs do. They are \nworking dogs, not pets. A guide dog is that person's vision, an \nintegral part of that person's essential activities and professional \nresponsibilities. A blind person or a visually impaired person, such as \nMs. Shea, has learned to turn over her diminishing sight to her dog and \ntrusts that dog with her safety. This guide dog has blocked Ms. Shea \nfrom oncoming traffic. He knows his left from his right. He is a marker \nto others that Ms. Shea is visually impaired. She has gone to the \nSenate Energy Committee hearings and nuclear weapons facilities. This \ndog has even met more just access with respect to the Soviet Union.\n  Yet, here in the United States, on the Senate floor, where we passed \nthe ADA and the Congressional Accountability Act, we are refusing \naccess to someone who needs to use a guide dog. This guide dog has a \nserious job, and, I might add, the dog performs it very well. This is \nthe tool that Ms. Shea uses to be a productive member of the work \nforce, and today we are denying her the ability to do her job to the \nbest of her ability. Ms. Shea is part of a growing work force of \npersons who want to be independent, who want to be productive, and who \nhave been raised with a can-do attitude.\n  Let me conclude by describing how the guide dog would work on the \nfloor. Ms. Shea would most likely tell him to ``follow me,'' and as \nthey walked down the aisle, the dog would alert Ms. Shea to each step \nby stopping. Then Ms. Shea would say to him ``find the chair,'' and \nthen Ms. Shea would sit down and the dog would lay right beside her. We \nwould all forget that the dog was even here. In leaving, Ms. Shea would \ntell the dog to ``find the door'' once again, and the dog would alert \nher to where all the steps are and take her right to the door.\n  Mr. President, that is all there is to it. It seems to me that the \nSenate should change its rules to ensure that there is justice for \npeople like Ms. Shea. To tell someone like Ms. Shea that she cannot \ncome to the Senate floor with either a white cane or a guide dog and \nonly with an escort is demeaning. You take away her right to decide \nwhat is the best method for her to carry out her job as a professional. \nYou take away her sense of independence. You take away her dignity. You \nmake her dependent on others. That is not what the Americans With \nDisabilities Act is all about.\n  Ms. Shea has Usher's Syndrome. That is the leading cause of deaf-\nblindness in the United States. She has struggled and worked hard to \nget where she is today as a professional. She is independent and self-\nsufficient, and she told me that she can cope with losing her eyesight, \nbut she should not be forced to face blatant discrimination.\n  It is time for the Senate to change its rules. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the Rules Committee to do this. It is \ntime to ensure that the visually impaired in our country have justice, \nand have justice in the way that Congress envisioned with the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act and the Congress Accountability Act. I thank my \nfriends from Minnesota, Nevada, and Alaska for joining me as cosponsors \nthis morning on this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3126-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 44\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI (for Mr. Lott, for himself and Mr. Wellstone) proposed \nan amendment to amendment No. 30 proposed by Mr. Wellstone to the bill \n(S. 104) to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982; as follows:\n\n       In the pending amendment, strike all after ``Sec.   .'' and \n     insert the following:\n\n     ``SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ASSISTANCE FOR ELDERLY AND \n                   DISABLED LEGAL IMMIGRANTS.\n\n       ``It is the sense of the Senate that elderly and disabled \n     legal immigrants who are unable to work should receive \n     assistance essential to their well-being, and that the \n     President, Congress, and States, and faith-based and other \n     organizations should continue to work together toward that \n     end.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3127-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      subcommittee on immigration\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, today I want to address a very \nserious issue, which is at the heart of the defense of our Nation's \ninterests. I want to address the need to acquire a meaningful long-\nrange-strike weapons system. I want to address the procurement of nine \nmore B-2 bombers, which are needed to complete a three-squadron fleet \nthat will have the means to deter, the capabilities to defend against, \nand the power to defeat threats to our national interest.\n  I speak today in support of America's most capable long-range-strike \naircraft, the B-2 bomber. The B-2 is not just a bomber. When most \npeople think of bombers, they think of World War II airpower films, \nwith scores of bombers flying in tight formation, dropping strings of \niron bombs on rail lines and oil refineries. The B-2 is more than a \nbomber. It is a long-range-strike aircraft, capable of reaching \nanywhere in the world and releasing highly sophisticated, explosive \nweapons with uncommon precision on specific targets. Unlike the bombers \nof old, which often missed their targets by miles, the B-2 strike \naircraft can hit as many as 16 separate aim points, with deadly \naccuracy, in a single pass.\n  Mr. President, it defies convention to think of the B-2, with its \nhigh sticker cost, as a cost-effective weapon. Only when we stop \nthinking of the B-2 as a bomber, and instead think of it as a long-\nrange-strike weapons system, do we realize that it is, indeed, the most \ncost-effective weapons system in our Nation's arsenal which can \nrealistically be used to protect our citizens, our interests, and our \nallies around the world. It is the only weapons system that combines \nlong-range, large payload, modern precision weapons, and stealth--a \nrevolutionary and powerful combination.\n  Since the end of the cold war, we have come to recognize that we no \nlonger live in a bipolar world. Threats to our national security have \ntaken on both familiar and unfamiliar forms: renewed territorial \naggression, simmering regional and ethnic conflicts, state-sponsored \nterrorism, and now, for the first time since the Middle Ages, stateless \nterrorism. We send our forces abroad to protect air bases and oil \nfields and our sons and daughters are attacked by religious zealots. We \nall vividly recall the loss of life at our military barracks in \nDhahran, Saudi Arabia. It was attacked, not by the Iraqi forces we seek \nto deter, but by nameless terrorists from Iran, or from Lebanon, or \nfrom internal Saudi opposition groups, or from God knows where. With \nthe B-2, the forward air bases would not be needed; the oil fields \ncould be protected from afar.\n  What happened when Saddam Hussein attacked the U.N.-protected Kurdish \nsafe zone in northern Iraq? We attacked Baghdad and southern Iraq. \nBecause the leadership in Jordan, in Saudi Arabia, in Turkey, and in \nother countries, where we have shorter range aircraft, was concerned \nwith stirring up public opinion, United States forces were denied the \nfreedom to launch counter strikes from air bases on their territory. \nWith the B-2, we could have struck Saddam Hussein's forces in the \nNorth, from bases in the United States.\n  The Secretary of Defense stated in his annual report for fiscal year \n1996: ``Because potential regional adversaries may be able to mount \nmilitary threats against their neighbors with little or no warning, \nAmerican forces must be postured to project power rapidly to support \nUnited States interests and allies.'' Clearly, the most appropriate \nweapon in our arsenal for rapid power projection is the B-2 long-range-\nstrike aircraft. Yet, because of legislation--which has now been \nrepealed--we currently have only two squadrons of B-2's. In order to \nmeet effectively our basic strategic objectives, just nine more B-2's, \nbringing the total to three squadrons, are essential. Mr. President, we \nmust restart this program; we must provide funding for the B-2 this \nyear.\n  The B-2--a long-range, precision-strike aircraft--is the best, and \nperhaps only, option available to us to counter emerging threats in our \nsecurity environment. We are not able to spend as much for defense as \nwe have in the past, causing us to decrease our presence abroad and \nbase more of our forces here at home. This, in turn, limits our forward \npresence and ability to rapidly respond to a crisis elsewhere in the \nworld. In addition, access to foreign bases, closer to theaters of \nconflict, has become more and more uncertain. And above all, weapons of \nmass destruction and accurate delivery systems are becoming more \nprolific, possibly held by rogue states and organized terrorists alike. \nThese chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons could be used with \ndevastation to attack American ground, naval, and air forces based \nwithin a theater of conflict.\n\n  How does the B-2 respond to these challenges? The B-2 uses stealth \ntechnology, technology more effective than that employed on F-117 \nfighter bombers in the gulf war. As you recall, these planes were the \nkey to securing the advantage immediately in the air war and remained \nimpossible for the Iraqis to stop. However, the B-2 is a more powerful \nand flexible weapon, and offers several advantages over the F-117.\n  First, it is a long-range system. The B-2 can fly anywhere in the \nworld, from bases in the United States, with only one refueling. These \nfactors also make the B-2 an important tool for deterrence, allowing \nthe President the ability to strike anywhere in the world immediately. \nThus, a counterstrike can be launched from the United States, as soon \nas the threat is apparent, without reliance on foreign bases, or troop \nbuildup.\n  Second, the B-2 carries a bigger, more accurate payload than the F-\n117. The precision bombs carried by the B-2 use GPS-aided targeting \nsystems, and GPS-aided munitions [GATS/GAM], which enables up to 16 \nindependent points to be targeted with extreme accuracy, in 1 pass. \nThis precision is an important counter to the mobile and relocatable \nnature of many of our new potential enemies, such as scud missiles or \nterrorist encampments. The local release of a strike allows last minute \nadjustments to account for local conditions, or target movement. This \nis not possible with cruise missiles. In addition, delivering a strike \nvia bomber also allows difficult targets, like the dark side of a \nmountain, or underground bunkers, to be attacked and destroyed.\n  One of the most important points to make about the B-2 is that it \nwill reduce the number of American soldiers put in harm's way, and \nultimately reduce casualties. Because the President can choose to \nrespond immediately, or preemptively, engagement in a conflict or its \nescalation, may be avoided. Because the aircraft is launched from \noutside the theater, all support personnel and equipment are also \noutside the theater of conflict. Because the B-2 utilizes stealth, the \nneed for escort aircraft, which are also theater-based, is eliminated. \nI have read several estimates about the value of stealth and precision \nweapons, and one that sticks in my mind is that one B-2 bomber has the \ncombat power of 75 non-Stealth aircraft.\n  This last statistic illustrates another important factor in our \nconsideration to build nine additional B-2's: the program will provide \ncost savings in the long run. This may be hard to believe, when we are \ntalking about aircraft that cost $850 million each to build, but as I \nhave explained--the B-2 requires less support; is more precise, \nrequiring fewer sorties to accomplish the task; and, may reduce the \nneed for further massive troop and aircraft involvement. Air Force \nanalysis shows that, operating independently, free of the requirement \nfor fighter escorts, electronic jamming aircraft, and tankers, a single \nB-2 with two crew members can accomplish missions currently requiring \n75 tactical aircraft and 147 crew members. The B-2's ability to \npenetrate air defenses, without the usual armada of support aircraft, \nmeans that we can, in some mission areas, replace dozens of aircraft \nwith one bomber, potentially saving billions of dollars over the long \nrun.\n  Mr. President, the American bomber force currently relies most \nheavily on two aging conventional bomber aircraft--the B-52 and the B-\n1. In order to maintain mission safety while attacking specific, above \nground targets,\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\nthese bombers must use cruise missiles. These missiles are more \nexpensive--the 44 cruise missiles fired against Iraq during the gulf \nwar cost more than $100 million--over 100 times more expensive than \nwhat an equivalent number of precision, direct-attack weapons, \ndelivered by the B-2, would cost. Moreover, these missiles are less \neffective--current-generation cruise missiles cannot be used against \nmobile or heavily hardened targets. The B-2 long-range-strike aircraft \nis cost effective.\n\n  Mr. President, the last B-52 was built 35 years ago. It has been a \nvery successful aircraft, but it will not last forever. As we look to \nthe future, with the retirement of B-52's and the withdrawal of the B-1 \nfrom active service, the B-2 will be the only long-range aircraft in \nthe Air Force inventory. That is why the B-2 program also represents an \nimportant opportunity for the United States to maintain superiority in \na critical field of production. This program is the only remaining \ncomponent of the combat aircraft manufacturing industry in California. \nBy building the remainder of the third squadron, the production lines \nwould stay open another 10 years. Not only would this sustain American \nknow-how in this important industry, but would also save tens of \nthousands of jobs within aerospace and related industries. When we buy \nthe B-2 we are not only buying the best long-range-strike aircraft in \nthe world, we are also investing in the industrial capacity to produce \nthem. We preserve the industrial base, while preserving the ability to \nproject power anywhere in the world to protect American interests.\n  Another important cost factor to consider is what we have already \ninvested in this revolutionary weapons system. If we do not have the \nforesight to approve the remaining nine bombers now, the costs to \nrestart this program will be much greater in the future, as the need \nbecomes more critical. Planning ahead will allow us to get more value \nfrom the money and effort already committed to this project.\n  Mr. President, earlier, I mentioned Saddam Hussein's aggression \nagainst the Kurds last fall, as an example of new threats to our \nnational security. This is especially true since administration \nofficials have stated that we should expect to contend with Saddam on a \nyearly basis from now on. In response to Saddam's movements against the \nKurds, on September 3, 1996, we attacked targets in the southern \nregions of Iraq. It would have been more effective to strike the \nRepublican Guard, which was the actual threat to the Kurds in the \nnorth, or the hardened command and control centers of the Iraqi \nleadership in Baghdad. However, our insufficient response to Saddam's \nassault resulted from a lack of options available to us.\n  Because Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Turkey each indicated that they \nwould not permit American aircraft from launching air strikes from \nbases in their countries, we were forced to use other options not \ndependent on foreign governments: carrier airpower, bombers, and cruise \nmissiles. The inherent limitations of each of these options imposed \nconstraints on where and what we could attack--the northern targets \nwere out of range of carrier-launched missions and, because the targets \nwere mobile, cruise missiles could not be used. The most important \ntargets in Baghdad were too heavily protected for conventional, non-\nStealth aircraft delivering cruise missiles that, in any event, could \nnot penetrate underground bunkers. Thus, we had to choose targets that \nwere easier to attack: fixed targets, which were above ground and not \nhardened and, therefore, vulnerable to cruise missile attacks within \nrange of carrier-based aircraft in the southern no-fly zone.\n  In order to more effectively attack Saddam and punish his aggressive \nactions, we would have had to use a stealth weapon to elude detection \nby Iraqi air defense; a long-range weapon, not based in a foreign \ncountry; and a precise weapon to strike the mobile and hardened targets \npresented in Iraq. Our B-2 is this weapon. It is the only tool in our \narsenal that allows us to respond to the new threats we face in an \nunequivocal and decisive fashion.\n  What about those who say we don't need any more B-2 bombers? The \nissue of our bomber capacity was addressed in the Department of Defense \nHeavy Bomber Force Study. This study concluded that our current force \nwould be sufficient through sometime around 2015. I was very \ndisappointed with the conclusions of this study, not only because I \nbelieve the study was fundamentally flawed and based on unrealistic \nassumptions, but also because I believe the B-2 is the most vital \nweapon of our future.\n\n  The study utilizes a scenario of two regional conflicts, but assumes \nthat our enemies would be incredibly considerate of our needs. It was \nassumed that we would have a 14-day advanced warning of an enemy \nattack, allowing time to deploy our forces; that the two regional \nconflicts would not be simultaneous, so our bombers could be used in \nboth conflicts; and that no weapons of mass destruction would be used \nto poison the ground and air in the area where we would intend to \ndeploy our troops. These were the assumptions.\n  I ask my colleagues, with the furor aroused in the American populace \nby the gulf war syndrome and the conflicting stories which have emerged \nfrom the Pentagon, is there anyone who still believes that we would \ndeploy forces into an area where we suspect the enemy has released \nchemical or biological weapons? What is to prevent an enemy from \ndischarging chemical or biological agents in an area prior to the \ninitiation of open hostilities? Would our troops be able to deploy into \nthe theater of conflict without interference? Could they set up and \noperate air bases and troop reception centers while under the threat of \nchemical or biological weapons? I am confident that the answers point \nto the urgent need for long-range-strike aircraft and support the \nacquisition of nine more B-2 aircraft.\n  The heavy bomber study also made some broad assumptions about other \nfactors that may or may not be in our control. The study assumes that \nwe will be able to move our troops and equipment faster than we ever \nhave before; that all of our allies will be on board and welcome \nforeign troops into their bases and ports; that our forward locations \nwill also be conveniently located near the regional conflicts; and that \nour current equipment, including bombers built in the 1950's and \n1960's, will be available and fully functional. Altogether, these are \nawfully big leaps of faith to make about uncertain enemies and unlikely \nconditions in the future.\n  If any one of the unrealistic assumptions does not hold true, the B-2 \nbecomes our primary weapon and our only practical option. It is the \nonly system that is not vulnerable to surprise attack. It is the only \nsystem that is independent of support aircraft based in the theater of \nconflict. It is the only system that is capable of operating beyond the \nrange of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, we have also learned that our allies do not always \ncooperate readily with our requests to use bases in their countries, or \nfly through their airspace, when answering aggression--again, examples \nare the United States raid on Libya in 1986 in response to terrorist \nbombings and the attack on Iraq last year when organized Iraqi forces \nattacked Kurds in northern Iraq. To give the President the best option \nto protect American interests and citizens, while reducing to a minimum \nthe risk to American soldiers, we need to have the most effective tool \navailable--an independent, global, precision strike system. We need to \ngive him this option and take advantage of the most advanced technology \navailable; we must approve funding in order to complete the third \nsquadron of B-2's.\n  Mr. President, I am no military expert. But those whom I know and \ntrust, men such as retired Air Force General Charles Horner, who ran \nthe air campaign in the gulf war, have determined that three squadrons \nof B-2's represent the minimum operational capacity required to meet \nour basic military objectives. In order to halt an invasion from bases \nat home, and to conduct a strategic air campaign, like that of the gulf \nwar, from bases at home, the Air Force needs three squadrons of B-2's. \nThese three squadrons are also critical to neutralizing weapons of mass \ndestruction and theater ballistic missiles; establishing air \nsuperiority and attacking enemy airfields; and suppressing enemy air \ndefenses; all of which then enable the deployment of forces to the \ntheater when necessary.\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\n  Mr. President, history shows us that surprise attacks, both strategic \nand terrorist, do happen and are very effective--Pearl Harbor and \nKorea, as well as the attack on the Marine barracks in Beirut, and on \nour installation in Dhahran--are poignant examples of our past \nfailures. We dare not fail again. We need to plan for surprise--to \nequip our military forces with the ability to blunt or defeat an attack \nanywhere, at any time, and with weapons that we will actually use and \nwhich others believe we will actually use. That means conventional \nexplosives delivered with great accuracy and with immediacy and with \nlittle risk of U.S. casualties. That means the B-2 long-range-strike \naircraft.\n  Mr. President, with the B-2, our ability to respond effectively to \ndiffuse global threats, through the projection of American power, is \nsecure; without it, our foreign policy is one of dependence on others, \nour interests are hostage to public opinion in foreign countries, and \nour soldiers, whom we send to defend our interests abroad, are \nneedlessly imperiled.\n  Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to support the acquisition \nof nine more B-2 aircraft, to establish the minimal, militarily \neffective force of three squadrons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3128-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REGARDING THE UNDERSTANDING REACHED BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE \n                             EUROPEAN UNION\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the \nunderstanding reached between the United States and the European Union \nregarding the implementation of the Helms-Burton Act and the Iran-Libya \nSanctions Act.\n  I want, from the start, to congratulate Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat, \nUndersecretary of Commerce, who negotiated this understanding. His \ncommitment to easing relations between the United States and the \nEuropean Union is unending. His work on the issue of Holocaust victims \nassets in Swiss banks has also played a vital role in settling that \nproblem. I am honored to work with him on both counts.\n  The understanding, as it relates to the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, is \nquite clear. It states:\n\n       The U.S. will continue to work with the EU toward the \n     objectives of meeting the terms (1) for granting EU Member \n     States a waiver under Section 4.C of the Act with regard to \n     Iran, and (2) for granting companies from the EU waivers \n     under Section 9.C of the Act with regard to Libya.\n\n  It should be clear that the terms for granting a waiver, specifically \nwith regard to Iran are very simple. If the country from which the \ncompany to be sanctioned is situated imposes substantial measures, \nincluding the imposition of economic sanctions, then a waiver can be \ngranted. Yes, there is a provision for national security waivers, but \nto simply provide a blanket waiver for the European Union, is a clear \ncontravention to the will of Congress and goes against the very fact \nthat the President signed the bill.\n  Congress intends for this law to be implemented in full, without \nblanket waivers that do not follow the provisions enacted unanimously \nlast year. If blanket waivers are provided without just cause then only \nIran will benefit. Congress enacted this bill with the intention of \ndenying the funds to Iran necessary to fund terrorism, as shown by the \nverdict in Mykonos and the strong speculation that Iran had a role in \nthe bombing of the Khobar towers in Saudi Arabia. It also did so to \ndeny Iran the funds with which to obtain weapons of mass destruction.\n  We must remember that the Iranian Government, at the highest levels, \nhas been implicated in ordering the assassination of Kurdish dissidents \nin Berlin. This terrorist act was conducted on European soil, not \nAmerican. It is unfortunate that Europeans are blind to the need for \naction to curb Iranian terrorism, even when it is occurring on their \nown streets. For Europeans to push for a relaxation of antiterrorism \nlegislation to counter Iran, is even worse. Yet, all of this seems to \nbe of little matter to them. The only thing that does matter is that \ntrade continues, even with the likes of Iran. I wonder if they will \never understand this all?\n  I look forward to seeing how this understanding progresses, and I \nlook forward to European compliance with the legislation. Europeans may \ntake this issue lightly. If they think that they can get a simple \nwaiver so that they can conduct business as usual with the foremost \nsponsor of international terrorism, but they're wrong--very \nwrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3130-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING ANTHONY (DUKE) DeBIASE OF THE MARINE CADETS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a man \nof character, his tradition of accomplishment, his outstanding record \nof public service, and his contribution to his community and the State \nof Tennessee. Today, April 14, Gene Roberts steps down as the mayor of \nChattanooga. He will be missed, but I know that wherever he chooses to \nput his skills to use in the future, he will be a great asset.\n  Gene Roberts is a low-key kind of man, the kind who leads with \nconfidence. When Gene gets behind some cause or effort, people just \nfundamentally know that he's in it for the right reasons and that they \nought to seriously consider following his lead. The people of \nChattanooga have had the benefit of Gene's talents in his capacity as \nmayor since 1983. They know firsthand what I'm talking about.\n  Gene's history of public service goes back over 25 years, back to \n1971, when he was the commissioner of fire and police for Chattanooga. \nFor a brief time, he served in the cabinet of my friend, Gov. Lamar \nAlexander. And his long tenure as mayor has been marked by \nunprecedented growth, progress, and a rise in the fortunes and profile \nof the city of Chattanooga.\n  He has presided over real progress. During his years in office, \nChattanooga has seen a revival of its downtown, revitalized \nneighborhoods, a cleanup of pollution to preserve the beautiful land in \nthe area, and a marked increase in the quality of life for the folks \nwho call Chattanooga home.\n  Thanks to Gene's efforts, and his coordination of efforts with other \ncivic-minded groups and individuals, Chattanooga has become a model for \nother cities striving to improve. Today, leaders from around the world \nand across the country visit Chattanooga to see what's been done, and \nto find out how they can duplicate the success of this model city.\n  It's this kind of effort that creates a vigorous economy for the \narea, and that's good for everyone. In no small measure, we have Gene \nRoberts to thank for that.\n  These kinds of positive changes only happen when an individual steps \nforward to take the initiative. You've got to care enough to invest \ntime and skill and experience to make a good city into a great city. \nThings like this don't just happen by themselves.\n  Congratulations and all the best to Gene Roberts as he retires from \nthe office of mayor of Chattanooga, TN.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3130-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3130-S3131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SALUTE TO LARRY MANCINO\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

This \ndistinguished organization, which boasts more than 18,000 members, is \nthe second oldest society of certified public accountants [CPAs] in the \nUnited States. In fact, several of the big six accounting firms were \nactually founded by PICPA alumni.\n  Mr. President, PICPA is comprised of dedicated professionals who \nprovide essential financial advice to individuals, corporations, \nnonprofits, and government entities. Every day, they ensure that \ncorporate financial dealings are properly reported to stockholders, \nhelp organizations comply with our tax laws, and provide detailed \nfinancial reports for managers.\n  In a dynamic business climate, it is essential to stay apprised of \nchanging professional standards, government regulations, and accounting \npractices. PICPA associates have risen to this challenge. They have \ndemonstrated a commitment to the accounting profession by adhering to a \ncontinuing education requirement. Likewise, they subject themselves to \nperiodic peer reviews to improve the quality of their financial \nstatements.\n  I am also pleased to note that PICPA encourages community service. \nMembers have proudly helped improve the quality of life for less \nfortunate Pennsylvanians by donating thousands of hours to charitable \norganizations.\n  Mr. President, members of PICPA are currently serving the public as \nauditors, tax advisors, computer consultants, personal financial \nplanners, educators, legislators, small business advisors, managers, \nand estate planners.

Mr. President, the Attorney General, today, will \napparently respond to the request of a majority of the members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee that she seek the appointment of an \nindependent counsel in the investigation into campaign finance \nirregularities of the 1996 campaign. In deciding how to respond, the \nAttorney General's duty is to follow the law, not to respond to \npolitical pressure.\n  But over the weekend, extraordinary attempts were made by several \nHouse Republican leaders to literally scare the Attorney General into \ndoing what they want, not necessarily what the law requires.\n  Both Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Armey said Sunday in effect \nthat if she doesn't seek an independent counsel it's because she caved \nin to administration pressure. I ask that the Washington Post article \nof Monday, April 14, 1997, entitled ``Republicans Warn Reno on \nIndependent Counsel'' be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, those comments by the Speaker of the House and the \nMajority Leader of the House constitute an attempt at political \nintimidation. Their message to the Attorney General yesterday was that \nif she doesn't seek the appointment of an independent counsel today, \nshe runs the risk of being hauled up before a congressional committee \nand put under oath. There are consequences, they are telling the \nAttorney General--there are consequences to not doing what they want \nher to do.\n  Well, Mr. President, those statements by House Republican leaders fly \nin the face of the very purpose of the independent counsel law. Here's \na statute that we passed to take the politics out of criminal \ninvestigations of high-level officials, and the Speaker and House \nLeader worked hard to put politics right back in. Their threats to the \nAttorney General--to make her do what they want her to do are \ninappropriate and jeopardize the very law they are demanding that she \ninvoke.\n  I have confidence, Mr. President, that the Attorney General will \nfollow the law wherever it leads her, despite their clumsy effort at \npolitical intimidation. I hope that Members on both sides of the aisle \nhere in the Senate will respect her decision, whatever it is, and the \ndiscretion the law entitles her to exercise.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 14, 1997]\n\n              Republicans Warn Reno on Independent Counsel\n\n\n    attorney general should be called to testify if inquiry is not \n                        requested, gingrich says\n\n                           (By John E. Yang)\n\n       House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said yesterday Attorney \n     General Janet Reno should be called before Congress to \n     testify under oath if she does not tell Congress today that \n     she will seek an independent counsel to investigate alleged \n     abuses in Democratic Party fund-raising.\n       Gingrich declared he has no confidence in Reno as attorney \n     general and, when asked if she should resign, said: ``We'll \n     know tomorrow,'' the deadline for Reno to respond to a \n     request from congressional Republicans that she call for an \n     independent counsel in the matter.\n       ``The evidence mounts every day of lawbreaking in this \n     administration,'' Gingrich said on ``Fox News Sunday.''\n       ``If she can look at the day-after-day revelations about \n     this administration and not conclude it's time for an \n     independent counsel, how can any serious citizen have any \n     sense of faith in her judgment?''\n       Late last week, the indications were that Reno would likely \n     not seek a counsel in the case, which is already being \n     investigated by career Justice Department prosecutors, but \n     aides emphasized no final decision had been made.\n       If she decides not to ask a three-judge panel to name an \n     independent counsel, Gingrich said, Reno needs to explain her \n     decision. ``She needs to answer in public, she needs to \n     answer, I think, under oath,'' he said.\n       Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) \n     said Reno ``becomes a major issue'' if she does not call for \n     an independent counsel.\n       ``The conflict of interest, both apparent and real, it \n     seems to me, would necessitate her choosing an independent \n     counsel,'' he said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``If she doesn't \n     then I think there's going to be a swirl of criticism that's \n     going to be, I think, very much justified.\n       Justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenburg dismissed \n     such talk. ``Unfortunately, this has become a battle between \n     law and politics,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``The \n     Justice Department will adhere to the law.''\n       Reno routinely asks the career prosecutors looking into the \n     matter whether any development requires the appointment of an \n     independent counsel, according to Brandenburg. So far, they \n     have not said that an independent counsel is indicated, he \n     said.\n       The law says the attorney general must ask for an \n     independent counsel if there is specific, credible \n     information of criminal wrongdoing by top administration \n     officials--including the president, vice president and \n     Cabinet officers--the head of a president's election or \n     reelection campaign or anyone else for whom it would be a \n     conflict of interest for the Justice Department to \n     investigate.\n       House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) \n     said an independent\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\n     counsel was needed to maintain public confidence in the \n     investigation. ``In-house investigations, as honorable as \n     they might well be, don't sell the public on the fact that \n     they are independent,'' he said on ABC.\n       While Hyde said he retains his confidence in Reno as \n     attorney general, Gingrich was sharply critical of her for \n     not telling White House officials the FBI suspected China was \n     planning to make illegal campaign contributions. Reno has \n     said she telephoned national security adviser Anthony Lake, \n     failed to reach him and never called back.\n       ``If you're the top law enforcement officer of this country \n     * * * wouldn't you say to the White House, `Gee, the \n     president and the secretary of state ought to know we think \n     the Chinese communists may be trying to buy the American \n     election'?'' he said.\n       House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.) suggested \n     Reno is victim of the political pressures within the \n     administration.\n       ``This is a person that would like to be professional and \n     responsible in their job, and that makes her out of place in \n     this administration,'' Armey said on CBS's ``Face the \n     Nation.'' ``She is in a hopeless situation. * * * If I were \n     Janet Reno, I would just say `I can't function with people \n     that stand with these standards of conduct and behavior and \n     I'm leaving.' ''\n       On another topic, Gingrich said the United States should \n     ``consider very seriously'' military action against ``certain \n     very high-value targets in Iran'' if there is strong evidence \n     linking a senior Iranian government official to a group of \n     Shiite Muslims suspected of bombing a U.S. military compound \n     in Saudi Arabia last year.\n       ``We have to take whatever steps are necessary to convince \n     Iran that state-sponsored terrorism is not acceptable,'' he \n     said. ``The indirect killing of Americans is still an act of \n     war.''\n       The Washington Post reported yesterday that intelligence \n     information indicates that Brig. Ahmad Sherifi, a senior \n     Iranian intelligence officer and a top official in Iran's \n     Revolutionary Guards, met roughly two years before the \n     bombing with a Saudi Shiite arrested March 18 in Canada. \n     According to Canadian court records, the man, Hani Abd Rahim \n     Sayegh, had fled Saudi Arabia shortly after the June 25 \n     bombing that killed 19 U.S. servicemen and wounded more than \n     500 others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3131-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   JOHN PIDGEON'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY AS HEADMASTER OF THE KISKI SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to \nacknowledge John ``Jack'' Pidgeon's 40th anniversary as headmaster of \nthe Kiski School in Saltsburg, PA. John is well known to many \nPennsylvanians for his excellent career in education and also is the \nproud husband of Pennsylvania's State treasurer, Barbara Hafer.\n  Forty years ago, John Pidgeon left a position at the Deerfield \nAcademy to assume the position of headmaster of the Kiski School. In \n1957, he became the youngest headmaster in the United States. Today, he \nis the longest serving headmaster in the country. In this capacity, he \nhas worked to stabilize the school's finances, develop the campus, and \nbuild upon its outstanding academic reputation.\n  When John first arrived at the Kiski School, the institution's \ninfrastructure was suffering and its deficit was rising. Under his \ndirection, the school raised funds for a campus face lift, built a \nstrong financial foundation, and stabilized enrollment. Throughout his \ncareer, he has emphasized the value of courtesy, ethics, discipline, \nhigh moral standards, and quality of education. By establishing a \nphilosophy that combined these values in the school's education \nprogram, he has prepared Kiski boys to meet the challenges and \nopportunities they will face in the future.\n  I ask that the text of an article in the September, 1996 Kiski \nBulletin be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   Kiski--The School that Jack Built\n\n       Forty years ago, John ``Jack'' Pidgeon left a secure job at \n     Deerfield Academy to become the Headmaster of The Kiski \n     School. As the new headmaster, he not only ran the School, \n     taught classes, and coached sports, but also initiated a \n     major face-lift of the deteriorating campus. Along with no \n     entrance road and few athletic fields, the school had no \n     desks or chairs in some dormitory rooms, lacked water for \n     days at a time, and suffered a $200,000 deficit. The students \n     willingly pitched in to paint and clean up the school \n     grounds.\n       Before 1957, Kiski never received a donation larger than \n     $10,000. Today, the 350 acre campus is the envy of both \n     independent schools and liberal arts colleges. Under the \n     direction of the Headmaster, the School has completed over a \n     dozen substantial fund-raising campaigns and added:\n       Daub Hall, 1961.\n       The Field House, 1962.\n       Heath Clark Classroom Building, 1967.\n       The Indoor Swimming Pool, 1967.\n       McClintock Hall, 1968.\n       Vlahos Hall, 1968.\n       The Dining Hall and Infirmary, 1976.\n       Sheesley Hall, 1978.\n       The S.W. Jack Sports Center, 1983.\n       The Stephen C. Rogers Fine Arts Center, 1984.\n       Schoenbaum Center, 1985.\n       The John A. Pidgeon Library, 1993.\n       Six faculty homes.\n       A new dormitory in planning for 1997.\n       Today, campus buildings are worth over $5 million, and the \n     School has an endowment of $20 million.\n       The campus enrollment is 250 boys, 225 boarders and 25 area \n     day students. Over the past decade, ``Jack's Boys'' have come \n     from six continents, 30 countries and 28 states of the U.S.\n       Jack Pidgeon came to Kiski as the youngest headmaster in \n     the United States. Today his forty years of service make him \n     the longest serving headmaster in the country. In addition to \n     building a school with a superb physical plant, a sound \n     financial basis, and a stable enrollment, Jack Pidgeon prides \n     himself on placing high value on courtesy, ethics, \n     discipline, morals, and a quality educational program. \n     ``Kiski Boys'' are prepared to meet the challenges and \n     opportunities they will face in the real world.\n       The man who played in the same backfield with actor Jack \n     Lemmon and the same field with President George Bush at \n     Phillips Andover Academy left a secure job teaching Latin at \n     Deerfield Academy and took the leap of faith in coming to \n     Kiski. He has, in his dynamic years as headmaster, built a \n     school that has had a positive effect on the lives of \n     thousands of young men. Every year, these young men receive a \n     personally signed birthday card from the man who cared enough \n     about their future that he risked his own on their \n     behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3132-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARINE CADETS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

The Marine Cadets \nof America was founded in Connecticut in 1958 and is in its 39th year \nof operation, and although its mission has drastically changed and is \ngeared to diverting children from falling prey to drugs and alcohol, it \nalso provides children with a wholesome environment by teaching \nleadership skills, CPR, vocational skills, and a regular camping and \nsurvival program along with physical fitness and water sports. The men \nand women that serve as adult advisors and role models all serve \nwithout pay as volunteers and donate their professional skills to the \nchildren of this program. I congratulate and commend these men and \nwomen for their efforts and wish them every success in the continued \nefforts of this outstanding youth program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3132-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3132-S3133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ZVI H. MUSCAL\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nZvi Muscal, an exemplary businessman from Philadelphia and an \noutstanding community leader. Last December, the American-Jewish \nCommunity presented the 1996 Civic Achievement Award to Zvi Muscal, and \nI had the distinct honor of delivering the keynote address at his \npresentation dinner.\n  In 1979, Zvi left his beloved Israeli homeland to start a branch of \nBank Hapoalim in Philadelphia. Like many who came to this country \nbefore him, Zvi came to America with a dream and a strong work ethic.\n  As the bank grew under his leadership, Zvi dedicated himself to many \norganizations which had a major impact on the Philadelphia community. \nServing on the International City Steering Committee, the World Affairs \nCouncil, and the Philadelphia-Israel Economic Development Corp., which \nlater became the Philadelphia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, Zvi has been \na tireless advocate for business development in Philadelphia. \nAdditionally, he has worked zealously to promote the city's cultural \naffairs and to support many important nonprofit organizations. In fact, \nthe city of Philadelphia recognized Zvi's outstanding achievements and \ncontributions by proclaiming May 19, 1985, Zvi Muscal Day.\n  Since then, Zvi has undertaken several business ventures. For \ninstance, he started PhilTrade, Inc., an international trading company. \nLater, he and other business leaders founded the First Executive Bank. \nZvi served as the bank's chief executive officer until June, 1996, when \nit merged with the First Republic Bank. Today, Zvi is the chairman of \nthis institution.\n  As Zvi climbed the ladder of success, he strengthened his commitment \nto\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nthe community and his ardent devotion to Philadelphia. He currently \nserves on the board of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental \nMedicine, the Philadelphia International Airport Advisory Council, the \nCommunity Bank Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of \nPhiladelphia, the Operation Smile-Philadelphia Chapter, the Police \nAthletic League, the Philadelphia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, Elwyn \nJerusalem, the Solomon Schecter Day School, and the Gesu School of \nPhiladelphia.\n  Mr. President, I salute Mr. Muscal for his achievements in business \nand in the community at large. I ask that my colleagues join me in \nwishing Zvi Muscal and his family all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3132-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IVA MAE DECKER'S 105TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Iva \nMae Decker, a Vermonter and very special woman who is celebrating her \n105th birthday today.\n  Iva Mae Decker was born in Montpelier, VT, on April 14, 1892. Ask Iva \nMae what the secret to her longevity is and she will answer: ``Just \nkeep on moving.''\n  Iva Mae lives at home with her daughter, Beverly, and appreciates the \nsupport she receives from her friends in the community. She is a \nshining example that independence need not be lost due to age. Beverly \nsays of her mother, ``She remembers the past, lives in the present, and \nlooks forward to the future.''\n  Iva has a genuine concern and warmth for others, as the children of \nthe Proctor Elementary School will attest. In 1992, during the annual \nCount to 100 Day, Iva visited the first graders in Proctor, VT. Five \nyears later, Iva continues to encourage these children to read and \nwrite through correspondence and poetry.\n  To celebrate her 103d birthday, Iva took a hot air balloon ride. A \nsurprise 104th birthday present provided by many friends, family and \nlocal businesses fulfilled Iva's life-long dream of riding the cable \ncars in San Francisco. She had a tremendous trip.\n  Last week, Iva had planned to celebrate her 105th birthday by \nvisiting Washington, DC to tour the city and share her thoughts on \nGovernment with her congressional Representatives. However, the flu \nforced her to postpone her plans for the moment. A birthday celebration \nwill be held instead in her home today. Among the many officials \nattending will be Rutland's mayor who will present a Rutland city \nproclamation in her honor.\n  I would like to join Iva Mae's many family and friends in wishing her \na very happy birthday. Her longevity and zest for life is an \ninspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3133-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 15, 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

It is something I know the American people feel very \nstrongly about. There has been a lot of attention given to the fact \nthat IRS employees have been fired because of this unauthorized access \nto these IRS records. It also will give us an opportunity tomorrow to \ntalk about other abuses at the IRS.\n  So Senators can expect additional votes on Tuesday after the policy \nluncheons--at least one and hopefully two more votes tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/14/senate-section/article/S3133-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
