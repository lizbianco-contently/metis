The question is on the motion to proceed. Is \nthere further debate on the motion?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \ntwelve minutes as in the morning hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thurmond pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2266 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, is the business before the Senate the \nmotion to proceed to S. 648?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, S. 648 is a bill relating to product \nliability reported about 1 year ago by the Senate Commerce Committee. \nThat bill is identical or nearly identical to the product liability \nlegislation that passed both Houses of Congress in the last Congress \nand was vetoed by President Clinton.\n  As and when the motion to proceed is agreed to, Senator Rockefeller \nand I will propose an amendment in the nature of a substitute on the \nsame subject, product liability, somewhat more modest in scope than the \nbill that was vetoed by the President. It is the result of more than 1 \nyear of careful and detailed negotiation involving myself, other \nmembers of this party, Senator Rockefeller and various of his allies, \nand the Office of the President of the United States.\n  The willingness of the President of the United States to sign a \nproduct liability bill in the form of this substitute is due to the \nuntiring and diligent efforts of the junior Senator from West Virginia, \nwho has literally been tireless in pursuing a solution to a question \nthat involved his time and my time for well over a decade, and a \nwillingness to pursue it in a White House from which a veto emanated \nalmost 2 years ago.\n  The bill, of course, is not as broad as the one that was then vetoed \nor the bill that was passed out by the Commerce Committee. \nNevertheless, it does bring a significant degree of rationality and \npredictability to product liability litigation. It removes a number of \nsevere inhibitions that stand in the way of research and development \nfor new and approved products in the commerce of the United States. \nThat may be its most important single feature, because we have an \neconomy in which litigation has provided a severe inhibition to the \nimprovement of our products, to the development of new products. \nPerhaps the single most vivid illustration of the value of product \nliability litigation is in the field of piston-driven aircraft, a \nsubject with which the Presiding Officer is more than familiar, where a \nlimitation on product liability litigation, a modest limitation, passed \nhalf a dozen years ago, has resulted in the recovery of an industry \nthat had almost disappeared in the United States of America. So we are \nnot speaking about a theory when we talk about the inhibitions placed \non various forms of business enterprise, industrial and otherwise, by \nthe present state of the law varying from State to State through 50 \nStates and several other jurisdictions.\n\n  While I would prefer broader product liability legislation, and while \nI believe the Senator from West Virginia might prefer it to be somewhat \nbroader than it is at this point, this legislation nevertheless is good \nfor the economy of the United States, and it is good for those who are \ninjured by the actual or real negligence of manufacturers or sellers. \nIt does, however, say that in the case of the seller, the seller is \nonly going to be liable when the seller itself is negligent. It does \nput some rational basis on the award of punitive damages with an actual \ncap on punitive damages for modest and for small businesses. In that \nregard, it sets a uniform national standard for punitive damages in \nthose States that allow punitive damages--my own, for example, does \nnot--raising the bar to require clear, cogent, and convincing evidence \nfor the award of punitive damages, a higher standard than exists in \nmost States at the present time, with a cap on punitive damages for \nsmall businesses.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business has just come out \nwith a study as to who is impacted by that, and while the definition of \na small business in this bill is 25 employees or $5 million a year in \nsales, their table shows that 73 percent of all the manufacturers in \nthe United States have fewer than 20 employees, 88 percent of all the \nretailers in the United States have fewer than 20 employees, and 85 \npercent of the wholesalers in the United States fall within the same \ncategory. So, for the vast majority of business enterprises in the \nUnited States, there will be a cap on punitive damages that is \nrealistic in nature and is something that the business might \nconceivably be able to pay, rather than simply being driven out of \nbusiness by such a verdict.\n  With respect to product sellers, it simply states that the product \nseller avoids liability if the product seller is not itself negligent \nor otherwise liable. Manufacturers, under those circumstances--since \nthey can't be joined in litigation with the product seller--can almost \nalways achieve what amounts to fraudulent joinder and thus get \ndiversity of citizenship, a diversity of citizenship that allows them \nto get into a Federal court rather than into State courts where the \ngreat majority of notorious and unwarranted verdicts in product \nliability cases have taken place in the past.\n  Product manufacturers have been frustrated by the unavailability of a \n``misuse'' defense. They have that, to a greater extent, as a result of \nthis bill. The bill includes a statute of repose, a very modest and \nnarrow statute of\n\n[[Page S7527]]\n\nrepose but a statute of repose nevertheless, one of 18 years for \ndurable goods used in the workplace where the plaintiff already has \navailable to that plaintiff workers compensation or industrial \ninsurance.\n  Finally, a strong biomaterials bill, particularly important, in my \nview, as the materials that go into implants--for example, heart \nmonitors and the like--are often very inexpensive. They are various \nforms of plastic tubing and the like. Yet the biomaterials manufacturer \nalmost always finds itself as a defendant in a product liability suit \ndirected primarily at the manufacturer or the assembler of the implant. \nAnd the cost, in the case of many relatively large corporations, of \nsuccessfully defending lawsuits based on those implants literally \nexceeds the total sales price of the materials that they have sold that \ngo into those items. So a rational manufacturer of the materials that \ngo into various very important cutting-edge medical devices--the \nrational manufacturer simply won't sell them. There is not much point \nin selling $100,000 worth of materials in a year if it is going to cost \nyou $1 million a year successfully to defend yourself against lawsuits \ndirected primarily at the person who has used the materials that you \nhave manufactured.\n\n  Some of those companies have continued in the business just as a \nmatter of being good citizens, but we cannot call on them or believe \nthat they will continue to do so for an extended period of time. To the \nbest of our knowledge, we do not have any who have actually lost these \nlawsuits, but the defense against these lawsuits is important in any \nevent.\n  We have a system that is sick, a system in which the greater \npercentage of the money that goes into product liability litigation \ngoes to lawyers, insurance companies, insurance agents and the like, \nand only a relatively modest portion of it ever gets to the actual \nvictims of actual negligence. We have a situation in which there are \nhighly publicized and outrageously large punitive damage awards in a \nhandful of States of the United States, but where, in the vast majority \nof cases in which some at least modest compensation is due, the \ncompensation is less than actual damages.\n  This bill is a modest attempt to improve the compensation system for \ndefective products in the United States and it modestly improves it. It \nis a modest move in the direction of uniformity. It certainly doesn't \ncreate uniformity everywhere, but at least it is a modest step in that \ndirection. And it is a significant step in the direction of encouraging \ncompanies to continue to be at the cutting edge of the development of \nnew products, new products used both in the workplace and by \nindividuals all across the United States--the kind of innovation and \ndevelopment which have marked the United States from the very beginning \nof our history and of our economy, and the kind of innovation and \nleadership in the world economy that is vitally important. So I hope we \nwill be soon able to move to the bill, to pass the bill in the form as \nit has been worked out by the Senator from West Virginia and myself \nwith the cooperation of the White House, its passage by the House, and \nits signing by the President of the United States.\n  I dare not say in a body like this that this issue has occupied us \nfor more years than any other in which there has not been any actual \nlegislation passed, but if it doesn't rank No. 1 in that score, it \nranks very, very close to No. 1. We now have a real opportunity, if we \nare constructive, to see to it that we are modestly successful, and I \nhope in the course of the next week or 10 days that is exactly what we \nwill do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rosalind \nWood, of my staff, be accorded floor privileges for the duration of the \nconsideration of the pending product liability bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, here we are again. As always, I am \nvery proud to be standing across the aisle from my dear colleague, \nSenator Gorton. Senator Lieberman is very much a part of this. There \nare many who are very much a part of this.\n  I can report that we are in a position, as the Senator from \nWashington has indicated, to pass and to have signed a product \nliability bill for the first time in my living memory, at least, in the \nSenate. This is, I guess, my 11th year on this subject.\n  We have a chance to have the bill signed, however, by the President, \nonly if we maintain the bill in its current very limited form. I, \nobviously, congratulate Senator Gorton--who does a prodigious job in \nall events--on this subject and many others, but he has also been \nextraordinary in the way that he has accepted and rejected and \nnegotiated not only with myself, but also with the White House in his \ndiscussions with the majority leader to, in effect, finally bring a \nproduct liability bill to the floor which actually can pass, and if it \ndoes pass, will be signed by the President, provided that it is in its \ncurrent limited form.\n  It is a good feeling to have a bill that can be signed. I am much \nmore accustomed to being here promoting a bill that I know would be a \ngood bill, but, on the other hand, which I know in the end isn't going \nto be signed. When you know something is going to be signed, that says \ntwo things: One is that you are dealing with some folks in the White \nHouse who have been very honorable and consistent; and, second, you \nhave a very limited bill.\n  The Senator from Washington used a much more tactful phrase. He said \na ``somewhat more limited bill.'' I will be more direct and say that it \nis a very much more limited bill. The logic for that is very simple. If \nit was other than its current form, we might be able to pass it, but it \nwould not be signed. I just somehow fail to see the logic or the wisdom \nof, once again, passing a bill that is vetoed. I don't see the point in \nthat. It takes up a lot of our time.\n  We have all worked at this for years and years. If we are going to do \nsomething, let's get what we can. I think that is one of the lessons we \nlearned from health care reform--one which I myself did not learn \neasily--that when we try to do the whole job, or at least a large chunk \nof the job, the Congress is not willing to accept it. I now refer to \nmyself on health care reform as a ``raging incrementalist.'' I have had \nto accept that position. On product liability reform, I now think the \nmore limited approach makes a great deal more sense.\n  I say again to my colleagues and those who work with them, that when \nI say there is not a lot of room for deviation in this bill, the \nSenator from West Virginia really means that. This is a process in \nwhich I worked for a very long period of time negotiating with the \nWhite House, knowing that it was fruitless to come forward with a bill \nwhich would not meet with their approval. In essence, we had to look at \nall of those things which were displeasing to the White House last year \nwhen the veto took place and then simply excise all of those or \nanything related to those, and proceed to craft a bill which did not \nmeet their objections. They were very tough about it, but they were \nvery fair about it. They were very consistent. I really respect them \nfor that. I can name the people who did that, and I will at the \nappropriate time, but I really honor them for their consistency and \ntheir willingness to let it be known where they stood.\n\n  Then, my obligation is to let my colleagues know that this is not one \nof those bills where we can come in and do all kinds of things to it or \nelse it will be vetoed, and only the President holds the pen. He always \ndoes, but sometimes there is more room for movement. On this one, I \nthink there is very little room for movement.\n  Senators know our legislative calendar is growing very short. That is \nwhy I have been so adamant about urging floor consideration for the \nreform agreement that has been reached with the White House and which \nwill be signed if passed. Senator Gorton and I recently completed work \non some technical changes which the White House had agreed to accept \nbut, again, technical, no substantive changes. No substantive changes \nwere contemplated by the White House; no substantive changes were \nagreed to by the White House, only some technical changes.\n  Why? Because they are the controlling element here. They are the ones \nwho have the pen. They can veto it, or they can sign it. Therefore, \ntheir leverage is considerable. I can pretend we\n\n[[Page S7528]]\n\nare otherwise, but it doesn't do me much good. That is the case. \nTherefore, if we are going to have some form of bill, then let's \nproceed to get what we can. That is the way Senator Gorton and I have \nproceeded on this bill.\n  I reemphasize to my colleagues that the White House has publicly \ncommitted to signing this bill if it remains in this form. That will \ngrate on some of my colleagues. I have also had private assurances this \nbill will be signed if it is unamended. It is now up to the full Senate \nto decide if they want a campaign issue or if they want to pass a \nmoderate, balanced, responsible reform bill that helps small business, \nproduct sellers, renters, lessors, as well as consumers, but which, in \nthe end, is a fairly modest bill.\n  My colleagues know there are many of us who have worked very hard to \ngain a meaningful and fair reform. I have taken on this task, not \nbecause I am a lawyer, which I am not; not because I am heavily \ninvolved in following these matters in the trade press, but for a very \nsimple reason. And that is I genuinely believe that in an international \nglobal economy, we have to keep up with the competition.\n  I just returned from 10 days in China with the President. It is just \nabsolutely stunning to see what is going on there, the way that \neconomy, in spite of the Asian troubles, is leaping ahead. This is true \nall over Asia. The Asia crisis is going to pass. It is going to be a \ncouple of years. It is going to pass. They are going to come back. The \nAsian countries are predestined to be successful economically.\n  All the European Union nations have a single product liability law. I \nknow, just as a matter of common sense, that when something is \nmanufactured in a State, if it is an average State, 70 percent of the \nmanufactured products will be exported on an interstate, if not \ninternational, basis. Therefore, State law, having had meaning at some \npoint, has much less meaning when it comes to interstate commerce, much \nless international commerce. Again, it is not just a question of the \nlaws, but it is also a question of are we being competitive or not. \nWhat is the added cost for liability insurance to our products as we \ncompete in Europe and Japan now, for example, which has also taken on a \nsingle national uniform product liability law.\n  All of these things are extremely important. I also think having 50 \nStates with separate laws is confusing. It means that people forum \nshop. They go to the State where they can get the best deal. I think it \nis true--I am not sure it is true this year--but it is true that last \nyear, 85 percent of all of the punitive damages awarded in this country \ncame out of Alabama, Texas, and California. That means that people knew \nwhere to go to get into a court system which would, in a sense, respond \nsympathetically. I don't think that is a wise way to carry on the \nbusiness of our country or the commerce of our country.\n  All of these States having different laws is very, very complex and \nvery difficult in allowing us to compete, and in fact, in even allowing \nus to adjudicate in product liability cases where people have, in fact, \nbeen injured and do, in fact, deserve payment and, in some cases, \npunitive damages.\n  The plain fact to this Senator's way of thinking is that our current \nsystem is simply unable to handle this problem in the modern \nmarketplace and much less--or more so, really--in the global \nmarketplace. States cannot deal with product liability problems that \noccur out of their borders. They can't do that.\n\n  In contrast to the circumstances that existed when our tort system \nwas evolving, most goods, as I indicated, move outside of the State. \nThat is important. When our tort system was evolving, the States could \nhandle it. The States did handle it. Exporting from McDowell County, \nWV, to Braxton County, WV, was the way life went on some time ago. Now \nif you export to Ohio, much less the State of California, much less \nIndonesia, Japan, or China, you have to be much more sophisticated in \nthe way you handle these problems. I think a Federal product liability \nlaw does make sense. That does not mean in all respects, and this bill \ndoes not do that in all respects, and I think that is an important \npoint.\n  I was a member of the National Governors' Association for 8 years, \nand, like other companies, I was protective of States rights on all \nissues. But they have fairly consistently recognized the importance of \nestablishing a Federal statute on product liability. I think that is \nvery significant and deserves the consideration of my colleagues.\n  There is another bipartisan group called the American Legislative \nExchange Council, a group of over 3,000 State legislators from all over \nthe country. They have repeatedly urged Congress to enact Federal \nproduct liability reform--Federal product liability reform.\n  The bill we are proposing would address the problems in our product \nliability reform system which we know exist. It would provide increased \npredictability for business. It would improve the system for consumers \nat the same time. Is it gigantic on any side? No, because it is not a \nbig bill. That we constantly bear in mind, because if it were a bigger \nbill, it would not get signed. We want to get the bill signed. This is \nnot the ``nose under the tent'' theory. It simply would be nice to get \nsome sort of uniform Federal standards on product liability going.\n  Under today's product liability system, companies have a disincentive \nto invent, to innovate. That means there are a lot of beneficial \nupgrades that are not done. People do not undertake certain kinds of \nbiomedical research or pharmaceutical production or other things just \nbecause they fear the result of getting sued. It isn't really so much \nthe number of suits. Those who oppose this Senator's position are \nalways talking about, ``The Senator from West Virginia is always \ntalking about the explosion of litigation.''\n  I have never talked about explosion of litigation. There is no \nexplosion of litigation. But the psychological factor of a company \nsitting down and trying to decide whether it will go into a line of \nresearch and development which could lead to a cure for some disease, \nthe present laws pull them back. Look at Viagra. It now has had about \n300 deaths. I don't know what will happen with Viagra. Maybe they \ndeserve to get sued, maybe they don't, I don't know. But you can see \nwhen people are looking at doing some kind of research that they want \nto pull back. In the case of Viagra, maybe they should have in the \nfirst place. Or maybe their warnings were not adequate.\n  I am not here to defend Viagra, as I was never here to defend Ford \nPinto--that was always the example. Ford Pinto is undefendable. They \nshould have been sued, they were sued, and that was the right thing to \ndo.\n  Keeping products off the market that can do remarkable good for \npeople is not in the American tradition; protecting consumers is in the \nAmerican tradition. But we have always managed to find a balance where \nwe both protect consumers and we move forward, strongly, in terms of \ninnovation. We have always been the country of basic research. Other \ncountries have been the countries of applied research. Basic research \nis not undertaken unless you can foresee it ending up someday in the \nmarketplace. If you don't, then you don't do it.\n  We can help all of this by establishing a set of Federal rules for \nproduct liability cases. The compromise bill that Senator Gorton and I \nwere able to work out with the White House, and which was introduced on \nJune 25, creates a national framework for a more rational process for \nlitigation regarding products, and products alone. If a manufacturer \nwas, in fact, responsible for injury, it would remain accountable. If \nthe seller of a product failed in its responsibility, it would be held \naccountable. The legislation is limited, meaningful, and signable.\n  I ask unanimous consent a section-by-section analysis of the bill \nappear in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will briefly run through a list of the bill's \nmajor provisions for my colleagues in the hope that some of them and \nsome of their staff they work with are listening.\n  No. 1, the bill, as the Senator from Washington indicated, protects \nproduct sellers, renters, and lessors from suits that should be brought \nagainst manufacturers, not the product sellers, renters, or the \nlessors. Product sellers, renters, or lessors will be held liable\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\nfor their own negligence, make no mistake. For their own negligence \nthey will be held accountable, or their failure to comply with express \nwarranty, but not for the negligence that is beyond their own control. \nThat comports, it seems to me, with common sense.\n  The product seller, renter, or lessor remains liable if the \nmanufacturer cannot be brought into court. So, again, a consumer \nprotection. Or they remain liable if the manufacturer is unable to pay \njudgments. All of this is in order to ensure that consumers retain a \nsource of recovery. So, product sellers, renters, or lessors, et \ncetera, are protected, but they are not protected in the ultimate \nsense. That is, if manufacturers don't show up, are broke, can't pay, \nthey--the consumer, injured consumer--will still get recovery.\n  No. 2, this bill will create a defense in a product liability case if \na plaintiff is found to have been under the influence of illegal drugs \nor alcohol and was responsible for more than 50 percent of his or her \nown injuries. That has always struck me as a commonsense idea. We \nshould help discourage abuse of illegal drugs or alcohol. Maybe it \nwill, maybe it won't. But in any event, if people are responsible for \ntheir own use of alcohol or drugs and responsible for more than 50 \npercent of their injury, there should be an absolute defense against \nthat.\n  No. 3, if a claimant's harm is attributable to the misuse or \nalteration of a product, defendant's liability will be reduced by \nwhatever extent the harm is due to that misuse or alteration.\n  No. 4, consumers will have 2 full years to file a complaint from the \ntime he or she discovers or should have discovered the harm and--this \nis new--the cause of the injury. A lot of States have the harm, the \ndiscovery of the harm, but there are not as many that have the cause. \nSo, this is very, very strongly in favor of the consumer. This is \nparticularly true--on the veterans committee, I have worked very hard \non a variety of issues, including the Persian Gulf War Syndrome, all \nkinds of things in the world we are moving into, like toxic harm, et \ncetera, where the cause becomes much more important, because often \nthings don't show up until much later.\n  No. 5, the bill's 18-year statute of repose applies to only durable \ngoods in the workplace, and only in those situations which are covered \nby State worker compensation laws, and specifically excludes injuries \ncaused by toxic harm. I just mentioned toxic harm. Well, toxic harm has \nno place, there is no remedy for it, in this bill. This means that only \npeople who can recover for their injuries under State worker \ncompensation laws are subject to the statute of repose. The statute of \nrepose does not begin until after the product's express warranty \nexpires. This provision is good for consumers, and, frankly, it is good \nfor business. Businesses are relieved of unlimited liability, and \nconsumers have a source of recovery.\n  No. 6, alternative dispute resolution--this is not the most potent \npart of the bill that I can imagine--we have an alternative dispute \nresolution that avoids protracted legal battles. That is encouraged \nunder this bill. Either party can request alternative dispute \nresolution using existing State ADR procedures.\n  No. 7, one of the main provisions of this bill limits punitive \ndamages for truly small businesses (under 25 employees with $5 million \nin revenue), individuals (with incomes of $500,000 or less), and local \ngovernments. It creates a Federal standard for awarding punitive \ndamages which are reserved for the most egregious cases--clear and \nconvincing. We simply take the Federal standard, uniform standard, and \nput it, frankly, where I think most people agree it should be. The bill \nsets the limit for these punitives for small businesses to $250,000, or \ntwo times the economic and noneconomic damages. This limit means that \nbusinesses will still have to pay punitives, should that be the \njudgment of the court, but they are less likely to be bankrupted by the \ncost of the penalty. This bill does not create punitive damages in \nStates that do not permit punitive damages. That needs to be said \nclearly. If the State does not have it, this bill will not create it.\n\n  The bill includes a workplace safety incentive by affecting an \nemployer's right to recover worker compensation benefits from a \nmanufacturer whose product harms a worker if the employer's fault was a \nsubstantial cause of the injury.\n  Finally, Senator Lieberman's biomaterials access assurance bill is \nthe second title of product liability reform. I should say, in all due \ncandor, this was something that was worked out between the White House, \nSenator Lieberman, and other parties. I concentrated, as did Senator \nGorton, on the products aspect of this. Senator Lieberman did the \nbiomaterial section of that and did a very good job. The White House \nhas accepted it and it is part of the bill. This provision is designed \nto alleviate the shortage of certain biomaterials due to biomaterials \nsuppliers who are increasingly unwilling--as those who would wish to do \nbasic research--to supply products that produce very little revenue, \nbut which would have high litigation costs attached to them. It should \nensure the availability of life-saving and life-enhancing medical \ndevices.\n  Specifically, the provision will protect suppliers of biomaterials by \nallowing them to seek early dismissal from claims against a medical \ndevice manufacturer, so long as the supplier did not manufacture or \nsell the device and met its contract requirements.\n  In sum, then, Mr. President, this bill, I think, is balanced in its \ntreatment of consumers and business. Again, it is not a large bill. I \nthink it should have strong, bipartisan support.\n  I believe in the need to develop a Federal-level framework. To me, \nthe free flow of interstate commerce demands some form of a rational \nand fair approach. I think that involves, to a certain extent, Federal \nstandards. We are, after all, in a global economy, and the world has \nchanged almost totally in the last 10 years as regards to this product \nliability subject, and the need for the legislation is greater than \never.\n  I am not naive. As we head into this debate, there is long \nexperience--over a decade--of filibusters and vetoes on products \nlegislation. That is why I am so pleased that we have succeeded in \nnegotiating a new bill with the President and his team. This bill has a \nfirm commitment from the White House that it will be signed if it is \nunaltered. My colleagues do not like to hear the phrase ``if it is \nunaltered.'' The Senate does have a right to work its will, but if the \nSenate works its will and the White House is displeased, of course, \nthere will be no bill. That is a choice the Senate will have to make.\n  So to hit the highlights again--one gives this speech only once \nduring the course of debate--we would gain strong protections for \nproduct sellers, renters, lessors and suppliers; strong protections for \nbiomaterials suppliers; uniform Federal statute of limitations and \nworkplace durable goods statute of repose; uniform Federal rules on \nalcohol and drugs; uniform Federal rules on misuse or alteration; \nuniform Federal legal and evidentiary standard for punitive damages--\nthe key word being ``uniform''--strong protections for small business \nfrom punitive damage awards; States' advances on joint and several \nliability determination would remain in place; more uniform rules of \npreemption (punitive damages and statute of repose changes). And then, \nas I indicated, there are incentives to resolve litigation, although \nthey are not mighty in their nature. Nevertheless, they are there.\n  I am fully aware that some have reservations about the limited nature \nof the product liability compromise that we secured with the White \nHouse, believing that it does not go far enough. That is a view that in \nother places or at other times, perhaps, might have my concurrence. But \nwe are not in other places and in other times; we are here and now. It \nis not my view that we will move forward toward enactment of anything \nif we make changes to this bill.\n  For the Record, let me acknowledge that we will face amendments that \ngo beyond the compromise that Senator Slade Gorton and I have now \nsecured with the White House. That was true in the last attempt to move \nproduct liability reform, and it resulted in--guess what? A veto, and \nno law. Those expansions will not have my support. I will not support \nthem, and they cannot be signed into law.\n  As I have stated many times before, I don't intend to support product \nliability reform provisions for the sake of doing it, so that I can say \nI did it. I want to see a law. I want to see something come from this \nprocess after all\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\nthese years. As the Senate proceeds with debate on product liability \nreform, I sincerely hope and believe that the majority leader will take \nadvantage of what I consider to be virtually the last opportunity to \nenact limited Federal reform of our product liability laws in the \nforeseeable future.\n  Mr. President, that is all I have to say at the present time. I thank \nthe Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n\n                              (Exhibit 1)\n\n                  PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n     1. Short Title; Table of Contents.\n     2. Findings; Purposes.\n\n\n                   Title 1--Product Liability Reform\n\n     101. Definitions.\n     102. Applicability; Preemption.\n       The Act covers product liability actions brought in federal \n     or state court on any theory for harm caused by a product, \n     but excludes actions for: (i) commercial loss; (ii) negligent \n     entrustment; (iii) negligence per se concerning firearms and \n     ammunition; (iv) dram-shop; (v) harm caused by a tobacco \n     product; or (vi) harm caused by a silicone breast implant.\n       State law is superseded only to the extent it applies to a \n     matter covered by the Act. Matters not governed by the Act, \n     including the standard of liability applicable to a \n     manufacturer, continue to be governed by applicable federal \n     or state law.\n     103. Liability Rules Applicable to Product Sellers, Renters, \n         and Lessors\n       Product sellers, rentors, and lessors will be liable only \n     for their own failures and misdeeds: a product seller, rentor \n     or lessor is liable if the harm that is the subject of the \n     action was caused by (i) his failure to exercise reasonable \n     care, (ii) his intentional wrongdoing, or (iii) the product's \n     failure to conform to his express warranty; failure to \n     inspect the product will not constitute failure to exercise \n     reasonable care if there was no opportunity to inspect the \n     product or an inspection wouldn't have revealed the problem; \n     product sellers are liable as manufacturers if the \n     manufacturer is judgment-proof or not subject to service of \n     process, in which case the statute of limitations is tolled \n     until judgment is entered against the manufacturer; and \n     rentors and lessors are not liable solely by reason of \n     ownership.\n     104. Defense Based on Claimant's Use of Alcohol\n       It is a complete defense in a product liability action if \n     the claimant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol and, \n     as a result, was more than 50 percent responsible for the \n     harm.\n     105. Misuse or Alteration.\n       Damages for which a defendant is otherwise liable under \n     state or federal law are reduced in proportion to the \n     percentage of harm caused by misuse or alteration of a \n     product if such misuse or alteration was in violation of a \n     manufacturer's warning or involved a risk that was or should \n     have been known by an ordinary person who uses the product. \n     Such damages are not reduced by the percentage of harm \n     attributable to an employer who is immune from suit.\n     106. Statute of Limitations.\n       The Act creates a uniform, 2-year statute of limitations--\n     product liability claims in all states must be filed within 2 \n     years of the date the harm and the cause of the harm was, or \n     reasonably should have been, discovered.\n     107. Statute of Repose for Durable Goods Used in a Trade or \n         Business.\n       The Act creates a uniform 18-year statute of repose for \n     harm (other than toxic harm) caused by durable workplace \n     goods where the claimant has workers compensation coverage, \n     with exceptions for general aviation, transportation of \n     passengers for hire, and products with an express warranty of \n     safety of life expectancy beyond 18 years.\n     108. Transitional Provision.\n       Claimants have a full year after enactment to bring a \n     claim, regardless of the impact of the new federal statute of \n     limitations or statute of repose.\n     109. Alternative Dispute Resolution.\n       Claimants and defendants are encouraged to use voluntary, \n     non-binding ADR as available under state law.\n     110. Punitive Damages Reforms\n       Uniform Standard. The Act creates a uniform legal and \n     evidentiary standard for punitive damages--the claimant must \n     establish by clear and convincing evidence that the harm was \n     the result of conduct carried out with a conscious, flagrant \n     indifference to the rights or safety of others. Punitive \n     damages are explicitly not created in states that do not \n     otherwise allow them.\n       Bifurcation. Any party can request that punitive damages be \n     determined in a separate proceeding and that evidence \n     relevant only to the punitive damages determination not be \n     introduced in the underlying action.\n       Small Business Limit. Punitive damages awards against small \n     businesses may not exceed 2 times the amount of compensatory \n     damages or $250,000, whichever is less. Small business is \n     defined to cover entities with 25 or fewer employees and less \n     than $5 million in annual revenue. Limitation also applies to \n     local governments and individuals with net worth under \n     $500,000.\n     111. Liability for Certain Claims Relating to Death.\n       Provisions regarding punitive damages will not apply for \n     one year in states that, in wrongful death actions, permit \n     recovery only for punitive damages.\n     112. Workers Compensation Subrogation\n       An employer or insurer may lose its lien against a judgment \n     or settlement in a products liability case involving a \n     workplace accident if the employer's conduct was a \n     substantial factor in causing the claimant's harm--thereby \n     providing an incentive for safer workplaces and ensuring \n     workers receive full recovery for their injuries.\n\n\n                title ii--biomaterials access assurance\n\n       A supplier of biomaterials (component or raw materials used \n     in the manufacture of implantable devices) is permitted to \n     seek early dismissal from claims unless he (i) manufactured \n     the device; (ii) sold the device; or (iii) furnished \n     materials that failed to meet contract requirements or \n     specifications. In the event that the manufacturer or other \n     responsible party is bankrupt or judgment-proof, a supplier \n     will be brought back into the suit if there is evidence of \n     his liability. Lawsuits involving silicone gel breast \n     implants are expressly excluded.\n\n\n        title III--limitations on applicability; effective date\n\n     301. Federal Cause of Action Precluded.\n       No federal causes of action are created.\n     302. Effective Date.\n       The Act applies to all actions commenced on or after the \n     date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, in a phrase, we ought \nto ``bail this buzzard.'' This bill ought to be killed outright. It is \nnothing more than a political farce. The distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia says 10 years; it is 20 years, really. What sustains a \n20-year drive is nothing more than political polling. I was elected \nsome 50 years ago, and if I have watched a dismaying trend, it is the \nlack of really addressing the true needs of a State or the Nation, and \ninstead addressing the needs of the individual politician, as reflected \nin the political poll.\n  Now, Mr. President, right to the point. We all have heard \nShakespeare's comment that Dick the butcher calls out in Henry VI, \n``First, we must kill all the lawyers.'' That is in response to the \nintent of fomenting anarchy, imposing tyranny; and Dick the butcher, \nlike Adolf Hitler himself, wanted to get rid of the lawyers first. Dick \nthe butcher says, ``First, we must kill all the lawyers,'' because he \nknew that as long as you have lawyers standing for individual rights, \nyou cannot have anarchy; you cannot have tyranny. But ask people about \nlawyers--until they need one; just like doctors, until they need one--\nand they will say get rid of all the lawyers. And over the 20-year \nperiod, I have kept my good friend Victor Schwartz in business. Maybe \nhe will go out of business now with this jury-built nonsense called an \namendment that we only got on yesterday, and I haven't had a chance--\nthat is why I have been scurrying around here at the desk--to pick up \nthe thrust of this latest assault.\n  But back to the initial point--we have been taken over by the \npollsters.\n  Only the week before last, the House of Representatives, the most \ncentral organ of our representative government, the body that controls \nthe purse strings, voted overwhelmingly to do away with tax revenues, \nsome $970 billion--just gut the source to pay the bills--that we are \ngoing to spend and spend and spend. They use substitutes now of \nborrowing from yourself. We passed section 13301 of the Budget Act to \nforbid it. They disregard it regularly, borrowing so much from Social \nSecurity, the highway trust fund, the airport trust fund, the civil \nservice pension fund, the military retirees pension fund, and the \nFederal Financing Bank--at this point over $111 billion--to bring about \ntalks of surplus.\n  In fact, this year we are spending over $111 billion more than we are \ntaking in--a deficit, if you please. But with all of the jargon around \nand the news media coverage that is supposed to educate and illuminate \nand keep us to the truth, politicians have joined in the conspiracy. \nThey babble ``surplus, surplus''-- everywhere they call ``surplus.'' \nWell, there isn't any surplus.\n  Of course, this bill here is intended strictly to get at the \nlawyers--not as the distinguished gentleman used the expression of ``in \nthe American tradition.'' ``In the American tradition,'' Heavens above. \nThe American tradition, Mr. President, has been for the\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\nStates to regulate our torts. They have done so commendably. There \nisn't any question. All the farcical preambles--they try to really get \naway from the preambles and just some dribble about interstate \ncommerce. I use the expression ``dribble'' and otherwise, because we \nknow otherwise.\n  The reality, heavens above, is that we have a great economy and \nbooming small businesses. The National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses says small businesses are having the best of times. My staff \ncompleted a Lexis-Nexis search for small businesses that couldn't \noperate on account of product liability. You know what--they couldn't \nfind any large and serious cases against small businesses. But I \npresume during the debate this legislation's supporters will bring us \nsome, and we will see how many they bring.\n  The fact remains that there isn't a problem. But there is a political \ninterest. There is a political problem. Oh, yes. We have to say we did \nsomething--we did something to get rid of the lawyers. We showed those \nlawyers. And, as a result, they not only voted away the tax system--now \nhere on the Senate side for a nonproblem they come up and talk about \nthe American tradition whereby they ask, and the gentleman says, \n``There goes that trial lawyer crowd.'' You are right. They are the \nones who have really been keeping the system honest. They haven't \nsucceeded but in 27 percent of the product liability cases. But they \nstill, when they have the clients who have been injured, try to keep \nthe system honest. And what happens is that we have the States here--\nnot only the trial lawyers but we have the States--and the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  So I am very proud to stand here with the State legislature. Don't \ntell me about the Governors. I have been one of those, just like the \nSenator from West Virginia. And when we had Democratic Governors, then \nthey voted against this thing right on down the line. Now the \nRepublican Governors, the last time they got together and even bothered \nto take action was 6 or 7 years ago. They are not really bothered by \nit. But the State legislatures are bothered by it.\n  We have an update here of June 18, less than a month ago. Here is \nwhat they really said when this was proposed, again on this particular \nbill, before with the amendment, which is to be introduced, I take it, \nlater on. This is from the National Conference of State Legislatures:\n\n       As you know, product liability legislation, in some form, \n     may come to the Senate floor before Congress adjourns in \n     November. I urge you, on behalf of the National Conference of \n     State Legislatures, to vote against any such bill, for the \n     simple reason that this is an issue best resolved by state \n     legislatures.\n       A good deal of lip service is given today to the advantages \n     of our constitutional system of federalism and to the \n     advantages of devolving authority to the states. But, from \n     the point of view of state legislators, this rhetoric belies \n     the reality of an accelerating trend toward concentration of \n     power in Washington. Every year, Congress passes more laws \n     and federal agencies adopt more rules that preempt state \n     authority. Little consideration is given to the cumulative \n     effect of preemption piled upon preemption. Little thought is \n     given to the shrinking policy jurisdiction of state \n     legislatures.\n       Moreover, little consideration is given to whether state \n     legislatures are responsibly exercising their authority. The \n     threat to preempt state product liability law, for example, \n     comes at a time when state legislatures have been \n     particularly active in passing reform bills. As the attached \n     article from the June issue of The States' Advocate shows, \n     over the past ten years, thirty-three product liability \n     reform bills have been enacted in the states. In addition, \n     states have been reforming their tort law generally. As of \n     December 1996, 34 states had revised their rules of joint and \n     several liability and 31 had acted to curb punitive damages.\n       Just as the preemption contemplated by a national products \n     law is unprecedented, so the intrusion on the operation of \n     state courts is both unprecedented and disturbing. National \n     products standards would be grafted onto state law. In a \n     sense, Congress would act as a state legislature to amend \n     selected elements of state law, thus blurring the lines of \n     political accountability in ways that raise several Tenth \n     Amendment issues. Given the Supreme Court's recent \n     interpretation of the Tenth Amendment in Printz v. United \n     States, the legislation might even be unconstitutional.\n       Our constitutional tradition of federalism deserves more \n     than lip service. It's time to vote ``no'' on product \n     liability and similar proposals to unjustifiably preempt \n     state law.\n\n  That is from the president of the conference and the president-elect \nof the National Conference of State Legislatures, which now has been \nupdated in a letter to this Senator dated June 18, 1998.\n\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I write on behalf of the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures in opposition to S. 648, a \n     bill that would supplant state liability laws with federal \n     standards.\n       For the National Conference of State Legislatures, this is \n     a simple matter of federalism and states' rights. Tort reform \n     is an issue for state legislatures, not Congress. There is no \n     precedent for such a federal intrusion into such an important \n     area of civil law. Moreover, we regard it as highly \n     inappropriate and perhaps unconstitutional for the state \n     courts to be commandeered as instruments of federal policy in \n     the fashion contemplated by S. 648.\n       The states have made considerable progress in reforming \n     their state law, including product liability law, over the \n     past decade. State legislatures are in a good position to \n     balance the needs of the business community and those of \n     consumers, not just in the abstract but in a way that \n     reflects local values and local economic conditions. This is \n     as the Founders intended it when they established a federal \n     republic rather than a unitary state.\n       The issue then is not finding the right compromise between \n     consumer and business interests in crafting the language of \n     S. 648. The issue is whether we will take a giant step toward \n     nationalizing the civil law, to the detriment of our \n     constitutional system of Federalism. Again, please oppose S. \n     648.\n\n  That is from the Conference of State Legislatures, which, of course, \nis once again over this 20-year period bolstered by the American Bar \nAssociation in a letter dated July 1, 1998.\n\n       Dear Senator: We understand that on July 7, broad federal \n     product liability legislation will be the subject of a \n     cloture vote on the Senate floor. I am writing to you to \n     express the American Bar Association's opposition to S. 648, \n     the bill reported by the Commerce Committee, and S. 2236, the \n     compromise proposal introduced by Senators Gorton and \n     Rockefeller. The ABA believes that improvements in the tort \n     liability system should continue to be implemented at the \n     state level and not be preempted by broad Federal law.\n       S. 648 and S. 2236, which would federalize portions of tort \n     law, would deprive consumers in the United States of the \n     guidance of the well-developed product liability laws of \n     their individual states. This legislation would also deprive \n     the states of their traditional flexibility to refine \n     carefully the product liability laws through their state \n     courts and state legislatures.\n       The ABA has worked extensively to improve our civil justice \n     system, including developing extensive recommendations on \n     punitive damages and on other aspects of the tort liability \n     system for consideration at the state level. Broad federal \n     product liability legislation, however, would constitute an \n     unwise and unnecessary intrusion of major proportion on the \n     long-standing authority of the states to promulgate tort law. \n     Such preemption would cause the whole body of state tort law \n     to become unsettled and create new complexities for the \n     federal system. Unequal results would occur when product \n     liability litigation is combined with other types of law that \n     have differing rules of law. An example of this would be a \n     situation where a product liability claim is joined with a \n     medical malpractice claim. If state tort laws differ from the \n     federal law in areas such as caps on punitive damages, \n     conflicts and uncertainly would likely result; one defendant \n     in an action could well be treated entirely different than \n     another. Having one set of rules to try product liability \n     cases and another set of rules to try other tort cases is not \n     consistent with the sound and equitable administration of \n     justice.\n       The ABA opposes the product seller provisions of section \n     103 of S. 648 and S. 2236 because those provisions remove the \n     motivation of the only party with direct contact with the \n     consumer, the seller, to ensure that the shelves in American \n     businesses are stocked only with safe products. Seller \n     liability is an effective way of maintaining and improving \n     product safety. Manufacturers traditionally rely on sellers \n     to market their products. Through their purchasing and \n     marketing power, sellers have influenced manufacturers to \n     design and produce safer consumer goods.\n       Ambiguity in the language of S. 648 and S. 2236 may result \n     in unintentionally eliminating grounds for liability which \n     promote safety. For example, the two bills expressly \n     eliminate a product seller's liability for breach of warranty \n     except for breach of express warranties. This Uniform \n     Commercial Code, long regarded as a reasonable, balanced law, \n     holds sellers responsible for breach of implied warranties as \n     well. By their vague and ambiguous language, S. 648 and S. \n     2236 may result in preempting these long established grounds \n     of liability.\n       We urge you to vote no on federal product liability \n     legislation as it is an unwise and unnecessary intrusion on \n     the long-standing authority of the states to promulgate tort \n     law.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, we all know the majority crowd and how they came \nto power in 1995. The election in 1994 said that Contract sounds pretty \ngood, and\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\none of the big things about that Contract was regulation, regulation, \nregulation. They wanted to diminish regulation. Well, heavens above, as \nthey said in the American Bar Association letter, you have two bills \nexpressly eliminating a product seller's liability and thereby coming \nand taking the Uniform Commercial Code and standing it on its head.\n  So we surgically are running into the Uniform Commercial Code, tried \nand true at the State level, and you have the most complex regulatory \nmess you have ever seen. All in the attempt to diminish litigation, \nthey compound it. Oh, yes, all in essence to protect the 10th \namendment.\n  The first vote we had was the particular vote with respect to \nunfunded mandates upon the States, and what-have-you. And here is an \nunfunded mandate, constitutional mandate, if you please, because they \ndon't give a Federal cause of action. They come with an unfunded \nmandate on the States and say we know best up here in the Congress in \nthe light of the most dynamic economy we have ever seen.\n  Where is Mr. Greenspan's statement.\n\n       Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan offered a \n     decidedly upbeat assessment of the Nation's economic health \n     yesterday--\n\n  This is dated June 11--\n\n       pronouncing the current expansion ``as impressive as any I \n     have witnessed in nearly half a century of daily operation.''\n\n  Where is the small business response?\n  Let's get the rebound. This is another quote.\n\n       ``The rebound in the optimism index, coupled with other \n     national economic indicators, suggests economic growth for \n     this year will be a lot closer to last year's level than many \n     have predicted,'' said National Federation of Independent \n     Business Foundation Chief Economist William Dunkelberg.\n       Far from worrying the expansion has just about played \n     itself out, more and more small business owners feel the best \n     is yet to come.\n\n  Dunkelberg noted that, ``Small business capital investment remains \nexceptionally strong.''\n  On and on, on and on, Mr. President. There is no foundation for \nclaims that trial lawyers are undermining small business entrepreneurs. \nThat is why I say this is a political farce responding to the political \npoll. It is not responding to the needs of small business. It is not \nresponding to the needs of the States, their inability to handle \nproduct liability law. It is in response to the needs of the political \npoll and the drive of trying to get rid of trial by jury and lawyers.\n  They know, in business, they are in their heyday here, and they are \nonto a real binge here, having a wonderful time--that they can come in \nnow with this particular Congress ready to do away with the income \ntax--let's do away with the lawyers and trial by jury. Whoopee. They \nget Gallup at the White House, and the White House follows the polls \ntoo, so they get together on this jury-built thing that is really an \nembarrassment for a lawyer to read.\n  They have a statute of repose in here for the individual but not for \nthe business, so the individual injured is barred by the statute of \nrepose, but the business he is working for, they can sue for the \nparticular product and get a verdict. I never heard of a more selfish \ninstrument than that presented here, just crassly selfish, trying to do \naway with trial by juries, the States and lawyers. Pell-mell, in a \nrush, this body now just writes in such things.\n  And what about tobacco? Here we have been debating for a month one of \nthe most injurious products that everybody agrees upon. Do you know \nwhat? This bill says exempt tobacco. The unmitigated gall of the White \nHouse and these authors that write this thing--it is just unforgivable \nto come forth here, now, after 4 weeks and everybody charged up, we are \ngoing to do something about the victims of tobacco; how it is habit-\nforming and everything else of that kind, so many deaths, more than \nheart attacks, more than cancer, more than all the rest, the injury--\nthe unmitigated gall to come and have a product liability that exempts \ntobacco. You would never get my name on such a charade, a political \nfarce as this, all in the name of the political poll. Kill all the \nlawyers, that is right. Just kill all the lawyers. So we really got it.\n  Small businesses are not asking for it. The States are not asking for \nit. They are trying to force Federal law upon the States over their \nobjections. I was just amazed when the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia started talking about competition with Japan. I cannot keep \nthem out of my State. They are running all over me. We just broke \nground for Honda at Timmonsville. We just broke ground for another \ndivision of Fuji photographic equipment and the little speed cameras. \nThey make 60,000 a day. This is the fourth increment of Fuji, a $1 \nbillion investment there. There are 58 Japanese plants, 100 German \nplants--foreign competition? They are buying us up. Yet they find out \nwe cannot compete with the foreigners.\n  I make a habit of visiting these industries. We shake hands, of \ncourse, with all, if they will allow us in the plant. I went through \nthe GE plant.\n  Incidentally, they think we are nothing but textiles. Tell them keep \non thinking. We lost, since NAFTA, 24,000 textile and apparel jobs in \nSouth Carolina. Little South Carolina lost 24,000 textile and apparel \njobs. That is from the National Bureau of Labor Statistics as of the \nend of April this year. And we have had, in May-June, several other \nclosings. So that is the April figure by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. We were proud of those jobs. We hate to lose them. But we \nhave these other industries here and they are exporting like \ngangbusters.\n  I was in that GE plant. I would say of those gas turbines, almost 100 \npercent are exported. One turbine was ready for delivery at Riyadh, \nSaudi Arabia; another one was ready for delivery to Tokyo, Japan. The \nsame is true for all of these Torrington and other industries. They are \nin the context of manufacture.\n\n  I said do you have any problem here with product liability? They \nalmost--well, at Bosch they got insulted. ``What do you mean, product \nliability?'' They went over there and showed me the antilock brake that \nthey got a contract for from Mercedes, Toyota, and all of General \nMotors. They said, ``Here is a number. We know it immediately. We never \nhave had product liability. We practice safety, Senator.'' As if I had \ninsulted them with the question.\n  We have a result from these wonderful trial lawyers that nobody wants \nto talk about. We have the safest society in the entire world. Let's \ntalk about competitiveness. We have Europe. The Pacific Rim--\neconomically, competitively on the ropes. And here they want to put in \na bill to compete with Japan, and Japan is coming here and saying we \nlove it in America. The other States have always had Japanese plants \ncoming. I have yet to have one of them say I can't come because of your \nproduct liability and the litigation explosion and all, torts. What is \nall these silly expressions they have here in these preambles? Here is \nwhat they have been referring to ever since last year: that the civil \njustice system is overcrowded, sluggish, and costly.\n  Mr. President, what is the actual fact? The National Center for State \nCourts, on State civil filings, their most recent statistics show that \nproduct liability cases constitute only 4 percent of all State tort \nfilings, and a mere \\36/100\\ of 1 percent of all civil cases. \nExplosion? Come on. Where is the support? They just use this language \naround here that the distinguished Senator from Washington put in, \nthese preambles here, ``excessive, unpredictable and often arbitrary \ndamage awards.''\n  What does the Justice Department say here? In a recent report, they \nvalidate all the studies and the witnesses who appeared before our \ncommittees, and said, ``Juries nationwide have become much tougher on \nplaintiffs.'' According to the Department of Justice report, \n``Plaintiffs prevailed in only 27 percent of the product liability \ncases that were filed in Federal court between 1994 and 1995.''\n  In 1992, Professors James Henderson, a supporter of tort reform, and \nTheodore Eisenberg, of Cornell University, released a study, ``Inside \nthe Quiet Revolution in Products Liability,'' which also found \n``notable declines in the number of product liability cases filed, as \nwell as significant decreases in the size of awards.'' The study \nconcludes that:\n\n       By most measures, product liability has returned to where \n     it was at the beginning of the decade.\n\n  The study confirmed Professors Henderson and Eisenberg's findings in \nan earlier study which found:\n\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\n\n       A quiet revolution away from extending the boundaries of \n     products liability and toward placing significant limitations \n     on plaintiffs' rights to recover in tort for product-related \n     injuries.\n\n  And then the other preamble about all the punitive damages.\n  There is another study. The American Bar Foundation conducted a \nnationwide study overseen by Dr. Steven Daniels of 25,000 civil jury \nawards, and it found that punitive damages were only awarded in 4.9 \npercent of the cases reviewed. Can you imagine that, only 4.9 percent?\n  He stated that the debate over punitive damages ``changed in the \neighties as the part of an intense, well-organized and well-financed \npolitical campaign by interest groups seeking fundamental reforms in \nthe civil justice system benefiting themselves.''\n  Did you hear that?--A ``political campaign by interest groups.''\n  Then the American Bar Foundation went on to state that this \n``politicization of the punitive damages debate makes the debate more \nemotional and manipulative and less reasoned. The reformers appeal to \nemotions, fear and anxiety in this political effort, while avoiding \nreason and rational discourse.''\n  He concluded that punitive damages were not routinely awarded, were \nawarded in modest amounts, were awarded more often in financial and \nproperty harm cases than in product liability cases, which, of course, \nis like Pennzoil suing Texaco with a $12 billion award in Texas, which \nwas more than all the oil product liability verdicts given cumulatively \nsince the beginning of product liability law. Just add them all up, and \nyou will never get to $12 billion. But there it goes from the American \nBar on down.\n  I think there was one particular study that showed there were only \n350 punitive damage awards. I want to find out the exact period of \ntime. This is Professor Rustid of the Suffolk University Law School and \nProfessor Thomas Kearney of Northeastern University. The Supreme Court \nrecently referred to this report. This is our U.S. Supreme Court:\n\n       The most exhaustive study of punitive damages . . .\n\n  Professors Rustid and Kearney reviewed all product liability awards \nfrom 1965 to 1990 in both State and Federal courts. During that time, \npunitive damages were awarded in only 355 cases --355 cases. That is \nwhat we find, as a matter of Federal interest, to violate the tenth \namendment, to violate the Republican contract of trying to get \nGovernment back to the people, trying to preserve and not have unfunded \nmandates upon the States.\n  We can go on and on, Mr. President. But what really has happened--and \nit is why this Senator is somewhat disarmed because I have seen it \noccur over the past 20 years--Mr. Victor Schwartz with the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers has buddied up now with the Chamber of \nCommerce, my friend, Tom Donahue. He is a fighter, and I respect him. \nAlso, the Business Roundtable and the Conference Board, they seek out \nthe candidates before they even get here.\n  They say, ``We would like to help you, but are you for tort reform?''\n  ``Of course.''\n  With respect to the general expression ``tort reform'' and \n``torts''--``Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm for tort reform.'' So you see them \nmarching like sheep up to the voting table down in the well voting, by \ngosh, to stop debate on one of the most heinous bills that has ever \nbeen presented in the U.S. Senate, because politically they remember \ntheir campaigns and politically they were asked and politically they \nanswered, ``Yes, I'm for reform,'' and they know that if they don't \nvote that way, some opponent is going to come and say, ``Here is what \nyou said and then flip-flopped.''\n  They didn't even know the facts of the case. In essence, the jury is \nfixed. The jury is fixed, Mr. President, before I can get to them, \nbefore the National Conference of State Legislatures can get to them, \nbefore the American Bar Association can get to them, before the Supreme \nCourt citing the most exhaustive study on punitive damages can get to \nthem.\n  There are no facts to support this particular initiative. This is \njust jerry-built from the word go. They say, ``Let's remove the seller \nfrom strict liability on toxic''--by the way, they have some very \ndangerous language in here, because some of the lawyers know how to \nword this language to get rid of the Dalkon Shield cases.\n\n  Let me quote this particular finding:\n\n       The difficulty in using the toxic nature of a product as a \n     means of statutorily differentiating between products covered \n     by the statute of repose is highlighted by the following \n     scenario that occurred in an asbestos case brought against \n     Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. In their opening statement, the \n     Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.'s counsel pronounced that their \n     product, Kaylo [K-A-Y-L-O, Kaylo] an insulation product \n     containing 1.5 percent amosite and chrysotile [C-H-R-Y-S-O-T-\n     I-L-E] asbestos was not toxic. OC's counsel relied on the \n     1964 article in the Journal of the American Medical \n     Association that stated that asbestos was not considered \n     toxic because it does not produce systemic poisoning.\n\n  I can tell you right now, that is trying to get rid of the asbestosis \ncases and the Dalkon Shield cases, when they give to women $250,000 for \nthe stay-at-home mom. Where have I heard that expression, the ``stay-\nat-home mom''? Oh, they were so disturbed on tobacco for the stay-at-\nhome mom who doesn't economically win anything. I never heard of the \nhusband paying the wife a salary. Maybe that happens somewhere else. It \ndoesn't happen in South Carolina, I can tell you that.\n  So there is no economic loss. You can come in with a Dalkon Shield \ncase, be injured for life, never be able to reproduce, never have that \nfamily, and buy it off for $250,000. That is easy pickings, easy \npickings.\n  Let me tell you, Mr. President, this thing is a dangerous measure, as \nwell as a political farce. When they come out with, for example, \npunitive damages, I go back to that 1978 case. I remind my colleagues \nof the wonderful result of punitive damages.\n  In 1978, Mr. Mark Robinson in San Diego brought the Pinto case \nagainst Ford Motor Co. The verdict--the Presiding Officer is a good \ntrial lawyer--the verdict, I think, was $3.5 million actual damages and \n$125 million punitive damages.\n\n  Now, Mr. Robinson had not been able to collect a red cent of that \n$125 million, but, boy, oh, boy, hasn't that brought safety practices \ngalore, saving lives, saving injury galore over the past 20 years.\n  They had a recall; it was on the radio this morning; Ford Motor just \nrecalled--I know they recalled about 1.5 million about 2 months ago \nbecause the wheels were coming off, but they had another recall, here, \nof how many vehicles involved in this--another 11,200 recalled \nyesterday. I remember Chrysler, at the end of the year, recalled 1.5 \nmillion hatchbacks. We will get in the debate the National Safety \nTransportation Administration's statistical recalls, but recall upon \nrecall upon recall didn't impoverish the businesses but it sure made \nsafer this society in which we live.\n  I came when we were talking about toxic fumes of the Love Canal up \nthere in Buffalo, NY. We put in the Environmental Protection Agency, \nthe impact statements, and they are a matter of habit now. We look \nenvironmentally, and we have the dump costs and everything else that \nhas to take care of in this Congress, I hope before we leave. But it \nhas been a wonderful result, so that environmentally we know now that \nwe are not inhaling the fumes and otherwise on account of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  We then had the little babies burning up in the cribs--flammable \nblankets. Since my time, we have instituted a Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. At one time, J.C. Penney's took me up to their safety lab \nin New York and showed how, not just blankets, but toys and the various \nproducts that they sold, they were testing in this particular lab to \nmake sure, so they put in safety ahead of giving it to the seller and \notherwise. So we got the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  And right to tobacco. Of course, they haven't won a class action. \nThat was an individual suit down in Florida; all the rest have been \nturned aside. So when they whine on the floor of the U.S. Senate, ``Why \ncould you give this particular industry immunity from liability? Why \nare we doing this?''--because the jurors of America have given them, \ntime and time and time again, immunity. They say, look, the Congress, \nin its wisdom, has required ``smoking is dangerous to your health''\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\nnotification on every one of those packs of cigarettes. It is your \nassumption of risk. You could have stopped. More people have stopped \nsmoking than have started smoking in America this minute.\n  So the jurors, in their wisdom--but, oh, no, they want to exempt \ntobacco on the one hand here, and the cases brought by the attorneys \ngeneral and the trial lawyers have done more to save people from cancer \nthan Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler and the American Cancer Society for the \nlast 30 years that I have been up here. They really have gotten us \naware, and more people have stopped smoking, like I say, than are \nsmoking this minute in the United States of America.\n  So when we go to the hearings where we used to have an ashtray and \nthe room was clouded with smoke and my distinguished beloved former \nchairman, the Senator from Washington, Senator Magnuson, with that \ncigar right there--we don't have that anymore. But we don't have it not \non account of Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler but on account of the trial \nlawyers. They are the ones who got into the records. They are the ones \nbringing the truth out. They are the ones bringing the class action \nsuits, bringing about settlements in Florida, Mississippi, Texas, and \nMinnesota, and they continue to bring the cases.\n  They had an orderly process to end all litigation and get a \nsweetheart deal in the interest of society whereby they would advertise \nnegatively--we can't control their advertising under the first \namendment, but they agreed to it--whereby they would have a look-back \nprovision whereby we could come in and control that and fine them if \nthey didn't control it. But instead, that case now is temporarily on \nhold--tobacco--and these particular authors want to make sure that \ntobacco, the most injurious of products, is exempted from this so-\ncalled product liability bill.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this bill, \nand it is long overdue. In a way, this is a tax cut bill, because it \nwill cut the ``trial lawyer tax'' often referred to as the ``tort \ntax.''\n  The ``trial lawyer tax'' is equivalent to the amount of liability \ninsurance that people pay to protect themselves from trial lawyers. \nThey pay it because no one is safe anymore.\n  We're looking at product liability cases here, but the problem \nextends far beyond product liability, and I remain committed to broad \ncivil justice reform.\n  If any Senators think this narrow bill is sufficient, let me mention \na few recent verdicts from the tort capital of the United States, New \nYork City. I am convinced that Senators will think twice before they \nput civil justice reform on the back burner after they hear these \nhorror stories.\n  A mugger on the New York City subway who was preying on the elderly \nbecame a multimillionaire when a Manhattan jury awarded him $4.3 \nmillion for being shot as he fled from the scene of a crime. A Bronx \njury gave $500,000 to a woman who broke her toe in a pothole. Another \nBronx jury awarded $6 million to the family of a drunk who fell in \nfront of a subway train after the jury found the drunk wholly without \nfault. Another jury in a medical malpractice case awarded $27 million \nto an injured patient and another $6 million to the members of his \nfamily--even though they hadn't even sued.\n  Mr. President, let me return to the subject at hand, which is limited \nproduct liability reform. The tort system is really a ``trial lawyer \ntax'' that costs American consumers more than $132 billion per year.\n  This is a 125 percent increase over the past 10 years. In fact, \nbetween 1930 and 1994, tort costs grew four times faster than the \ngrowth rate of the economy.\n  This tort tax costs the average American consumer $616 per year. The \ncivil justice system, in effect, deputizes the trial lawyers as tax \ncollectors. Further, because they often sue under a contingent fee \narrangement, the trial lawyers are bounty hunters.\n  They all want to bag the big case--the trophy case--and raid those \n``deep pockets.''\n  The U.S. tort system is the most expensive in the world and costs 2.2 \npercent of gross domestic product.\n  This is a jobs issue, Mr. President, because tort reform is good for \neconomic development. The evidence is clear: when States pass tort \nreform, productivity increases, and employment rises. Let me offer a \nfew examples of the ``trial lawyer tax'' in action. A heart pacemaker \ncosts $18,000; $3,000 of that is the ``trial lawyer tax.'' A motorized \nwheelchair averages $1,000; $170 of that is the ``trial lawyer tax.'' A \ndoctor's fee for removing tonsils averages $578; $191 of that is the \n``trial lawyer tax.'' A two-day maternity stay averages $3,367; $500 is \nthe ``trial lawyer tax.''\n  These are the costs of the ``trial lawyer tax.'' Now let's contrast \nthat with the benefits of product liability reform.\n  Before federal legislation was enacted, production of single engine \naircraft had fallen 95 percent from the previous highs of the late \n1970s.\n  Plants were closed and more than 100,000 jobs were lost. In 1986, \nCessna Aircraft Company discontinued production of the single engine \naircraft. However, Cessna pledged that it would resume production if \nCongress passed product liability legislation to protect the general \naviation industry from the predatory practices of the trial lawyers.\n  When the Congress finally passed the General Aviation Revitalization \nAct, Cessna invested $55 million in facilities and equipment, and it \nnow employs 650 people and plans to double that number.\n  That is the choice, Mr. President, jobs or lawsuits. Money for \nworking Americans or rapacious trial lawyers. Productivity or \nlitigation.\n  I'll side with working Americans, not fat-cat trial lawyers, and I \nhope the Senate will invoke cloture on this landmark bill.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \na period of up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7526-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7534-S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JUVENILE CRIME\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Today, Senator Lieberman and I will \nhost a policy forum entitled ``The Young and the Violent: What is \nBehind the Spread of Juvenile Violence--and What Can Be Done About \nIt?''\n  The horror of the killings in Jonesboro, Arkansas; Paducah, Kentucky; \nEdinboro, Pennsylvania, Springfield, Oregon; Fayetteville, Tennessee, \namong other places, shattered forever the illusion that ``it can't \nhappen here.'' The young and the violent are found in small towns as \nwell as big cities, and their numbers, as well as their crimes, are \ngrowing.\n  We will hear today from some of the most respected criminologists in \nthe nation--as well as those who are working to transform their \ncommunities and solve their problems locally. Their insights on the \ncauses, catalysts and consequences of the spread of juvenile crime are \nhelpful in grappling with the most important questions of our time, \nnamely: why has crime risen and civility declined? How have we failed \nto civilize our children? What is happening to our national character?\n  Make no mistake, our culture has changed radically over the past few \ndecades. Since the mid-1960s, violent juvenile crime has increased more \nthan 500 percent. And even though teen violence has dropped over the \npast three years, teen murders have jumped dramatically since even the \nearly 1980s--and there is reason to believe that they will continue to \nincrease.\n  Not only have the rates and number of juvenile crimes increased, but \nthey have changed in nature as well. Juvenile crime has grown \nincreasingly predatory--where teens kill strangers for the most trivial \nof matters--a jacket, or a dirty look--or even worse, for sport.\n  Moreover, the young and the violent are found in rural and suburban \nareas, as well as the inner cities. Gangs and guns are ever more \nvisible in our schools. Fistfights begin to seem\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\nquaint by comparison. Violence that was once unthinkable now fails to \nshock. In our schools, and across the nation, we have, to borrow a \nphrase from my colleague Senator Moynihan, ``defined deviancy down.''\n  This forum seeks answers to the questions of why kids kill, why teen \nviolence is on the rise, and what can be done about it. Of course, \nthere are no easy answers. But there are a lot of contributing factors.\n  Perhaps the single most important factor is the continued breakdown \nof the American family. Today, almost a third of all children are born \nout of wedlock. Around half of all children will live in a broken home \nbefore they turn 18. Tens of millions of little boys and girls will \ngrow up without a loving and committed father.\n  There are other cultural warning signs. Popular entertainment \ncontinues to glamorize violence. Movies and computer games grow ever \nmore gory and grisly. Chart-topping songs feature lyrics celebrating \ntorture, rape, and murder.\n  Glorifying violence in popular entertainment--whether it be music, or \nmovies, or video games--is dangerous. It is dangerous because a society \nthat glorifies violence will grow more violent.\n  We had a hearing recently on the issue of music lyrics. One person \nmade the point along this line and said that if John Philip Sousa's \nmusic makes us feel patriotic, and if other music, like Frank \nSinatra's, makes us feel romantic, what does music that is violent make \nus feel? If it is hateful, if it is anti-women, if it is oriented \ntowards death and destruction, we think that is going to make us feel \nthat way--that music will just wrap around your soul and cause some \ndistortions to take place.\n\n  But most importantly, this discussion will focus on ways to prevent, \ncurtail, and combat teen violence--whether on the Congressional, state, \nlocal, or societal level.\n  I hope that we will gain insight not only on the proper government \npolicies to deter and combat crime, but also on non-governmental \ninitiatives--including those by churches, faith-based organizations, \nand charities--that have reached out to troubled youth, and succeeded \nwhere government has failed.\n  One of the great things about our nation is that for each of our \nproblems, there are people who are living and working the solution. In \nchurches, youth groups, schools, charities, and families across the \nnation, miracles are every day taking place. These groups show what is \npossible by what is actual--that is, their real-life success stories \nshould inspire us with the possibilities.\n  We in Congress need to enact wise and prudent crime-fighting \npolicies. But we also need to allow these small, often faith-based \ngroups to touch the souls and transform the lives of those in need.\n  Mr. President, I know that you, as the Presiding Officer and a \nSenator in this body, know full well the problems that we are facing in \nthis culture and in this society, and the increase in the violent \nnature of what is happening here. We are all troubled and very \nperplexed by it.\n  What we are hoping with this discussion and policy forum that Senator \nLieberman and I have today is that we will be able to begin the \nnational dialog--actually not only begin but continue the national \ndialog--about what each of us can do now to become a more civilized \ncountry to stop the violence from growing.\n  Abe Lincoln made a point that the United States frequently is a \nnation that moves to a common thought. I think today we have decided we \nhave focused in on saying this is a major problem. Youth violence is a \nmajor problem. What can each of us in our individual capacities and our \ncapacities in this body, or in other places--in our communities and \nhomes, in our churches and synagogues--do to solve this problem?\n  That is what we are going to focus on today--some of the individual \nsolutions that have taken place, what are appropriate governmental \npolicies. But, more importantly, let's get to the common thought on how \nto start solving this growing problem in America.\n  I invite my colleagues to tune in to this policy forum that we will \nhave starting today at 2:30. I hope some of them will be willing to \njoin us and follow the subsequent proceedings as we pick up this debate \nand try to carry it on forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsession be put into recess until after the caucuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that request?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I withdraw the request.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I noticed we were in a quorum call. I was \ngoing to mention a situation that we have today that we may want to \nthink about as we consider moving to proceed. Tonight much of America \nis going to observe a midsummer tradition, the major league baseball \nAll-Star Game.\n  A number of teams are having outstanding seasons, including the New \nYork Yankees, Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres. Adding special \ninterest to this season is the possibility that the single-season \nrecords for home runs and runs batted in may be broken.\n  Now, when Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle were chasing the home run \nrecord in 1961, they finished the first half of the season at 33 and 28 \nhomers, respectively. At this year's All-Star break, Mark McGwire \nalready has 37 homers, Ken Griffey, Jr., 35, and Sammy Sosa 33, as they \nhead toward Maris' record of 61.\n  Some may recall from baseball history what Babe Ruth said when he was \nasked about his $80,000 contract for 1930--it was 10 years before I was \nborn--and at the time it was the highest salary ever agreed to be paid \nto a baseball player. In a response to a reporter's comment that he was \nearning more money than the President of the United States, the Babe \nremarked, ``Why not? I had a better year than he did.''\n  So, too, when the American people consider how the Senate is meeting \nits responsibilities with respect to judicial vacancies, we are going \nto have to conclude that Mark McGwire is having a better year than the \nSenate. In light of the All-Star Game being played tonight, let us \ncompare the Senate's pace in confirming much-needed Federal judges to \nMark McGwire's home run pace. The Senate got off to an early lead this \nyear. From January through the end of April, the Senate confirmed 22 \njudges. The Senate's pace, though, slowed in May. We have not been able \nto generate any real momentum through the spring and early summer. The \nnumber of Federal judges confirmed all year is only 33.\n\n  Of course, the Senate's early lead on McGwire started to vanish once \nthe baseball season started on March 31, which happens to be my \nbirthday. It took ``Big Mac'' only 10 weeks to match the Senate's \ntotal. By June 8 he had caught and passed the Senate's total and he has \nbeen looking back at us ever since. McGwire is on a pace to shatter \nMaris' record and total 70 home runs in a single season.\n  You can see on my chart: July--judges confirmed by the Senate, 33; \nMcGwire's home runs, 37; October projections--for the Senate only 51; \nbut for McGwire, 70.\n\n[[Page S7536]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the Senate is nowhere near a record pace. As recently \nas 1994--coincidentally, the last year in which the Senate majority was \nDemocrats--the Senate confirmed 101 judges. It has taken the Republican \nSenate three years to reach the century mark and to do what a \nDemocratic Senate was able to achieve in a single session.\n  As Chief Justice Rehnquist--and I have no idea if like Justice \nBlackmun, he is a baseball fan or not--but he correctly observed: ``The \nSenate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the \n101 judges it confirmed in 1994.''\n  This chart also shows you where the Senate is today as compared to \nour total of judges confirmed in 1994, when we had confirmed 44 judges \nin July on our way to 101 confirmations. That out paced even Mark \nMcGwire. Here again are our October projections: Judges confirmed at \nthe current pace, probably around 51. I think Mark McGwire is on a pace \nto get 70. And, of course, the Congress, when last controlled by the \nDemocrats confirmed 101.\n  I hope that some think about this when we are watching the All-Star \nGame tonight. Would not the Senate be more productive if we could do \njust a little more and get a bit closer to the pace being set by some \nof our favorite baseball players? We are supposed to be the stars of \nthe legislative firmament, but we certainly aren't All-Stars when it \ncomes to this.\n  We began this year with the criticism of the Chief Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court ringing in our ears: ``Vacancies cannot remain at \nsuch high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice \nthat traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.''\n  Both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have had to cancel \nhearings over the past couple of years due to judicial vacancies. Chief \nJudge Winter of the Second Circuit has had to declare a circuit \nemergency and to proceed with only one circuit judge on their three-\njudge panels.\n  In response to the criticism of the Chief Justice, the Republican \nleadership has argued that the Senate is on a steady course and making \nsteady progress. So was the Titanic as it headed towards the icebergs. \nIt was only in the last 9 weeks of the last session that the Senate \nachieved any real progress. In that period, in conjunction with the \nPresident's national radio address on the crisis, the Senate confirmed \n27 judges in 9 weeks.\n  I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace. \nInstead, we confirmed only 33 judicial nominees in 18 weeks in session \ninstead of the 54 we would have confirmed if we had maintained last \nyear's pace.\n  I have reissued my challenge for the last 10 weeks in session, which \nare all that remain to the Senate this entire year. We can confirm \nanother 30 nominees by the end of the session if the Senate will work \nat the pace it achieved at the end of last year.\n  We have held only seven judicial nomination hearings all year. I \nrecall in 1994, the most recent year in which the Democrats constituted \nthe majority, the Judiciary Committee held 25 judicial confirmation \nhearings, including hearings to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, which \nautomatically take far, far more time than others. That is 25 hearings \nas compared with seven.\n  They had no vacancy on the Supreme Court this year, but nine of the \ncurrent nominees for the courts of appeals need their hearings and they \nneed them promptly. We have 25 currently pending nominees to the \ndistrict courts, and only one of those is less than 30 days old.\n\n  We should not tolerate upwards of 73 vacancies in the Federal courts, \nwith more on the horizon. Almost one in 10 judgeships remains unfilled, \nand from the looks of things, they are going to remain unfilled into \nthe future. The Judiciary Committee needs to do a better job, and the \nSenate needs to proceed more promptly and to consider nominees reported \nto it.\n  The nomination held the longest on the Senate calendar is Judge Sonia \nSotomayor for a critical vacancy in the Second Circuit. I have already \nmentioned that in that circuit, which is my own, the Chief Judge has \ndeclared an emergency situation. Chief Judge Winter recently issued his \nannual report in which he notes that the court now has the greatest \nbacklog it ever had.\n  Ironically, it was Judge Sotomayor who issued a key decision in 1995 \nthat brought an end to the work stoppage in major league baseball. How \nwonderful it would be if today, at the time of this year's All-Star \nGame, the Senate would end its work stoppage with respect to her \nnomination and proceed to consider and confirm her.\n  This brings me back to the All-Star Game, Mr. President. We will \napplaud these outstanding players and we will cheer the baseball teams \nrepresented. As a New Englander, I historically applaud the Red Sox, no \nmatter how they do--although they had a pretty good first half. Every \none of us has favorite players and teams. We stick with them even when \nthey fall behind. But none of these teams has fallen as far behind \nwhere they should be as the U.S. Senate has, none has been so \ndisappointing.\n  Let us try harder. Let us try to confirm at least as many judges as \nMark McGwire is going to hit home runs. If we do not want to use the \nConstitution as an inspiration, if we do not want to use judicial \nvacancies and the harm they cause as an inspiration, if we do not want \nto use the potential collapse of the Federal judicial system as an \ninspiration, maybe some can take inspiration from America's pastime and \nsay, ``If Mark McGwire can do it, so can the U.S. Senate.''\n  We have not yet, but hope springs eternal. Let us take his effort and \ncommitment as inspiration. Let us not keep hitting foul balls. Let the \nSenate hit a home run now and then. It would be a home run for the \nAmerican people if the Senate stopped holding the Federal judiciary \nhostage. We should help fill these vacancies. Let's do it.\n  We have 45 judicial nominations pending, some of whom were first \nreceived over three years ago. There are currently nine qualified \nnominees on the Senate calendar who have been reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  In addition, there are 36 nominees pending before the Judiciary \nCommittee and more nominees are being received from the President every \nweek. I hope that the Committee will schedule prompt hearings for each \nof the judicial nominees currently pending in Committee and for the \nnominees we expect to be receiving over the next several weeks so that \nthey may have an opportunity to be considered by the Committee and \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  At the conclusion of the debate on the nomination of Merrick Garland \nto the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as \n23 Republicans were preparing to vote against that exceptionally well-\nqualified nominee whose confirmation had been delayed 18 months, \nSenator Hatch said ``playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am \nsick of it.'' I agree with him. I look forward to a return to the days \nwhen judicial nominations are treated with the respect and attention \nthat they deserve.\n  I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky \nnominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1994 \nand 1995 judicial nominees took on average 86 or 87 days from \nnomination to confirmation. In 1996, that number rose to a record 183 \ndays on average. Some would discount that number because it was a \npresidential election year, but even they cannot ignore that it \nshattered the previous record.\n\n  Last year, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation \nrose dramatically yet again, and this in the first year of a \npresidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average \ntime it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke \nthe 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. \nUnfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still \nrising to the detriment of the administration of justice. The average \ntime from nomination to confirmation is now over 260 days. That is \nthree times the time it took before this partisan slowdown began in \nearnest.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the \nnumber of judicial vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in \nthe federal judiciary.''\n  I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the \nPresident's judicial nominations to reconsider and work to fulfil this \nconstitutional responsibility. Those who delay\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\nor prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are \ndelaying or preventing the administration of justice. Courts cannot try \ncases, incarcerate the guilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.\n  The Republican Senate leadership seems to be operating under several \nfalse assumptions. As recently as June 22, they have stated that there \nis no problem with the scores of longstanding judicial vacancies \nbecause the federal judiciary has 767 active judges, which are more \nthan the number of active judges sitting during the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations.\n  Unfortunately, their statement fails to consider the enormous growth \nin the workload of the federal courts over the last two decades. The \nfederal judiciary's workload was at least 60 percent lower than it is \ntoday when the Reagan-Bush administrations took office. The federal \ncourt's criminal docket alone is up from 28,921 cases in 1980 to 50,363 \nlast year. That is an increase of over 70 percent in the criminal case \nfilings in the federal courts.\n  Moreover, if the Republicans have their way, this Congress will add \nmore and more cases to the federal courts' workload. Among their \npriorities are a products liability bill, a so-called ``takings'' bill \nand a version of a juvenile crime bill that each federalizes huge \nportions of what have traditionally been cases handled through state \ncourts.\n  In recognition of the growing federal court workload, Congress \nauthorized an additional 85 authorized judgeships back in 1984. The \nvacancies were then filed without delay by Congress, including the \n100th Congress in which there was a Democratic majority. Indeed, in \n1987 and 1988, the last two years of the Reagan administration, a \nDemocratic Senate confirmed 96 judges, leaving only 23 vacancies at the \nend of that Congress.\n  In 1990, a Democratic Congress created 85 additional judgeships \nduring the Bush administration. That brought an anomalous spike in the \nvacancy numbers. During the 102nd Congress, in 1991 and 1992, the last \ntwo years of the Bush administration, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunder the chairmanship of a Democrat, held 30 confirmation hearings and \nthe Democratic Senate confirmed 124 Bush nominees to the federal bench. \nIn fact, in 1992, during President Bush's last year in office a \nDemocratic Senate confirmed 66 of his nominations.\n  Thus, during the Reagan and Bush years, both Democratic and \nRepublican Senates not only promptly considered and confirmed judges \nbut also authorized 167 new judgeships in response to the increasing \nworkload of the federal judiciary. Authorized judgeships have increased \nin number by 25 percent since 1980 while the workload of the federal \ncourts has grown by over 60 percent during the same period. That is why \nthe prolonged vacancies being perpetuated by delays in the confirmation \nprocess are creating such strains within the federal courts.\n  Presidents Reagan and Bush were able to appoint 579 federal judges, \nincluding 291 confirmed by a Democratic Senate from 1987 through 1992. \nIn the last two years of the Bush administration, 1991 and 1992, a \nDemocratic Senate held 30 hearings and confirmed 124 judges nominated \nby a President of the other party, with 66 coming in 1992, a \npresidential election year.\n\n  When Republicans note that President Clinton has appointed 273 \nfederal judges over the past six years, they invariably fail to mention \nthat 129 of these nominees were confirmed by a Democratic Senate in \n1993 and 1994. Over the past four years, Republican have confirmed a \ntotal of fewer than 145 federal judges, during a time in which the \njudicial vacancy rate has continued to hover between 70 and 110 \nlongstanding vacancies and the workload of federal courts continues to \ngrow.\n  So unlike other periods in which judicial vacancies could be \nattributed to newly-created judgeships, during the past four years the \nvacancies crisis has been created by the Senate's failure to move \nquickly to consider nominees to longstanding vacancies.\n  Republicans also suggest that maintaining as many as 60 vacancies is \n``virtually full employment'' on the federal bench. I disagree. In the \nearly and mid-1980's, vacancies were between 25 and 34 at the beginning \nof each session of Congress. By the fall of 1983, the vacancies for the \nentire federal judiciary had been reduced to only 16.\n  With attrition and the 85 new judgeships created in 1984, vacancies \nreached 123 at the beginning of President Reagan's second term, but \nthose vacancies were reduced to only 33 within two years, by the fall \nof 1986. A Democratic Senate in 1987 and 1988 reduced the vacancies \nstill further to only 23 at the end of the 100th Congress.\n  It was not until the additional judges were created in 1990 that the \nnext significant spike in vacancies occurred and then, again, the \nDemocratic Senate responsibly set about the task of helping fill those \nvacancies with qualified nominees. Although President Bush was \nnotoriously slow to nominate, the Democratic Senate confirmed 124 \nnominees in President Bush's last two years and cut the vacancies in \nhalf.\n  Republicans also contend, erroneously, that the Clinton \nadministration has stated that 63 vacancies is acceptable and \n``virtually full employment.'' They misinterpret a press release from \nOctober 1994. That press release was pointing out that if the Senate \nhad proceeded to confirm the 14 nominees then on the Senate calendar it \nwould have brought the total judges confirmed during President \nClinton's first two years to over 140 and would have reduced the \njudicial vacancy rate to 4.7 percent, which the press release then \nproceeded to compare to a favorable unemployment rate of under 5 \npercent.\n  This was not a statement of administration position or even a policy \nstatement but a poorly designed press release that included an ill-\nconceived. Job vacancy rates and unemployment rates are not comparable. \nJudicial vacancy rates have significance beyond general unemployment \nstatistics.\n  When I learned that some Republicans had for partisan purposes seized \nupon this press release, taken it out of context, ignored what the \npress release actually said and were manipulating it into a \nmisstatement of Clinton administration policy, I asked the Attorney \nGeneral, in 1997, whether there was any level or percentage of judicial \nvacancies that the administration considered acceptable or equal to \n``full employment.''\n  The Department responded:\n\n       There is no level or percentage of vacancies that justifies \n     a slow down in the Senate on the confirmation of nominees for \n     judicial positions. While the Department did once, in the \n     fall of 1994, characterize a 4.7 percent vacancy rate in the \n     federal judiciary as the equivalent of the Department of \n     Labor `full employment' standard, that characterization was \n     intended simply to emphasize the hard work and productivity \n     of the Administration and the Senate in reducing the \n     extraordinary number of vacancies in the federal Article III \n     judiciary in 1993 and 1994. Of course, there is a certain \n     small vacancy rate, due to retirements and deaths and the \n     time required by the appointment process, that will always \n     exist. The current vacancy rate is 11.3 percent. It did reach \n     12 percent this past summer. The President and the Senate \n     should continually be working diligently to fill vacancies as \n     they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent \n     capacity for the federal bench.\n  At no time has the Clinton administration stated that it believes \nthat 60 vacancies on the federal bench is acceptable or a virtually \nfull federal bench. Only Republicans have expressed that opinion. As \nthe Department noted last year, the Senate should be ``working \ndiligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to \nreach 100 percent capacity for the federal bench.''\n  With respect to the question of vacancies, it is also important to \nnote that in 1997 the Judiciary Conference of the United States \nrequested an additional 53 judgeships be created and the Republican \nCongress has refused to consider that workload justified request. My \nbill to meet that request, S.678, the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, \nhas received no attention since I introduced it over a year ago. Had \nthose additional judgeships been created, as they were in 1984 and 1990 \nunder Republican Presidents, current judicial vacancies would number \n123 and total almost 14 percent of the federal judiciary.\n  I hope that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate will proceed to \nconsider and confirm judicial nominees more promptly and without the \nmonths of delay that now accompany so many nominations. I hope the \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S7538]]\n\nwill not delay in scheduling the additional hearings we need to hold to \nconsider the fine men and women whom the President has nominated to \nfill these important positions.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this will be the eighth year that I have \nstood here and debated whether or not America should go forward with a \nspace station. I didn't like the idea of the Space Station Freedom, but \nit was probably a bargain compared to what the International Space \nStation is turning out to be.\n  First, I would like to pose a question to my colleagues: Why is it \nthat we continue to fund a program called the International Space \nStation, when every cellular biologist, every medical researcher, and \nevery physicist in America who isn't involved in the program itself is \nvehemently opposed to it? These are some of the most brilliant people \nin America. Before we start off spending $100 billion, we ought to ask \nourselves, Why are they opposed? Well, for very good reasons, and I \nwill come back to those in just a minute.\n  It is a mystery that here in Congress we talk seriously about a \nprogram which in the last 3 years has become almost laughable. If it \nweren't so serious and the amount of money so enormous, it would be \nalmost a comedy--a comedy of errors.\n  The cost began to spiral in 1996--maybe before that, but that was the \nfirst time we really knew it. The Russians have had space stations up \nfor almost 30 years. The Mir is the seventh space station that the \nRussians have had up since 1971. And what do they have to show for it? \nAbsolutely nothing.\n  In a little while, I will come back and quote some of the top Nobel \nPrize winners, some of the top physicists in America, cellular \nbiologists--you name it. I will come back and quote several of them and \nwhat they have had to say about the space station as a research \nvehicle.\n  Now, you should bear in mind throughout this debate that when you \ntalk about research on the space station, there is only one reason--one \nreason--you have to believe that the kind of research we are going to \ndo, which NASA says will cure ingrown toenails, warts, cancer, sties--\nit will cure everything--you have to believe that research of whatever \nkind--mostly medical, and some of it molecular biology--but you have to \nbelieve that something happens in a microgravity situation that you \ncan't emulate on earth, and not only is something going to happen in a \nmicrogravity situation, but it is going to be good. Again, I will come \nback to what the top scientists in this country have to say about it. \nBut right now I will quote Professor Bloembergen, who is a top \nphysicist at Harvard University. When he was President of the American \nPhysical Society, which consists of 40,000 physicists, and, he summed \nit up when he said, ``microgravity is of micro importance.''\n  John Glenn came to the Senate with me. We developed a warm friendship \nthe first day we met and we have remained friends. I consider him one \nof my dearest friends, except when I bring this amendment up. But \nSenator Glenn is not going to deny that about all you get out of this \nis whatever you can get from microgravity research that can be emulated \non earth; but there is no need to emulate it on earth. You are going to \nhear all this business about gallium arsenide crystals, which is \n``bunk.'' Even if you could build crystals on the space station, nobody \non earth could afford to use them.\n  Well, Mr. President, why are all these people opposed? Why are the \ntop people on whom we rely for all of our medical research, cellular \nresearch--the top scientists in America--why are they outraged by \nspending $100 billion on one orbiting space station with a crew of, at \nfirst three people, and subsequently six or seven people? Why are they \noutraged? Well, one reason might be that they come up here pleading for \nmoney for honest-to-God research every year, and we give them a few \nshekels and off they go to do the best they can with it.\n  Think about the National Institutes of Health getting about $13 \nbillion a year, and they do research on everything--honest research. \nThey send out money to every university in the country that has a \nmedical school to do research. Well, if we ever get this thing in \nspace, just the annual operating cost will be enough to fund 6,000 \nresearchers at NIH and universities across America for a year. We are \ngoing to have six people on the space station doing what the National \nResearch Council estimates to be 24 hours of research each day, at a \ncost at which we could hire 6,000 researchers on earth.\n  Do you want to hear another one? Once we get it deployed, we are \ngoing to leave it in space for 10 years. You multiply the man-hours by \n10 years that we are going to get in research, and if you don't just \ndivide the annual operating costs, which, as I said a moment ago, would \nproduce 6,000 researchers on earth, but divide it into the entire $100 \nbillion cost, which is a legitimate thing to do because, after all, we \nare spending $100 billion to put the space station up and do research--\nwhether you are going to build crystals or cure ingrown toenails, it is \nall research. But when you do that, the cost\n\n[[Page S7539]]\n\nof each man-hour of research on the space station is $11.5 million per \nhour.\n  Now, if that doesn't stagger people, what would? Here we starve the \nNational Institutes of Health, we starve the Food and Drug \nAdministration, we starve the Centers for Disease Control, and we are \nembarking on a program that will cost $100 billion, which translates \ninto $11.5 million for every hour of research that will be done on that \nthing over a 10-year period. So can you see why I raise my voice? I \ncan't believe it. It is so patently absurd and outrageous. And the \nordinary layman in America thinks the space station is a pretty good \nidea. The Russians did it, why shouldn't we?\n  But let's go to the original promises. Mr. President, not only are \nall of the scientists in America opposed to it, I will give you another \nreason that Congress ought to be opposed to it. It is because we have \njust had one broken promise after another from NASA. My good friend \nfrom Ohio has heard me say this many times. Let me get this off my \nconscience right now. I believe in NASA and I believe in the space \nprogram. I thought the Mars Pathfinder Program was wonderful. We sent \nan unmanned rover to Mars, and it took magnificent pictures and sent \nthem back to earth. It gave us a much, much better comprehension, for \nwhatever it may be worth, of what is on Mars. So I want everybody to \nunderstand that this is not an anti-NASA speech or amendment; this is \nan antispace station amendment.\n  In September 1993, there was a solemn promise that was made to \nCongress and, therefore, to the American people. This is what a \nbriefing paper on NASA's Web site says:\n\n       In September 1993, a program implementation program called \n     PIP had been developed in the baseline for the new \n     International Space Station. The plan was coordinated with \n     and agreed to by all existing partners. Based on this PIP, \n     NASA reached agreement with the Clinton administration and \n     with Congress that the International Space Station would be \n     implemented with a flat budget of $2.1 billion a year.\n\n  Let me indelibly ingrain that on your brain. NASA said we will do \nthis for $2.1 billion a year.\n  And we will build it. Bear in mind, there are three stages: Building \nit, deploying it, and operating it. The NASA briefing paper goes on to \nsay:\n\n       NASA promised that the program would remain on schedule and \n     within the annual $2.1 billion and the runout $17.4 billion \n     budget and that no additional funds will be sought. In \n     exchange the program will be required to redesign and rescope \n     the station.\n\n  A solemn promise of $2.1 billion. But, as they say, something \nhappened on the way to the forum. We are now up to $98 billion-plus and \nheading north.\n  They also promised us that this thing would be finished by June of \n2002. Again, something happened on the way to the forum. I will come \nback to that in just a moment.\n  But we should have noticed back in 1996. If we had been paying \nattention in 1996, we would have known that something was happening. \nPrecisely what was happening was, NASA transferred $235 billion from \nother programs within NASA to the space station. They did that with the \napproval of the appropriate committees of Congress here. I assume it \nwas the Commerce and Appropriations Committees. But what else did they \ndo? They then changed their accounting system so they could transfer \nanother $100 million over to the space station. That $300 million \ndidn't count against the $17.4 billion that the cost of this thing was \nsupposed to be. It didn't count against the $2.1 billion they promised \nthey would use every year and not ask for more.\n  In 1997, guess what. The same song, second verse. In 1997, they \ntransferred $200 million from the shuttle program to the space station \nbecause they had decided that Russia was not going to be able to come \nthrough with its part of the bargain their very first component--\nbuilding the service module. They decided they might have to build it. \nSo they transferred $200 million from the shuttle program to build what \nthey call an interim control module. Then they again transferred $100 \nmillion from other accounts--mostly scientific accounts.\n  So we are not going to get as much science as we planned, because \nthey have already taken $100 million of that out, and this $300 million \ndid not count against the annual $2.1 billion appropriations.\n  Then in a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee last year--I \nthink it was in May--Boeing, the prime contractor, and NASA both \nappeared before the Senate Commerce Committee. Boeing said, in a rare \nadmission, that it their part of the program was going to cost $600 \nmillion more than we anticipated. That didn't include the $600 million \nthat had already been transferred by NASA from other accounts. NASA \nsaid that is true. But in that same hearing, they said the figure was \nnot going to be $600 million in cost overrun, it would be $817 million. \nThey also said in 1998 that they are going to need still another $430 \nmillion extra.\n  I mean we are getting bombarded by transfers from other accounts, \ntransfers with and without the permission of Congress, admitted cost \noverruns of $817 million on top of that. And we are going to need \nanother $430 million in 1998.\n  So, Mr. President, the thing is beginning to sort of roll out of \ncontrol. And Dan Goldin, Administrator of NASA, takes the extra \nprecaution, with, I think, a little prodding by Congress, to appoint a \ntask force to look into this whole thing. He made Jay Chabrow, one of \nthe premier space technology analysts in America, chairman of what is \ncalled the Chabrow Commission. They were formulated, I think, and \nappointed in September and went to work in November. And on April 15, \n1998, they came back to the Congress and to NASA and said that the \n$21.3 billion that NASA admitted the station would cost in its FY 1999 \nbudget was not enough. I should have mentioned that before. In their \nbudget for 1999 NASA admitted that the space station was not going to \ncost $17.4 but, rather, $21.3 billion. They wish.\n  Jay Chabrow, in whom Dan Goldin obviously put a great deal of \nconfidence, comes back and says, ``Would you believe $24.7 billion?'' \nThat is a $7.3 billion overrun--43 percent--just to build it on the \nground before we have put the first piece of hardware in space. Chabrow \nwent ahead to say you are not going to finish it in the year 2002. It \nis going to take 10 to 38 months longer to deploy the space station \nthan you have been admitted, more likely 2 years. So, instead of the \nyear 2003, it is going to be finished in late 2005, or early 2006 at \nbest.\n  Do you know what those kinds of delays mean in a program like this? \nBillions. If this had been anybody other than somebody like Jay \nChabrow, with the credibility and reputation he has, everybody could \nhave swatted it like a fly. But you cannot ignore this prestigious \ncommission.\n  Do you know what else? The Chabrow Commission went ahead to say this \n$7.3 billion overrun assumes that the Russians, our big partner in the \nspace station, will perform on time.\n  Mr. President, let's go to the next stage, deploying the space \nstation. It is going to take, according to the latest figures from \nNASA, about 83 launches to deploy it. That means taking all of these \nparts into space over the period of the next 63 months, putting them \ntogether in space, and becoming what we call the International Space \nStation. When Jay Chabrow's commission said the cost overrun is going \nto be $7.3 billion, he went ahead to say ``if the Russians fulfill \ntheir part of this bargain.'' The Russians were scheduled to deploy the \nservice module--a very important element in the space station--April \n1998. Then it was going to be December 1998. Now we are up to April \n1999.\n  Do you know what those delays do? They cost billions.\n  Do you know something else? Colleagues, let me ask you. Do you think \nthe Russians can fulfill their part of this program? The Russians, who \njust barely have enough money to get a rescue team up to the Mir and \nrescue them, and whose electricity has been cut off at their primary \ncosmodrome at Baikonur. The electricity has been cut off because they \nwon't pay their bills, and the reason they don't pay their bills is \nthat they do not have the money. The reason they don't have the money \nis that the central government doesn't have the money to send to the \nRussian Space Agency.\n  The Russians are our partners. I feel sorry for them. This statement \nis not intended to condemn the Russians. But to think that we are \ngambling $100 billion on assuming that the Russians will provide 49 of \nthe 83 launches it is going to take to put this thing in orbit.\n\n[[Page S7540]]\n\n We are depending on the Russians to do that? Do you remember when the \nVice President went over to talk to Chernomyrdin and Chernomyrdin told \nthe Vice President not to worry, that the money is going to be coming?\n  The money did not come. The money has not come.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is one admission I want to make right now. \nI would tell Daniel Goldin and the administration at NASA, forget \nRussia. I don't know what it is going to cost for the United States to \nassume its share of this burden, but whatever it is will be less than \nwaiting for them to perform. They cannot perform. It is sad, and I am \nsorry, but the Russians are not going to be able to hold up their share \nof the bargain.\n  The European Space Agency--I think there are 14 countries in the \nEuropean Space Agency--is in this, and you are going to hear all these \nloud laments: We can't quit now; it is an international project.\n  It is an international project with the United States putting up $100 \nbillion and everybody else putting up $15 billion. The French are \nmembers of the European Space Agency. They have a very clever Space \nMinister, Claude Allegre. Do you know what he said? ``It is time to get \nout. This was a mistake.'' He went ahead to say, ``People often do \nstupid things. There is no rule that says we have to applaud them.''\n  They are in for 27 percent of the European Space Agency's share, \nwhich is around $9 billion to $10 billion, and they want out. They do \nnot want to hear all these patriotic songs on the Senate floor about \nhow this international cooperation is just wonderful. They want to save \ntheir 27 percent and get out while the getting is good. And as Claude \nAllegre, the Space Minister, said, ``I have never seen any research \nthat would justify this kind of expenditure.''\n  Mr. President, some studies have been done which indicate that even \nif Russia could perform right on time, out of those 83 launches, 5 of \nthe Russian launches could be failures under the best of \ncircumstances--5 of those launches would be failures and 1 United \nStates launch would be a failure.\n  In addition there will be launch delays. You have a 5-minute window. \nSenator Glenn is familiar with all of this. You have a 5-minute window \nto launch those things. If you don't do it in the 5 minutes, Lord knows \nhow long you have to wait. To assume that 83 launches to just get this \nthing into orbit are going to go off without a hitch, without a flaw, \nis naive and simplistic in the extreme.\n  Going back to NASA's promises, in 1993, they said that in order to \nassemble this thing in space, it is going to require our astronauts to \nengage in what they called ``extravehicular activity,'' space walks for \nshort, and it will take 434 man-hours, 434 man-hours of space walking \nto assemble this thing.\n  In 1995, they said, no, it is going to take 888, a little over twice \nas many as we first said. In 1996, they said, no, it is going to take \n1,104 hours of space walking. In 1997, in April, they said, no, it is \ngoing to take 1,520 hours. And in December of 1997, they said, no, it \nis going to take 1,729 hours. There is a nice, solid 400-percent \nincrease or, if you choose, a 400-percent mistake.\n  Mr. President, we ought to expect something as a return on our \ninvestment. We send our children and grandchildren, our most precious \npossessions, off to school every morning. All of us got teary-eyed as \nwe sent our children off to school the first time. And incidentally, we \nsent them for 7 or 8 hours that day to be with a teacher who was going \nto have almost as much, and possibly more, influence on that child than \nthe parents.\n  How many debates have you heard in this Chamber about how the school \nbuildings in this country are deteriorating? And how many debates have \nyou heard about how we have to lower the size of the classes? \nIncidentally, that is a lot bigger issue. I haven't had any children in \nschool in some time. I have grandchildren, and one of my daughters-in-\nlaw told me the other day my grandson was in a class with 34 students, \nand that is not extraordinary; that is fairly common, even though every \neducator will tell you anytime a classroom is bigger than 20 students, \nthe chances of that child getting a decent education go down \ndramatically. Twenty is the optimum size for classrooms. So we wail \nendlessly on the floor of the Senate about our commitment to the \neducation of these children, to teachers. That teacher to whom we send \nour child off to be with 7, 8 hours a day in my State, his or her entry \nlevel salary is in the $20- to $25,000 range.\n  Just as an aside--this doesn't cost anybody anything-- if I were \nPresident Clinton, I would tell the American people I hope to raise \nteacher's salaries to $50,000 a year. I married a schoolteacher, and I \ncan tell you categorically it is the roughest, toughest job in America. \nI would work for the Washington sanitation department before I would \nteach elementary and secondary education. And we pay tribute to them \nbut we don't pay them money.\n  Around here you hear all of these things. When we were marking the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill, virtually every Member of the Senate \ncame to Senator Cochran or me or both saying, please, help me with this \nlittle project back home; we just need $400,000 for this; if we could \njust get $1.5 million for that. Do you know what Senator Cochran and I \nwere dealing with? A budget that was $1 billion less than last year, a \nlittle over $13 billion for the whole Agriculture Department of \nAmerica. This cost overrun just to build the space station on Earth \nwould fund 50 percent of the agriculture budget. Think what it would do \nto send children to college. Think what it would do to improve \nteacher's salaries. We tried to appropriate $5 billion to upgrade the \nclassrooms in this country. And we are talking about a $7.3 billion \noverrun here.\n  Well, you trust the teacher with your child because oftentimes it is \na joy to do it and sometimes because you have to.\n  I started off this debate by saying that Congress is arrogating to \nitself a knowledge it does not possess as to what kind of research is \nlikely to go on on the space station. If you think it can only happen \non a space station, or if you think there is something peculiar about \nmicrogravity that we have to do all of this research in a vacuum, let \nme read to you, at the expense of boring you to tears, a few quotes.\n  Here is Dr. Ursula Goodenough, a cell biologist from the University \nof Washington and past president of the American Society for Cell \nBiology. She wrote to Dan Goldin, the administrator of NASA, and said:\n\n       The frontier of microgravity never did interest first-rate \n     scientists, physical or biological. And this is all the more \n     true now that it is clear that nothing of any real interest \n     has emerged from the many in-flight studies on the effects of \n     microgravity on this or that.\n\n  John Pike, of the American Federation of Scientists:\n\n       As soon as the most visible justification for piloted space \n     craft becomes science, you got BS detectors going off all \n     over America.\n\n  Here is Marcia Smith. Marcia Smith is with the Congressional Research \nService and probably knows as much or more about space than any person \nin America. She has done a report that is very current, issued in the \nmonth of July, that before any Senator votes to continue spending up to \n$100 billion or $150 billion, that Senator ought to read. Here is what \nshe said in a publication in 1995:\n\n       I don't know of any breakthroughs that have come out of \n     Russian space station programs in terms of new or cheaper-to-\n     produce materials or scientific discoveries. Mostly, they \n     have learned how to operate a space station for longer \n     periods of time.\n\n  Longer periods of time--nothing in there about cancer, AIDS, myopia--\nnothing. They say the Russians have had space stations up for almost 30 \nyears, Mir being the last one, and what have they learned? They have \nlearned how to keep space stations up for longer periods of time.\n  Here is a quote from Tim Beardsley, Scientific American. He, in turn, \nis quoting Elliott C. Levinthal, a former program director of the \nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency. And he says:\n\n       Levinthal, who has been a professor of genetics and \n     mechanical engineering at Stanford University, asserts that \n     no neutral committee handing out funds for basic research in \n     biology would support microgravity studies.\n\n  James Ferris, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, June, 1996:\n\n       Nothing has come out of microgravity research to convince \n     me that a material can be fabricated in orbit that is going \n     to be better than what you can make on Earth.\n\n\n[[Page S7541]]\n\n\n  Why are we spending $150 billion if you believe that?\n  Here is Dr. James Van Allen. Did you ever hear of the Van Allen \nradiation belt? One and the same person.\n\n       With the benefit of over three decades in space flight, it \n     is now clear that the conduct of scientific and applicational \n     missions in space by human crews is of very limited value.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       For almost all scientific and utilitarian purposes a human \n     crew in space is neither necessary nor significantly useful.\n\n  That is pretty powerful stuff from a man like Van Allen, isn't it--\nnot necessary or useful?\n  Here is Dr. Allen Bromley, Presidential Science Adviser, March 11, \n1991, in a letter to the Vice President:\n\n       The space station is needed to find means of maintaining \n     human life during long space flights. This is the only \n     scientific justification, in our view, and all future design \n     efforts should be focused on this one purpose.\n\n  That is George Bush's Vice President, Dan Quayle. That is back before \nAl Gore and Bill Clinton. And Dr. Bromley is writing to the Vice \nPresident, saying bear in mind that the only scientific justification \nshould be focused on one purpose and that is maintaining human life \nduring long flights.\n  The American College of Physicians--medical doctors. The American \nCollege of Physicians:\n\n       We agree that much, if not all, of the money slated for the \n     space station, the superconducting super collider, SDI, and \n     for Defense Intelligence could be better spent on improving \n     the health of our citizens, stimulating economic growth, and \n     reducing the deficit.\n\n  That was in 1992 when people thought the deficit was absolutely out \nof control and so was Congress. And sometimes I wonder about Congress \ntoday, when I see us appropriating money to keep this thing going.\n  Here is one from the American Physical Society, all the physicists in \nAmerica:\n\n       The principal scientific mission of the station is to study \n     the effects on humans of prolonged exposure to a space \n     environment.\n\n  Listen to this:\n\n       Medical researchers scoff at claims that these studies \n     might lead to cures for disease on Earth.\n\n  Why, you are going to hear all these things about, ``We don't know \nwhat is up there; we have to go up there and find out.'' We have been \ngoing up there for 30 years. We have been in space for 30 years. The \nspace station will keep us there longer, but we have been there before.\n  On cancer research--that is one of the things you always hear about, \ncancer research. Everybody deplores and is so frightened of cancer and \nAIDS and other terminal diseases like that. All you have to do is throw \n``cancer research'' out and you can have all the money you want. And \nhere is what Dr. David Rosenthal at the Harvard Medical School said on \nbehalf of the American Cancer Society:\n\n       We cannot find valid scientific justification for these \n     claims and believe it is unrealistic to base a decision on \n     funding the space station on that information. . . . Based on \n     the information we have seen thus far, we do not agree that a \n     strong case has been made for choosing to do cancer research \n     in space over critically needed research [right] here on \n     Earth.\n\n  Mr. President, I will save some of the other quotes. I know it gets a \nlittle tiresome listening to somebody read on the Senate floor. I get a \nlittle wrought-up in debating this issue. But you show me somebody who \ncan't get wrought-up over an issue and he ought not to be on the floor \nof the Senate. If you don't feel strongly enough about it to get \nexcited and agitated about it, maybe you should not offer it in the \nfirst place.\n  This is my last year in the Senate. This is my eighth and last effort \nto kill this program. But this year I am doing something a little \ndifferent. Of the $2.3 billion we are talking about putting in the \nprogram for 1999--I would terminate the space station. It will cost \nroughly $800 million to terminate it. I would take $1 billion that is \nleft over and put it in veterans medicine. The veterans have been \nsquealing like a pig under a gate about how they have been mistreated \nthis year, and they have been mistreated. If anybody in this body wants \nto redeem themselves, here is a chance to ingratiate themselves with \nevery veterans organization in this country, who are totally wired to \nthe fact that they have been shorted by the tune of about $1 billion.\n  So I will put $1 billion of this in veterans programs. And I will put \n$450 million into low-rent housing. We are doing a magnificent job \nduring this unprecedented era of prosperity; 67 percent of the people \nin this country own their own homes, or like me, have a fighting \ninterest in one. But people who are poor and people who work that are \npoor, 60 percent of them spend over 50 percent of their wages on a \nhome, on a house, on rents.\n  The poor people always get the shaft, don't they? I have always \nthought they did. If it hadn't been for the Government providing me \nwith the GI bill to go to a prestigious law school, I wouldn't be \nstanding here right now. It was that mean old Government that everybody \ntalks about how terrible it is that gave my brother and me a great \neducation and gave us a fighting chance that we might otherwise not \nhave had.\n  People don't like to admit it, but the truth of the matter is, most \npeople who make it in this world make it because they had a little luck \nalong the way or because the Government gave them a little hand with an \neducation or a small business loan or some kind of Government \nassistance. A lot of them, like me, got all three--luck, Government \nhelp, and I chose my parents well. Everybody doesn't get that chance. A \nlot of people do a miserable job of choosing their parents, but they \ncan't help it.\n  We can help it. We can do something for the least among us. I call on \nmy colleagues for one time to rise above the politics of this. Eighty-\nfive percent of the money goes to Alabama, California, and Texas. The \nrest don't have that much money in your State to warrant voting a bad \nvote. Anybody who can't justify a ``no'' vote on the space program \ndoesn't have much business being here. Maybe you feel strongly about \nit, and I am not going to quarrel about that, but if you are looking \nfor a political justification, anybody who can't justify voting to kill \nthat thing has no business being in the debate on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. Glenn addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the \nstatements made by my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers. Some of his statements I agree with, and, obviously, some of \nthem I do not agree with. One I agree with very strongly is, when he \nand I arrived here together, we became closest friends. He is one of my \nbest friends, if not the best friend, I have in the Senate today. We \nvote in a very similar fashion on most things. But every year it seems \nwe lock horns on this particular issue. I am sorry that is the case, \nbut I feel as strongly in the other direction with regard to the space \nstation as he does on the other side.\n  Let me put this in a little larger context perhaps. Let me start out \nwith the big picture of this country and what made this country great, \nbecause I have always believed that there is one thing that does set \nthis country apart from other nations around the world.\n  By the very nature of people coming to this country in the early days \nand their expansion across the unknown territory that we know today as \nAmerica, they exhibited a questing curiosity, a questing spirit that \nled them not only to explore lands and oceans and skies and geography, \nbut also to do not just the macro exploration, but the micro \nexploration in laboratories, classrooms of our Nation, and express our \ncuriosity in learning new things. And that is at the heart of science. \nThe heart of science is learning the new and putting it to use in ways \nto better our lives and understanding of the world around us--indeed, \nthe universe around us.\n  This questing spirit is at the heart of our history, from those first \nsettlers who landed on our rocky shores, to Lewis and Clark pushing \ninto hostile lands west of the Mississippi, to Thomas Edison and the \nelectric light, to the Wright brothers struggling to break the bond of \ngravity, to the past and present-day pioneers in our country's space \nprogram.\n  Along the way, there have always been plenty of doubters about our \nefforts to explore, to learn the new. There have always been those who \nsaid, ``Well, we haven't solved all of our problems yet, so we should \nspend our\n\n[[Page S7542]]\n\nmoney on the here and now until we get those answers and never look \ninto other new areas; don't waste money on what might be.''\n  There have been plenty of doubters about our efforts to explore the \nnew, and one of the most famous is one I have quoted on this floor \nbefore, a distinguished orator and Senator, Daniel Webster.\n  Daniel Webster used to get very impassioned. All you have to do is \nsee the desk on the other side of the aisle which is always reserved \nfor the senior Senator from New Hampshire. That is the only desk in the \nU.S. Senate that has a solid top on it. It does not raise. It does not \nhave hinges. That is because Daniel Webster became so impassioned on \nthe Senate floor, he used to bang so hard on the desks during his \nspeeches, that he broke the tops of the desks. They finally got so \ntired of replacing the tops that they put on a solid top of additional \nthickness so he couldn't break it. That is how impassioned he became \nabout some of the matters in which he believed.\n  He rose in the Senate when our Government was considering buying \nlands west of the Mississippi from Spain and Mexico, lands that now \nmake up more than half of the area mass of today's United States. \nDaniel Webster would rise during floor debate to say words to the \neffect of these: ``What use can this area west of the Mississippi be, \nthis area of cactus and prairie dogs, of blowing sand, mountains of \nsnow, impenetrable snow to their very base? Mr. President, I will not \nvote one cent from the public Treasury to move the Pacific one inch \ncloser to Boston than it now is.''\n  We can see in the past we have had some of our greatest statesmen who \nhave taken a rather myopic view of branching out and looking into the \nnew and unknown. The Wright brothers faced their skeptics, too. Some \npeople said at that time that if God wanted us to fly, God would have \nmade feathers on us so we could fly. Yet, their curiosity and \npersistence led to airplanes and the aviation industry and really have \nchanged the nature of the world and commerce and how we do business \nover this Earth.\n  I hate to say we face reincarnation of some of those skeptics when \ndebating our space program. I think people who take some of these views \nare just as misled as Daniel Webster and critics of the Wright brothers \nwere years ago. Each year they ask, ``Why do we invest billions of \ntaxpayers' dollars for space exploration and research''--even though it \ndoes have a great promise, which I will go into in a few moments--\n``while we still have other problems right here on Earth we haven't \nsolved? It is not just exploring the West. So why do we put new money \ninto research and laboratories when we haven't solved the problems on \nwhich we are already working?''\n  You can look at the macro research or micro research area, either \none. We do research for one reason, and I can give a short answer for \nthat: We do it to benefit people right here on Earth and to address \nthose very problems they raise, and that has been true ever since I was \ninvolved in the space program many years ago during Project Mercury, \nand it is true today.\n  I cannot think of one area of our society, whether it is \ncommunications or transportation or medicine, manufacturing, \nagriculture, the environment, education--that has not demonstrably \nbenefited from our space program.\n  I know my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, \nwill say he is not against the space program--and that is true, he is \nnot, he votes for it--that he is just against the space station. Yet, \nthe space station, to my mind, is one of the most preeminent examples \nof where we stand the potential of benefits for the future beyond \nanything we can foresee at the outset right now. That is the nature of \nbasic research. That is the nature of geographical research and \nexploration or research in laboratories.\n  This year, as in years past, we will debate what the benefits are of \nthe International Space Station. Fortunately, we have continued to fund \nthe space station. I think it is one of the greatest cooperative \nscientific enterprises in the history of this world--in fact, the \ngreatest. A total of 16 nations have teamed up to launch the most \nambitious technical undertaking known to man. The first components will \nbe launched later this year. As a matter of fact, the scheduled date is \nDecember 3 when the first U.S. node will be put up. The Russians will \ntheir first component, the Functioning Cargo Block on November 20.\n\n  The station will be a laboratory in permanent orbit. Much of its \nresearch will be a continuation of work currently being done on the \nshuttle, which is more limited as a research facility because of \nseveral things, including space available inside it, and because of \ntechnical considerations and the length of time it can be in space. \nThat is the main one, the length of time that it can actually stay in \norbit.\n  Let me go into a little bit about some of this research that I do \nbelieve is important. We had a recent set of experiments called \nNeurolab in April of this year. It was started on the shuttle and will \nbe continued on the space station to a greater extent. It will deal \nwith probably the greatest single frontier, the greatest unknown, the \ngreatest area for potential advancement of anything we could think \nabout, and that is a study of our human brain and our nervous system \nand how they operate. It can't be much more important than that. That \nis the part of the human body that is most complex and least understood \nby scientists.\n  Neurolab flew this past April carrying seven astronauts and a whole \nhost of different animals. It is NASA's view that it is the most \ncomplex and scientifically sophisticated research mission they have \never flown. Researchers used state-of-the-art techniques and \ntechnologies to gather information about how the nervous system's \ncontrol of various body functions changes in the microgravity of space \nand how gravity influences the development of our nervous system right \nhere on Earth--trying to get an insight from the lack of gravity as to \nhow these whole systems work.\n  A Neurolab lab performed research in the area of our vestibular \nsystem, balance; cardiovascular functions; spatial orientation and \ndevelopment biology; and circadian rhythms. The lay person listening to \nme recite those might wonder what all these terms involving research \nwith a bunch of astronauts have to do with me right here on Earth. That \nis a good question. But there are some very ready answers to that.\n  The vestibular system relates to how the inner ear links to our sense \nof balance which is disrupted when the astronauts are in microgravity \nand space. The research lab will help to better understand how balance \nis disrupted and then restored. Is that of importance here? There are \n12.5 million Americans right now over the age of 65 who suffer from \nbalance disorders just as a pure result of the aging process. In fact, \nbalance disorders affect most people at some point in their lives, and \nhopefully this may give us a new approach to those problems.\n  Cardiovascular Functions: Blood pressure control is upset in space. \nMany astronauts faint or become dizzy when they come back to Earth. \nThis ``orthostatic intolerance'' also affects 500,000 Americans. \nNeurolab's research will be helpful in developing treatments for those \nwho suffer from inadequate regulation of their blood pressure.\n  Spatial Orientation and Development Biology--that s a big title: \nResearch in this area examines the development of motor skills like \nwalking and manual dexterity. Findings could be helpful in learning how \nthe nervous system connects to motor development, which could have \napplications in treating children whose motor development is retarded \nby disease or genetic defect, or for people who are seeking to regain \nmotor function after a stroke or an accident.\n  Sleep and Circadian Rhythms: Astronauts in space have trouble \nsleeping. So do millions of Americans, especially older Americans, and \nthose who work night shifts. But trials on Neurolab examine the hormone \nMelatonin and its efficacy as a sleep aid. For those over 65 in this \ncountry, it is estimated about one-third of those people have serious \nenough sleep problems that it really interferes with their lives. So \nthis may give us a handle on looking into some of those problems.\n  All of the Neurolab's research is not something NASA just dreams up \nand says, hey, I think we will put something on this flight that might \nbe a good idea; it looks pretty cool. We will\n\n[[Page S7543]]\n\ntry that next time out and see what we find out. No, that is not the \nway it is done. All the research has been peer reviewed and the \nNeurolab research involved collaboration between NASA and the National \nInstitutes of Health, the Office of Naval Research, and some of the \nworld's leading scientific experts in this area. Neurolab will be \ncontinued on the space station in a longer and more sustained way. I \nthink we are only scratching the surface now of what will be learned.\n  Neurolab is not the only research being done that has benefits right \nhere on Earth. One field of research we have talked about on the floor \nbefore that I find most intriguing and I know this is denigrated \nsomewhat as being sort of esoteric, but it is anything but that. It is \nvery important. That is protein crystal growth in space. Most people \nare probably not aware--outside of the medical profession, that is--\nmost people are probably not aware of the importance of protein \ncrystals or proteins in our bodies and the fact that in space there is \na big difference.\n  Contrary to what was said on the floor a few moments ago, there are \ndifferences in microgravity, there are differences in ``zero-G'' as to \nthe kind of research you can do. You can't do all these things on \nEarth. In space, the protein crystals grow to a larger size and a \ngreater purity than anything you can do here on Earth because of \ndisruption caused by gravity. Research going on now with drug companies \nis fascinating and it brings a whole new input to medicine, to the \nthousands of different proteins and combinations that make up our \nbodies and literally stands to transform the way medicine looks at \nitself and the way we treat disease and what we can do with regard to \nimmunities by these things we are learning from changes in protein \ncrystal growth in space. Some of our leading drug manufacturers are \ncooperating very, very closely in that particular area.\n  Let me give an example dealing with the treatment of flu. The flu \nremedy is being developed with space-grown crystals where you can find \nout how the flu bug itself reacts. As far as flu is concerned, the loss \nof productivity due to flu is staggering--with some estimates as high \nas $20 billion a year that it costs our economy--with the high mutation \nrates of the flu virus. New data from the protein crystals grown in \nspace and on Earth appear to unlock some of the secrets of the flu bug \nand reveal its Achilles' heel. This gets rather technical, but the \nsecret lies in a small molecule attached to the host cell surface and \neach flu virus, no matter what strain, must remove this small molecule \nto escape the host cell to spread infection. But using data from space \nand space-grown crystals, researchers from the Center for \nMacromolecular Crystallography are designing drugs to bind with this \nprotein's site. In other words, they lock on this site, and this lock \nand key reduces the spread of flu in the body by blocking its escape \nroute.\n  I think that is fascinating. It gets a little technical for \ndiscussion on the Senate floor, again, but for critics to say there is \nno benefit coming from this research is just not right. These are very, \nvery promising medical breakthroughs that are coming from the fact that \nwe can grow protein crystals in space of far greater purity and size \nthan we can here on Earth in a one-G environment.\n  The Center for Macromolecular Crystallography, in collaboration with \na private sector affiliate, has developed several potent inhibitors of \nviral influenza. It is anticipated that phase I human trials will begin \nthis year. This is an excellent example of the kind of research in our \nspace program that has direct relevance to us here on Earth. We have 20 \nto 40 million people every year that get the flu, causing some 20,000 \ndeaths a year in the U.S. alone. This new data on space-grown crystals \nhas helped unlock a secret to let us treat flu in a different way. That \nis just one example.\n  Another benefit from these same kind of space-grown crystals is \ntrauma from open-heart surgery that can lead to complications due to \nmassive inflammation of heart tissue. Factor D plays a key role in the \nbiological steps that activate the immune response. Being able to block \nfactor D's effects could enable heart-surgery patients to recover more \nrapidly, and data from space-grown crystals allowed researchers to \ndevelop inhibitors which specifically block factor D. The industrial \npartner for these activities recently received approval to start human \nclinical trials.\n  Another example is space crystals in the fight on AIDS. A new \ncombination of drugs, including protease inhibitors, has proven \nimmensely successful in treating AIDS. In an ongoing experiment with \nDuPont Merck, NASA has crystallized HIV protease enzymes with an \ninhibitor to support structure-based drug design research. This may be \na successful second generation approach to treat this disease.\n  A final example: the CMC has determined the structure of NAD \nsynthetase, a protein found in all bacteria. Several leading drug \ncandidates have been developed that have shown positive effects against \nE. coli, salmonella, strep pneumonia and tuberculosis.\n  Think how helpful these discoveries might be. On E. coli alone, we \nhave all become unfortunately aware in the last couple of years of its \nbreakout in tainted meat and the resulting illnesses and deaths in many \nchildren across the country.\n  Protein crystal growth is only one field of research which has \nalready benefited from access to space. Another area of research which \nshows great potential is advanced cell culture research. Researchers \nwill take advantage of the weightless environment of space to study \ntissues as they grow and develop in three dimensions without settling \nto the bottom of the vessel. The rotating wall bioreactor, developed by \nNASA to mimic this capability on the ground is already finding wide \napplication in medical research here on Earth. The bioreactor has the \npotential for changing disease treatment through tissue transplants.\n  Forthcoming experiments plan to grow human pancreatic islet cells in \nthe bioreactor for possible transplantation into diabetic patients. If \nthe upcoming experiments are successful, diabetic patients will not \nneed to rely as heavily on insulin injections and will have less \ncomplications from their disease.\n  Another example: Modeling colon cancer with bioreactor. Mr. \nPresident, 166,000 cases of colon cancer are diagnosed each year in the \nUnited States, and it is one of the leading causes of death. Colon \ncancer tissue grown in a bioreactor develops remarkably similar to \ntumors extracted from humans. Studying these tissues outside the human \nbody may allow researchers to understand how cancer spreads, as well as \nidentifying new therapies which may prevent it.\n  This bioreactor is a marvelous thing. It lets tissues be cultured in \nthe same way they occur in the human body. If you go into a laboratory \nand try to do experiments there, quite often the experiment becomes \ntwo-dimensional because it wants to settle to the bottom of the petri \ndish. A bioreactor in space, with all the right fluids that simulate \nthe body, allows growth in a 3-D situation. They can be studied better \nso possible treatments can be put into a culture that is very similar \nto what occurs in the human body.\n  Growing cartilage with the bioreactor is another potential \napplication. An application of the bioreactor is culturing cartilage \ntissue for replacement and transplantation. Experiments with the \nbioreactor indicate it can successfully culture cartilage tissue that \nis quite similar to human cartilage.\n  I use these few examples today just to illustrate how relevant this \nresearch is to our future on Earth. The international space station \nwill make it possible to continue some of the same experiments for \nlonger periods of time. A longer duration of time is absolutely \ncritical for the success of many of these experiments.\n  In this regard, I quote a friend and one of the most respected \nsurgeons in this country--as a matter of fact, in the world--Dr. \nMichael DeBakey, chancellor and chairman of the department of surgery, \nBaylor College of Medicine, who said:\n\n       The space station is not a luxury any more than a medical \n     research center at Baylor College of Medicine is a luxury. \n     Present technology on the shuttle allows for stays in space \n     of only about 2 weeks. We do not limit medical researchers to \n     only a few hours in the laboratory and expect cures for \n     cancer. We need much longer missions in space--in months to \n     years--to obtain research results that may lead to the \n     development of new knowledge and breakthroughs.\n\n\n[[Page S7544]]\n\n\n  NASA has already had some 1,000 or more proposals per year for \nground-based and flight investigations involving precursor research for \nthe International Space Station project. Selection of principal \ninvestigators and commercial developers is beginning this year for \nlimited flight opportunities starting in 1999, and this population will \nincrease from 650 to 900 principal investigators and from 100 to 200 \nindustrial affiliates by the time the station assembly is complete.\n  About 650 life and microgravity sciences principal investigators are \nnow participating at over 100 institutions of higher learning around \nthe country, and the number of investigators is expected to grow to \nover 900 before assembly is completed. These researchers, in turn, \nemploy about 1,400 graduate students at present, with that number \nexpected to grow.\n  What are they looking into? Well, a number of different areas, and I \nwon't be able to go into all of them today. Biotechnology with an x-ray \ndiffraction system, for instance. Microgravity allows researchers to \nproduce superior protein crystals, which I mentioned a moment ago, for \ndrug development and to grow three-dimensional tissues, including \ncancer tumors, for research and cartilage for possible transplant.\n  Another area that can be looked into on the international space \nstation also is in the area of materials science. Researchers use low \ngravity to advance our understanding of the relationships among the \nstructure, the processing and the properties of physical materials.\n  The long-term benefits: We advance the understanding of processes for \nmanufacturing semiconductors, metals, ceramics, polymers, and other \nmaterials. We also determine fundamental physical properties of molten \nmetal, semiconductors, and other materials with precision impossible on \nEarth.\n  Another area being looked into, and this too is a fascinating one, is \ncombustion science. Scientists are using low gravity to simplify the \nstudy of complex combustion processes, burning processes. Since \ncombustion is used to produce 85 percent of Earth's energy, even small \nimprovements in efficiency will have large environmental and economic \nbenefits.\n  Now, that is an interesting one because if you light a candle in \nspace, you don't have the flame standing up. There is no convection \ncurrent, no rise of air from heating. It gathers in a mass around that \nburning area. So it enables combustion to be studied in ways that were \nnever possible before.\n  These are only highlights of some of the prestation research that \nhave already occurred. Dr. Robert Cheng and Dr. Larry Kostiuk, \ncombustion science researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \nunder contract to NASA, were awarded a patent for a ring flame \nstabilizer, which significantly reduces pollution from natural gas \nburners. Fitted into an off-the-shelf home heating surface, the device \nfrom natural gas burners. Fitted into an off-the-shelf home hearting \nsurface, the device reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by a factor of 10 \nby increasing efficiency by 2 percent, and the device can be readily \nsized to industrial scales. That kind of experiment will continue on \nthe space station.\n  Furthermore, the international space station will continue research \ninto fundamental physics. Scientists use low gravity to test \nfundamental theories of physics with degrees of accuracy that far \nexceed the capacity of earthbound science. Physics and low gravity \nexpand our understanding of changes in the state of matter, including \nthose changes responsible for high-temperature superconductivity.\n  Scientists will study gravity's influence on the development, the \ngrowth and the internal processes of plants and animals, and their \nresults will expand fundamental knowledge to benefit medical, \nagricultural, and other industries.\n  In that regard, on plant studies, I sat in a classroom at Houston \nduring some of the training I have been doing there just last week. One \nof the experiments was explained. We will have growth of certain seeds \nand exactly how they differ in growth patterns in microgravity was \nassessed, and the different tissue that makes up these plant cells will \nbe a subject of study on the flight that I will be on in October of \nthis year. We were learning how to go about getting those samples, \npreserve them and bring them back to earth so they can be studied here.\n  Furthermore, the space station will be a unique platform from which \nto observe the Earth and the universe. That is planned with Earth \nObservation and Space Science, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, and \nSAGE to be deployed in 2001. This research will further expand our \nknowledge of the solar system and beyond, as well as of the Earth \nitself.\n  I cite these examples to briefly indicate what a wide variety of \nscientific effort will go on with the international space station. \nThere will undoubtedly be many unintended or ``spin-off'' benefits as \nwell, especially if NASA's past record in this area is of any \nindication. There have been over 30,000 different spin-off benefits \nfrom our space program since its inception. I'd like to give just one \nof the latest examples that is highlighted in NASA's publication \nSpinoff 97. Several years ago, the agency developed a highly sensitive \ninfrared detector, otherwise known as a QWIP, to observe the plume \ncreated by the shuttle when it is launched. Subsequently, QWIPs have \nbeen modified for use for other applications. They were used to track \nthe Malibu fires in 1996 and served as an early warning system on hot \nspots not visible to the naked eye from the air. Recently, a QWIP was \ntested by surgeons at the Texas Heart Institute to see which arteries \nare carrying blood during heart surgery.\n  Now, let me address these next remarks about something that happens \nto all of us. As much as some might wish otherwise, there is no cure \nfor the common birthday and as we advance in years our bodies start to \nchange as we age. So research of the aging process has a direct \nrelevance to all of us.\n  For several years now, NASA and the National Institute of Aging, \nwhich is part of the NIH, were working on a project looking at what \nhappens to astronauts in space. I have been personally involved with \nthis over the last several years. I will be flying as a test subject on \nboard the space shuttle Discovery later this year, due to be launched \nOctober 29. Let me address how this whole thing came about because I \nthink it is of interest and will be of interest to so many Americans \nthat are in their senior years. Back about 3 years ago, I was looking \nat some of the results of what happens to the human body in space. NASA \nhas been able to chart, through the years, over 50 changes that occur \nin the human body in space. Cardiovascular changes, osteoporosis, \nmuscle system changes, coordination, immune system changes--things like \nthat--sleep pattern changes, it seemed to me as I read the list as I \nwas getting ready for debate on the Senate floor at that time--as we do \nevery year--it seemed to me, when I read this list, that there are \nseveral things that appear to be part of the natural process of aging \nright here on Earth. I talked to some of the doctors over at NASA, and \nthey said they noticed some of those things. But we didn't have any \nprojects to go ahead research these observations. So I went out and \ntalked to the people at the National Institutes of Aging who said yes, \nthey noticed some of the same changes and thought that sometime we \nought to look into it.\n\n  I looked at these changes. I was able to take the Merck manual on \ngeriatrics, the handbook that most doctors have on their desks in their \noffices, and go back through and chart the different things where there \nis a special process that occurs just from aging, and a similar thing \noccurs with the younger astronauts in space in a much shorter time \nperiod.\n  Out of that we came up with a number of them: Osteoporosis; \ncardiovascular changes; orthostatic--the ability of the body to keep \nblood in the upper part of the body and keep it distributed so the \nbrain keeps functioning; muscle degradation, or deterioration of the \nmuscle systems that change in weightlessness; but also change is part \nof the natural process of aging right here on Earth; coordination; \nimmune system changes. The body's immune system becomes less responsive \nfor the aged right here on Earth and for younger astronauts in space \nright now.\n  Sleep changes: About one-third of our population of those over 65 \nhave very serious sleep problems right here on Earth, as do astronauts \nin space. The\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\nability of the body to even take in nutrients and absorb them, drugs \nand nutrients; changes in space and changes for the elderly here on \nEarth. Those are a number of things that we noted.\n  When I talked to people, they thought that we should be establishing \na project to look into these things, with the ultimate objective of \ntrying to find out what turns the body's systems on and off in these \nparticular areas, both for astronauts and for the elderly right here on \nEarth. We have some 34 million Americans right now who are beyond the \nage of 65. That is due to double by the year 2030 and due to triple to \nalmost 100 million by the year 2050.\n  So this is an area of growing concern as we have so many more of our \npeople enter some of these areas of frailties of old age. That is what \nwe are trying to look into: What if I as an older person go up into \nspace, and what if my immune system or my reactions are different than \nthose people who are already up there now of a younger age? Will the \nthings happening to them be additive to me, or will I be immune from \nthem because those things may have occurred to me here on Earth as part \nof the natural process of aging?\n  This is the kind of research we are trying to look into. We can't \nlook into them all at once. But some of the problems we can look into \nare some of the muscle system changes. Muscle turnover experiments, \nwhich I will take part in, where I will have isotope injections and \ntake blood-urine samples on a regular basis to see what is causing the \nbody to break down its own cells in space, which happens right here on \nEarth to the elderly; doing a sleep experiment in which I will have on \na ``sleep net,'' as it is called, with a net put over the head that has \nleads over it, which picks up EEG--all the brain waves--picks up rapid \neye movement with sensors here, sensors under the chin, a respiration \nsensor across here, as well as EKG measurements, as well as monitoring \ndeep body core temperatures; swallowing of a pill that transmits the \nlittle signal, with temperature accurate to one-tenth of a degree, as \nrecorded on a monitor card around your waist all the time as that pill \nworks its way through your body.\n  This will be the most comprehensive study of sleep ever made. It will \ncontinue what was done on the Neurolab flight where several people were \nthere provided good baseline data. NASA and NIA will now be able to \ncompare data, at least with one person anyway of an older nature, such \nas myself. We will be able to start this kind of research then, which I \nthink has the potential of being extremely valuable into the future. \nThese are the things that have to be done in zero-G and can't be done \nright here on Earth.\n  The ultimate objective is to get a handle on what turns these body \nsystems on and off, which will benefit not only the astronauts up there \nin space by allowing them to take preventive medicine, before these \neffects occur but also be used here on Earth to hopefully treat some of \nthe frailties of old age that afflict too many people right here on \nEarth. We are all familiar with the syndrome of broken bones in the \nelderly through falling and breaking a hip. If we can learn how to \nstrengthen bones with this kind of study, it would be of tremendous \nvalue.\n  That is what we will be starting some of the research on this fall, \nin October of this year. I will be a data point of one when we come \nback from the mission. Some people say we don't learn anything from a \ndata point of one. My response to that is, well, you start to build a \ndata bank with a data point of one.\n  I hope that through the years NASA will continue this kind of \nresearch. I hope we can bring back enough good information that they \nwill continue this research through the years and see the value of this \nkind of research so it builds the storage of knowledge that we have and \nI think can be extremely valuable into the future. It can open up a \nwhole new area of NASA and NIA research that will be so important into \nthe future. I am looking forward very, very much to participating in \nthat kind of research, as well as the other things that are going on on \nboard the flight that I will be on.\n  I think the current number of research projects on STS-95, which will \nbe the flight going up in October, is 83 separate research projects. It \nis going to keep everybody busy on a very tight timeline all during \nthat flight to even keep up with that amount of research. There will be \na tremendous amount of research going on on that particular flight.\n  I could talk for hours on that subject. I have all sorts of material \nthat I brought to the floor today that I thought I might get to--we \ndon't have time to do it today, but I learned in some of the briefings \nthat NASA had in Houston. I think it would be a tragedy if we didn't \ncontinue to fund the space station where this research can be carried \nout in the future to a far better degree than they have ever been able \nto be done just on the orbiter itself.\n  Let me say a few words about the importance of international \ncooperation in space research.\n  If you had told me some 36 years ago when I made my flight in 1962--\nthat in 1997 United States astronauts would take up residence on a \nRussian space station and work together with a Russian crew, I would \nnot have believed it possible. I am a veteran of the cold war and the \nspace race. I guess I could not be more pleased to see this kind of \nprogress. Obviously, there is tremendous symbolic value also when \nformer enemies work together cooperatively. But symbolism isn't the \nmost important reason we cooperate. Again, it gets back to the basic \nresearch when we can do it better together working together in \nlaboratories all around the world. Yes, we can.\n  The quality of research is going to improve if we have the best and \nbrightest from 16 nations working on these various projects. The \nshuttle-Mir program also was called Phase I of the International Space \nStation. It is a perfect example of the benefits of such cooperation. \nThe program consisted of nine shuttle-Mir docking missions. The program \nhas helped both the United States and Russia learn countless valuable \nlessons which will be put to use on the International Space Station.\n  Just a few of those accomplishments, and I will just read them off: \nAmerican astronauts had a presence on Mir for 812 days; conducted nine \nshuttle-Mir docking missions; Russian and American engineers, \nastronauts and cosmonauts, in performing joint operations, have \ndeveloped a mutual understanding in these areas, even though we come \nfrom different cultures, and that is important for the future. We have \nlearned how to plan and execute typical shuttle missions to station \nrendezvous and docking, joint ground and mission control, \nextravehicular activity, exchange of supplies, and on and on.\n  Most importantly, we are working together on joint research projects. \nOver 45 different research papers are expected to be published by the \nend of this year just on the experiments off of Mir. They encompass \nwork on bone loss, bone marrow growth, growth of cancer cells and \ncartilage, protein to crystal growth research, and measurement of the \nEarth's magnetic field--a wide range of scientific matters.\n  They put us in an excellent position for assembly and subsequent \noperation of the International Space Station with reduced risk, greater \nconfidence, and a reduced learning curve which will save us time and \nmoney.\n  Now, we had a number of charts here on the station. I think in the \ninterest of time I will not put those up right now and take more time \nfor discussion.\n  To summarize this particular part, we will have for the first time in \nhistory 16 nations involved in an International Space Station, \ncooperating instead of fighting each other. Working together, using the \nbest and brightest of each of these countries to do research is a \nbenefit to people right here on Earth. This is a new model for how \npeople can reach across borders to work together to solve problems \ncommon to all mankind. It is truly a monumental and historic effort, \nand I am proud and honored to be able to support it.\n  I think there is one other important factor here too that I run into \nall the time going around the country, and that is--and this is, \nrather, an intangible benefit. I think our efforts in scientific \nresearch in these areas is something that the kids look up to; our \nyoung people in school are encouraged to study math and science and to \nwork harder in school. We run into that all the time. We meet with \nteachers, and we will be doing some discussion from the flight that I \nwill be on this fall. We\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\nwill be doing some talking back and forth to Earth in this educational \narea to hopefully inspire some of our young people in their academic \nefforts.\n  Now, the Senate will be debating an amendment that would, if passed, \nterminate the space station. I hope that the Bumpers amendment will be \ndefeated. I urge my colleagues to oppose it, or any other amendments to \ncut back or restrict space station funding because I believe the \ndifficult task of building and launching the station is being done in a \nmost cost-effective manner while keeping safety paramount.\n  I think it is very, very difficult task. This is not like going to \nDetroit and saying, General Motors, we want to buy 5,000 trucks. What \nis your cost? And we will know within a dollar what we are going to get \nthem for, and we will probably get them on time without any change in \ncapability. We are dealing in an area that is out on the cutting edge \nof science, setting up a vehicle that will be used to initiate projects \nand do research on the cutting edge of science and is less amenable to \naccurate cost accounting.\n  I think it is difficult when we say we are expecting NASA to be able \nto foresee some of the things that have happened such as, for instance, \ncongressional cutbacks in funding from time to time, cutbacks of \nprograms and building up later on, cutbacks again. One estimate by one \nof the studies was that 80 percent of the overruns of the last few \nyears, where there has been a budget increase, has been caused by that \nvery factor alone. So perhaps we have to look at ourselves here in \nCongress a little bit as to what caused some of these increases.\n  This year's cost for the station, $2.3 billion in this particular \nbill, that is just $30 million above the President's 1999 budget that \nwe are talking about here today. Back years ago, we were talking about \na continuing basis of $2.1 billion per year. That is when we thought \nthe total cost was going to be $17.4 billion. So for a scientific \nproject like this, I don't see that that is too far out of line. This \nis not like going out and buying something that is a commonplace \nproduct, off the shelf in this country, or wherever.\n  It is not true that all scientists are opposed to the station as my \ncolleague stated earlier, and it is not true, I don't think, that NASA \nhas broken their promises. I think they have basically made the best \nestimates they could, and they have tried to live with them.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join me in defeating this amendment to \nterminate the space station because I think it is very valuable for the \nfuture. The voting patterns in the past in the Senate have shown that \nmost in the Senate believe that, and I hope it continues today. Most of \nthe hardware is either under construction or actually completed now, \nand the first nodes will be launched later this year. And we will get \nit onstream over the next couple of years so that we can start this \nresearch that is going to benefit all mankind.\n  I think one of the best decisions ever made by this country way back \nin the earliest days of the space program when NASA was just being \nformed was--the decision was made by Dwight Eisenhower--that our \nprogram would be open for the whole world to participate in. And here \nwe are at the end of the cold war participating now with 16 nations in \nthe greatest engineering effort ever made in the history of the world. \nIt is inspiring to our young people. It has the tremendous benefit of a \nresearch laboratory we have never been able to have. In all the tens of \nthousands of years as people looked up and wondered what was up there, \nand the Wright brothers made the first flight off the surface of the \nEarth, and ever higher, and now we have the chance to use this for the \nbenefit of all people on the Earth, I think it should continue and I \nhope my colleagues will vote to defeat this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are in the process of seeking to reach a \ntime agreement and have the measure set aside for a vote about 6:30. We \nhave not yet cleared the time agreement. I intend to make some remarks \nnow and would want those remarks charged against the time agreement if \nand when we do reach that time agreement. It is our hope that we will \nhave this vote and be able to take another matter that is very \nimportant that Senator McCain is going to offer after this and vote on \nthem at 6:30 and thereafter this evening. So for the information of all \nSenators, that is what we are working on, and we hope to have word from \nthe Cloakrooms shortly.\n  There are many points that can be made. I certainly appreciate the \nvery knowledgeable comments of our distinguished colleague from Ohio, a \nman who speaks about space from personal knowledge that none of the \nrest of us have, and I know that we are all very, very enlightened by \nhis description of the work that could go on, the scientific inquiry \nthat can go on. But I want to address a point that was made earlier, \njust one of them that I think is very important.\n  There was a statement made about 1\\1/2\\ hours ago that all scientists \nin America are opposed to it. Clearly, there are many scientists whose \ndisciplines have not yet identified enhancements that might come from \nthe microgravity environment of space. It is not surprising that many \nof these scientists would rather see money for science go into one of \ntheir disciplines. But taking money away from NASA does not \nautomatically make that money available for other research programs for \nother Federal agencies.\n  Let me just indicate some of the scientific groups that have \nexpressed support for the space station. The Federation of American \nSocieties for Experimental Biology has called for a 58-percent increase \nin funding for NASA's live science research in its annual consensus \nreport.\n  In a 1997 report, the National Research Council said in something \ncalled ``Future Materials Science Research on the International Space \nStation'':\n\n       The microgravity environment . . . of space provides a \n     unique opportunity to further our understanding of various \n     materials phenomena involving the molten, fluidic, and \n     gaseous states by reducing or eliminating buoyancy-driven \n     convection effects. . . . the anticipated scientific results \n     of microgravity materials-science research range from \n     establishing baselines for fundamental materials processes to \n     generating results of more direct commercial significance.''\n\n  I am not sure all of our colleagues understand exactly what they \nmean, but I get the drift of it, and that is that scientific \ninvestigation in space is good and they are going to make breakthroughs \nin areas that are very important.\n  The National Research Council further stated, in Microgravity \nOpportunities for the 1990's:\n\n       Increasingly, fundamental processes that were thought to be \n     well understood under terrestrial (1-g) conditions have, in \n     fact, proved to behave in altered and even startlingly \n     unfamiliar ways when observed and measured in reduced gravity \n     environments. Space experiments in areas such as combustion, \n     fluid flow and transport, phase separation fundamental \n     physics, and biology, have revealed new phenomena and have \n     demonstrated new and occasionally unpredicted behavior.\n\n  NASA and the National Institutes of Health have executed over 20 \ncooperative agreements in life sciences. The American Medical \nAssociation has passed a resolution in support of the International \nSpace Station. In addition, we have quotes from people like Dr. Samuel \nC.C. Ting from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory \nfor Nuclear Science. Dr. Ting is a Nobel laureate. He said:\n\n       From my experience conducting experiments in particle \n     accelerators for over thirty years, I conclude that the space \n     station is an ideal place to address fundamental issues in \n     physics. In the final analysis, the construction of the Space \n     Station this year will provide scientists from many \n     disciplines with the unprecedented opportunity to carry out \n     large scale, precision, and long-duration experiments \n     unimpeded by the effects of the Earth's atmosphere and \n     gravity.\n\n  I might cite Professor of Engineering Physics and Combustion, \nDirector of the Center for Energy and Combustion Research at the \nUniversity of California, San Diego, Professor Forman A. Williams, who \nsaid:\n\n       The practical objective of learning how to burn our \n     precious fossil fuels more cleanly, efficiently and safely \n     certainly would benefit from the fundamental studies that the \n     Space Station would allow us to pursue. Considering the \n     astronomical costs of petroleum, the investment in Space \n     Station thus seems to me very well conceived.\n\n  Obviously, we have statements from other scientists who indicate the \nimportance of this scientific research.\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\n But when you look at it, realize that the space station is not just \njustified in terms of science alone. The international space station is \nnot and never has been simply a science platform. It serves many other \nfunctions, not the least of which is the greatest peaceful, \ninternational, scientific endeavor in history.\n  It will offer practical applications beyond the realm of research, as \na test-bed for manufacturing, for technology. It has a potential for \ngreat commercial involvement in manufacturing, in materials processing. \nIf we choose, as a matter of policy, the station also can play a key \nrole in civilization, taking another step beyond Earth's orbit. It is \nnot just science. It is a laboratory with the capability that many of \nour top scientists are eager to begin using, and many who would hope to \ncommercialize and provide benefits through the private sector, not only \nthrough investigations, scientific explorations, but actual production \nin space, may be able to realize.\n  For these reasons, I hope, when the time comes for a tabling motion, \nan overwhelming majority of my colleagues will join us in so tabling \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise in opposition to the \nBumpers amendment to strike the funding for the space station.\n  We have heard, prior to Senator Bond's speech, from a distinguished \nAmerican. Senator Bond is also a distinguished American, but Senator \nBumpers, the Senator from Arkansas, has really raised very important \nand significant flashing yellow lights regarding the space station. He \nhas raised questions related to the funding of the space station; also, \nas to whether we are getting our money's worth in terms of research, \nwouldn't it be better deployed in other areas? And he has consistently \nraised many of those questions over the years.\n  The result of that has been that, while he has not always won his \namendment, he has certainly won our attention, that of those on the \nAppropriations Committee, and the attention also of the space agency \nitself that has resulted, I believe, in greater management efficiencies \nand a greater focus on specific research outcomes than would have been \nthe case had those important issues not been raised.\n  Senator Bumpers has been a champion particularly in the area of \nhealth care and medical research. I remember when I first arrived in \nthe Senate, he was the leading advocate to make sure we had adequate \nimmunization for the children of the United States of America, and what \nis now a standard public policy he raised and he supported, and we \nthank him for that.\n  He also speaks eloquently of the funding for the National Institutes \nof Health, and I, too, join him on that. I hope by the year 2000 or \nthereabouts, in the new century, we double the funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, an agency that resides in my own State but really \nbelongs to all of America and really benefits the entire world.\n  I feel so strongly about the benefits that could be derived from the \ncollaboration between NIH and NASA that I encouraged then Administrator \nGoldin and the Director of NIH then, Dr. Bernadine Healy, to really \ndevelop joint research projects. And they actually entered into a \nmemorandum of agreement that stands today to ensure collaborative \nresearch in that area, a great deal of which is being manifested in the \nspace station research arena.\n  So, we thank Senator Bumpers for the yellow flashing lights that he \ncontinues to signal to the committee. We thank him for his steadfast \nadvocacy for biomedical research. And we want to thank him for his \nimportant contribution.\n  However, having then said those accolades, we do not want his \namendment supported. I think another wonderful American, Senator John \nGlenn, has outlined very clearly and extensively why we should continue \nto support Space Station Freedom. I would not duplicate, but hope to \namplify, Senator Glenn's remarks. I recall I was a young social worker \nwhen Senator Glenn himself had just finished orbiting the Earth looking \nfor these important scientific breakthroughs, and I think of the year \n1968 when we also orbited the Moon and our astronauts read from Genesis \nin space to remind us all of our link between here, the planet Earth, \nand outer space.\n  I also remember that many Democrats, members of my own party, \nridiculed the whole effort to go to the Moon and to take that ``one \ngiant step for mankind.'' In fact, one Senator from Minnesota at that \ntime called it ``moondoggle.'' No one looks back on the success of that \nendeavor, what it meant to our country both in terms of national \nprestige and scientific breakthroughs in that era of the cold war, and \nno one would call that program, now, ``moondoggle.'' I hope we will not \nalso just dismiss, in the same way, Space Station Freedom.\n  This endeavor was begun under Ronald Reagan, sustained under \nPresident George Bush, and continues to be supported by President Bill \nClinton. But it is not only the Presidential support that gives this \nprogram validity, it is also the support of the scientific community. I \nwould like to bring to the committee's attention the Nobel laureate, \nDr. Samuel Ting, who has played a major role in developing much of the \nresearch on the space station.\n  Another Nobel laureate, Dr. Herbert Hauptman, has addressed the \nBiomedical Research Caucus of Congress on the value of orbital research \nfor biomedicine.\n  Dr. Michael DeBakey of Baylor Medicine said:\n\n       The space station is not a luxury any more than a medical \n     research center at Baylor College of Medicine is a luxury.\n\n  Since 1992, NASA has signed 20 different cooperative agreements with \nNIH. The National Academy of Sciences has repeatedly expressed its \nsupport for research on the space station. The Planetary Society \nsupports it. The American Medical Association has adopted a resolution \nin support of it. The Society for In Vitro Biology hosts an annual \nworkshop on what culturing cells in microgravity will mean.\n  Who knows what breakthroughs we will find?\n  I have five pages of quotes from different deans and professors of \nmedical schools from all over the United States of America in support \nof this. They range from MIT, to Harvard Medical School, to the Harvard \nInstitutes of Medicine; Brigham and Women's Hospital. I could go on \nabout it.\n  Let me quote Dr. Jessup who heads up the Deaconess Hospital, Harvard \nMedical School:\n\n       The space program offers a chance to improve out models of \n     cancer and to develop new drugs and treatments as well as to \n     gain knowledge about how cancer spreads . . .\n\n  The space station is the place to do it.\n  Mr. President, my family was affected by two major diseases: \nAlzheimer's and diabetes. My very dear father died of Alzheimer's, and \nI am deeply committed to continuing the research to find either the \ncure or the ability to stretch out the intellectual ability for anyone \nwho has it. My dear mother was stricken with diabetes and overcame her \nin her final years and resulted in her death.\n  What I think about now, as I listen to scientists brief us on what \nthis means, is it is outstanding, in those two areas, and what it will \nmean. Let me tell you about what Dr. Ken Kosik of the Harvard Institute \nsays:\n\n       By raising rats in an environment that lacks gravity, we \n     have the opportunity to zero in specifically on the brain \n     system that controls orientation. This brain system is \n     exactly the part of the brain attacked by Alzheimer's \n     disease. We will use the rats to search for the specific \n     molecules which fail to appear in the brain circuits \n     controlling orientation.\n\n  And this could lead to incredible breakthroughs in knowing how to \nhelp those who have Alzheimer's or a propensity to it.\n  I have a quote from a letter from Dr. Jim Mulvihill, the president \nand CEO of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International encouraging \nthe support of the space station because of what it will mean.\n  Dr. Murray Loew, member of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Lay \nReview Committee, at Georgetown says:\n\n       Although it may not be immediately apparent, persons with \n     diabetes and astronauts share some of the same challenges. \n     Consequently, NASA and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation last \n     May signed a joint Space Act Agreement so that both \n     organizations can together begin fully sharing informa-\n     tion . . .\n\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\n\n  And research in juvenile diabetes, there are links here to do this. I \ncould elaborate on this, but I turn to my colleague from Missouri, and \nask him if the time agreement is ready.\n  Mr. BOND. It is in the process.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record these statements unsolicited from scientists who do both \nbasic research and applied clinical research, not only on diabetes and \nAlzheimer's, but on many others diseases. I want their testimony to \nspeak for itself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       August F. Witt, Ford Professor of Engineering, \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology:\n     . . . your program is now generally recognized as absolutely \n     critical in efforts to maintain for the U.S. a competitive \n     position in the development of new materials. The facilities \n     and scientific infrastructure provided by your Agency [are] a \n     unique national asset which will unquestionably even increase \n     in value, with the establishment of the International Space \n     Station.--Letter to Administrator Goldin, April 22, 1998.\n       G. Paul Neitzel, Professor, Virginia Institute of \n     Technology:\n       The presence of a ``permanent'' manned platform on orbit \n     will provide unprecedented opportunities for long-term \n     experimentation in a weightless, or ``microgravity'' \n     environment. . . . the results of research done outside the \n     confines of gravity may be able to point the way to the \n     improvement of processes and products produced here on \n     Earth.--Letter to Administrator Goldin, April 22, 1998.\n       Forman A. Williams, Professor of Engineering Physics and \n     Combustion, Director, Center for Energy and Combustion \n     Research, University of California, San Diego:\n       The practical objective of learning how to burn our \n     precious fossil fuels more cleanly, efficiently and safely \n     certainly would benefit from the fundamental studies that the \n     Space Station would allow us to pursue. Considering the \n     astronomical costs of petroleum, the investment in Space \n     Station thus seems to me to be very well conceived.--Letter \n     to Administrator Goldin, April 20, 1998.\n       Charles A. Czeisler, Ph.D., M.D., Associate Professor of \n     Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Chief, Circadian, \n     Neuroendocrine and Sleep Disorders Medicine, Brigham and \n     Women's Hospital:\n       [The ISS] provides an ideal platform to explore the long-\n     term effects of space flight on human physiology, and will \n     provide critical information for us scientists to assess the \n     feasibility of extended duration space flight such as will be \n     required for a flight to Mars.--Letter to Administrator \n     Goldin, April, 1998.\n       Samuel C.C. Ting, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \n     Laboratory for Nuclear Science [Dr. Ting is a Nobel \n     laureate]:\n       From my experience conducting experiments at particle \n     accelerators for over thirty years, I conclude that the space \n     station is an ideal place to address fundamental issues in \n     physics. In the final analysis, the construction of the Space \n     Station this year will provide scientists from many \n     disciplines with the unprecedented opportunity to carry out \n     large scale, precision, and long duration experiments \n     unimpeded by the effects of the earth's atmosphere and \n     gravity.--Letter to Administrator Goldin, April 17, 1998.\n       Dr. Murray Loew, Member, JDF Lay Review Committee, \n     Professor of Engineering, Georgetown University:\n       Although it may not be immediately apparent, persons with \n     diabetes and astronauts share some of the same challenges. \n     Consequently, NASA and JDF last May signed a joint Space Act \n     Agreement so that both organizations can together begin fully \n     sharing information and ideas.--Testimony of the Juvenile \n     Diabetes Foundation International before the House \n     Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent \n     Agencies, April 22, 1998.\n       James E. Mulvihill, DMD, President and CEO, Juvenile \n     Diabetes Foundation International:\n       Again, on behalf of the 16 million Americans with diabetes \n     and their loved ones, I appreciate your partnership in the \n     search for a cure.

Jacobson, M.D., Vice Chancellor for Health \n     Affairs, Vanderbilt University David Robertson, M.D. Director \n     of the Clinical Research Center, Vanderbilt University:\n       The study will give us critical insights into how the brain \n     regulates blood pressure and heart rate in human beings in \n     the unique environment of microgravity, and this information \n     directly relates to the clinical work we are doing regarding \n     the abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system and its \n     control of critical aspects of physiology, such as blood flow \n     to the brain. Using the laboratory of space to examine the \n     underlying regulatory mechanism in the absence of the \n     confounding factor of gravity will allow us to understand \n     these mechanisms at a level not previously possible.--Letter \n     to Administrator Goldin Re Neurolab, April 28, 1998.\n       Gail H.

First, because of the Center's expertise in \n     macromolecular crystal growth in both 1-g and g \n     environments, we would like to fund the CMC to crystallize a \n     large number of biologically important proteins that Lilly \n     scientists have identified from a variety of sources \n     including our own genomics data base. Second, because of our \n     mutual interest in infectious disease, we would like to work \n     with the CMC on the crystallization and structure \n     determinations for several key proteins associated with a \n     number of bacterial and viral pathogens. . . . In this \n     regard, we hope to support and have access to your NASA-\n     funded microgravity flight program.--Letter to Dr. Lawrence \n     J.

Reggie Edgerton, Vice Chair and Professor of \n     Physiological Science for the Division of Life Sciences at \n     The University of California, Los Angeles:\n       The significant advantage of studying the ability of the \n     nervous system to adapt to a microgravity environment, known \n     as plasticity, is the ability to identify the potential of \n     the normal nervous system. This information is critical \n     because it will allow us to differentiate the potential for \n     plasticity of the nervous system in response to trauma and \n     disease, in comparison to that associated with altered use of \n     the normal nervous system.--Testimony before the U.S. House \n     of Representatives Committee on Science, Subcommittee on \n     Space and Aeronautics, April 10, 1997.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I acknowledge the validity of what \nSenator Bumpers has raised about cost overruns, and I also raise the \nvalidity about what Senator Bumpers has raised with NASA over the fact \nthat the cost overruns in the space station could lead to raids on \nother well-managed NASA programs. To that end, working on a bipartisan \nbasis with our colleague from Missouri, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, we established a separate account dedicated solely to the \nspace station to create better accountability and financial management \nof this program and transparency in terms of the total cost of what the \nInternational Space Station is.\n  So it is not a million bucks here, 100 million tucked in over here, \nand so on. We are going to have a separate account providing \naccountability and transparency.\n  I would like to continue with my arguments, but we have reached a \ntime agreement. I temporarily yield the floor to my colleague from \nMissouri so he can propound his unanimous consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent to return to speaking on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we have reached a time agreement. It \nmay be a little convoluted, but if you will stick with me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour 30 minutes for debate \nprior to a motion to table, and that the vote on the motion to table \noccur at 6:30 p.m. this evening. I further ask unanimous consent that \nthe time be divided as follows: 40 minutes under my control, and we \nwill charge the 15 minutes used to this point by Senator Mikulski and \nmyself against that 40 minutes; 50 minutes under the control of Senator \nBumpers; that just prior to the vote on the motion to table, there be \n10 minutes equally divided for closing remarks; that following the \ndebate, the amendment be laid aside until 6:20 p.m. this evening, and \nat that time, I be recognized to move to table amendment No. 3062.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, and I am most reluctant \nto, I would like, in this eighth year of my\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\ntravail, to get an up-or-down vote on this.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in response to that, I had offered to offer \na separate amendment naming the space station after Senator Bumpers.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It will be called the ``Bumper crop.''\n  Mr. BOND. In spite of that, I personally will forego the motion to \ntable and ask that the vote be an up-or-down vote on the Bumpers \namendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator. I am more than happy to forego \nhaving the space station named after me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest as amended?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for the further information of all Senators, \nit is my understanding that Senator McCain will be in position next to \noffer an amendment. It is our hope we can have a vote on that matter, \nor relating to that matter, perhaps on a Budget Act point of order, \nfollowing the vote on amendment No. 3062. That is not part of the \nconsent agreement. That is for information only. I thank my colleague \nfrom Maryland, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has used 11 minutes \n9 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I believe this amendment is a choice between the future and the past. \nWe must be willing to embrace science and technology, to take the bold \nrisk in scientific endeavors of the future like the space station. \nInvestments in science and technology will be determinative of the 21st \ncentury in what nations will continue to lead the world. I do not want \nthe American century to come to a close without a continued commitment \nto science and technology.\n  We must use American ingenuity and know-how through this unique \nenvironment of the space station to tackle understanding of diseases or \ndevelop new techniques, like I just elaborated on a few minutes ago. \nSome will argue this type of research can be done more cost effectively \non Earth. Other scientists will disagree because you cannot create a \nlow gravity environment on Earth to perform many of these unique \nactivities.\n  One is microgravity research and providing better research in better \npharmaceuticals, medical advancement to develop new materials to use on \nEarth, such as new fire resistant materials. My gosh, wouldn't our \nfighters have benefitted from that in Florida?\n  Others might ask why this type of research cannot be done on the \nshuttle. The answer is we cannot rush the development of new \ntechnologies and science. If we did it on the shuttle, it means you \nwould have 2 weeks maximum to be able to do it. I know no scientist \nworking at my beloved NIH who could do research in 2 weeks, take a \nbreak, wait for another launch and go back for 2 weeks.\n  One of the arguments we hear every year is space station-related \ncosts and, sure, the space station does cost money, but the fact is \nthat over $51 billion of the $96 billion discussed by Senator Bumpers \nis really related to shuttle missions, and those missions will fly \nwhether we do the space station or not.\n  One of the real questions, too, is what is the cost to the United \nStates of America and its taxpayers if we do not continue or stay the \ncourse for the space station? We hear about the cost to maintain it and \nto build it. The actual work on the space station means 15,000 highly \nskilled engineering and production contract jobs supporting the space \nstation. There are 35,000 contract workers and 5,000 civil servants who \nwork on the shuttle, who is our major customer. This is a major \nemployer. About 2,000 pounds of hardware have already been built for \nthe U.S. station.\n  What else do we lose? U.S. credibility with our international \npartners. Japan, Canada, and European Space Agency have all made this a \ntruly international program. We have worked closely with the Russians. \nLike many, I am disappointed in the way the Russians have failed to \ndeliver their promised technology on time, for which we paid. They have \nimproved these actions, and I know President Clinton is moving on this.\n  U.S. competitiveness can only be maintained by continuing the long-\nterm, cutting-edge, high-risk research and development that we have \ndone. I am not going to elaborate any further on what Senator John \nGlenn said. For all who are listening, we want to amplify that the \nspace station is an important public investment and scientific \nbreakthrough, where the very technology of doing the space station will \nlead to new breakthroughs in life science, information technology, and \nnew kinds of materials--ceramic and so on--that will be very important \nto maintaining America's cutting edge.\n  I reserve further time on my time for when we need to conclude our \ndebate.\n  I urge the defeat of the Bumpers amendment. Vote for the future and \ndefeat the Bumpers amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to ask for your attention to \nan issue of great importance to the future of science and space \nexploration: the International Space Station. We have debated the \nmerits of this project on many occasions. It is time to end this debate \nand declare our permanent support. We must press ahead with mankind's \nexploration of the cosmos.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt once said:\n\n       The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our \n     doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active \n     faith.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to embrace Franklin Roosevelt's vision and \nsupport efforts to move the International Space Station forward.\n  The International Space Station is one of the most promising space \nprojects in history. Over 60 percent of the station hardware, nearly \nhalf a million pounds, will be assembled by the end of this year. More \nthan 75 percent of the developmental activities are completed. The end \nresult of this 16-nation effort will be an international university in \nlow-earth orbit and a launching pad for further exploration of the \nstars.\n  Mr. President, constructing this space station will not be simple or \ncheap. But why would we expect it to be? For the first time in the \nhistory of manned space exploration, we are assembling a laboratory, \nenergy plant, and apartment complex the size of a football field in \norbit 200 miles above the Earth. This is an ambitious technical feat.\n  Our nation's exploration of the galaxy has never been easy. While we \nprefer to remember glorious moments like our distinguished colleague \nJohn Glenn's first orbit, Neil Armstrong's first moon landing, and the \nmajestic first launch of the space shuttle, we should not forget that \nAmerica's four decade adventure in space has also been plagued by \ntechnical difficulties and political struggles. We've faced tragedies--\nnamely the three brave astronauts who lost their lives in the Apollo I \nfire, and the seven others who perished on the Challenger. Space \nexploration has been exciting, but it has never been easy.\n  But perseverance and patience have powered our space program past \nthese difficulties, and they will be necessary ingredients in our \neffort to construct and maintain this International Space Station. \nWithout the perseverance and patience of early space pioneers, we might \nnot have been the first nation to land on the moon or successfully \noperate a reusable launch vehicle.\n  The International Space Station will excite the nation and the world. \nI cannot imagine any other project that will so readily inspire young \npeople across our country to focus their attention on math and science. \nThe first launch of space station components will cultivate the next \ngeneration of mechanical engineers, software designers, flight \ncontrollers, and of course, our astronaut corps. Throughout its \nlifetime, the space station will include student experiments and \nteleconferencing and telescience projects.\n  For this investment, we will have a permanent facility in space in \nwhich we can conduct numerous scientific and medical experiments, the \nend results possibly being cures for diseases known and unknown.\n  For instance, space-grown insulin crystals created in a microgravity \nenvironment are larger and better defined\n\n[[Page S7550]]\n\nthan those developed on Earth. Scientists from NASA and the \npharmaceutical industry hope to develop drugs that will bind insulin \nand attack the third leading cause of death in this country, diabetes.\n  Microgravity can also be used to study proteins and three-dimensional \ntissue samples. Previous success in advanced cell-culturing has led to \npartnerships with the National Institutes of Health in the study of \ntransmission of the AIDS virus. This application of space technology \nhas also led to new studies of cancer tumors.\n  Space flight is particularly applicable to studying the aging \nprocess, since astronauts experience many of the same symptoms seen in \nthe elderly, such as anemia, loss of muscle, and imbalance. Women are \nfive times more likely to suffer from osteoporosis, the medical term \nfor weakening bones. What better way to study it than to simulate it in \nspace? The results could be fewer broken bones in the years to come as \nbaby boomers advance in age.\n  In addition to the tremendous health benefits we will reap from \nmedical studies on the space station, our daily lives will be affected \nby numerous spin-offs and product developments. Aerogel is the lightest \nknown solid, only three times heavier than air. Space-manufactured \nsamples are four times better in quality than any produced on earth, \nallowing for the creation of superinsulators. Fortune magazine predicts \nthe aerogel market could result in 800 potential product lines, from \nsatellite parts to surfboard material.\n  Finally, as demonstrated by the devastating Florida fires, combustion \nrepresents a threat in many forms. Fires cause 5,000 deaths and $26 \nbillion in property losses every year, a figure I am certain will be \nhigher due to the terrible losses we have suffered in Florida. How can \na space station help? In space, researchers can study flames without \nthe interference of the earth's gravity. Such studies will help us \nbetter understand how combustion happens and better address problems \nsuch as air pollution and forest fires.\n  The House and Senate share a vision for the future of space and we \nmust continue to act together on behalf of this visionary project. The \nfuture will soon be upon us. We don't want to see it pass us by. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against this amendment and endorse the \nInternational Space Station. We must not let the doubts of today stand \nin the way of the possibilities of tomorrow.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as the Senate considers funding for the \nInternational Space Station, I want to remind my colleagues about the \nachievements of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n(NASA).\n  Since 1915, American aviators, astronauts, and spacecrafts have \nexpanded human knowledge. The advancements made by NASA are found in \nvirtually every aircraft in use today. One example, used by Continental \nAirlines, is a NASA-developed device that warns of dangerous wind-shear \nconditions. In addition, NASA made valuable contributions to medicine \nby allowing scientists to utilize microgravity conditions in space to \ngrow larger breast cancer cells, allowing different growth stages of \nthese cells to be studied.\n  NASA technology has produced a pacemaker that can be programmed from \noutside the body and developed instruments to measure bone loss and \nbone density without penetrating the skin. NASA research led to the \ndevelopment of a three-inch implant for diabetes that provides more \nprecise control of blood sugar levels, thereby freeing diabetics from \nthe burden of daily insulin injections. These are just a few of the \nscientific and medical advances developed from NASA technology.\n  A panel of experts headed by aerospace consultant Jay Chabrow \nrecently concluded that the space station's cost through the assembly \nstage could be $24.7 billion, which is $3 billion more than NASA now \nprojects. While the overrun projected in the Chabrow report is a \nconcern, the estimate in the report is modest in historic terms. For \nexample, the initial contract for the lunar excursion module was $350 \nmillion. By the end of the contract, the cost had escalated to $2.3 \nbillion, seven times the original cost. For the entire Apollo, Mercury, \nand Gemini programs, NASA spent approximately $100 billion to reach the \nmoon. These programs, much like the International Space Station, \nventured into unknown territory and were considered inherently risky.\n  It is also important to note that while the panel indicated that \nthere may be cost overruns and schedule delays, the panel also \nrecognized that NASA's management of the Space Station has been \n``resourceful and effective'' in addressing the many challenges that \nhave resulted from this project. With over 400,000 pounds of flight \nhardware completed, NASA and its international partners believe that by \nthe end of this year, over half a million pounds will be completed and \nthe first two elements of the station will be in orbit. Although Russia \nhas only been able to complete 95 percent of the module, the Russian \ngovernment has reiterated its commitment to the station. However, NASA \ncontinues to evaluate other contingency plans to address possible \ndelays by Russia.\n  Once completed, the International Space Station will be the most \ncomplex structure ever sent into orbit, encompassing a laboratory and \nliving quarters the size of two football fields. As demonstrated by \nseveral experiments conducted on the Russian Mir space station, Skylab, \nand space shuttle flights, advancements in science will be enhanced by \nthe International Space Station. These experiments have been used to \ndetermine or refine existing protein structure models, create new drugs \nto battle viruses, such as AIDS, and develop inhibitors, such as those \nused to alleviate the complication of inflammation associated with \nheart surgery.\n  Mr. President, as I have mentioned, the importance of the \nInternational Space Station is evident. The technological advancements \nthat may be achieved by this project are monumental. I urge my \ncolleagues to continue funding the International Space Station and \nmaintain American's leadership in space research and exploration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to lend my support \nto the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Senator Bumpers has led a long, and often lonely, battle against the \nInternational Space Station. Since I joined this body in 1993, I have \nsupported his efforts to terminate the program on the basis of its \nextraordinary cost and its crushing burden on the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  We now see that the space station is not only far more expensive than \nprevious cost estimates, but also significantly behind schedule and \nlosing the support of partner nations, including the Russians failing \nto keep its financial commitments. The reasons for terminating the \nspace station are now more compelling than ever. Senator Bumpers has \nbeen prescient in his efforts to save our tax dollars on this wasteful \nprogram.\n  In a May, 1998, report, the General Accounting Office stated that the \nnew cost estimate for the space station had risen to almost $96 \nbillion. And this extraordinary cost doesn't even include the cost of \ndecommissioning and deorbiting the space station at the end of its \nuseful life. This, in and of itself, will cost billions more.\n  Even a NASA-appointed commission found that NASA's own cost estimates \nwere vastly underestimated. The blue ribbon Cost Assessment and \nValidation Task Force recently reported that the cost of simply \ndeveloping and building space station hardware will probably cost $24.7 \nbillion. Just last year, NASA officials promised Congress that \ndeveloping and building space station hardware would cost $17.4 \nbillion. Mr. President, how in the world did cost estimates rocket up \nby 42 percent in the course of one year?\n  The same blue ribbon panel also estimates it will take two years \nlonger to assemble the space station than NASA now plans. The report \npushes the completion of the space station back to early 2006. Let me \nremind my colleagues that in September, 1994, NASA said it would \ncomplete assembly of the space station by June, 2002. The schedule has \nslipped by four years, let me repeat, four years since 1994. \nIronically, NASA recently announced a delay in launching the first \npiece of the space station by five months. According to the commission, \neach month of delay will add about $100 million to the final cost of \nthe project.\n  Finally, Mr. President, NASA enlisted the support of Russia as a \nmeans\n\n[[Page S7551]]\n\nof fostering collaborative energy and as a means of defraying program \ncost. As we know, Russia is in the midst of economic instability and an \nunreliable space program, witness the problems with the Mir space \nstation.\n  NASA estimated that the American taxpayers would save $2 billion by \nworking with the Russians on this new space station. That savings is \nalready gone. On top of that, the Russian Space Agency doesn't even \nhave the money to safely deorbit Mir. How, then, can we safely rely on \nRussia to fulfill its obligations for the International Space Station?\n  Even our European partners in the European Space Agency are beginning \nto reconsider their commitment to the International Space Station. \nFrench Space Minister Claude Allegre said of the International Space \nStation project, ``People often do stupid things. There is no reason we \nshould applaud them.''\n  Fortunately, Congressional leaders are growing skeptical of NASA's \nplans. Last month, the chairman and ranking member of the House Science \nCommittee wrote the President asking for a plan for controlling cost \ngrowth and delays on the space station. Given the Administration's \nreluctance to offer such a plan and NASA's resistance to cutting back \nthe program, I don't see how we can support putting good money after \nbad.\n  Mr. President, it is time to end this program.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today the Senator from Arkansas takes his \nfinal shot at terminating funding for the International Space Station. \nFor the eighth consecutive year, he argues that America should abandon \nits commitment as the leader of this historic endeavor.\n  The Space Station is real and well on its way to orbit. Last year, \nNASA employees and contractors at the Marshall Space Flight Center in \nHuntsville, Alabama finished construction of Node 1, the first \nsignificant piece of flight hardware. Since then, the Pressurized \nMating Adapters, Integrated Electrical Assembly, Z1 Truss, Long Spacer, \nFGB Control Module are being prepared for integration tests and launch.\n  Those who do not believe that America should maintain its leadership \nin space exploration speak only of the expense of building man's next \ngreat adventure of the space age. While I also am concerned about cost \noverruns and Russian participation, it is reasonable to expect some \nunforeseen costs given the complexity of the station. The critics also \nfail to mention that past funding for the space station now exceeds \nproposed future investment. More than 50 percent of the costs have been \npaid, and more than 80 percent of the development will be complete by \nthe end of the current fiscal year. It does not make sense to abort \nthis mission at this time.\n  It goes without saying that termination of the International Space \nStation will undermine the credibility of the United States with its \ninternational partners who have already invested nearly $10 billion. \nThe other nations participating in the development of the space station \nreaffirmed their commitment by signing partner agreements in January \n1998. At the same time, the U.S. has taken the lead in developing the \nspace station and have made commitments to the international community \nto see it through. Leadership requires resolve and character. It is not \nin the American nature to break our promises and abandon our friends \nand partners, especially when we are on the verge of launching the \nfirst elements of the space station.\n  Continued development of the space station is the right course for \nthe United States to take. The history of mankind, and especially of \nAmericans, is one of curiosity and exploration. The same pioneer spirit \nthat led past generations to explore the frontiers has manifest itself \nin our present journey to space. The United States is the undisputed \nleader in space technology development, and it would be arbitrary and \nreckless for the Senate to reject our destiny of discovery through the \nspace station. I ask my colleagues to join me in reaffirming our \ncountry's commitment to our future by opposing this shortsighted \nattempt to strip funding from the space station.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think the majority leader has asked for \ntime. We ask unanimous consent he be granted such time, not to be \ncharged against the debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I do this in order to introduce a resolution. I am \njoining today with Senator Torricelli and a number of others in \nintroducing a resolution on Taiwan. I ask now that additional \ncosponsors be added to this resolution until the end of business today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lott and Mr. Torricelli pertaining to the \nsubmission of S. Con. Res. 107 are printed in today's Record under \n``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to my colleague from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for \nyielding the time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the Bumpers \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bumpers \namendment, and I join him in his 8th year of travail on what I think \nhas been an important provision. When I came to Congress in 1993, I \ncame with great alarm about the cost overruns, the delays, the \nprojected increases in spending, and what appeared to be a black hole \nabsorbing precious taxpayer dollars. I also came with a willingness to \nbe convinced that was going to change. I was promised that they were \ngoing to tighten their belts, slim it down and trim it down, that it \nwas going to become a responsible kind of program and project. Well, \nthe most recent GAO report--the 1998 GAO report--has convinced me that \nwe need to cut our losses, that it is not going to happen, that it has \nnot happened and, in fact, the projections are that we are going to \ncontinue to see exorbitant cost increases if we continue down the road \nof building the space station.\n  My colleague from Maryland spoke much of the value of microgravity \nand the need for the space station and microgravity research. I would \nlike to quote Professor Robert Park of the Department of Physics at the \nUniversity of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. Doctor Park said:\n\n       Microgravity is the only unique property of a space station \n     environment, and the station was originally envisioned as a \n     sort of microgravity R laboratory. The microgravity \n     research that was envisioned for the international space \n     station has already been largely completed, either on the \n     shuttle or on Mir.\n\n  So there you have it. The original and primary justification for \nbuilding the space station has largely been realized by ongoing R, \neither on the shuttle or on Mir.\n  By cutting the international space station's lifeline, today the \nSenate has the opportunity to save billions of dollars that have been \nfloating away now for over a decade. I want to commend Senator Bumpers \nfor his resolve, for his eloquence, and for his persistence on this \nissue. My distinguished colleague from Maryland said that in \nappreciation for Senator Bumpers' efforts, he had turned on the yellow \nlight. I can only say that what we need to do is turn on the red light \non this project. It needs to be a stop light.\n  From fiscal year 1985 to fiscal year 1997, it has already cost the \nAmerican people $19 billion. In its current form, the Senate \nappropriations bill would pour another $2.3 billion into this project. \nMy distinguished colleague from Arkansas has offered an amendment to \nthe VA-HUD appropriations bill which would end this cycle of waste. The \nBumpers amendment would provide $850 million for the termination of the \nInternational Space Station, make $450 million available to HUD, and \nmost important, redirect $1 billion of the savings from the \nspace station and make that money available to the Veterans' Health \nAdministration medical care account.\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\n  Since its inception, the International Space Station has become a \nlooming monstrosity of skyrocketing costs and scientific \nindefensibility. According to the latest GAO estimate, this will now \ncost the American taxpayers $96 billion. That is up $2 billion from \n1995--only 3 years ago. This enormous figure includes the costs of \ndesign, construction, launching, and 10 years of operation, but it does \nnot include future schedule slippage, additional shuttle launches to \ntest the crew return vehicle, deconstruction at the end of the \nstation's life, as well as possible delays by our partners on their \nobligations to the project. With these additional factors, the space \nstation will undoubtedly take several more years and several billion \nmore taxpayer dollars. It is a record we have seen time after time on \nthe space station.\n  Costs have been increasing steadily. So far, the American people have \npaid $19 billion into the project. Since the space station was \nconceived, cost estimates have risen dramatically. Under the original \nspace station concept, space station Freedom, the Reagan administration \nestimated a cost of $8 billion in 1983. NASA's estimate rose to $16 \nbillion by 1987. By 1993, the cost of developing and building the space \nstation Freedom rose to $30 billion, with an additional $60 billion for \n30 years of operation. In the same year, the GAO estimated a grand \ntotal of $118 billion for all space station costs, including launches. \nNow, under the revised concept of the International Space Station, NASA \nestimated $72 billion in costs, including 10 years of operations and \nshuttle costs. Those are a lot of figures. What is the American \ntaxpayer to think? What are they to believe?\n  In the past 3 years, the GAO's cost estimate for the station has \nincreased by $1.7 billion. You can believe that. From $93.9 billion in \nJune of 1995 to $95.6 billion in April of 1998. Why have the costs \nincreased? According to Allen Li, Associate Director of Defense \nAcquisitions at the GAO, during his June 24, 1998, testimony before the \nHouse Science Committee, there are a number of factors why that \nhappened.\n\n       The higher development costs--$21.9 billion [1998] versus \n     $17.4 billion [1995]--are attributable to schedule delays, \n     additional prime contractor effort, not covered by funding \n     reserves, additional crew return vehicle costs, and costs \n     incurred as a result of delays in the Russian-made Service \n     Module.\n\n  My colleague spoke eloquently about Russia's role in the space \nstation and their delays in the cost overruns, and the fact that they \nsimply are not capable of bearing their share of this burden.\n  In other words, schedule delays and increased shuttle flights have \ndriven costs up dramatically. Unfortunately, these delays are not new \nto the space station project. Phase II of the project, which involves \nconstruction of a U.S.-Russian space station that can be permanently \noccupied by three astronauts, was originally scheduled to occur from \n1997 to 1998. NASA pushed phase II to occur from 1998 to 2000. Phase \nIII, which involves additional construction, including the addition of \nEuropean, Japanese and Canadian components, has been postponed from \n1998 through 2002 to the years 2000 through 2004. The first launch for \nphase II was originally scheduled for November of 1997, later postponed \nto June of 1998, and is now scheduled for November of 1998. The \ncompletion date for the station, originally scheduled for June of 2002, \nthen 2003, is now scheduled for January of 2004. On and on we could go \nwith these delays.\n  Clearly, delays and launches are likely to increase, driving costs \neven to newer heights. There is much that I would like to say. When I \ncame up here, NASA lobbied me hard, telling me that though there had \nbeen mistakes and there had been cost overruns, they were going to \ntighten their belt, that it was going to be a new kind of project with \na new kind of fiscal austerity. I believe that the GAO report, in \naddition to the cost assessment and validation task force that gave a \nsimilar report, provides compelling evidence that NASA is not capable \nor is unwilling to make those kinds of tough decisions. This is a \nproject it is time to end.\n  I remember all of the eloquent arguments that my colleague from the \nHouse side from the State of Texas made in defense of the Super \nCollider. ``We have to have the Super Collider.'' Almost every argument \nI heard today was made in defense of the Super Collider and the \nbenefits, the spinoff benefits, we were going to receive in society. \nCongress made a tough decision that it could be better used in other \nforms of scientific research, and we cut our losses.\n  I cite the Cost Assessment and Validation Task Force established by \nNASA in September 1997 to independently review and assess the cost \nschedules and performance schedules on the International Space Station. \nThat was led by Mr. Jay Chabrow. They issued a report this past April. \nThis is what they said. The most optimistic estimate of the cost growth \nfor the space station was over $2.195 billion. The most pessimistic \nestimate was $7.5 billion. It estimated that it will take 2 years \nlonger to assemble the space station, pushing the completion date to \n2006. Personnel requirements spiral from 1,285 originally predicted, to \nover 2,000.\n  I would say to my conservative friends on the Republican side of the \naisle that we were not sent up here to build up more government. We \nwere not sent up here to support projects that are good sounding, that \nhave noble objectives, but have a track record of wasting taxpayer \ndollars. That is not why we were sent up here. That is the record of \nthis project. If we just step back and set aside our conservative \nRepublican prejudices on this issue, and ask if it were any other \nproject, would we defend it; were it any other project with these kind \nof cost overruns, delays, and wasteful spending record, would we defend \nit? I would suggest to you we would not. But this is our little baby \nthat we are going to protect at all costs regardless of how much \ntaxpayer dollars it wastes. We were not sent up to float a barrel of \npork in outer space.\n  I want to say one other thing before I end my remarks. We go from the \nextraterrestrial to the terrestrial, because I think it is good that we \nare taking $1 billion of what is being wasted on this project and \nputting it toward veterans health care.\n  There are 26 million veterans in this country. We hear from them. We \nhear of the waiting lines. We have 173 hospitals, and we have not built \na new one in a long, long time. We are rightly moving to outpatient \ncare. We cannot open enough clinics for veterans. We cannot make health \ncare accessible enough. The average age of veterans is increasing, \nnecessitating more frequent care and longer convalescence. These are \ngoing to be greater needs as the World War II generation of veterans \nfaces greater and greater health care needs. The increased demand in \ncare strains the resources of VA medical facilities. Many of them have \nto drive many miles to get health care. High-quality medical personnel \nshy away from VA hospitals because they find them less appealing and \nless lucrative. Nurse practitioners rather than doctors have become the \nnorm in many VA facilities.\n  This is an opportunity for us to do a service to this country by \nstopping a program that needs to be stopped. This is not--and I \nemphasize this is not--an antiscience, an antitechnology vote. NASA \nwill continue to have over $11 billion in fiscal year 1999. This is a \nprotechnology Congress. We consistently voted for increased funding for \nNIH and NAS, the National Academy of Sciences. This is not an \nantiscience and antitechnology vote. It is a vote to say here is one \narea that has been so egregious in wasteful spending that we draw the \nline, we cut our losses, we stop the bleeding, and we are going to take \nthose savings and put it in where we know it is going to be an \ninvestment in human beings in VA health care.\n\n  Michael Daly, a seventh grader from Sherwood, AR, wrote me a letter \nasking me the value of a future in the military. Do you know what that \nyoung seventh grader is thinking about? He is thinking not only about \nour commitment to our Armed Forces, but how well we are going to meet \nour commitment to our men and women who have served as they leave the \narmed services and as they become the veterans of this country. Are we \ngoing to remember them?\n  This is an opportunity for us to do a twin service to our veterans \nand to the taxpayers of this country in stopping an indefensible \nwasteful spending program. I urge my colleagues to support\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\nSenator Bumpers, who has been sometimes a lonely voice in pointing to \nthe catastrophic waste in the space station, and join us in ending that \nprogram this year and support our veterans at the same time.\n  I thank my colleague from Arkansas for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri submitted a written \nunanimous consent agreement to include material that he did not state \norally; namely a prohibition against second-degree amendments to \namendment number 3062. Did he mean that to be a part of this unanimous \nconsent agreement?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes. Mr. President, we amended that written statement as it \nfirst appeared to ask that it be a straight up-or-down vote on the \nBumpers amendment pursuant to the request raised by the Senator from \nArkansas who said there would not be any other motion.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The material is a prohibition against second-\ndegree amendments. Does the Senator from Missouri wish to include \nsecond-degree amendments?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes. We included in the amendment that there would be no \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Missouri for \nyielding.\n  Mr. President, it is certainly true that Congress has terminated many \nscience programs in the recent past. In fact, in 1965 we were investing \n5.7 cents out of every dollar spent by the Federal Government in non-\ndefense research in science and technology. But as a result of \npolitical decisions that have been made for more than 30 years, we are \nnow investing only 1.9 cents out of every dollar of government spending \nin science and technology research for the future.\n  You have to ask the question when so many of our colleagues are so \nquick to point out that they are not antiscience--and I believe them--\nhow is it that the science budget in the budget of the U.S. Government, \na budget which has exploded since 1965--``exploded'' is the only word \nfor it--how is it that as the total budget has grown in leaps and \nbounds, our commitment to invest in science and technology and to \ninvest in the future has declined from 5.7 percent of the Federal \nbudget to 1.9 percent?\n  I submit, Mr. President, that our colleagues, Members of the House \nand Senate, are not antiscience. Their problem, however, is that they \nare constantly forced to choose in the process of spending the \ntaxpayers' money between spending that money on programs that have big \nconstituencies in the next election and investing that money in science \nand technology in the future that really has a constituency in the next \ngeneration. The problem with maintaining science and technology \nspending is that the value only comes in the future, whereas by \nspending money on programs with big political constituencies, the \nbenefits politically come in the next election. The next election now \nis only a few months away.\n  It is not that Congress doesn't value investment in science and \ntechnology that would develop new products and new technologies, new \nknow-how, and a scientific base that can create jobs in the 21st \ncentury and perhaps yield a capacity to heal some dreaded disease. It \nis that the benefits of such spending don't appear between now and \nNovember 3rd. They come to fruition over long periods of time as a \nresult of the accumulation of scientific knowledge. Our problem, then, \nis not that Congress is antiscience, but that Congress invests in the \nnext election rather than the next generation.\n  The amendment we have before us is an old amendment. We have debated \nthis subject on many occasions. This is just the latest version of a \nlong debate. But basically what the amendment before us proposes that \nwe do is to cut the Nation's premier science project, and to use the \nmoney to invest in two programs that have very large and vocal \nconstituencies. Both of these programs are good programs. They both are \nobviously very desirable. But the point is that we have a very limited \nscience budget now. It has been reduced from 5.7 percent of our budget \nin 1965 to 1.9 percent today, and this latest effort to reduce it \nfurther comes at the very time when we are beginning to get interest in \nthe country in an initiative to double our expenditure on science and \ntechnology and research, because we believe investment in the future is \ncritically important if we are going to continue to lead the world in \nscience and technology job creation. I think this amendment is simply a \nmovement in the wrong direction.\n  I do not doubt the sincerity of our colleague from Arkansas. He has \noffered this amendment, it is my understanding, for 8 years. It seems \nwe have debated it for a longer period of time than that.\n  I remind my colleagues that we have killed science projects. We \nkilled the SSC. We have cut science expenditures in real dollar terms \nin virtually every area of the Federal budget. But the question is, \nHave we benefited as a nation from doing that? We killed the premier \nscientific project in the world when we killed the SSC, which was high-\nenergy physics aimed at understanding the fundamental building blocks \nof nature. And while understanding atomic physics does not sound very \nsexy in Congress, I remind my colleagues that 40 percent of the GNP of \nour country is now based on scientific research that has occurred \nmostly in America since the 1920s and where high-energy physics has \nyielded products from the computer to the television.\n  So the point is that when America was investing in those programs, \nthey were going to yield benefits 10 or 20 or 30 years in the future. \nThey have always been politically disadvantaged. I would simply like to \nconclude by reminding my colleagues, we have an enormous Federal \nbudget. We are spending a lot of money on programs that have big, \npowerful, political constituencies, and in a sense, politics is about \nlistening and responding to those constituencies.\n  But I remind my colleague that there is another constituency, and \nthat constituency is called the future. America has invested more money \nin science than any country in the history of the world, and in my \nopinion, there are two principal things that are responsible for the \nunique achievements of America. One is we have had a country with \nbroad-based opportunities so ordinary people could do extraordinary \nthings, and the other has been an investment in and a commitment to \nscience. I think we are moving away from that commitment. I think we \nhave already moved too far. I wish we were here today debating cutting \nother programs to invest in science and technology in the future, but \nwe are here talking about terminating the premier scientific project in \nAmerica which we have undertaken with many nations around the world.\n  I hope and trust this amendment will be defeated, and it should be \ndefeated. This amendment will not lower federal spending by a nickel. \nThis amendment simply reduces money going to the space station and to \nscience and technology and to the future. So for that reason, I oppose \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Alaska has a \nunanimous-consent request to speak as if in morning business.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nspeak as if in morning business for not more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the submission of S. Con. \nRes. 107 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent \nand Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOND. I yield to my distinguished colleague from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield my distinguished colleague from \nIowa 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me this \ntime. More than that, I thank Senator Bumpers for his relentless \npursuit, over the years, of shedding more and more light on this issue \nof the space station. I say at the outset that a vote for the Bumpers \namendment is a vote for space exploration. A vote against Bumpers is a \nvote for the status quo. It is a vote for the myopic approach to space \nexploration and it is a vote for wasteful spending for science that can \nbe done better and cheaper.\n  I am foursquare with Senator Bumpers on his approach on the space \nstation. It is a boondoggle and a waste of money. Maybe Senator Bumpers \nand I are not foursquare on the issue of space exploration itself. That \nmay be for another time and another debate. But on this issue, Senator \nBumpers is absolutely right.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of aviation, aviation research, \naviation technology, pushing the boundaries of aviation technology \nthrough science and technology and also for space. For 10 years, I \nserved in the House on the House Science and Technology Committee. I \nwas proud to chair the Aviation and Materials Subcommittee of that \ncommittee. I was proud to work to try to get more and more funds for \nspace exploration. But I watched, during those 10 years in the House on \nthe Science and Technology Committee, I watched in dismay as NASA \nshifted, gradually but determinatively, shifted from a civilian space \nagency to an arm of the military. That can be seen through the way that \nthe space agency shifted in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It became \nmore and more an arm of the Air Force. It became more and more an arm \nof our military establishment.\n  I can remember the debates we had on that in the Science and \nTechnology Committee back in the mid-1970s. I kind of understood that. \nWe were in a cold war with the Soviet Union. Space was being used more \nand more for military purposes--spy satellites, that kind of thing. But \nanother interesting thing happened. We began to develop a thing called \nthe space shuttle, which I believe was driven more by the desire of Air \nForce pilots to fly than anything else. I think it was driven more by \nthe desire to be more than just a monkey sitting on a seat.\n  I remember when the first shuttle took off. I was there for the \nlaunch, and I remember we had the first shuttle astronauts back in the \ncommittee room for a hearing. I remember Neil Armstrong was there. One \nCongressmen stated how proud he was to see them land with dignity as \nthey came back, rather than plopping in the ocean as they used to in \nthe space capsules. I thought at the time, what a tremendous \nexpenditure of money just so that we could land that thing on a runway \nrather than plopping it in the ocean.\n  Let's remember, the first man to set foot on the Moon was not a \nmilitary person, it was a civilian, a civilian test pilot by the name \nof Neil Armstrong, and that was not happenstance. It was not an \naccident that happened that way, because we believed and our Government \nbelieved at that time that space should be a civilian exploration \nenterprise. Then we watched as two things happened; as NASA became more \nand more militarized and as we retreated from Moon exploration to near-\nEarth orbits.\n  Then we were sold the space shuttle. Oh, it was going to be a great \nflying machine. It was going to reduce the cost of launching material \ninto near-Earth orbit by a factor of 10. I remember being told that. I \nwas on the Science and Technology Committee. It was going to reduce \nlaunch cost by a factor of 10. We were going to have these reusable \nrockets and all that kind of stuff. We are still waiting. We are still \nwaiting for that factor of 10 reduction. It has never happened.\n  I am convinced today, perhaps more than I was at that time, that the \nshuttle should never have been built. I am convinced that, had we not \ngone ahead with the space shuttle but had commenced and continued our \nspace exploration with the Saturn, that we could have had a fully \noperational Moon base at this time with all that would mean for the \nworld and for our country and, yes, for science and technology.\n\n  Now, that brings me to the present time. If we build this space \nstation for $98 billion and counting, it will effectively suck all of \nthe dollars out of space exploration. That is why I said, in an oddly \ncurious way, a vote for the Bumpers amendment is a vote for space \nexploration. A vote against him--forget about it. You are not going to \ndo anything in space, because this is going to suck all the money out \nof it. Suck money out for what, scientific experiments?\n  I listened to the speech given on the floor by my good friend, \nSenator Glenn from Ohio, on all of the wonderful science that is going \nto be done and the experimentation. We estimate the cost per man-hour \nfor those scientific experiments to be about $155,000 per man-hour. NIH \ncan do it for less than $300 an hour. The Senator from Ohio says, \n``Just think how much this is going to energize young people to go into \nscience and into medical research.'' If you want to encourage young \npeople to go into medical research in this country, take that kind of \nmoney and put it into NIH. You will hire thousands of times more \nresearchers doing that than you will spending $155,000 per man-hour for \nscientific research on this space station. Put the money into NIH.\n  I think it is time to cut our losses. Do you know what this reminds \nme of, I say to Senator Bumpers, this debate we are having on the space \nstation and listening to Senator Gramm from Texas? It reminds me of the \ndebates we had on something called the Clinch River breeder reactor. \nHow many years we debated that; how much good it was going to do for \nour country and the science and the research. Billions of dollars we \npoured down the rat hole on that one. We finally terminated it. We came \nto our senses and terminated it. How many billions of dollars, though, \ndid we waste?\n  And then, most recently, something called the Superconducting Super \nCollider that was going to be built in Texas. Oh, my gosh, to listen to \nthe debates that went on around this floor about that--why, if we ended \nthat one, all science was going to come to a halt. Why, building the \nSuperconducting Super Collider was going to unlock and unravel the \nmysteries of the universe for us. Nonsense. Stuff and nonsense, that is \nwhat it was.\n  We came to our senses and we killed it--rightfully so, because the \nSuperconducting Super Collider would have had the same effect on \nphysical sciences as the space station is going to have on medical \nscience. It is going to suck all the money right out of it, because \nonce you build the space station, then you have to justify it. How do \nyou justify it? Through medical research at $155,000 per man-hour. \nWhere is the money going to come from for NIH? Where is the money going \nto come from for the research that has to be done here? It will not be \nleft around. This will do to medical research just what the \nSuperconducting Super Collider would have done to physical science \nresearch. And that is why so many physicists and scientists were \nopposed to the Superconducting Super Collider. They were right. That is \nwhy so many scientists are opposed to the space station. They are \nright. It is time to cut our losses.\n  I remember--I was not here then, but I know my history--back in the \n1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission, the head of it, Lewis Strauss, \ntestified before a Senate committee and said that atomic energy would \nbe so cheap in making electricity we wouldn't even have to meter it. We \nare still waiting. But look at the billions of dollars that we have \nspent on nuclear power. I am not saying it hasn't done some good, that \nwe don't get power from it. My gosh, we are still fighting the battles \nof what we are going to do with the waste. Of course, we know now it is \nmore expensive than anything else. If we build this space station, \nforget about it, there will be no money left.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I can have an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield an additional 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The microgravity kind of research that has been talked \nabout can be done on the shuttle. We don't need a space station to do \nthat. Or it can be done other ways.\n  In 1994, Mr. President, I read an article that was in Discover \nmagazine and became entranced with it. Just today, I had a long talk on \nthe phone with Ed Belbruno, a former NASA mathematician. He has devised \na new way of space\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\nexploration. I won't go into it. I don't have the time. I think it is \nfascinating, however.\n  Because of his theories, we could use 40 percent less energy to go to \nthe Moon and beyond--40 percent less--and it has already been proven. \nHe did it once already in the early nineties. The Japanese space agency \nis looking at it more, and so are the Europeans. I am sure my friend \nfrom Ohio will recognize it by using what we call the ``weak stability \nboundary theory.''\n  I won't go into all the theories of it, but physically it is \nfascinating about how we can use the gravity of the Sun, the Moon, and \nthe Earth to launch vehicles from here to the Moon or to Mars or beyond \nand use 40 percent less energy.\n  What that means is today we have the ability to return to the Moon \nand beyond using a lot less than we did before. Think of the excitement \nin that. Think of what we can do with exploration if we actually build \na Moon base. Think of what that will mean in terms of scientific \nresearch and technological advancements. Think of what that will mean \nto us if we want to explore the universe, not from the space station, \nthat is not going to help it one single bit, but now we have the theory \nand it has been proven; it has already been done once.\n  Mr. President, this weekend I was in Iceland. It occurred to me that \nin about the year 900, around the year 1000, Leif Ericson sailed to the \nNew World, from Norway to Iceland to Greenland to Newfoundland, almost \nall the way down to what we now consider to be New York City. And they \ndid it for years. Almost 500 years later, Christopher Columbus decided \nto go a different route, and it took him forever.\n  But you see, the Vikings had it right. They could sail the North Sea \non the new great circle route, come to the New World, turn around, and \ncatch the Gulf Stream and zip back. They had it figured out. You can't \nhardly blame Columbus. They didn't have it figured out. They didn't \nknow. They sailed the southern ocean, down through the doldrums, and it \ntook them a long time. They never quite figured it out. The Vikings \ndid. You can't really blame Christopher Columbus. They didn't have that \nknowledge.\n  You can't blame us. We now know that there are cheaper and better \nroutes for space exploration than building a space station. We know \nthat there are better and cheaper ways of doing microgravity research \nthan on a space station. We know there are better and cheaper ways of \ndoing medical research than spending $155,000 per man-hour on the space \nstation.\n  If we rush ahead with this space station, we have no one to blame but \nourselves. I ask my colleagues to think back to the promises of the \nfifties when we were going to meet our energy needs so cheaply with \nnuclear power. Think about the Clinch River breeder reactor and how \nmany votes were cast for that and all the promises it was going to give \nus. Think about the Superconducting Super Collider and what that was \ngoing to do for us. And then think about the scientists who opposed the \nClinch River breeder reactor. Think about the scientists who opposed \nthe Superconducting Super Collider. And now think about the scientists \nwho oppose this space station.\n  Senator Bumpers had it right. I saw a quote that he sent around in a \n``Dear Colleague'' letter where the scientists were saying, basically, \nwhy would you want to spend so much money on something--here it is, \nDiscover magazine. Here we are back to my favorite magazine:\n\n       Is it possible to imagine a technological undertaking so \n     enormous that could garner less respect from the scientific \n     community?\n\n  Discover magazine, May 1997.\n  They know why. If we build this space station, it is going to suck so \nmuch money out of here, there won't be anything left. Oh, I suppose, as \nSenator Bumpers said, it will lose. I hope not. I hope it wins. I hope \nwe come to our senses.\n  I do believe this: The space station is not going to be built. It \nwill never be completed. We may put up a module. We will do some \nshuttle flights. The Russians will never come through with their, what, \n50 flights or 60 flights? Forget about it, the Russians are not going \nto do it. They don't have the money. So who is going to pick up that \nslack? Our taxpayers? We can take that $98 billion and start \nmultiplying it out.\n  That is why I say today, this will be like Clinch River; it will be \nlike the Superconducting Super Collider. We built some trenches down \nthere. We spent a couple billion dollars on it. We spent a couple \nbillion on the Clinch River breeder reactor also, and we finally came \nto our senses and said it was a boondoggle. That is what will happen \nwith the space station. It is not going to be built, but what we can do \nis take this money and do something a lot cheaper and a lot better than \nbuilding the space station.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator from Maryland wish the floor?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If we are going to rotate time, I know that the Senator \nfrom Ohio had a few minutes that he wanted to use. I yield the Senator \nfrom Ohio no more than 5 minutes for his comments.\n  Mr. GLENN. Just 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I thank the floor manager of the bill, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  I want to make a point on a comment that was made by the other \nSenator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, about the cost overruns and \nthe budget situation, because the Chabrow task force report has been \nalluded to today, sometimes correctly and sometimes incorrectly.\n  In this case, it was referred to incorrectly because, contrary to the \nassertion that the program has a large overrun, the Chabrow task force \nreported that the program was--and this is a quote:\n\n       Diligent and resourceful in managing the unique challenges \n     of this complex venture given the significant complexity and \n     uncertainty of international involvement and the difficult \n     task of staying within annual and total funding caps \n     established prior to final program content definition.\n\n  That indicates that there has been very responsible management. That \nis in the Chabrow task force report.\n  Further, the task force stated, referring to the ISS, the \nInternational Space Station Program specifically, and their quote is \nout of their report:\n\n       Although cost and schedule growth have occurred, the \n     magnitude of such growth has not been unusual, even when \n     compared with other developmental programs of lesser \n     complexity.\n\n  I think that is a compliment. I think we should also note that many \ndefense research and development programs have exceeded development \ncost estimates by 20 to 40 percent, way out of the ball park of what we \nare talking about here, which indicates to me that major technical \ndevelopmental programs have a degree of complexity that makes cost \nassessment very, very difficult--the point that I made in my original, \nmore lengthy statement.\n  We need to keep in mind what the Chabrow report said in their task \nforce report, which is, to my way of thinking, complimentary to NASA \nabout how they managed this program and kept things under control. NASA \npersonnel numbers are way, way down. The NASA budget has been flat over \nthe last couple of years, and yet we have gone ahead with more \nefficient management within NASA and I think they should be \ncomplimented for given the complex management environment in which they \nhave to work. So the Chabrow report has been quoted here today, but I \nthink the two quotes out of the Chabrow report should be noted.\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me remind my colleagues of how this \nall started. This is a classic case of a space station looking for \njustification. This chart shows where we started years ago, with a crew \nsize of eight and a cost of $8 billion. Here are the capabilities we \nwere told that the space station would have.\n  First of all, it would be a staging base to go on to Mars with. Carl \nSagan said that was a justification for it. He didn't think much of its \nresearch potential. But as a staging base to Mars, he thought it was a \ngreat idea.\n  A manufacturing facility--make gallium arsenide crystals, I suppose; \nspace-based observatory; a transportation node; a servicing facility, \nto\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\nservice shuttles or whoever might come up to visit the space station; \nassembly facility--I don't know what they were going to assemble; a \nstorage facility.\n  One by one, every single one of those missions was eliminated as a \njustification for the space station. We have one remaining, and that is \na research laboratory. So that is the reason you hear about how we are \ngoing to cure AIDS, cancer, and all these magnificent things that will \nhappen in medical research in the space station--because that is the \nlast only justification anybody can dream up.\n  If you are having difficulty with that, write NASA and ask \nAdministrator Goldin to send you a copy of his Chamber of Commerce \nglossy. It has it all in here. It has it all. If you are a \nconservative--and most people in this body profess to be \nconservatives--and you have any pang of conscience about spending $100 \nbillion for a boondoggle, for utterly no redeemable purpose, if you are \nhaving problems with that, write to NASA and get their glossy brochure. \nIt will just make you sleep so much better.\n  Mr. President, I can remember, as the Senator from Iowa has pointed \nout, it took me 4 years to kill the Clinch River breeder. Howard Baker \nwas majority leader, and no matter how close we got, he always had two \nmore votes he could pull out of his pocket. I remember that fateful \ndate when we had too many votes for him to pull out of his hip pocket, \nand he turned everybody loose, and we got 75 or 80 votes to torpedo the \nClinch River breeder. Who has lost any sleep about the Clinch River \nbreeder? And we saved billions. Everybody said, ``They have broken \nground; it is too late. We can't quit now; we have our nose under the \ntent.'' We quit, and it has been God's blessing ever since we did.\n  The Superconducting Super Collider, the gigantic hole in the ground \nin Texas--all I can think about is the Senator from Texas, the senior \nSenator from Texas, who defended the hole in the ground until the last \ndog died. I was arguing all along that there was a superconducting \nsuper collider in Switzerland, at the European consortium called CERN. \nNo, the SSC's supporters said, our's got to be bigger than that one; \ngot to be more expensive than that; got to have a 50-mile racetrack; \nnone of that 20 mile racetrack business. We finally killed it after we \nspent $2 billion. And who here has lost any sleep over the \nSuperconducting Super Collider? Everybody ought to rejoice every night \nthat we saved $10 billion.\n  So now here we go. How can a good conservative justify the kind of \ncost overruns we are looking at? How can you justify $100 billion when \nyou think of the unmet needs in health care and education in this \ncountry? This program as a research vehicle is precisely 1,000 times \nless effective than doing the same research on Earth. So you ask, why \nare we doing it?\n  The Senator from Texas has a very legitimate reason for standing on \nthe floor and defending the space station. Texas gets $661 million a \nyear out of it. In all candor, I might be standing here up here arguing \non the other side if Arkansas got $661 million a year. For my \ncolleagues who think you have a few jobs in your State, 85 percent of \nthis money goes to Alabama, Texas, and California. The rest of you are \njust barely a layer; you are nothing.\n\n  If you consider yourselves a conservative but only when it fits your \nconvenience, you go ahead and vote against my amendment. But if you say \nyou are a conservative and you don't believe in squandering billions \nand billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money, ask yourself a very \nsimple question: What is your threshold? How high would this thing have \nto go before you would have to rethink your position? Forty-three \npercent cost overrun, just to build it on the ground? Is that not \ntroubling to you? Is the $7.3 billion overrun just announced in the \npast 8 months, is that not troubling to you? Is the fact that we are \nalready acknowledging a $7.3 billion cost overrun and headed in for the \nlaunching of this thing into space, and depending on the Russians for \n49 launches, does that bother you? Who here believes that the Russians \nwill be a player in this 1 year from now? They are not going to meet \ntheir deadline right now for launching the service module or what they \ncall the functional cargo.\n  If we are going to keep the Russians in the program, buy them out \nright now. They are not going to participate. They can't. Let me \nreiterate. The Russian Cosmodrome at Baikonur, the principal launching \nplace, which is in Kazakhstan, has the electricity cut off because they \ndon't pay their bills. How can you launch a space station from a \ncosmodrome that has had its utilities cut off?\n  My junior colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, invited you to \nread the GAO report. Let me add the Congressional Research Service \nreport to that. You don't have to believe what I say or what Senator \nHarkin said or Senator Hutchinson. Read the reports that you always \nrely on, and see what they say.\n  Take a look at this chart. This summarizes the so-called Chabrow \nreport. The Chabrow Commission was appointed by Dan Goldin to analyze \nthe space station. They were appointed by Goldin, and Jay Chabrow is \nconsidered one of the best space technology analysts in America. He \nsays it will not cost $17.4 billion as NASA promised as recently as \nlast year; it will cost $24.7 billion--a little over $7.3 billion cost \noverrun. How many children in America could you educate with that? How \nmany teachers' salaries could you educate with that? How many \nclassrooms could you build with that? How many students could you cut \nout of classrooms with $7 billion? We act like it is nothing around \nhere. Nobody even gasps; nobody drew a deep breath when I started \nthrowing these figures out.\n  I commend my distinguished colleague from Maryland, and I thank her \nmost heartily and profoundly for her kind words about my efforts on \nthis. She mentioned the yellow lights that I had thrown up. I attended \na meeting that she and the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee \nallowed me to attend, and in that hearing--incidentally, Daniel Goldin \nwas testifying--I asked this question: ``Mr. Goldin, is there a \nthreshold for you? Is there a figure beyond which you are not willing \nto go? Is there a cost figure on the space station you are not willing \nto go beyond?'' He must have paused at least 15 seconds. Finally, he \nsaid, ``I really hadn't thought about it.''\n  I have thought a lot about it. I have thought almost of nothing else \nsince I started working on this.\n  So I ask my colleagues, what is your threshold? In 1984, when Ronald \nReagan first started talking about a space station at $8 billion, and \nnow we are talking about $100 billion.\n  Let me show you something. You see this $98 billion figure here? That \nis not all of it. No. 1, the cost overruns are going to skyrocket from \nhere on. But even if they didn't, this does not include getting the \nspace station down. Add $3 billion for that. So you are already well \nover $100 billion. When Ronald Reagan said it would be $8 billion to \nbuild this thing, I can only shutter to think what Ronald Reagan might \nthink today if his $8 million was up to $100 billion. The conservatives \nwho were in the Senate when Ronald Reagan was President would be \ngasping for breath. Nobody ever believed we were headed for such a \npickle.\n  If you believe that all the premier scientists in America don't know \nwhat they are talking about when they say microgravity research is of \nmicro importance, vote no, vote against my amendment. If you think we \nare already spending enough at NIH on cancer, Alzheimer's, \ncardiovascular illnesses, vote no. If you think $11.5 million per man-\nhour for every hour of research that goes on in the space station is \nreasonable, vote against my amendment. That is right, $11.5 million an \nhour--as the Senator from Iowa has already said, at NIH you can get \nresearchers who are the best in the country for $300 an hour. Divide \nthe man-hours for research that you are going to get for this program \nfor 10 years into $100 billion, it comes out to a cool $11.5 million \nper man-hour.\n  Is nobody disturbed by this?\n  Mr. President, I am reluctant to start reading it to you again. But I \ndo want to quote Dr. Robert Park, a professor of physics at the \nUniversity of Maryland and who has long been the spokesman for the \nAmerican Physical Society, which is all the physicists in America. Here \nis what he said while testifying before a committee in the House on \nJuly 1, 1993. He was speaking\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\nfor the American Physical Society, which is 40,000 physicists. I \npromise you that virtually every one of them--except those who are \nemployed by NASA--are opposed to this. Dr. Park, in testimony, speaking \nfor all those physicists, said:\n\n       It is in the view of the American Physical Society that \n     scientific justification is lacking for a permanently manned \n     space station in Earth's orbit. We are concerned that the \n     potential contribution of a manned space station to the \n     physical sciences has been greatly overstated and that many \n     of the scientific objectives currently planned for the space \n     station could be accomplished more effectively, with a much \n     lower cost, on Earth.\n\n  It goes on and on. He has a magnificent statement. He says:\n\n       The only unique property for the space station environment \n     is microgravity. In 23 years of research, it has found little \n     to no advantage from such an environment.\n\n  Mr. President, what are we afraid of? Here we have a chance to save \n$80 billion. That ``ain't'' beanbags. We are going to spend an \nadditional $80 billion minimum on this program, plus the 20-something \nbillion we have already spent. If we continue to rely on the Russians, \nyou can depend on the space station costing $120 billion to $150 \nbillion, easily--the most monumentally expensive scientific undertaking \nin the history of the world, all at the expense of the taxpayers.\n  I plead with you--plead with you--to use your common sense. You don't \nhave to abandon common sense when you come on to the floor of the \nSenate. I promise you that you can justify this to your constituents. I \nsaid earlier, and I will say again, if you can't justify a vote against \nthis program, you have no business being in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I know there are legitimate concerns by people who \nhave honest differences with me. I would certainly never denigrate my \nfriend, John Glenn. I know he believes fervently in this. We all wish \nhim well in the endeavor he is about to take in another trip to space, \nand we applaud him. As far as I am concerned, I hope they get some \nbeneficial research out of him. But I can tell you that he didn't have \nto go into a research project. If he just wanted to go up there and \nlook out the window, it would be fine with me, and it would be fine \nwith everybody else in America, too. Before I ever met him, he was a \nhero of mine. I had tears in my eyes, like every American did, when we \nsaw John Glenn get out of that capsule. We all shared in his joy. We \nhave shared the joy of John and Annie ever since he came to the Senate. \nWe love him and we wish him well on everything--except the vote on this \nspace station.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the offer still stands. I would be delighted \nto offer an amendment to name it after the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the continued funding \nof the International Space Station. Mr. President, there is no denying \nthat the International Space Station has problems. It has had real \nproblems with the prime contractor, the performance of foreign partners \nand program management, all of which are acknowledged, but all of \nwhich, I repeat, are being addressed by NASA and the U.S. Congress.\n  In the Commerce Committee, a price cap was approved for the \nInternational Space Station. This price cap, in my opinion, begins to \naddress many of the guiding principles that I have discussed here on \nthe Senate floor--guiding principles which direct our investment in \nresearch and development, and that is good science, fiscal \naccountability, and program effectiveness. This program, indeed, \nrepresents a long-term investment, and it is very hard for us on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and in this Congress to understand the \nimportance of long-term investments. But this provides a long-term \ninvestment in a one-of-a-kind research facility.\n  Although the price tag of this facility is approaching $100 billion \nover the life of the station, the potential of the research to be \nconducted in this space station is enormous. As a scientist, as one who \nhas conducted research, I understand that there are no guarantees in \nresearch. However, if we are to continue to dream, to continue to want \nto improve the quality of our lives, continue to promote the economic \nstability of this country, vis-a-vis our neighbors, we must continue to \nconduct such research, investing long-term.\n  The space station will provide a unique environment for research with \na complete absence of gravity, allowing new insights into human health \nthat we simply cannot explore today in any environment: research on \ncardiovascular disease, disease of the heart and the vessels of the \nbody, understanding cancer, understanding hormonal disorders and \nosteoporosis and how the immune system functions. Yes, we have heard a \nlot about it in the last several hours--the whole issue of cost. We \nspent over $20 billion on this effort since its inception in 1985. \nSince the major redesign and the inclusion of the Russians in 1994, the \nprogram has spent an additional $11 billion. These amounts are for \ndevelopment only and don't include the costs associated with the \nshuttle to visit the Mir station.\n  The real question is, Should we sacrifice this $20 billion investment \nand terminate this project by some action today? By ending this \nproject, we not only forego the importance of research to be conducted \naboard the station, but also the technology development that will be \nnecessary to build and operate the space station. Research and \ndevelopment simply has played too important a role in the economic \nvitality of our Nation to put it at such great risk. There are many \nthat expect the next great industry to be space. And, yes; I hope the \nSenate will soon take up consideration of the Commercial Space Act of \n1997 as a new industry. Commercial space accounted for $7 billion in \n1995. By one estimate space could be a $120 billion worldwide business \nby the year 2000. This type of growth will mean substantial changes in \nhow things are currently done.\n\n  Historically, the government has taken the lead on many long-term \nresearch projects. Many are high risk. The outcome we simply don't \nknow. The benefits of that research we cannot predict.\n  The Federal Government should continue this tradition by continuing \nto build the International Space Station. However, NASA simply cannot \nbe given a blank check. We, the Members of this body, must continue to \nhold NASA accountable for good management of the program.\n  We must be prepared to deal with the various risks associated with \nthe program. There are many challenges; many we can't predict in \nassembling the components of the space station. The men and women who \nwill make this happen need and will continue to need the support of the \nAmerican people.\n  There has been much discussion of the report on the Cost Assessment \nand Validation Task Force. They don't recommend ending the program. \nThey simply say the program plan shall be revised so that it is \nachievable within the financial resources available. I think Congress \nshould determine what resources are available for the program and allow \nNASA to complete it accordingly.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the launching of the first element \nof the station this fall, and I hope that we will soon see the \nbeginning of another successful NASA project.\n  Mr. President, I urge support for continued funding of the \nInternational Space Station.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, is the Senator prepared to yield back time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, happily we have a Senator here. I have 4 \nminutes 20 seconds remaining. I would like to yield that to Senator \nDurbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, a question \nto the Senator from Arkansas: Will he yield back the time, or is he \ngoing to use it all?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I only have 4 minutes 20 seconds. I fully expect the \nSenator from Illinois to use all of that. My time will be used.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I expect it, too.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Under the unanimous-consent agreement we will still have \n5 minutes each prior to the vote. Is that correct?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is correct. If the Senator will withhold a second, \nI\n\n[[Page S7558]]\n\nwish to advise the Chair that I will leave the floor and delegate my \nauthority to Senator Glenn until I return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I start, I believe there is an \ninquiry as to whether there is any time remaining on the other side on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bumpers \namendment. I thank the Senator from Arkansas. This is a battle he has \nbeen waging for many years. I joined him as a Member of the House, and \nI am happy to join him as a Member of the Senate.\n  Some might ask if I have taken leave of my senses to be on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate debating the elements of the space program with John \nGlenn on the other side. How do I find myself in that predicament? In \nthis instance, I have to say I disagree with my friend from Ohio and my \nlong-time hero. I believe the Senator from Arkansas is right. In 1984, \nPresident Reagan said to the American people that he had a dramatic \nannouncement to make. A permanent-manned space station, an \ninternational cooperative effort, is going to be a staging area for \nfurther space exploration. It is a great opportunity, and we will be \nable, at the cost of $8 billion from the U.S. taxpayers to make this \nhappen. Over the years, we have watched the concept diminish and the \nprice explode.\n  As the Senator from Arkansas explains to us, just last year, after a \nthorough professional study was done, they gave us an estimate that the \nfirst phase of this project would cost--no, not $17 billion, but in \nfact $24.7 billion, a 40-percent cost overrun. Those who have been \nwatching this project since its inception and suggestion in 1984 have \nto wonder whether there is any end in sight.\n  For each year the cost of this project continues to mushroom, the \nuncertainty grows and the scope of the project diminishes. Over the \nyears, the debate over this space station has been enlarged to go way \nbeyond its original intent. It is now going to be a research \nlaboratory.\n  I have listened to those who have argued for the space station say \nwith a straight face, ``If we could just have this space station, then \nwe might one day find a cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer. We need to \nget up in a weightless atmosphere with microgravity research, and that \nmight be the breakthrough.''\n  Competent scientists rebut that conclusion, and common sense does as \nwell, because we in the United States of America today fund only 20 \npercent of the approved applications for medical research at the \nNational Institutes of Health. Here on God's green Earth we are unable \nto come up with the money for sound research to find a cure for \ndiabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease, and instead, we are \ngoing to take another $80 billion and plow it into this project and \nsend it up into space.\n  I know that some people are energized with the idea of space \nexploration, and I am one of them. I can remember John Glenn, and I can \nremember the walk on the Moon, and so many other experiences in life, \nand going down to Cape Kennedy for a liftoff, and to feel that Earth \nrumble under your feet when that rocket takes off is something you will \nnever forget. That is exciting.\n  Let me tell you what else is exciting. It is exciting to pick up the \nmorning paper and to read that we have found a cure for a disease. It \nis exciting to be able to tell the parent of a child that their baby \ncan live, that we have come through with a new medical breakthrough. It \nis exciting for us to know that the next generation may not have to \nworry as much about Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. I find these \nrevelations just as exciting, if not more so, than a space liftoff.\n\n  The Senator from Arkansas presents a challenge to us today. He \nbasically is saying to this Chamber, Will you look at the facts as \npresented? Will you acknowledge the dramatic increase in cost of this \nspace station? Will you come to the understanding, as we did with the \nSuperconducting Super Collider--that big tunnel in Texas, which we \nfinally decided was headed for nowhere--come to the conclusion that \nthis $80 billion could be better spent right here on Earth for real \nneeds of real people, whether it is in the area of medical research or \neducation?\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Senator from \nArkansas and to defeat this funding for the space station.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to reply to a couple of things which Senator \nHarkin indicated a little bit earlier. I was a little bit disquieted by \nthe fact that he indicated that NASA is now an arm of the military Air \nForce. I don't know where on Earth that came from because NASA has \nnever been that. Military payloads have been put up. But it has not \nspilled over in that direction at all. It is still going along as a \ncivilian agency. It was declared to be by Dwight Eisenhower, and has \ncontinued to be that every since.\n  As far as money being sucked out, there is $98 billion. We are \ntalking about $2.3 billion in this bill for the next year for the \nInternational Space Station. Most of the hardware has already been \nconstructed, or is in the final stages of being constructed.\n  The fact is that we have doubled the budget for NIH over the last \ncouple of years. It is not that we are not doing things in that area.\n  I repeat what I said earlier. If we are to wait until every problem \nin our country is solved before we put money into basic fundamental \nresearch out there, that is just the wrong way to go.\n  Senator Durbin talks about child diseases. Some of the protein \ncrystal growth advances we are making these days is something that we \ncan look forward to as maybe helping solve some of those childhood \ndiseases.\n  Back to what the Senator from Iowa said again, though, I will point \nout that on the very flight that I will be on this fall in October, we \nhave three different areas of commercialization of space in which one \nof the projects is commercial protein crystal growth. I will not go \ninto details. My 2 minutes won't permit. But in that area, we are in \nthe commercialization of protein crystal growth experiments. We are \ninto another one on the commercial generic bioprocessing apparatus that \nwe are taking up in space. We have another one. I have already been \nbriefed on these. We will be taking part in some of the research that \nis being done at that time.\n  The other one is on what is called the cybex mission, and it is to \nperform IDA-funded, corporate microgravity biomedical cancer research; \nsecond purpose: perform other IDA corporate commercial microgravity \nresearch, and provide a turnkey service of commercial access to space.\n  That is the way NASA has been going. That is the direction they want \nto go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN. So this is almost built. It would be foolish to cut back \nnow and waste the money we put into it right when it is just about to \npay off in a great way, I think.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have heard much discussion today about \nthe cost of the space station. We have seen from independent analysis \nby leading scientists that there are truly significant scientific \nadvances which can come from the International Space Station, and we \nnoted it serves many other functions. As the international scientific \nendeavor is furthered, it offers practical applications in research and \npotentially commercial manufacturing and materials processing. This is \na tremendous step forward. We have heard about the Chabrow report. In \nit the NASA advisory council says that the task force members, with \nconsiderable experience, found the program to be consistent with the \nlevel of funding and that they have endorsed it. We think that it is an \nimportant measure. We would urge when the vote occurs that Members \noppose the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\n  Under the previous order, the amendment is set aside until 6:20.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncommend an extraordinarily successful collaboration between NASA and \nthe JASON Project, a private foundation which is working to engage \nmiddle school students in grades 5-8 in science and technology. Each \nyear, JASON electronically takes hundreds of thousands of our students \non real scientific expeditions with world class scientists, researchers \nand explorers to work together with them on projects of discovery. NASA \nparticipates through three of its research centers and the expertise of \nmany of its scientists. This collaboration is bringing real science to \nmany students and teachers in the US and abroad, and I wanted to \ncommend NASA's work with JASON as a model for public/private \npartnerships and educational leadership.\n  Mr. BOND. The committee is aware of NASA's partnership with JASON and \nwe encourage NASA to continue and to expand this work during the next \nfiscal year.\n\n\n                      housing for the mentally ill\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to raise the issue of \nhousing for the mentally ill as the Senate discusses this important VA-\nHUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations bill.\n  I have worked for many years to focus attention on the serious \ndiseases that are mental illnesses. These are devastating diseases that \ncan leave a person significantly disabled and in need of a variety of \nservices, including affordable housing.\n  Mr. President, I recently met with representatives of a non-profit \norganization, Cornerstone, Inc., that has provided capital funding to \nconstruct quality housing for the seriously and chronically mentally \nill who reside in the District of Columbia. This program began in 1994 \nwhen Congress directed that $5 million of funding previously for St. \nElizabeth's Hospital be allocated for community-based housing. With $3 \nmillion of this funding, Cornerstone has leveraged other resources to a \ntotal of $15 million that has been used to construct over 300 units of \nhousing for those with mental illness.\n  Cornerstone is now into its final year of funding under the original \nprogram. Continuation of this program with another $5 million in \ncapital funding would enable over 350 patients currently residing at \nSt. Elizabeth's to be housed in affordable housing at significant \nsavings over continued residence at the Hospital. Housing supported by \nCornerstone, Inc., costs less than $40,000 per unit compared to an \nestimated cost of $100,000 per patient at St. Elizabeth's Hospital. \nThis is the type of public-private partnership that can do so much to \nhelp our communities.\n  Would the Chairman agree that it would be worthwhile for the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development to consider a proposal for \ncontinued funding of the Cornerstone, Inc. affordable housing program \nfor the seriously and chronically mentally ill as the Department \ndistributes its 1999 funding?\n  Mr. BOND. I understand the concern of the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico in providing sufficient housing for the mentally ill. I know \nthat here in the District of Columbia the supply of supportive housing \nis of ongoing concern. I would concur with my colleague with New Mexico \nthat the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development should consider a \nproposal from Cornerstone, Inc., to continue constructing affordable \nhousing for the seriously and chronically mentally ill in the District \nof Columbia.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his \nconsideration of this important matter. I join him in urging the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development to work with Cornerstone, \nInc., on the continuation of an affordable housing program for the \nmentally ill in the Nation's Capital.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Senator Coats and I have shared with you \nthis year our strong support for $2 million through the HUD Economic \nDevelopment Initiative Account for the Midwest Proton Radiation \nInstitute (MPRI). The MPRI is an important economic development and \ncancer treatment initiative at Indiana University, Bloomington, \nIndiana. This is an important effort for the University, the City of \nBloomington, and the State of Indiana. Funding for this project was not \nincluded as one of the 87 projects listed for this account in S. Rept. \n105-216. The MPRI project--like several science-related projects slated \nto receive funding as listed in S. Rept. 105-216--is beneficial from an \neconomic development perspective as well as in the area of health \nsciences research and cancer treatment. This is our only project \nrequest from the VA-HUD Subcommittee this year. As you move forward \nwith consideration of the final VA-HUD Appropriations bill, I hope you \nwill give consideration to including funds for this valuable and \nworthwhile economic development project of importance to my State.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's strong interest in the Midwest \nProton Radiation Institute. I believe this project will create economic \ngrowth in Indiana and contribute to improving our nation's cancer \ntreatment activities. As we move to conference with the House on S. \n2168, we will give this project every consideration for funding.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chairman, for his comments and for his \ninterest in this project.\n  Mr. COATS. Of the $85 million set aside for the EDI account in S. \n2168--as stated in S. Rept. 105-216--only $67 million earmarked for \nindividual projects in 40 states. It appears funding is available for \nadditional projects within the appropriated spending provided in the \nbill. I believe the Midwest Proton Radiation Institute is an important \neffort that will be of great benefit to the city of Bloomington and to \nIndiana University. In addition, Senator Lugar  and I believe the MPRI \nis a worthwhile and appropriate project for funding under community \ndevelopment programs at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. I join with Senator Lugar in requesting your assistance \nand consideration for funding for this important project as you move to \nconference with the House on the FY '99 VA-HUD Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I share the Senator's view that the MPRI project is a \nmeritorious one that should receive serious consideration for funding \nby HUD in FY 1999. I am pleased to know of your support for this MPRI \ninitiative, and that you join with Sen. Lugar in seeking funds for this \neffort.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n   small system technical assistance and the safe drinking water act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, page 67 of the committee report \naccompanying the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill of 1999 \nincludes $8 million for the National Rural Water Association. In \naddition to the appropriation to the National Rural Water Association, \nthe Committee notes that ``States are authorized to set aside 2 percent \nof the funds provided under their drinking water State revolving fund \nallotment.''\n  I ask my friend from Missouri if he and other members of the \nAppropriations Committee are implying that the 2 percent set aside \nauthorized in Section 1452(g)(2) of the Safe Drinking Water Act \nAmendments of 1996 is to be used for grants made to the National Rural \nWater Association and various regional community action organizations?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am not making such an argument. It was not \nthe Committee's intention to imply, encourage or require States to use \nthe 2 percent set aside authorized in Section 1452(g)(2) for the so \ncalled ``circuit rider'' program. The Committee is aware that Section \n1452(g)(2) gives States the discretion to use up to 2 percent of their \nallotted revolving loan funds to provide technical assistance to small \npublic water systems. The language was included in recognition of the \nfact that States have the ability to increase funding in this area \nabove the $8 million provided directly in this bill at their \ndiscretion.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Subcommittee \non VA, HUD and Independent Agencies for clarifying the report.\n\n\n                           enhanced vouchers\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in the last two appropriations acts, the \nCongress provided enhanced section 8 tenant-based subsidies to low-\nincome residents of certain multifamily housing properties whose owners \nhave elected to prepay their FHA-insured mortgages. These enhanced \nvouchers were provided to protect residents from displacement from \ntheir homes. I understand, however, that the Department of Housing\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\nand Urban Development (HUD) has interpreted the appropriations language \nso that previously assisted residents would pay an amount based on the \nsame amount of rent on the date of prepayment regardless of a change in \ntheir adjusted income. In other words, HUD would require previously \nassisted residents to no longer base their rent contribution as a \npercentage of income. This policy interpretation will likely force a \nsection 8 assisted resident to pay a higher percentage of their income \nin rent if their income decreased and potentially result in \ndisplacement.\n  Mr. President, HUD's interpretation seems contrary to the intent of \nthe appropriations language and the statutory requirements under \nsection 8 or other rental assistance programs. I would like to ask the \nChairman of the VA, HUD Appropriations Subcommittee if HUD has \ncorrectly interpreted the intent of the appropriations language.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's attention to this issue. HUD has \nincorrectly interpreted the enhanced voucher language. Previously \nassisted residents who receive enhanced vouchers should be paying the \nsame percentage of income for rent as they had before they had received \nthe enhanced voucher. This means that if a resident's income decreases, \ntheir rental contribution should also decrease. The purpose of \nproviding enhanced vouchers to previously assisted residents was to \nensure that these residents would be protected from displacement or \nunaffordable rent increases.\n  I would also like to state that I expect HUD to administer the \nenhanced voucher program in a manner that will ensure a smooth \ntransition for residents in prepayment developments. I have heard of \nsome administrative problems with the enhanced voucher program that has \ncreated undue and unnecessary hardship for the residents. I would like \nto reemphasize that the transition should be administered so that \nresidents are able to continue their tenancy with as little disturbance \nas possible.\n  Mr. MACK. I appreciate the Senator's response and his leadership in \nprotecting low-income families.\n\n\n                    exception rents for rural areas\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, under last year's VA/HUD appropriations \nact, the Congress created a program called ``mark-to-market'' to reduce \novermarket section 8 contract rents on FHA-insured multifamily \nproperties. Section 514(g)(2)(A) of the mark-to-market program would \nauthorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to allow \nfor exception rents over the 120 percent of fair market rent (FMR) \nlimit for up to five percent of the restructured units in a year. There \nis some confusion, however, if this five percent waiver is a national \nlimit or a geographical limit. I am concerned that certain areas, such \nas the upper Midwest, the need for waivers may exceed five percent \nbecause of the proportion of elderly facilities and the way FMRs \ncompare to the relative costs of operating those facilities in certain \nareas as well as the random circumstances that may occur in certain \ngeographical areas in a given year.\n  I would like to ask the Chairmen of the HUD authorizing and \nappropriations subcommittees for their clarification on the \ncongressional intent of this issue.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague from Iowa for raising this issue. The \nfive percent waiver is a national limit, and the Secretary should \nexercise his authority in waiving this limitation for areas such as the \nupper Midwest.\n  Mr. BOND. I also thank my colleague from Iowa for raising this issue. \nI concur with the Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee that the five \npercent waiver is a national limit. This provision was included in \nmark-to-market to ensure that properties, especially those that serve \nelderly persons in rural areas, are not adversely affected by the debt \nrefinancing and rent reduction process.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the two Senators for their assistance in this \nmatter and for their work on housing issues.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the ``mark-to-market'' program that was \nenacted last year in the VA/HUD appropriations act was expected to be \nimplemented by late October of this year. While I applaud the efforts \nof the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in preparing \nthe implementation of the law, I am still concerned about its progress \nand ability to meet the October deadline.\n  I am concerned about the President's failure after 9 months to \nnominate a Director of the Office of Multifamily Housing Assisted \nRestructuring and that interim regulations have not yet been published. \nI, however, would like to focus on the fact that HUD has not begun the \nprocess for selecting participating administrative entities (PAE). \nWithout them, the program will not work. In the original mark-to-market \nlegislation that passed the Senate as part of the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997, State and local housing finance agencies (HFA) that had \nqualified under the mark-to-market demonstration and FHA risk-sharing \nprograms would automatically qualify as PAEs. The Banking Committee \nfelt strongly that HFAs not only were the best entities to administer \nmark-to-market, but it also had concerns about HUD's ability to select \nqualified entities in a timely and objective manner.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank Senator Mack for raising these concerns. I \ncompletely agree that it is critical that the PAEs be in place by \nOctober if the program is to be able to operate at that time. I also \nadd that the consequences of not implementing mark-to-market in a \ntimely manner are serious and could create havoc with contract \nexpirations and renewals. Even if the program is only delayed, HUD may \nhave to extend the contracts at above market levels to provide the PAEs \nadequate time to restructure the properties. This will result in \nadditional costs to the government and result in shortfalls in the \nappropriation for renewals. Further, the uncertainty surrounding the \nrules and regulations of the program will make it difficult for project \nowners and residents to prepare for mark-to-market.\n  Mr. President, based on the Administration's less-than-adequate \nperformance in selecting restructuring agents under the mark-to-market \ndemonstration programs, I would say that the concerns expressed by the \nChairman of the Housing Subcommittee are valid.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee for his response and shared concerns. I would like to \nstress that the credibility of HUD is directly linked to its successful \nimplementation of the mark-to-market program. It is imperative that the \nDepartment not only ensures that the program is implemented in time and \nin compliance with the letter and spirit of the law, but it also \nensures a smooth transition. I believe that the legislation provides \nthe Secretary with sufficient flexibility in selecting PAEs and would \nhighly recommend that the Secretary use its current restructuring \nagents to continue as PAEs under the permanent program, especially if \nthe program is to be implemented in time. As I have advocated before, I \nwould specifically recommend the use of State and local HFAs as PAEs.\n\n  HFAs have proven that they have the capacity and willingness to serve \nas the federal government's partners in affordable housing. Thirty HFAs \nhave been qualified by HUD to participate under the mark-to-market \ndemonstration program. Twenty-eight HFAs are participating in the FHA \nrisk-sharing program. Almost every state HFA has administered the \nsuccessful Low Income Housing Tax Credit program since the Congress \ncreated it in 1986. HFAs have financed more than 200,000 Section 8 \nunits and administer Section 8 contracts on behalf of HUD in many \ncases. Thirty-four HFAs administer the HOME program, under which \nmultifamily properties are being financed every year.\n  It is clear from this evidence that the HFAs are the most qualified \nto act as PAEs under the mark-to-market program and more importantly, \nthey are publicly accountable and have missions that are aligned with \nHUD. I expect HUD to approve many HFAs as PAEs and provide them as much \nflexibility as possible within appropriate parameters to administer the \nprogram.\n  Mr. BOND. Based on their demonstrated performance as the Senator from \nFlorida has pointed out and my own knowledge of the Missouri Housing \nFinance Agency, I would also expect HUD to approve many HFAs as PAEs. I \nalso agree that HUD should not require the HFAs that act as PAEs to go\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\nthrough any unnecessary administrative steps in restructuring \nproperties. I would especially be concerned if HUD created impediments \nin the HFAs ability to provide financing, such as risk-sharing, for \nrestructuring transactions.\n\n\n                 owners' right to prepay fha mortgages\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand that the Manager's Amendment to \nthe VA/HUD Appropriations Bill contains an important provision that \nallows owners to prepay its FHA-insured multifamily housing mortgage. \nThis provision would continue current policy.\n  I would like to ask Senator Bond, the Chairman of the VA, HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee, if he could confirm this.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee for \nraising this issue. The Senator is correct that the Manager's Amendment \ncontains language regarding the owner's right to prepay its mortgage \nand continues current housing policy that has been in effect for the \npast three years. This policy change was originally made in past \nappropriations legislation.\n  Under the appropriations legislation and this year's legislation, the \nCongress restored the owner's right to prepay its mortgage under the \nLow Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 \n(LIHPRHA). However, as a condition of prepayment, some resident \nprotections were included in the appropriations law to prevent hardship \nfor affected residents. Specifically, upon prepayment, an owner could \nnot raise rents for 60 days and eligible residents were provided \nenhanced or ``sticky'' vouchers so that they could choose to remain in \ntheir homes at an affordable rent. The provision of sticky vouchers \nwere provided in lieu of the resident protections under LIHPRHA. In \nother words, the provision of sticky vouchers and the prevention of \nraising rents for 60 days permanently replaces the LIHPRHA resident \nprotections that included (1) providing relocation benefits, (2) \nkeeping rents at levels existing at the time of prepayment for three \nyears, and (3) requiring owners to accept voucher holders.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague for his assistance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to offer my support for S. \n2168, the FY 1999 Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Independent Agencies appropriation bill, and most \nparticularly for Title I, the section outlining funding for VA.\n  Once again, the chair of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, Senator Bond, the \nranking member, Senator Mikulski, and the other members of the \nSubcommittee, have taken a reduced allocation and tremendous \nlimitations on funding, and have miraculously created a bill which \nadequately addresses the needs of America's veterans. While I would \nalways want to increase support for veterans programs further, I am \nenormously pleased with the result of their efforts. I would like to \nhighlight several accomplishments in particular.\n  On the health care side of the ledger, the Committee on \nAppropriations recommended $17.25 billion for VA medical care, a \nsubstantial increase of $222 million over the President's request and \n$192 million above the FY 1998 level. When these funds--$17.25 \nbillion--are coupled with receipts collected under the Medical Care \nCost Fund, the Veterans Health Administration will have access to \n$17.92 billion in discretionary resources to care for sick and disabled \nveterans.\n  I am also particularly gratified by the Committee's report language \non the need for community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) in the \nEastern Panhandle of my home state of West Virginia. Indeed, the \nCommittee noted that clinics in Petersburg and Franklin will benefit \napproximately 2,000 veterans who have been forced to drive long \ndistances and spend the entire day at VA medical center for routine \nhealth care. I am hopeful that VA will begin providing needed health \ncare services by the end of this year, if not sooner.\n  I must also mention the extraordinary work done by the Committee to \nappropriate substantial funds for the VA medical and prosthetic \nresearch account. For the first time in many years, the Administration \nhad proposed funding this account at the level of $300 million. \nAlthough this amount represents an increase compared to last year, \nunfortunately, this level of funding is not sufficient even to keep up \nwith inflation, much less provide for any real growth.\n  For many years, the VA research program has suffered from flatline \nfunding that has hampered its ability to improve the quality of care \nprovided to veterans, attract well-trained physicians, and advance \nmedical treatments that can benefit the nation as a whole. In light of \nthis, the Committee has gone beyond the $300 million mark and allocated \nan additional $10 million. These additional funds will produce research \ndiscoveries which will benefit veterans and non-veterans alike.\n  The bill before us also includes a substantial increase for grants \nfor construction of state extended care facilities. The Committee \nrecognized the important role State Veterans Homes play in providing \ndomiciliary and nursing home care to veterans and chose to recommend \n$90 million for this program. This recommendation is $10 million more \nthan the fiscal year 1998 funding.\n  The Committee also included report language which emphasizes the need \nfor VA to ensure funding for grants and per diem payment assistance to \ncommunity-based providers of services to homeless veterans. In the past \nthree years, VA has closed approximately 4,500 acute mental health and \nsubstance abuse beds. At the same time, the number of unique patients \nreceiving outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment has \nincreased by 8 percent. There is no question that outpatient based \ntreatment for homeless veterans with mental illnesses and substance \nabuse disorders can be effective, but such treatment must be coupled \nwith safe, supervised transitional housing programs. VA grant programs \nhelp to fill the void caused by the closure of inpatient services.\n  On the benefits side, I was very pleased to see that the Committee \nincluded an increase of $5 million for the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration and tied the release of these funds to submission of a \nplan implementing the recommendations of the National Academy of Public \nAdministration. VA continues to struggle to correctly adjudicate \nveterans' benefits claims in a timely manner, and faces a backlog of \npending cases and an increase in new claims being filed. Additional \nfunding, spent in a targeted manner, should greatly improve VA's \ndecisionmaking ability.\n  The Committee has also recommended a $2.2 million increase in funds \nallocated for the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), Professional \nGroup VII, which represents the Secretary before the U.S. Court of \nVeterans Appeals. There is a growing backlog of cases at the Court \ncreated by the loss of experienced attorneys and increased productivity \nof the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA). Our veterans should not have \nto wait additional time for a decision because the OGC does not have \nthe staff to litigate their cases.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I am pleased with what the Committee on \nAppropriations has been able to do for VA. I applaud the leadership of \nall the members of the Appropriations Committee, and especially those \nmembers on the VA-HUD Subcommittee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3057\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Bond and \nMikulski for including a provision in the manager's amendment that \nmakes it explicit that State Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund \nprograms may continue the practice of collecting a loan service fee to \nhelp cover the cost of administering the loans and managing the \nrevolving loan fund.\n  Mr. President, there are approximately fourteen States that charge a \nloan administration fee to revolving loan fund borrowers to cover some \nof the costs associated with the loan transaction. As a service to the \nborrower, most of the States roll this fee into the loan so that it is \nrepaid with interest over the duration of the loan. This is a \ntremendous help to the borrower, who is often unable to pay the fee \nupfront. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently \nobjected to this practice despite the fact that it has been used since \nthe inception of the revolving loan fund. EPA contends that this \npractice violates the\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\nfour percent limitation on administrative fees in Title VI of the Clean \nWater Act.\n  The language included in the manager's amendment will resolve this \nproblem by allowing States to charge administrative fees regardless of \nwhether they exceed the four percent limitation. To ensure that this \npractice is not abused, the fees cannot exceed an amount the \nAdministrator of EPA deems reasonable.\n  Mr. President, without this amendment many of the Clean Water State \nRevolving Loan Fund programs would face severe financial hardship that \nwould be detrimental to the health of the revolving loan fund program.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for \nincluding this very important amendment in their manager's package.\n\n\n                                  fema\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a great appreciation for the fine \nwork Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond have put into crafting this \ndifficult bill. The VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nbill in particular deals with many tough issues and competing demands. \nOne of the smaller agencies which I would like to bring attention to \ntoday is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n  Just a few weeks ago FEMA invited Lamoille County in Vermont to \nbecome a part of Project Impact, FEMA's pre-disaster mitigation \nprogram. This is a program that is partnering with communities, and the \nprivate sector, to make communities more resistant to natural disaster.\n  The importance of this kind of pre-disaster planning was driven home \nthis past weekend as Lamoille, along with Addison, Chittenden, \nFranklin, Orange, Rutland, Washington, and Windsor Counties in Vermont \nwere again devastated by severe storms and flooding. On June 30th, the \nPresident declared these areas in Vermont a major disaster. I toured \nthe area with FEMA officials last week and, thanks to the hard work and \nspirit of the people of Vermont, the local public safety forces and \nFEMA, those communities are beginning to recover. Project Impact could \nhelp counties like Lamoille take steps to reduce the costs and public \nhealth risks of these kinds of disasters in the future.\n  FEMA Director, James Lee Witt is a friend to just about every member \nof the Senate. He and his staff, both here and in the regional offices, \nhave been there for our states through all manner of natural disasters. \nTo maintain FEMA's capability to respond so quickly to the needs of our \nstates, I believe Congress should support the levels of funding for \nFEMA recommended in the President's budget. Again, I congratulate \nSenator Bond and Senator Mikulski for their fine work and know they \nshare my support for FEMA and the work it does.\n\n\n                     environmental self-evaluations\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President I was prepared to offer an amendment to the \nVA/HUD Appropriations bill that would have taken away EPA's authority \nto withdraw Colorado's delegated environmental programs. EPA has been \nthreatening Colorado's authorization to administer delegated programs \nbecause of an environmental self-evaluation law the State passed in \n1994. As many listening know, self-evaluation laws allow companies, \nindividuals, and local governments to go above and beyond what is \nrequired in seeking out environmental problems under their \njurisdiction. In return the entity who performed the audit is protected \nfrom fines. Colorado's law makes good sense, in fact in the short time \nit has been in existence those who have availed themselves of it have \nfound and corrected many environmental problems that otherwise would \nhave gone undetected.\n  However, last February I became aware that EPA may not have been \ntaking the State of Colorado seriously with respect to negotiations on \nthe self-evaluation law. At that time I stated my intention to object \nto an EPA nominee. Subsequently, I dropped my objection to their \nnominee after speaking with Assistant Administrator Herman about my \nconcerns. He agreed to do his best to ensure that negotiations occurred \nin good faith and that they were inclusive of Colorado's elected \nofficials who had an interest in the manner. Over the past several \nweeks I became concerned that EPA had not followed through on this \ncommitment.\n  I was particularly distressed at the prospect that EPA had promised \nme they would take an action and then turned around and ignored their \npromise. Earlier today Assistant Administrator Herman called me and \nassured me that he had been faithful with respect to the previous \nagreement we had made. However, he agreed to redouble his efforts in \nnegotiating an agreement to the audit issue in Colorado that has broad \nbased support because of broad based involvement among policy makers \nand other local officials.\n  While my inclination is still to offer my amendment, I am willing to \nforego it in this instance. However, should I find that EPA is \nattempting to exclude people from negotiations on Colorado's \nenvironmental audit law I will revisit this issue soon.\n\n\n           Veterans' Tobacco-related Illnesses and Disability\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I had every intention to offer an \namendment to the Veterans' Affairs/Housing and Urban Development \nAppropriations bill that would restore the $10.5 billion in funding \nthat was so egregiously and eagerly taken from our nation's veterans to \nfund pork-laden highway programs in the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1998 (ISTEA). Unfortunately, there was \nsimply no possibility that this amendment would be adopted, simply \nbecause of the inflexibility of the Appropriations Committee's \nallocation of funds between the Transportation and VA/HUD \nSubcommittees.\n  Because of the arcane rules of the Senate, I and my cosponsors are \nprecluded from righting this profound wrong that has been perpetrated \nagainst those who have served and sacrificed for our country.\n  This amendment would not have been my first attempt to rectify this \nshameful treatment of our Veterans. On the tobacco bill, I sponsored \nlegislation that would provide not less than $600 million per year to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans' health care activities \nfor tobacco-related illnesses and disability and directed the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs to assist such veterans as is appropriate. The \namendment would have provided a minimum of $3 billion over five years \nfor those veterans that are afflicted with tobacco-related illnesses \nand disability. Additionally, the amendment would have provided smoking \ncessation care to veterans from various programs established under the \ntobacco bill. Unfortunately, when the tobacco bill was returned to the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, the funding vehicle \nfor those afflicted veterans suffering from smoking-related illnesses, \nwent with it.\n  The failure to address the tobacco-related health care needs of our \nmen and women who faithfully served their country in uniform would be \nwrong. Congress cannot continue to rob from veterans, whose programs \nhave been seriously underfunded for years, to pay for special interest \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, I want to assure my colleagues, and more importantly, \nour veterans, that this issue is far from dead. I am even more \ncompelled and committed to find a vehicle to restore the critical \nfunding that was so selfishly taken by members of this body. Mr. \nPresident, our veterans--those who served and sacrificed, those who \ntrusted, and in this case were betrayed by their government--deserve no \nless.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3063\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Public Health Service Act and the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 to protect consumers in managed \n                 care plans and other health coverage)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment and I send it to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know there is an understanding that we \nwill go to the veterans amendment at some point, and I would be happy \nto lay aside this amendment to accommodate Senator McCain and others \nwho may wish to offer their amendment, with the understanding that we \nmight have a vote on both amendments at some point in the future. But I \nwanted to lay this amendment down, and I will be brief because I know \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico also wishes to speak.\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the leader will withhold, the clerk needs \nto report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3063.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.''\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the issue of patient protection is among \nthe most important health questions facing the American people today. \nIn survey after survey, the American people have said without \nequivocation that they want Congress to deal with this issue. More and \nmore, from places all over the country, we hear reports about victims \nof our current system and cries for reform. The need to address this \nissue, this year, has become more and more pronounced.\n  For many months, we have worked in concert with the White House and \nwith our House colleagues to come up with a way to comprehensively \nrespond to the growing array of concerns and problems that people from \nall over the country have raised as they talk about the current \nsituation we face with regard to health insurance and HMOs.\n  After a great deal of attention, study, thoughtful analysis, and \nworking with over 100 organizations from all philosophical and \npolitical persuasions, we have introduced legislation that provides a \nnumber of very basic patient protections: providing access to needed \nspecialists including pediatric specialists for children; ensuring \naccess to an independent appeal board when insurance companies deny \ncare and requiring timely resolution of those appeals; guaranteeing \naccess to the closest emergency room so that people don't have to waste \nprecious time as they drive miles to save their insurance company a few \ndollars; allowing patients to see the same doctor through a pregnancy \nor a difficult treatment even if their doctor stops participating in an \nHMO; allowing women direct access to their ob/gyn without asking their \ninsurance company for permission; preventing drive-through mastectomies \nand other inappropriate insurance company interference with good \nmedical practice; and holding HMOs accountable when their decisions to \ndeny or delay health care result in injury or death.\n  These provisions, and a number of others that I will not list now, \nwere very carefully thought through before we incorporated them in this \npatient protection bill. I do not know of another piece of legislation \nthat has higher priority. I do not know of another piece of legislation \nthat deserves the attention of the Senate more than this one.\n  Every day we fail to act on basic patient protections, the list of \nfamilies who suffer continues to grow. We have fewer than 10 weeks \nremaining before the end of the session. We have yet to spend 1 day \ntalking about the Patients' Bill of Rights, debating patient \nprotections, and dealing with this issue in a comprehensive way. My \nhope is that we can work through this amendment and come up with a way \nin which to address this issue on this bill.\n  I also would like very much to be able to schedule debate and a vote \non this legislation. To date, we have not been able to do that. So I \noffer this amendment in good faith and hope that we can finally come to \nclosure on what I consider to be the single most important piece of \nhealth legislation facing the Congress and our country today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I regret that the minority leader has chosen \nto add a totally new subject to this debate. I know there have been \ndiscussions at the leadership level about scheduling debate on it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. BOND. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3062\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Bumpers amendment \nNo. 3062.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  I assume most everybody in this Senate now understands that we are \ndebating an amendment that would terminate the space station, save $80 \nbillion over the next 15 years, and this year alone put $1 billion in \nveterans medicine, $450 million into low-rent housing.\n  I hate to call a program that has been successful in most ways, \nalmost comical, but there is no way to describe what is going on with \nthe space station right now any other way. We have been told from the \nbeginning it would cost $17.4 billion to build the station on Earth. \nThere are three stages: No. 1, you have to build it; No. 2, you have to \nput it in space; No. 3, you have to operate it for 10 years.\n  What are we looking at? We are looking at a $100 billion cost today. \nSince last October 1, since last October 1, the Chabrow Commission, \nappointed by Daniel Goldin, the administrator of NASA, Jay Chabrow, \nprobably the best space policy analyst in America, comes back and says \nthe first part is not going to cost $17.4 billion; NASA is going to \ntake 10 to 38 months longer than they told you, and it will cost $24.7 \nbillion. That is $7.3 billion--a 43-percent cost overrun and we haven't \neven finished building it yet.\n  If you think that is a cost overrun, wait until the Russians start \nreneging. Jay Chabrow says you will not have this thing finished in \nearly 2003. You will be lucky to have it finished early 2006. So when \nthe Russians start reneging on their part of it, we have about 80 \nlaunches to deploy this thing, and the Russians are going to be \nresponsible for about 40 of them, between 40 and 49. Who here believes \nthat a country who can't even pay the electric bill at their principal \ncosmodrome is going to come through on their commitment with that many \nflights? Every time they renege it will cost us close to $1 billion.\n  I asked my colleagues this afternoon, and I repeat the challenge, I \nhave talked endlessly about the cost overruns we are experiencing and \nthe ones we are going to experience, and according to the way we have \ndebated this thing this afternoon, those cost overruns are like Ross \nPerot's crazy aunt in the basement; we ignore it. I can tell you that \ncrazy aunt in the basement will have a lot of company unless we kill \nthis program now.\n  You can save $80 billion. We have yet to spend $80 billion. If the \ncost overruns are anything even close to what they are looking at now, \nwhat Jay Chabrow says is a distinct possibility, you are talking about \n$100 billion to $150 billion, and every research scientist in America \nsays it is of highly questionable value. As a matter of fact, virtually \nevery one of them are adamantly opposed to it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to thank Senator Bond very much for allowing \nme to be in the summation. Because of a family emergency I just \narrived.\n  Mr. President, I do admire the tenacity of the Senator from Arkansas, \nfor he has tried 15 straight times to submarine the space station, in a \nmixed metaphor. But I do think the Senator is wrong.\n  I think the Senate will rise above his arguments, which would have \nthe world's greatest superpower saying to all of the other nations that \nhave put their money into this project, we are going to walk away from \nan experimental project, 90 percent complete. This project is \nsucceeding. What we are going to be able to do has already begun to be \ntested in the early stages, and that is use microgravity conditions to \ngrow tissue, which you can't do on Earth. You can't simulate this \nprocedure on Earth. It means we will be able\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\nto take defective tissues, without harming the patient, and \nexperimenting without harming the patient. It is biomedical research. \nWe have partners--the United States, Canada, Italy, Belgium, \nNetherlands, Denmark, Norway, Spain, France, Germany, the UK, Japan, \nand Russia--in this project. Yes, the Russians are having trouble. We \nknow that. Does that mean we will walk away from all of our other \ninternational partners? The United States has been the leader in \ntechnical advances. It is why we have been able to get all of the \nbenefits that we have seen from space research, because we have been \nwilling to take the risk. Experiments are not precise. You make \nmistakes when you are the first one out there.\n  You can't draw the budget for the first time and say you have to stay \nwithin this budget. Yes, it may take a couple more years. But if we can \nfind a cure for ovarian cancer, for breast cancer, for osteoporosis, \nthen I think a couple of years or 3 years working this out together, \nperhaps getting new partners, which is what we ought to be doing, \ninstead of saying let's walk away, 90 percent into a project, with all \nof the other countries that have depended on us.\n  We are the world's greatest superpower. We are not going to walk away \nfrom our partnership. We are not going to walk away from the \nleadership, at least that is not the country I represent. Most \ncertainly, I don't think the Senate would do something so narrow.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Texas just alluded to curing breast \ncancer and curing several other diseases. You could fund the National \nInstitutes of Health God knows how many times for what this thing will \ncost. You are not going to cure anything with this. That is the reason \nAmerica's physicists, cell biologists, and medical scientists are all \nopposed to it.\n  You know what this space station is going to cost per man-hour of \nresearch?--$11.5 million per hour. Can you imagine us, with our eyes \nwide open, saying we are going to build a space station for research \npurposes that will cost $11.5 million an hour. It is the height of \nirresponsibility.\n  The American people have a right to expect us to be fiscally \nresponsible. I want to ask my colleagues in closing, how far are you \nwilling to go? What is the threshold beyond which you are not willing \nto go? We have gone from $8 billion to $100 billion for the space \nstation and we are headed for $150 to $200 billion. We kill the Super \nCollider, we kill the Clinch River Breeder, and who here misses them? \nWe save America billions of dollars. You have a chance to save $80 \nbillion right now and help veterans, help veterans and help people who \nare desperately needing low-rent housing.\n  I plead with my opponents to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time on this side to \nthe distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes 48 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we have addressed costs here. This $96 \nbillion is a fictitious figure; $40 billion of that, by NASA estimates, \nincludes shuttle costs that are going to go on anyway. Besides all \nthose big figures taken into a 15-year account here, what we are \ntalking about in this bill is for fiscal 1999? We are talking about \n$2.3 billion versus $2.1 billion for last year, not a huge increase.\n  Now, there are always going to be competing needs for every bit of \nresearch. If we ever tried to solve all problems and to do everything \nwe wanted to do before we made research, we would never have moved off \nthe east coast. Basic research is a way of life, fundamental. This is a \nnew laboratory we are working on. It is our experience that dollars \nspent on research seem to have a way of paying off in the future beyond \nanything we ever foresee at the outset. That has been the history of \nthis country. We have gotten to the place now where much of the space \nprogram is increasingly going commercial.\n  On the flight we will be on, STS-95, we will have three specific \nprojects. We will have basic research, besides what we are talking \nabout, in the physical sciences, in the bio area. We will have the \nSpartan spacecraft making the measurements of the Sun and solar winds. \nWe will have research on aging, with which I will be involved. We will \nhave ultraviolet measurements that will be probably the most accurate \never made in space. These things cannot be done except in zero-G, not \non the ground.\n  We are talking about payoffs in commercial areas with three different \nprojects on STS-95. We are almost there. The figure was quoted a moment \nago that 90 percent of our hardware has been built. I think 75 percent \nof the milestones have already been passed. The first elements are due \nto be launched later this year. I think the Russians are due to launch \nthe first node, module, on November 20, and we are scheduled to launch \nthe first United States one on December 3.\n  It is a 16-nation commitment that we have. Certainly, it is better to \nbe working peacefully together than to be thinking about war, which we \nwere a few years ago. It is the biggest, most incredible scientific \nengineering experiment ever tried internationally. I think there can be \nincredible scientific possibilities and results from this, not only in \nmedicine, but learning about our world and our solar system, inspiring \nour young people to explore and to learn. The benefits are not out \nthere in space. The benefits are for us right here on Earth. That is \nthe important part of this whole thing. The Chabrow report said this. \nAlthough costs in scheduled growth have occurred, the magnitude of such \ngrowth has not been unusual, even when compared with other \ndevelopmental programs of lesser complexity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment No. 3062 \noffered by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \nvote in relation to the space station was the last vote of the evening. \nWednesday, the Senate will consider the IRS conference report. I expect \na considerable amount of time for debate to occur with respect to this \nIRS reform and restructure bill. A lot of Senators put a lot of time \ninto it. There are some important provisions I know they will want to \nemphasize. Therefore, a late afternoon or early evening vote can be\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n\nexpected to occur with respect to the IRS reform legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7538-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WELCOME BACK, SENATOR SPECTER\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

What is it about not having a \ngood debate that so appeals to them? Mr. President, I don't know.\n  But I do know this. Senators on this side of the aisle will continue \nto fight for our rights to offer amendments, regardless of \ncircumstance. There are many of our colleagues who may support this \nbill on final passage, and I respect their rights even though I \ndisagree. I personally think this bill is as bad as all the others that \nhave been proposed, and I hope that we have a good debate about how \ngood or how bad this legislation truly is. But for us to start the \ndebate by saying that there will be little or no debate, especially \nwhen it comes to our opportunity to offer amendments, precluding the \nvery right of every Senator to be heard, precluding the opportunity for \nus to offer ways in which we think it could be improved.\n  So we will have this debate over and over and over again. But on so \nmany occasions now, our colleagues on the other side insist on denying \nthe rights of every Senator to be heard. That doesn't have to happen. \nThis is not the House of Representatives. This is not the most \ndeliberative body in the world so long as we continue to utilize this \npractice. There is a time and a place for cloture, but that time and \nthat place is not as soon as the bill is laid down. Many of us could \nhave objected to the motion to proceed. We could have voted against \ngoing to the motion to proceed. We could have even filibustered the \nmotion to proceed. We didn't do that. Why? Because, in good faith,\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\nwe felt it was important to get on to the bill. But now what do we \nhave? Another in a continued pattern by our Republican colleagues to \ncurtail debate, to curtail thoughtful consideration of a very important \nissue.\n  I don't know of a more complicated bill that any one of us will have \nto address in this session of Congress than product liability. We could \noffer a pop quiz today, and I am sure many of our colleagues would \nprobably fail simply because we are not familiar with all the \nramifications of this issue. So for us, now, just at the beginning of \nthe debate to say we don't want amendments, we are not even sure we \nwant a lot of debate, we are just going to get this out of our way so \nwe can move on to other things, that is not the way the Senate ought to \nwork. That is not what we ought to be doing here.\n  What goes around comes around. This issue is going to come around \nagain and again and again. We will not be denied our rights.\n  So I am just very hopeful that even many of our Republican colleagues \nwho may have misgivings about this bill will join Democrats in \ndefeating cloture when the occasion arises on Thursday.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would simply ask the minority leader if \nhe might draw any parallel or distinction between the way this bill is \nnow being handled and other bills are handled, versus the tobacco \nlegislation and the question of cloture on that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator from Massachusetts raises a very \nimportant point. Exactly. We have seen this in a series of different \nepisodes over the course of the year. It is a dangerous precedent to be \nsetting. It is a remarkable admission from the other side that they are \nunwilling to face the reality here, to face the opportunity to have a \ngood debate on key votes having to do with improvement of the bill, \nhaving to do with different views on a bill. Just as we saw with \ntobacco.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, am I correct that the Senator from South \nDakota had offered an amendment to the appropriations bill on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights and that, if we had not had the majority \nleader's requests at this time, tonight we in this body would be \ndebating the Patients' Bill of Rights? Am I correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts raises a very important \nnote here. It seems that our colleagues on the other side are reverting \nto two practices: One is to file cloture as soon as a bill is laid \ndown. That is what they did in this case. That is what they did--what \nthey did on the Coverdell bill. The other practice is to offer a bill, \nand as soon as we offer an amendment that is in disagreement with their \nlarger scheme, they pull the bill. That is what happened to the Ag \nappropriations bill when we offered tobacco on Ag appropriations. That \nis what just happened on the VA-HUD bill.\n  So it seems to me there are two actions taken by our Republican \ncolleagues with some frequency here: File cloture, deny the colleagues \nthe right to offer amendments because of cloture; or pull the bill and \nmove on to something else and never come back. So the Senator from \nMassachusetts raises a very good point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will further yield, as I understand it \nnow, as a result of the action of the majority leader, the Ag \nappropriations bill has returned to the calendar and the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill has returned to the calendar. So it appears, would \nthe Senator not agree with me, that it is not the Democrats who are \nholding up the appropriations process and procedure--we were prepared \nto move ahead--but evidently it is the majority leader who has sent \nthese matters back to the calendar when it is our responsibility to go \nforward?\n  I am just wondering if the leader can tell us whether he has had any \nopportunity to talk to the majority leader about when we will have an \nopportunity to at least have discussion or debate on the measures that \nevidently are objectionable to the majority leader? Are we going to \nhave any opportunity to debate these measures, or are we going to be \nrequired to continue this charade and continue to try to offer these \namendments on other appropriations as well?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Unfortunately, I have to report to the Senator from \nMassachusetts that there doesn't appear to be any end in sight to this \ngagging of Democrats, to this notion that you either proceed on our \nterms or we won't proceed at all.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts just noted, we are no longer in a \nposition where the regular order is to go back to an appropriations \nbill. They have been shelved. They have been put back on the calendar. \nNow, we have to move to a motion to proceed to bring the bills back, \nwhere at least before we had the bills as the regular order should we \nfail to reach any kind of an agreement on how to proceed on a current \nbill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just finally, and I thank the Senator, does he find it \nsomewhat ironic that the Republican leadership is effectively gagging \nthe Senate from debating rules on HMOs which are gagging doctors from \ngiving the best health care advice? That we are being gagged here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate, so to speak, as well, by Republican \nleadership who have refused to permit a debate on this issue? There is \na certain irony in that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is the irony, I would say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. And the real sad thing is that this goes beyond the \nbill. This goes to the fact that 3,000 kids a day start smoking. It \ngoes to the tremendous number of victims of managed care abuses all \nover this country, in every State of the Union, who have said if you do \nanything in Congress this year, we want you to fix managed care. We \ndon't want you to wait until we lose more people. We want you to solve \nthis problem this year. And that is what we are trying to do. We have \n10 weeks to go, fewer than 40 legislative days. If we don't do it now, \nwhen are we going to do it?\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts makes a very important point. I yield \nto the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Democratic leader can yield for a \nquestion, I ask the Senator from South Dakota--and I am looking around \nthe floor, and I see a number of Senators on the floor. I see only two \nwho have served here longer than I. I ask my question in the form of \nthat context.\n  In the 24 years I have been here, Democrats have been twice in the \nmajority, twice in the minority. Thus, the Republicans twice in the \nminority and twice in the majority. Would it not be the experience of \nthe Senator from South Dakota, as it has been mine, that no matter \nwhich party was in the majority, the Senate and the Senate rules and \nthose who have led the Senate have always reflected the need of the \nSenate rules to protect both sides, both the majority and the minority, \nso that the United States of America would know that there was a full \ndebate on real issues where all voices were heard, not just the voice \nmaybe of temporarily the majority, but all voices would be heard?\n  And would it not be the experience of the Senator from South Dakota \nthat this procedure, something I have not seen in my 24 years here, \nthis procedure is said to make sure there will not be a vote where all \nAmericans are heard, will make sure there is not a debate where all \nAmericans are heard, but will be done in such a way that only one \nsegment of our country will be heard? Will that not be the experience \nof the Senator from South Dakota?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Vermont speaks with a wealth of \nexperience that goes well beyond what this Senator has had in his 12 \nyears in the Senate. But like him, I have not seen this practice used \nwith the frequency and the amazing degree of persistence demonstrated \nby the majority leader to cut off debate, to gag the Senate, to stop an \nopen opportunity for us to debate key issues, complicated issues such \nas this.\n  The Senator is right, this experience is one that I think really \nbears a great deal of explanation to the American people. Why on key \nissue after issue--why on education, why on tobacco, why on all these \nissues that we face this year--does the Senate majority persist in \nprecluding a good opportunity to have the kind of debate the American\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\npeople expect and want and need. The Senator from Vermont is absolutely \nright.\n  This is not the Senate's brightest moment. This is a very, very \ndisappointing episode in what has been a pattern all year long, and it \nis disappointing not only to us but the American people. I yield to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, I agree completely with his \ncomments.\n  If the Members of the U.S. Senate serving in the 2d session of the \n105th Congress were charged in court with having passed meaningful \nlegislation to help America, I am afraid there is not enough evidence \nto convict us, because if you look at what we have been about over the \nlast several months, with the exception of renaming Washington National \nAirport, we have little to show for the time we have spent in \nWashington and only 10 weeks to go.\n  The Senator is so correct, the President, in his State of the Union \nAddress, challenged this Congress, leaders on both sides of the aisle, \nto address the issues America really cares about: Saving Social \nSecurity, campaign finance reform, tobacco legislation, education, \nchild care, doing the things that American families would really \napplaud, responding to their needs.\n  Yet, we stand here today in the first week of July and we hear, \nagain, an effort by the majority leader to not only stop the train in \nan effort to stop legislation moving forward, but to stop the debate in \nwhat is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  It is a disappointment to me, and I think to a lot of people who are \nfollowing this session of the U.S. Senate, that we are back here this \nweek and not about the business that people really care about across \nAmerica.\n  I stand in support of what our leader, Senator Daschle, said, that it \nis a deprivation of our responsibility as U.S. Senators representing \nStates across this country and as representing families who expect us \nto respond to these needs, when you think of the opportunities we have \nalready missed--the campaign finance reform bill killed on the floor of \nthe Senate by the Republican leadership, and then we turned around with \nan opportunity to protect millions of our children from tobacco \naddiction, killed on the floor of the U.S. Senate by the Republican \nleadership time and time again.\n  Here is an effort by the Democrats to bring out legislation to \nprotect families and patients who go to their doctors wanting the very \nbest in medical care and find themselves twisted in knots by the \ninsurance industry and, once again, efforts on the Republican side to \nstop us.\n  I am afraid that when all is said and done this will turn out to be \none of the worst Congresses in this century in terms of its \nproductivity. And if we are to be measured by our productivity, I am \nnot sure that many Senators can collect their paychecks and talk about \ntheir pensions based on what we have been able to do or failed to do in \nthe last few months.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, I remind Senators \non the floor that they must pose a question----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator agree?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And then the speaker who has the floor will \nyield. Otherwise, I request they go through the Chair.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair for the clarification. Let me just \nsay, the Senator from Illinois is absolutely right, he was asking if I \nagreed with his characterization of the way this Senate has performed.\n  Sometime this year, our Republican colleagues will be asked, ``Tell \nus what you did on tobacco.'' They will say nothing.\n  Our Republican colleagues will be asked, ``Tell us what you did on \ncampaign reform.'' Our colleagues will say nothing.\n  Our Republican colleagues will be asked, ``Well, tell us what you did \non education; what did you do to build infrastructure; what did you do \nto reduce class size?'' And our Republican colleagues will have to say \nnothing.\n  Our Republican colleagues are going to be asked, ``Well, tell us what \ndid you do, then, on trying to address one of the most important health \ncare questions our country is facing today in managed care?'' And, \nagain, our Republican colleagues will say nothing.\n  Mr. President, the list continues to grow. Why? Because they appear \nto be afraid of a debate, appear to be afraid to take this issue to its \nsuccessful conclusion. If we don't go along, we don't do anything on \nthat particular issue. That isn't the way this Senate is supposed to \nperform.\n  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I inquire of the distinguished Democratic \nleader if he is not aware of what the effect of this cloture motion may \nbe on the product liability legislation? I raise that question of the \nDemocratic leader because I am a cosponsor of this bill. I am one of a \nhandful of Democrats who have supported the work of my good friend, \nSenator Gorton from the State of Washington, and Senator Jay \nRockefeller, our colleague from West Virginia, who are the lead \nsponsors of this legislation.\n  I raise the point with the Democratic leader; I go back to the days \nof Jack Danforth and working on a proposal some 10 years ago on product \nliability legislation, tort reform. As someone who authored, along with \nSenator Domenici, the securities litigation reform bill and uniform \nstandards, I am very interested in seeing us get a bill done here. We \nhave indications the White House is going to be supportive of this \nlegislation. For the first time, we might be able to do something about \nthis issue.\n  I am inclined to agree with the managers and principal authors of \nthis bill that we probably ought to keep this bill pretty clean. So I \nam sympathetic to that notion.\n  But I cannot imagine at this point filing cloture on this bill. I \ndisagree with the majority of my colleagues on this side who disagree \nwith this bill, but I will fight with every power in me as a Member of \nthis body to see to it that any Member has a right to raise amendments \nabout this bill.\n  I may vote against all the amendments, but if we reach a point here, \nMr. President--and I say this to ask a question of the Democratic \nleader--if we reach the level where we end up becoming sort of a mirror \nimage of the House, the other body, where we deprive the minority, as \nthe rules of the House allow, to cut off debate where the will of the \nmajority prevails, then we turn this institution into nothing more than \na mirror image of the institution down the hall. But in this body it is \nsomething different. Here, the rights of the minority are to be \nprotected. And so the right to offer amendments, to be heard, is \nsacrosanct when dealing with the U.S. Senate.\n\n  So it is with a deep sense of regret that I inform my colleagues, who \nhave worked hard on this bill, that I will oppose a cloture motion. I \nhope other Democrats who support this bill will do likewise, so that we \ncan get back to the business of debating this bill, take the day or 2 \nthat it needs to be debated here, let the amendments be offered, let us \ndefeat them if we have a majority here, and get about the business of \npassing this legislation so that this Congress might deal with product \nliability legislation.\n  I raise that, Mr. President, in the form of a question to my \ncolleague, the Democratic leader, because I am saddened by this. Why \nare we filing cloture on this bill? We are coming this close to, for \nthe first time, dealing with tort reform, really dealing with this \nissue, not in as comprehensive a way as some would like, but a real \nchance for the first time ever. And you are taking people like me who \nsupport this bill and asking me to vote in a way that would disallow my \ncolleagues from offering amendments on this legislation and thereby \nkilling this bill. It will destroy this bill on tort reform over this \nprocedure.\n  So I raise the question to the Democratic leader, if in fact it is \nnot unwittingly maybe what the majority leader, who has offered the \ncloture motion, is achieving by forcing those of us who support this \nbill to oppose a cloture motion and then depriving us of legislation \nbeing heard and fully debated?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, the Senator from Connecticut has demonstrated his \ncharacteristic eloquence again. I would answer in the affirmative. I do \nnot\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nknow what motivation there may have been on the part of the majority \nleader, but I must say this, that it complicates dramatically the \nposition of those who support this legislation, complicates it \ndramatically. As the Senator from Connecticut correctly points out, it \ncould actually kill the very bill they are trying to pass.\n  Now, for those of us who want to protect Senators' rights, we are \nsurprised and I guess somewhat amazed at the actions just taken by the \nmajority. Keep in mind, if we pass cloture, all relevant amendments \nwill be barred. And yet our Republican colleagues have already laid an \namendment down, an amendment, I might add, that nobody has seen. You \ntalk about a legislative pig in a poke; there isn't a Senator on this \nside, maybe with one exception, who has seen the amendment just laid \ndown by the majority leader--not one, with one exception perhaps. I \nhave not talked to Senator Rockefeller.\n  So I am astounded that our Republican colleagues would say, ``We want \nour amendments, but we don't want you to have any. We're going to pass \nour amendment, but on the chance that you could pass one of yours, \nwe're going to preclude them all.''\n  Mr. President, the Senate cannot work that way. As the Senator from \nConnecticut just pointed out, we are acting more and more like the \nHouse of Representatives. If any one of our colleagues wishes to run, \nlet them declare their candidacy. There are all kinds of open seats, \nuncontested seats, on the other side. Go run. But if you want to be a \nU.S. Senator, live up to the responsibilities of the U.S. Senate. This \nis supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world.\n  How deliberative can we be when, vote after vote, amendment after \namendment, bill after bill, this side is precluded from offering \namendments either because the majority leader pulls the bill or they \nfile cloture immediately upon filing? That cannot work, Mr. President.\n  So I appreciate the wisdom of the Senator from Connecticut, and I \nmust say the courage, because clearly there could be Senators who \nmisinterpret, were it not for his eloquent explanation just now, why he \nis going to work to protect Senators' rights.\n  I must say, there will be Senators on the other side who will want \ntheir rights protected at some point. Majority or minority, it does not \nmatter, it happens to all of us.\n  So I appreciate the position taken by the Senator from Connecticut. I \nhope all of our colleagues have heard his explanation and his reasons. \nAnd I hope a lot of our Republican colleagues will join us. Cloture \nmust be defeated. We must protect Senators' rights, and we must protect \nthe institution of the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this Senator is puzzled, truly puzzled, by \nthe remarks which he has just had the privilege of hearing. The \nminority leader protests that we cannot have a debate on product \nliability because cloture has been filed on this substitute amendment. \nHe is joined by one of the supporters of the bill, the senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut, who evidently wants a debate on product liability.\n  But it is overwhelmingly evident from the remarks of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the Senator from Illinois, and the responses to those \nremarks on the part of the minority leader, that they do not have the \nslightest interest in a debate on product liability--not the slightest \ninterest in a debate on product liability.\n  They want a debate on their agenda. And they want a debate on their \nagenda whether it has already occupied weeks of the Senate's time or \nnot, whether they have already been offered a debate on that agenda or \nnot in a reasonable time, at which they could be taken up as individual \nmatters.\n  No. The net result, Mr. President, of the remarks of the minority \nleader is that they wish the right, at any time and under any set of \ncircumstances, to set the agenda of the Senate, the subject matter that \nthe Senate will be debating, and they want to engage in that agenda not \nonce, not twice, but on an unlimited basis whenever they wish to bring \nit up.\n  The Senator from Illinois implied, at least, that he wanted another \ndebate on what he calls ``campaign reform,'' on a proposal blatantly \nunconstitutional, a proposal clearly violating the free speech \nguarantees in the first amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates, a debate which the Senate had for more than 2 weeks and a \ndebate which the Senator from Illinois and the minority leader lost--\nlost only after threatening a filibuster themselves against any \ncampaign reform advocated by a majority of the Members on this side, \ncampaign reforms based on seeing to it that individuals did not have to \ncontribute to campaigns with which they did not agree, campaign reform \nbased on bringing light into the source of the kind of money that so \ndevastated and discredited the Presidential election of 1996.\n  Then the Senator from Illinois, and I believe the Senator from \nMassachusetts, spoke about tobacco legislation. Tobacco legislation, \nMr. President? Does my memory fail me? Did we not debate tobacco \nlegislation for the better part of 4 weeks on a bill relating to \ntobacco? I believe that we did. And I believe that the positions taken \nby most of the Members on the other side of the aisle ended up \nunsuccessful. And so what have we had since then? Four weeks is not \nenough?\n  Immediately thereafter, they attempted to redebate tobacco on another \nissue important to the people of the United States. They have now \ndestroyed the debate on a bill for the support of the Department of \nAgriculture and all of our agricultural across the United States by \ninsisting that we can't debate agriculture for 2 days and pass a bill \nwithout having another 4, 6 or 8 weeks on their tobacco agenda.\n  The Senator from Illinois says that nothing was done with respect to \neducation. I seem to remember at least a week, maybe 2 weeks, debating \nthe subject of reform of education in the United States. In fact, I \nbelieve it was just 2 weeks ago that we passed a bill on that subject \nand sent it to the President who has determined that he will veto. This \nSenator proposed to this body a true reform in the way in which we deal \nwith education, one that would have trusted our State education \nofficials, our local education officials, our teachers and our parents \nto make decisions about the education of their children without the \nconstant interference of bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who impose more \nthan half of the rules regulating the conduct in our schools, while \ncoming up with 7 or 8 percent of the money. Not a single Member on that \nside of the aisle was willing to vote for that proposal, and they said \nthe entire education reform bill would be filibustered to death if it \nwere included in any bill sent to the President of the United States.\n  Oh, no, Mr. President, we have debated education reform. We have \npassed in this body true education reform. I don't think at this point \nthat there is much point in going over it again.\n  Here today we were debating a vitally important appropriations bill \nfor veterans, for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. We \nhad a thoughtful debate, dividing both parties on the space station. We \nwere about to debate mortgage limitations and do the business of the \nSenate when the minority leader says, oh, no; we are not going to let \nthe majority of the Appropriations Committee go through an \nappropriations bill. We will debate our proposal for health care \nchanges, and we will do it right now.\n  Now, he did that in spite of the fact that when I was sitting in your \nseat as the acting President of the Senate, the majority leader 3 weeks \nago came down here and offered a full opportunity to the minority to \ndebate their health care proposals together with our health care \nproposals and to have direct votes on those proposals before the end of \nthis month of July 1998. That offer was totally rejected by the very \npeople who now demand we engage in that debate today as a part of an \nimportant bill on a totally and completely different subject.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. No, the Senator will not yield. The Senator will not \nyield.\n  So this Senate has debated a change in our campaign reform laws. It \nhas debated education reform and passed a bill on the subject. It has \ndebated tobacco legislation. And it is more than\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\nwilling and will debate health care legislation with the proposals of \nboth parties considered in that connection.\n  But no majority party, no majority leader, has ever permitted a set \nof circumstances under which the minority not only determines the \nagenda, but when the agenda is to be debated and how many times it is \nto be debated, even though that prevents a debate on vitally important \nappropriations bills for the conduct of the government, and in this \ncase a debate on an important product liability bill. As the manager of \nthat bill, had the minority leader said we would like to do what we did \njust 2 years ago and have a debate and several amendments about product \nliability, the way that the senior Senator from Connecticut was \nspeaking about the subject a few moments ago, I have no doubt that that \ndesire would be granted. I have no doubt that proposed changes in the \nsubstitute bill that is now before the Senate would have been debated. \nI think those proposed changes would have been defeated.\n  Two years ago this Congress did spend, I think, a full week or more \non a much broader and more all-encompassing product liability bill. It \nwas debated then by the minority party as a product liability bill \nwithout the attempt to move on to a totally and completely unrelated \nsubject. It was passed. It was sent to the President of the United \nStates for reasons that this Senator did not consider to be \nparticularly persuasive. The President of the United States vetoed that \nbill.\n  Then the junior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, and \nI worked diligently for almost 2 years in coming up with a bill to be \nproposed here on that subject with which the President of the United \nStates would agree and with which the President of the United States \ndoes agree. We are now told that an attempt actually to debate that \nsubject and to vote on this bill is somehow or another an infringement \non the rights of the minority party.\n  I heard during the course of the last week over this, the minority \nparty does want one change in the bill on product liability having to \ndo with guns. That amendment, I am informed by the Parliamentarian, \nwill be germane after cloture. It can be debated and it can be voted \nupon. For all practical purposes, any limitation of an already modest \nbill on product liability can be debated and voted upon after cloture. \nIt is difficult to persuade this Senator that anyone on this side of \nthe aisle wants to expand this product liability bill and cause it to \ncover a greater field related to product liability than it does at the \npresent time.\n  That was the pretense set forth in the initial remarks of the \nminority leader, that he wishes a fuller and more complete debate on \nproduct liability. But that pretense was shattered instantly by the \nSenators who asked him to yield to questions and simply stated, and I \nrepeat it again, that they wanted to debate subjects totally unrelated \nto product liability. Three of the four subjects they mentioned have \nalready been debated at length on the floor of this Senate and \ndecided--decided in a way they don't like--but decided pursuant to the \nrules of the Senate of the United States.\n  The fourth will clearly be debated, will be debated on its own \nmerits, and will be debated at a time at which both the members of the \nminority party and the members of the majority party can set forth \ntheir proposals and have the merits of their proposal both fully \ndebated and determined and decided under the rules of the Senate.\n  This artificial fury that we have listened to here for most of the \nlast hour is directed partly at party politics and partly as a highly \nskillful way of destroying a product liability bill to which the \nPresident of the United States, the leader of their party, has agreed. \nIt may well be successful. The Senator from Connecticut is right if he \nrefuses to support a bill that he has supported through his entire \ncareer because it won't also carry debates on campaign laws, health \ncare, education, and tobacco, then unfortunately all of the work of \nwhich he was a part, and the Senator from West Virginia was a part, and \nmany of us were a part of on this side, and the President of the United \nStates was a part, may be wasted.\n  I think that may very well be the goal of those who engage in this \nartificial outrage about whether or not we should deal with product \nliability for a few days and debate that issue, finish it, have a vote \non it, finish our appropriations bills, have votes on each of them, and \ndeal with a health care debate before the end of this month. That only \nis the desire of the majority leader in the normal management of the \nSenate, just as it was the desire under identical circumstances when \nthe majority leader was on the other side of the aisle.\n  It is probably a more open debate on issues of interest to the \nminority than I could remember during the course of Congresses in which \nmy party was in the minority. But this rhetoric this afternoon here has \nlittle, if anything, to do with product liability, or a debate on this \nproduct liability bill, or attempts to improve or to amend this product \nliability bill with product liability provisions. It has to do with the \ndemand of the minority leader that he determine not only the agenda, \nnot only the subjects that the Senate will debate, but the length of \ntime that debate will take, the number of times the debates on \nparticular subjects will be taken.\n  The Senate cannot operate under those sets of circumstances. It ought \nnot to operate under those circumstances. I have little hope for those \nwho simply oppose any legal reform whatsoever, even when the President \nhas agreed to it. I do hope that those who believe in product \nliability, those who were on the other side on each of the three issues \nthat have already been debated, and those who will have the opportunity \nto debate health care when they wish to do so, will have the courage to \nsee to it that we are able to debate this product liability bill and \nreach a conclusion on it in a reasonable period of time, so that we can \ngo on to other subjects that are of importance to the Senate and to the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague. I am \ndisappointed in the minority leader's statement, and also its tone. A \nlot of us came back from the one-week break for the Fourth of July and \nsaid we have work to do, we have appropriations bills to pass, we have \nproduct liability reform bill to pass, we have the IRS reform bill. And \nthen somebody says this is an unbelievable procedure. No, it is not. We \nare moving to a conference report. That has priority under the rules of \nthe Senate. We are moving to a conference report on a bill that already \npassed the House and the Senate, and, hopefully, the President will \nsign it. I think it may be one of the most notable and significant \nachievements of this Congress.\n  Then our colleagues say, wait a minute, you are denying us an \nopportunity to offer an amendment. I disagree. The Senator from \nArkansas had an amendment on the space station that lasted most of the \nafternoon. We were clearly willing to take amendments. We had an \namendment that Senator Kohl from Wisconsin and I were going to offer \ndealing with FHA. That was bipartisan. We were trying to do the \nSenate's work. As a matter of fact, the Senate was planning on staying \non the VA appropriations bill so we could finish tonight, tomorrow, or \nthe next day, to do our work. The minority leader tried to place an \namendment--or did file an amendment called the Patients' Bill of Rights \non the appropriations bill. He has a right to do so, but he knows it is \nnot the time or place to do it.\n  For the information of our colleagues and the viewing public, the \nmajority leader has already said we will take up the so-called issue \ndealing with health care and the regulation of managed care, with the \nvery nice title of ``The Patients' Bill of Rights.'' We will take it up \nthis month. But in the meantime, let's finish our work, let's pass the \nIRS reform bill, let's pass appropriations bills.\n  We are willing to have a decent amount of time on the so-called \nPatients' Bill of Rights this month and to consider alternatives. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has an alternative. I am working on an \nalternative. I may have a couple of other ideas. And we are willing to \nconsider relevant amendments. I think it is a mistake to do it\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\nall month. Maybe some want to. Maybe they think there is political \nfodder to be gained. Some of us know we have some work to do. That is \nour intention.\n  The majority leader made it clear that we have work to do. We are \ngoing to be voting on Mondays and Fridays. We should be passing bills. \nWe have only passed 2 appropriations bills; we have 13 to do. The House \npassed five, and next week they will probably pass another five. We \nare, in the meantime, hoping to get two bills done this week. \nUnfortunately, instead, the minority said we need to put the Patients' \nBill of Rights on one and then the smoking bill--even though we have \nspent 4 weeks on the tobacco bill. Maybe if they came up with a better \nalternative, we could pass a bill. But they came up with one that would \ncost hundreds of billions of dollars, and I think we rightfully \nrejected it.\n  They said, ``We don't have an opportunity to debate our issues.'' \nThey had 4 weeks on the so-called tobacco bill. Campaign finance reform \nhas been in the Senate on numerous occasions, including this Congress. \nWe insisted on having one amendment that said campaign contributions \nwould be voluntary. Most of our colleagues on the Democrat side said, \n``No, no, we can't have voluntary campaign contributions. That would be \nunheard of. We can't have that kind of reform.''\n\n  One of our colleagues said that the Senate can't work this way. \nReally, what they are trying to say is, ``We want to have product \nliability reform on the floor, and we want to dump our entire Democrat \nagenda on,'' half of which they tried and could not get passed \npreviously. They want to dump it on this bill or on the appropriations \nbills, and they will keep trying until maybe something will stick.\n  And then they said, ``Wait a minute, if you file cloture''--cloture, \nfor the information of people not aware of the Senate rules, it would \neliminate a lot of extraneous amendments. They are acting like that \nhasn't happened before. George Mitchell, as majority leader, was the \ninstigator of the quick-draw cloture motion. He would file cloture so \nfast, it would make your head spin. He did it time and time again. I \ndon't like cloture. I think it happens to be too restrictive.\n  The Senator from Washington, who was managing the bill, has said we \nare perfectly willing to work with colleagues if they have amendments \nthey want to discuss on product liability. We can work that up and come \nup with an agreement. Obviously, our colleagues on the minority side \nsaid, ``No. We want to put our whole agenda on. We want another debate \non tobacco and the Patients' Bill of Rights, and debate on schools or \neducation''--you name it. They want to put everything on there except \nproduct liability.\n  In other words, they don't really want product liability. They have \nthat right, but we also have a right to try to get the Senate's \nbusiness done. So we are going to pass the conference report on IRS \nreform. We are going to take that up tomorrow. Again, I hope all of my \ncolleagues will support that. We are going to have a vote on cloture on \nproduct liability reform. If colleagues are really interested in having \nlegitimate amendments dealing with that issue, they could make a \nproposal and we could probably work that out--if we keep the amendments \nrelevant. Are we going to say you can dump your entire agenda on it? \nNo. At least it is my hope that we don't do that. That is the reason we \nhave cloture--to keep amendments germane, finish our work, and be done \nwith it.\n  So I am disappointed in the rhetoric and the tone that we heard \ntonight. I hope we will come back and say, wait a minute, we only have \n4 weeks this month and a few weeks in September--all of the month of \nSeptember, and maybe part of October to finish the Senate's business. \nWe have to pass a lot of appropriations bills. I still hope we will get \na budget. I hope we will pass tax relief. So we have some significant \nreform that needs to happen, and we need to do the work of the Senate.\n  I notice my friend from Massachusetts on the floor. He has a bill \ncalled the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am perfectly willing to debate \nthat issue. We are willing to spend some time on that issue and give \ncolleagues a vote on the Democrat proposal, which has been recently \nintroduced--I guess today--on the VA-HUD appropriations bill. It \ndoesn't belong on an appropriations bill. There is a point of order. \nThat is legislation on an appropriations bill. That is the reason we \nhave the rule. It does not belong there. The majority leader said we \nwill take it up sometime this month, and with some amendments dealing \nwith that issue, relevant health care amendments.\n\n  If our colleagues are just interested in rhetorical flourishes and \nmaybe campaign issues, they can make that attempt. But that won't \nlegislate. That won't change the law. If they are interested in \nchanging the law, I urge them to work with us. Let's come up with an \nagreement where we can bring the issue up, have an adequate amount of \ndebate on the so-called Patients' Bill of Rights, and have different \nalternatives considered and voted on.\n  I make that point. This side is willing. We had a significant debate \non tobacco. We are willing to have a debate on the so-called Patients' \nBill of Rights. We have had debate on campaign reform. We have had \ndebate on education. Now we have to finish the appropriations bills. We \nhave to do the work of the Senate. It is going to take both sides \nworking together to make that happen.\n  I hope we will have greater cooperation exhibited in the future for \nthe Senate to really get its work done in a timely, efficient, and \nproductive manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am encouraged certainly by the comments \nof the acting floor leader now that he says we will have an opportunity \nto debate the issues on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We look forward \nto that opportunity. But I will just take a few moments of the Senate's \ntime--I will not take a great deal of time--to really correct the \nRecord.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma remembers, and should remember very \nclearly, the U.S. Senate overturned in 1995 the longstanding rule that \nwe would not have legislation on appropriations. And it was the \nRepublican Party that overturned that concept. Every single Republican, \nincluding the Senator from Oklahoma, voted to overturn the ruling of \nthe chair and allow legislation on appropriations. So, now we have \nlegislation on appropriations. I think it is regrettable, and should \nthe Republican leader want to alter and change that, I think he would \nfind that there would be strong support for that.\n  But, Mr. President, I want to get back and talk for just a moment or \ntwo about what the issues really are. We have just listened to our \nfriends from the States of Washington and Oklahoma speak on the floor \nabout what cannot be done, or what should not be done.\n  Earlier this afternoon, in a time-honored process and procedure, the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, sent to the desk of the U.S. Senate \nan amendment to provide for a Patients' Bill of Rights, a recognition \nthat in this country too often those who are making health care \ndecisions are actually insurance company accountants rather than \ndoctors. Too often the doctors, who represent the best interests of the \npatients, are caught in this extraordinary dilemma and understand that \nthey are put between a rock and a hard place. Too often in our country \nwe find that managed care is mismanaged care. And we have heard \nexamples of this on the Senate floor time and time again over the \nperiod of these past weeks. I dare say that we have had few days that \nhave gone by when Senators have not spoken about particular tragedies \nthat have been experienced in their States.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment should have allowed the Senate to debate \nthe issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, debate it this afternoon, \ndebate it this evening, debate it tomorrow, but debate it and reach \nsome kind of a conclusion on the issue. The President has spoken. He \nspoke as recently as this afternoon in support of the legislation that \nwas included in Senator Daschle's proposal.\n  That is what this is about. We have that opportunity to debate \nmanaged care reform. The Democratic leader offered the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. It is an issue that Republicans and Democrats across the \ncountry want us to do\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\nsomething about. We are being denied that opportunity because the \nmajority leader pulled the bill down and put it back on the calendar, \nas was his wont to do, and we are again denied the opportunity to \ndebate this critically important issue.\n  So our efforts to move toward that debate have been temporarily \ndeferred--deferred perhaps for a day or two, but certainly not longer \nthan a day or two. We are going to come back to that issue and keep \ncoming back. And our friends on the majority side better get used to \nit. They may get into a situation where they are going to put \nappropriations bill after appropriations bill after appropriations bill \nback on the calendar because the Senate will want to debate a Patients' \nBill of Rights, and the Republican Leadership will want to continue to \ndeny us that opportunity. Mr. President, we will continue to demand \ndebate because the American people are demanding it.\n  You can say, Why are we in this kind of a situation? Why aren't we \nfollowing a regular order, the procedure that everyone learns in civics \nclass and in their study of American history, that says when \nlegislation is introduced, it goes to the committee, the committee \nmarks it up, it comes to the floor, it is acted upon on the floor, the \ntwo bodies get together in a conference, and, if they agree, they send \nit to the President of the United States?\n  The reason the Senator from South Dakota offered the amendment is \nbecause we could not get a markup and we could not get a hearing in the \nappropriate committee. We were denied that opportunity--denied it, \nturned down, thumbs down to the Senators who supported that \nlegislation. No, you can't have a hearing on that legislation in our \ncommittee. The Republicans told those of us on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee that not only can't you have that hearing, but, if \nyou introduce the legislation, we will not give you a markup on it. We \nwill not let you have a debate in the committee. We are going to \nobstruct the whole committee process so you will not be able to advance \nyour issues, and the issues of the American people.\n  I did not hear that talked about by the Senator from Washington. I \ndid not hear that talked about from the Senator from Oklahoma. The \nmajority leader has put forward several lists of his priorities for the \nsession, and the Patients' Bill of Rights is not on any one of them--\nnot on any one of them. The Republican leadership wants to stonewall--\nstonewall on this issue, which is of such great importance to families \nall across the country. That is why the Democratic leader offered this \namendment, because the Republican leadership is trying to stonewall it.\n  So, Mr. President, are we going to say--those of us who favor patient \nprotection legislation--that we are going to be denied consideration of \nthe committee, we are going to be denied a markup in the committee, and \nwe are going to be denied floor debate by the majority leader and the \nRepublican leadership, that we are not even going to consider this \nissue in the U.S. Senate?\n  No. That is not the kind of U.S. Senate that our Founding Fathers \nintended, nor has today been one of our best and greatest days. But we \nare going to debate this issue, and we are going to act on it. Make no \nmistake about it.\n  And we are going to come right back after that and consider an \nincrease in the minimum wage. Our Republican friends better hear that \nas well. We can't get the markup on the increase in the minimum wage \nfor workers in this country--workers who have not benefited by the \nextraordinary explosion of the stock markets and the extraordinary \nincrease in the accumulation of wealth. These are men and women who are \nworking 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, primarily single women, \nprimarily women who are heads of households with children. This is a \nwomen's issue. It is a children's issue. It is a fairness issue. And we \nare going to consider it this year. We know Republican leaders are \nopposed to that.\n  What else is new? They were opposed to it last time. And we were able \nto be successful. It wasn't on the Republican agenda the last time we \nsaw an increase in the minimum wage. The increase in the minimum wage \nhas never been on the Republican agenda. Yet we have been successful in \ndoing so. And we will be successful in doing so this time.\n  So that is why we find ourselves where we do this evening. And here \nthe Democratic leader offers our amendment, makes a brief comment--a \nbrief comment--about it. And then, bingo, the bill is pulled. Now we \nhear from the Republican leadership that, Oh, well, you objected to a \nconsent agreement that could get this proposal before the Senate and to \nact on it.\n  I would love to take the time of the Senate to go through this, but \nlet me just include the appropriate parts of this proposal. Let me just \nmention a very interesting aspect of the consent agreement, to which \nthe Senator from Washington referred. I asked him to yield so we could \ngo through this agreement together. He refused the opportunity to do \nso. I can understand why, too. I might have wanted to do the same if I \nhad to defend this proposed agreement. This is what was included in the \nagreement. And I will include the whole agreement. But let me read a \nsection:\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that the Chair not entertain a \n     motion to adjourn or recess for the August recess prior to a \n     vote on or in relation to the majority leader's bill and the \n     minority leader's amendment.\n\n  And that following those votes:\n\n       It be in order for the majority leader--\n\n  Listen to this--\n\n     to return the legislation to the calendar.\n\n  ``Return the legislation to the calendar.''\n  And the Senator from Washington has the audacity to say on the floor \nof the Senate that the consent that was offered by the majority leader \nwould have actually gotten these measures up?\n  You know what this proposal is effectively saying? This says that \nafter the votes, even if we win the Patients' Bill of Rights with a \nmajority of the Members of the Senate, it will be in order for the \nmajority leader to--send it to the President of the United States if \nthe House has already acted on it? No. To send it to the House of \nRepresentatives if they have not acted on it? No. Under the majority \nleader's proposal, if we pass it, after a debate, the majority leader \nsends it right back up there to the desk. It is over. Good-bye, \nfarewell, so long, to protections for the patients of this country.\n  Now, that is a farce, an absolute farce. I could go through the whole \nconsent agreement, but it should not be given any more attention \nbecause it is a farce offered, evidently, only to make a political \npoint.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is a commonsense plan that guarantees \nfundamental protections that every good insurance company already \nprovides and that every American who pays insurance premiums deserves \nto have when serious illness strikes.\n  But the Republican leader's position is to protect the insurance \nindustry instead of protecting the patients. They know they cannot do \nthat in the light of day, so their strategy is to work behind closed \ndoors to kill the bill, keep it bottled up in committee, no markup, no \nfloor debate, no vote. That has been the strategy. Ask any Member of \nthis body whether they can contest that. They cannot. No markup, no \nfloor debate, no vote, no fair time agreement.\n  Mr. Willis Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica, when asked in an interview published in the Rocky Mountain \nNews to sum up the strategy of the businesses opposed to patient \nprotections, replied:\n\n       There's a lot to be said for ``just say no.''\n\n  ``Just say no.'' The author of the article goes on to report that at \na strategy session last month called by a top aide to Senator Don \nNickles, Gradison advised Republicans to avoid taking public positions \nthat could draw fire during the election campaign. Opponents will rely \non Republican leaders in both Chambers to keep managed care legislation \nbottled up.\n  Well, they have done a good job of bottling it up tonight. We would \nhave had an opportunity for debate if they had not pulled down the \nunderlying legislation. But, no, they bottled it up by sending the bill \nright back to the calendar.\n  That has been the strategy for the past year--keep the Patients' Bill \nof Rights bottled up, engage in a campaign of misinformation and \ndisinformation, cater to the special interests, ignore insurance \ncompany abuses, and ignore the will of the\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\nAmerican people. We are seeing that strategy in this Chamber this \nevening.\n  Now, Mr. President, the rights that are included in our legislation \nare commonsense components of quality care that every family believes \nthey were promised when they signed up for insurance coverage and paid \ntheir premiums. Virtually all of the protections that this legislation \nprovides already apply to Medicare, are recommended by the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners, which is a bipartisan group, or \nwere recommended by the President's Advisory Commission, another \nnonpartisan group, or even established as voluntary standards by the \nmanaged care industry itself through their trade association.\n  These commonsense rights include access to appropriate specialists \nwhen a patient's condition requires specialty care. It would allow \npeople with chronic illnesses or disabilities to have referrals to the \nspecialists they need on a regular basis.\n  It assures that patients whose plans cover prescription drugs can \nhave access to drugs needed to save their life or protect their health \neven if the drugs are not included on their plan's restricted list.\n  They are assured that persons suffering from serious symptoms can go \nto the nearest emergency room without worrying that their plan will \ndeny coverage. No patients with the symptoms of a heart attack should \nbe forced to put their life at risk by driving past the emergency room \ndown the street to the managed care hospital farther away, and that is \nhappening here in the United States tonight.\n  No patient with symptoms of a stroke should be forced to delay \ntreatment to the point where paralysis and disability are permanent \nbecause an accountant in the managed care headquarters does not respond \npromptly and appropriately.\n  Reforms must protect the integrity of the doctor-patient \nrelationship. Gag clauses and improper incentive arrangements should \nhave no place in American medicine. They are absolutely appalling, Mr. \nPresident.\n  This amendment only says that any reform worthy of the name must \nguarantee that insurance plans meet the special needs of women and \nchildren. Women should have access to gynecologists for needed \nservices. No woman with breast cancer should be forced to endure a \ndrive-through mastectomy against the advice of her doctor or be denied \nreconstructive surgery following breast cancer surgery if that is her \nchoice.\n  No child with a childhood cancer should be told that a urologist who \nhappens to be in the plan's network will treat him, even if that \nurologist has no experience or expertise with children or with that \ntype of cancer.\n  Patients should have the right to appeal their plans' decisions to \nindependent third parties. Today, if a health plan breaks its promise, \nthe only recourse for most patients is to go to court, a time-\nconsuming, costly process that may not provide relief in time to save a \nlife or prevent a disability.\n  Independent review was recommended unanimously by the President's \nCommission. Republicans and Democrats alike recommended independent \nreview unanimously. It has worked successfully in Medicare for more \nthan three decades. Families deserve the basic fairness that only a \ntimely, impartial appeal can provide.\n  Without such a mechanism, any rights guaranteed to patients exist on \npaper only, and they are often worth no more than the paper on which \nthey are printed. When the issues are sickness and health, and often as \nserious as life and death, no health insurance company should be \nallowed to be both judge and jury.\n  When health plan's misconduct results in serious injury or death, \npatients and their families should be able to hold those plans \naccountable for their actions. Every other industry in America can be \nheld responsible for its actions. Why should health plans whose \ndecisions can truly mean the difference between life and death enjoy \nthis unique immunity?\n  We had a debate on the issues of immunity not long ago with regard to \nthe tobacco industry, and this body voted overwhelmingly not to give \nimmunity to tobacco. These health plans have immunity today under the \nERISA provisions. That is not right and we ought to address it. Every \nday and every night that we delay it, the health, the good health of \nAmerican families is threatened. You would think, when you listen to \nthe Republican leadership talk about scheduling, that it doesn't matter \na twiddle whether this debate goes on today or tomorrow or next week or \nnext month or next year. It does. And every day we delay means that \nmore families' health protections are threatened.\n  Under the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act, patients whose \nlives have been devastated or destroyed by the reckless behavior of \ntheir health plan have no ability to go to court to obtain appropriate \nredress. ERISA preempts all State remedies, so patients are limited to \nFederal ERISA remedies, which will only cover the cost of the procedure \nfor which the plan failed to pay.\n  Just the cost of the procedure--some remedy. You can be crippled for \nlife by cancer of the spine because the plan refused to authorize a \ntest costing a few hundred dollars to detect the cancer in its early \nstages, and all you can get back to help support your family is the \ncost of the test. That is no remedy. That is wrong. And our bill does \nsomething about it.\n  During the debate on the tobacco legislation, as I mentioned, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike voted overwhelmingly to support the \nproposition that no industry in America should be exempt from \naccountability because of its actions, but because of the ERISA \npreemption, one industry alone--the health insurance industry--enjoys \nthis protection. That is wrong and today the Senate should have the \nopportunity to say it is wrong.\n  ERISA preemption applies to the millions of Americans who get their \ncoverage through a private employer, but it does not apply to 23 \nmillion State and local employees and their families. It does not apply \nto Medicaid patients. It does not apply to Medicare. And we have not \nheard a shred of evidence that the ability of State and local \nemployees, Medicaid patients and Medicare patients to sue their health \nplans has imposed significant costs on those plans. That case has not \nbeen made.\n  Mr. President, 23 million State and county employees have that kind \nof ability to sue, and we have not seen that the costs of their plans \nhave been higher than others. So I challenge my colleagues who oppose \nthis provision to explain to the American people why State and local \ngovernment employees should be able to hold their taxpayer-financed \nhealth plans accountable if they are injured or killed by the plan's \nbehavior, but equally hard-working Americans employed by private \ncompanies should be denied this basic right. Explain that to me.\n  Our legislation simply removes the Federal preemption provision. It \ncreates no Federal right to sue and lets States take whatever steps \nthey see fit. So many of those who oppose this legislation are fond of \ntalking about the need to keep Washington out of decisions by States, \nbut when the profits of special interests are at stake, it suddenly \nbecomes better for bureaucrats in Washington rather than elected State \nand local officials to decide what is best for people in their State. \nThis amendment should not be controversial for any Member of the Senate \nwho is serious about protecting patients from insurance company abuse. \nIt is supported by the American Medical Association--and more than 170 \nother organizations, Mr. President. Let me just give you a few.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is supported by the American Medical \nAssociation, the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, the American \nCancer Society, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the \nNational Partnership for Women and Families, the National Association \nof Children's Hospitals, the AFL-CIO, the American Association of \nRetired Persons and many other groups representing physicians, health \ncare providers, children, women, families, consumers, persons with \ndisabilities, small businesses, Americans with serious illnesses, \nreligious organizations, and working families.\n  Find me another piece of pending legislation that has that kind of \nsupport. But we are told we cannot even debate it tonight. We are told \nwe cannot even consider it tonight. We are told we cannot even move \nthis legislation to have\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\na rollcall vote to see who is for it and who is against it.\n  It is rare for such a broad and diverse coalition to come together in \nsupport of legislation. But they have done so to end the flagrant \nabuses that hurt so many families. The choice is clear. The Senate \nshould stand with patients, families and physicians, not the well-\nheeled special interests that put profits ahead of patients.\n  The American people know what is going on. Movie audiences across the \ncountry erupt in cheers when actress Helen Hunt attacks the abuses of \nmanaged care in the film ``As Good As It Gets.'' Helen Hunt won an \nOscar for that performance, but managed care is not winning any Oscars \nfrom the American people. Everyone knows that managed care today is not \nas good as it gets.\n  It is time for Congress to end the abuses of patients and physicians \nby HMOs and managed care health plans. Too often, managed care is \nmismanaged care. No amount of distortions or smokescreens by insurance \ncompanies can change those facts. A Patients' Bill of Rights can stop \nthese abuses, and let's pass it before more patients have to suffer.\n  We want to tell our friends on the other side of the aisle that they \nare going to see this amendment day after day after day after day, \nuntil this body has a chance to debate it and vote on it. Let me give \nthe assurance of that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask that I be allowed to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7565-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEBATING THE HEALTH CARE BILL\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know there has been some brouhaha this \nafternoon about not being able to debate a health care bill, and I came \ndown here earlier today to talk about the bill we were on, the VA-HUD \nbill, an extremely important piece of legislation that was set \nregularly on this agenda. Amendments were being offered to it. \nEverybody has known for some time that we were going to be dealing with \nhealth care and managed care and HMOs and that sort of thing. It is \ncertainly going to be coming up on our agenda when the time is right, \nand everybody will have full opportunity to debate that issue. I hope \nwe do. I expect we can make some improvement in our health care policy \nin America.\n  But the bill that we were on was important. I submit it was a \npolitical act by people in this body to derail where we were going, to \nintroduce onto the VA-HUD bill this kind of massive change in agenda to \ntry to create a debate on health care when this body was on another \nitem. That is what the majority leader is for, to try to set agenda in \na rational way. He has done that. We are going to be on health care \nlater, but we should have stayed on the bill that we were on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7573-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NASA\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am disappointed the administration has \nseen fit to reduce NASA's budget by $183 million this year. Frankly, I \nthink it ought to be increased. I would like to share a couple of \nthoughts about that with the Members of this body and the people who \nmay be listening.\n  From 1983 to 1992, NASA's budget went up from $7 to $14 billion. That \nis less than 1 percent of the national budget in this country, but that \nwas a significant increase. During that time, they made two planetary \nlaunches. In the last number of years, that budget has seen a \nsignificant reduction. In fact, according to a committee that was \nformed in 1991, a committee on the future of space formed by President \nBush, they had the expenditures for NASA going up to as high as $40 or \n$50 billion. As it turned out, under the previously agreed-upon budget \nfor NASA, we should be at about $16 or $18 billion. In fact, that \nbudget has been cut every year, and over the last 5 years they have \nsustained a $27 billion reduction in what was projected for their \nbudget even under our last budget agreement.\n  People say, ``Jeff, that is just numbers; it doesn't mean much.'' \nNASA has cut its employees since 1993 by 25 percent. They have cut \ntheir employees 25 percent. There is no agency in this American \nGovernment that has done a better job of producing more for less than \nthey have.\n  In fact, the fiscal year 1994 budget for NASA was $14.5 billion, and \nthe fiscal year 1998 for NASA is $13.6 billion.\n  During this same time, they have been sustaining these substantial \nlosses in income. They are now making planetary launches one every 10 \nweeks. Whereas they used to do two planetary launches in 9 years, they \nare now doing them one every 10 weeks, even though their budget is down \nand employees are down 25 percent. They are doing some remarkable \nthings.\n  Last July 4, the Martian lander landed, and we saw those vivid \nphotographs that were shipped all over the world. The American people \nand the people of the world stood in amazement as we saw the actual \nground of the planet Mars. It was an exciting time. My family and I \nwatched that in our home with amazement and pride at what this country \nhad accomplished.\n  Let me point this out: 20 years before, we had done another Martian \nlanding. We had not had one in 20 years. The Martian landing 20 years \nbefore, in actual dollars, cost 10 times as much as the one last year. \nThey were able to accomplish this landing last year for one-tenth of \nthe cost 20 years before.\n  This is the kind of achievement that is important for our country. \nThe whole world watched it. Mr. Dan Goldin, who directs the NASA \nprogram, told us that they had more hits on their web site from around \nthe world than they even had in the United States. It was by far the \nbiggest single time of people tuning in to the NASA web site from all \nover the world.\n  The world was watching America. We are the leader in space. We need \nto remain the leader in space. We are a nation of explorers. That is \nour heart and soul. That is our national characteristic. We have \nexplored this Earth pretty well. We are now exploring the heavens. We \nneed to continue forward with that.\n  Sure, the space station has gone over, but from the numbers I have \njust told you, even though the space station has cost more than it \nshould--and a lot of that is involved with trying to work with the \nRussians, who have not been very effective in fulfilling their portion \nof it, and we need to evaluate that--everything else they have been \ndoing has been doing more for less.\n  We are going to be able to continue to have repeat launches at less \ncost and more success and highly technical launches that can bring us \nthe kind of science and improvements in our life that can benefit the \nentire world. This is the kind of thing with which America needs to be \ninvolved. I am excited about it.\n  I wish we were still on that bill. I had some things to say about it. \nWe are going to handle health care as we go down the road, but I think \nit is important for the people of America to note that we moved off \nthat bill because the other party sought to change the agenda that was \nset, to go off on an entirely new tangent, attaching to this bill an \nentirely different subject matter that requires a great deal of debate \nand discussion. That was not the appropriate thing to do, and the \nmajority leader did the only thing he could, which is pull down the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this time, and I yield the floor. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7573-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7573-S7574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to waive the 24-\nmonth waiting period for Medicare coverage of individuals disabled with \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to provide Medicare coverage of \ndrugs used for treatment of ALS, and to amend the Public Health Service \nAct to increase Federal funding for research on ALS; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) research, treatment, and assistance \n                              act of 1998\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nthat will improve the lives of 30,000 Americans, 850 of whom live in my \nState of New Jersey, who are stricken with Amyotrophic Lateral \nSclerosis (ALS). Many of us know ALS as the disease that struck down \nthe famed Yankees 1st baseman, Lou Gehrig. Today, few of us are aware \nof the tragic effects ALS still has on its victims.\n  First diagnosed over 130 years ago, ALS is a fatal neurological \ndisorder that usually strikes individuals over 50 years old. Each year, \nover 5,000 new cases are diagnosed, and tragically, life expectancy is \nonly 3 to 5 years. The financial costs to families of persons with ALS \ncan be up to $200,000 a year.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today addresses the need \nfor the federal government to provide increased medical services and \nresearch for ALS. First, the bill waives the 24-month waiting period \nthat ALS patients must endure in order to receive Medicare services. \nSince the life-expectancy for ALS patients is only a few short years, \nit is crucial that these individuals have access to Medicare services \nas soon as possible. It makes absolutely no sense to require \nindividuals to wait two years to receive Medicare services when their \nlife expectancy is only three to five years.\n  Next, the legislation will ensure Medicare provides coverage for all \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) drugs used to treat ALS. Medicare \ntypically does not provide coverage for drug therapies, but in the case \nof ALS, the need for an exception is clear. In addition, expanding \nMedicare coverage for ALS therapies will hopefully stimulate further \nresearch.\n  Finally, the bill recognizes the need to increase critical research \ninto ALS by authorizing $25 million to the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is simple, it's modest, and the logic \nis overwhelming. ALS is a disease that strikes at every community, with \nthe potential for every American. No one is immune, and everyone is \nvulnerable. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Wellstone \nin introducing legislation that represents a first real step toward \nimproving the quality of life for people with ALS while bringing us \nmuch closer to finding a cause and a cure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, in \nits entirety, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Research, Treatment, \n     and Assistance Act of 1998''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as \n     Lou Gehrig's Disease, is a progressive neuromuscular disease \n     characterized by a degeneration of the nerve cells of the \n     brain and spinal cord leading to the wasting of muscles, \n     paralysis, and eventual death.\n       (2) Approximately 30,000 individuals in the United States \n     are afflicted with ALS at any time, with approximately 5,000 \n     new cases appearing each year.\n       (3) ALS usually strikes individuals who are 50 years of age \n     or older.\n       (4) The life expectancy of an individual with ALS is 3 to 5 \n     years from the time of diagnosis.\n       (5) There is no known cure or cause for ALS.\n       (6) Aggressive treatment of the symptoms of ALS can extend \n     the lives of those with the disease. Recent advances in ALS \n     research have produced promising leads, many related to \n     shared disease processes that appear to operate in many \n     neurodegenerative diseases.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to assist individuals suffering from ALS by waiving the \n     24-month waiting period for medicare eligibility on the basis \n     of disability for ALS patients and to provide medicare \n     coverage for outpatient drugs and therapies for ALS; and\n       (2) to increase Federal funding of research into the cause, \n     treatment, and cure of ALS.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \nand the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to exempt State and local agencies \noperating prisons from the provisions relating to public services; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   state and local prison relief act\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress an undue burden that has arisen out of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n  The purpose of the ADA to give disabled Americans the opportunity to \nfully participate in society and contribute to it. This was a worthy \ngoal. But even legislation with the best of intentions often has \nunintended consequences. I submit that one of those is the application \nof the ADA to state and local prisons throughout America.\n  Last month, the Supreme Court ruled in Pennsylvania Department of \nCorrections versus Yeskey that the ADA applies to every state prison \nand local jail in this country. The circuit courts were split on the \nissue. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, my home circuit, forcefully \nconcluded that the ADA, as well as its predecessor and companion law, \nthe Rehabilitation Act, did not apply to state prisoners, focusing on \nfederalism concerns and the fact that the Congress did not make clear \nthat it intended to involve itself to this degree in an activity \ntraditionally reserved to the states.\n  However, the Supreme Court did not agree, holding that the language \nof the\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nAct is broad enough to clearly cover state prisons. It is not an issue \non the Federal level because the Federal Bureau of Prisons voluntarily \ncomplies with the Act. The Supreme Court did not say whether applying \nthe ADA to state prisons exceeded the Congress' powers under the \nCommerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, but we should not wait on \nthe outcome of this argument to act. Although it was rational for the \nSupreme Court to read the broad language of the ADA the way it did, it \nis far from clear that we in the Congress considered the application of \nthis sweeping new social legislation in the prison environment.\n  The Seventh Circuit recognized that the ``failure to exclude \nprisoners may well have been an oversight.'' The findings and purpose \nof the law seem to support this. The introductory language of the ADA \nstates, ``The Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with \ndisabilities are to assure quality of opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency'' to allow ``people \nwith disabilities * * * to compete on an equal basis and to pursue \nthose opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous.'' \nOf course, a prison is not a free society, as the findings and purpose \nof the Act envisioned. Indeed, it is quite the opposite. In short, as \nthe Ninth Circuit explained, ``The Act was not designed to deal \nspecifically with the prison environment; it was intended for general \nsocietal application.''\n  In any event, now that the Supreme Court has spoken, it is time for \nthe Congress to confront this issue. The Congress should act now to \nexempt state and local prisons from the ADA. If we do not, this law \nwill have broad adverse implications for the management of these \ninstitutions. Prisoners will file an endless number of lawsuits \ndemanding special privileges, which will involve Federal judges in the \nintricate details of running our state and local prisons.\n  Mr. President, we should continuously remind ourselves that the \nConstitution created a Federal government of limited, enumerated \npowers. Those powers not delegated to the Federal government were \nreserved to the states or the people. As James Madison wrote in \nFederalist No. 45, ``the powers delegated to the Federal government are \nfew and definite. * * * [The powers] which are to remain in the State \ngovernments are numerous and indefinite.'' The Federal government \nshould avoid intrusion into matters traditionally reserved for the \nstates. We must respect this delicate balance of power. Unfortunately, \nfederalism is more often spoken about than respected.\n  Although the entire ADA raises federalism concerns, the problem is \nespecially acute in the prison context. There are few powers more \ntraditionally reserved for the states than crime. The crime laws have \nalways been the province of the states, and the vast majority of \nprisoners have always been housed in state prisons. The First Congress \nenacted a law asking the states to house Federal prisoners in their \njails for fifty cents per month. The first Federal prison was not built \nuntil over 100 years later, and only three existed before 1925.\n  Even today, as the size and scope of Federal government has grown \nimmensely, only about 6% of prisoners are housed in \nFederal institutions. Managing that other 94% is a core state function. \nAs the Supreme Court has stated,\n\n       Maintenance of penal institutions is an essential part of \n     one of government's primary functions--the preservation of \n     societal order through enforcement of the criminal law. It is \n     difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a \n     stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up \n     with state laws, regulations, and procedures.\n\n  The primary function of prisons is to house criminals. Safety and \nsecurity are the overriding concerns of prison administration. The \nrules and regulations, the daily schedules, the living and working \narrangements--these all revolve around protecting prison employees, \ninmates, and the public. But the goal of the ADA is to take away any \nbarrier to anyone with any disability. It requires the authorities to \nprovide ``reasonable accommodation'' for essentially any disability \nunless doing so would impose an ``undue burden'' or ``a direct threat \nto the health or safety of others,'' as broadly defined by the courts. \nAccommodating inmates will interfere with the ability of prison \nadministrators to keep safety and security their overriding concern.\n  The practical effect of the ADA will be that prison officials will \nhave to grant special privileges to certain inmates and to excuse \nothers from complying with generally-applicable prison rules.\n  The ADA presents a perfect opportunity for prisoners to try to beat \nthe system, and use the courts to do it. There are over 1.6 million \ninmates in state prisons and local jails, and the numbers are rising \nevery year. Indeed, the total prison population has grown about 6.5% \nper year since 1990. Prisons have a substantially greater percentage of \npersons with disabilities that are covered by the ADA than the general \npopulation, including AIDS, mental retardation, psychological \ndisorders, learning disabilities, drug addiction, and alcoholism. \nFurther, administrators control every aspect of prisoners' lives, such \nas assigning educational and vocational training, recreation, and jobs \nin prison industries. Combine these facts, and the opportunities for \nlawsuits are endless.\n  For example, in most state prison systems, inmates are classified and \nassigned based in part on their disabilities. This helps administrators \nmeet the disabled inmates' needs in a cost-effective manner. However, \nunder the ADA, prisoners probably will be able to claim that they must \nbe assigned to a prison without regard to their disability. Were it not \nfor their disability, they may have been assigned to the prison closest \nto their home, and in that case, every prison would have to be able to \naccommodate every disability. That could mean every prison having, for \nexample, mental health treatment centers, services for hearing-impaired \ninmates, and dialysis treatment. The cost is potentially enormous.\n  Adequate funding is hard for prisons to achieve, especially in state \nand local communities where all government funds are scarce. The public \nis angry about how much money they have to spend to house prisoners. \nEven with prison populations rising, they do not want more of their \nmoney spent on prisoners. Often, there is simply not enough money to \nmake the changes in challenged programs to accommodate the disabled. If \nprison administrators do not have the money to change a program, they \nwill probably have to eliminate it. Thus, accommodation could mean the \nelimination of worthwhile educational, recreational, and rehabilitative \nprograms, making all inmates worse off.\n  Apart from money, accommodation may mean modifying the program in \nsuch a way as to take away its beneficial purpose. A good example is \nthe Supreme Court's Yeskey case itself. Yeskey was declared medically \nineligible to participate in a boot camp program because he had high \nblood pressure. So, he sued under the ADA. The boot camp required \nrigorous physical activity, such as work projects. If the program has \nto be changed to accommodate his physical abilities, it may not meet \nits basic goals, and the authorities may eliminate it. Thus, the result \ncould be that everyone loses the benefit of an otherwise effective \ncorrectional tool.\n  Another impact of the ADA may be to make an already volatile prison \nenvironment even more difficult to control. Many inmates are very \nsensitive to the privileges and benefits that others get in a world \nwhere privileges are relatively few. Some have irrational suspicions \nand phobias. An inmate who is not disabled may be angry if he believes \na disabled prisoner is getting special treatment, without rationally \naccepting that the law requires it, and could take out his anger on \nothers around him, including the disabled prisoner.\n\n  We must keep in mind that it is judges who will be making these \npolicy decisions. To determine what vague phrases like ``reasonable \naccommodation'' and ``undue burden'' mean, judges must get involved in \nintricate, fact-intensive issues, Essentially, the ADA requires judges \nto micromanage prisons. Judges are not qualified to second-guess prison \nadministrators and make these complex, difficult decisions. Prisons \ncannot be run by judicial decree.\n  The Supreme Court in recent years has recognized this. In apply \nConstitutional rights to prisoners, the Court\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\nhas tried to get away from micromanagement and has viewed prisoner \nclaims deferentially in favor of the expertise of prison officials. It \nhas stated that we will not ``substitute our judgment on difficult and \nsensitive matters of institutional administration for the \ndeterminations of those charged with the formidable task of running a \nprison. This approach ensures the ability of corrections officials to \nanticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the \nintractable problems of prison administration, and avoid unnecessary \nintrusion of the judiciary into problems particularly ill suited to \nresolution by decree.''\n  Take for example a case from the Fourth Circuit, my home circuit, \nfrom 1995. The Court explained that a morbidly obese inmate presented \ncorrections officials ``with a lengthy and ever-increasing list of \nmodifications which he insisted were necessary to accommodate his obese \ncondition. Thus, he demanded a larger cell, a cell closer to support \nfacilities, handrails to assist him in using the toilet, wider \nentrances to his cell and the showers, non-skid matting in the lobby \narea, and alternative outdoor recreational activities to accommodate \nhis inability to stand or walk for long periods.'' It is not workable \nfor judges to resolve all of these questions.\n  It is noteworthy that a primary purpose of the Prison Litigation \nReform Act was to stop judges from micromanaging prisons and to reduce \nthe burdens of prison litigation. As the Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt recently recognized, the PLRA is having some success. However, \nthis most recent Supreme Court decision will hamper that progress.\n  Moreover, the ADA delegated to Federal agencies the authority to \ncreate regulations to implement the law. State and local correction \nauthorities must fall in line behind these regulations. In yet another \nway, we will have the Justice Department exercising regulatory \noversight over our state and local communities.\n  Prisons are fundamentally different from other places in society. \nPrisoners are not entitled to all of the rights and privileges of law-\nabiding citizens, but they often get them. They have cable television. \nThey have access to better gyms and libraries than most Americans. The \npublic is tired of special privileges for prisoners. Applying the ADA \nto prisons is a giant step in the wrong direction. Prisoners will abuse \nthe ADA to get privileges they were previously denied, and the reason \nwill be the overreaching hand of the Federal government. We should not \nlet this happen.\n  Mr. President, the National Government has gone full circle. We have \ngone from asking the states to house Federal prisoners to dictating to \nthe states how they must house their own prisoners. There must be some \nend to the powers of the Federal government, and to the privileges it \ngrants the inmates of this Nation. I propose that we start by passing \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2266\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to grant \nrelief to participants in multiemployer plans from certain section 415 \nlimits on defined benefit pension plans; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           multiemployer defined benefit pension legislation\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Murkowski, to correct an inequity in the \nTax Code that deprives working people of hard earned pension benefits. \nThe problem is section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, which sets \ncompensation based limits and a dollar limit on pension plans. In \neffect, these section 415 limits discourage retirement savings.\n\n  Workers are being denied the full benefits that they have earned \nthrough many years of labor and on which they and their spouses have \ncounted in planning their retirement. We can all appreciate the \nfrustration and anger of workers who are told, upon applying for their \npension, that the federal government won't let their pension plan pay \nthem the full amount of the benefits that they earned under the rules \nof their plan. For some workers, this benefit cutback means that they \nwill not be able to retire when they wanted or needed to. For other \nworkers, it means retirement with less income to live on, and in some \ncases, retirement without health care coverage and other necessities of \nlife.\n  The bill that Senator Murkowski and I are introducing today will give \nthese workers relief from the most confiscatory provisions of section \n415 and enable them to receive the full measure of their retirement \nsavings, consistent with the policy goals of the National Summit on \nRetirement Savings recently sponsored by the President and the \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, Congress has recognized and corrected the adverse \neffects of section 415 on government employee pension plans. In fact, \nas part of the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996 and the Tax \nRelief Act of 1997, we exempted government employee pension plans from \nthe compensation-based limit, from certain early retirement limits, and \nfrom other provisions of section 415. Relief measures for workers \ncovered by multiemployer plans have been passed three times by the \nSenate, most recently in the Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act \nof 1997. Unfortunately, those changes were not maintained in the \nSenate/House Conference Report.\n  Section 415 was enacted more than two decades ago when the pension \nworld was quite different than today. The section 415 limits were \ndesigned to contain the tax-sheltered pensions that could be received \nby highly paid executives and professionals. The passage of time and \nCongressional action has stood this original design on its head. Today, \nthe limits are forcing cutbacks in the pensions of rank-and-file \nworkers. Executives and professionals are now able to receive pensions \nfar in excess of the section 415 limits by establishing non-qualified \nsupplemental retirement programs.\n  Generally, section 415 limits the benefits payable to a worker by \ndefined benefit pension plans to the lesser of (1) the worker's average \nannual compensation for the three consecutive years when his \ncompensation was the highest (the compensation-based limit); and (2) a \ndollar limit that is sharply reduced if a worker retires before the \nSocial Security normal retirement age of 65 or 66.\n  The compensation-based limit assumes that the pension earned under a \nplan is linked to each worker's salary, as is typical in corporate \npension plans (e.g., a percentage of the worker's final year's salary \nfor each year of employment). That assumption is wrong as applied to \nmultiemployer pension plans. Multiemployer plans, which cover more than \nten million individuals, have long based their benefits on the \ncollectively bargained contribution rates and years of covered \nemployment with one or more of the multiple employers which contribute \nto the plan. In other words, benefits earned under a multiemployer plan \ngenerally have no relationship to the wages received by a worker from \nthe contributing employers. The same benefit level is paid to all \nworkers with the same contribution and covered employment records \nregardless of their individual wage histories.\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\n  A second assumption underlying the compensation based limit is that \nworkers' salaries increase steadily over the course of their careers so \nthat the three highest salary years will be the last three consecutive \nyears. While this salary history may be the norm in the corporate \nworld, it is unusual in the multiemployer plan world. In multiemployer \nplan industries like building and construction, a worker's wage \nearnings typically fluctuate from year-to-year according to several \nvariables including the availability of covered work and whether the \nworker is unable to work due to illness or disability. An individual \nworker's wage history may include many dramatic ups-and-downs. Because \nof these fluctuations, the three highest years of compensation for many \nmultiemployer plan participants are not consecutive. Consequently, the \nsection 415 compensation-based limit for these workers is artificially \nlow; lower than it should be if they were covered by corporate plans.\n  The dollar limit under section 415 is forcing severe cutbacks in the \nearned pensions of workers who retire under multiemployer pension plans \nbefore they reach age 65. For example, construction work is physically \nhard, and is often performed under harsh climatic conditions. Workers \nare worn down sooner than those in most other industries. Often, early \nretirement is a must. Multiemployer pension plans accommodate these \nneeds of their covered worker by providing for early retirement, \ndisability, and service pensions that provide a subsidized, partial or \nfull pension benefit.\n  As it stands now, section 415 is forcing cutbacks in these pensions \nbecause the dollar limit is severely reduced for each year you are \nunder the normal Social Security retirement age. For a worker who \nretires at age 50, the dollar limit restricts their pension at about \n$40,000 per year.\n  This reduced limit applies regardless of the circumstances under \nwhich the worker retires and regardless of his plan's rules regarding \nretirement age. A multiemployer plan participant who becomes disabled \nand is forced into early retirement is nonetheless subject to the \nreduced limit. In addition, a construction worker who, after 30 years \nof demanding labor, has well-earned a 30-and-out service pension at age \n50, is nonetheless subject to the reduced limit.\n  Our bill will ease this early retirement benefit cutback by extending \nto workers covered by multiemployer plans some of the more favorable \nearly retirement rules that now apply to government employee pension \nplans and other retirement plans. These rules still provide for a \nreduced dollar limit for retirements earlier than age 62, but the \nreduction is less severe than under the current rules that apply to \nmultiemployer plans.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly concerned that early retirees who \nsuffer pension benefit cutbacks will not be able to afford the health \ncare coverage that they need. Workers who retire before they become \neligible for Medicare are typically required to pay all or a \nsubstantial part of the cost of their health insurance.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nthe research and experimentation tax credit, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          research and experimentation tax credit legislation\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last Tuesday, June 30, 1998, the \nresearch and experimentation tax credit expired, once again. Once \nagain, U.S. industry was left in a state of uncertainty as to how to \nvalue its investments in research and development, which are really \ninvestments in the economic future of our country. Today, I am \nintroducing a bill to extend permanently and improve the research and \nexperimentation tax credit. It is the fruit of analysis from the staff \nof the Joint Economic Committee, of which I am the ranking member. It \nis also the product of consultations with a spectrum of groups who \nshare my concern for our Nation's future scientific and technological \nstrength. The bill would, briefly, make the existing R tax credit \npermanent, improve the economic efficiency and practicality of the \nalternative incremental credit, convert the existing basic research \ncredit into a flat credit, and accompany the basic research credit \n(which is aimed mostly at research in universities) with a new credit \nfor nonprofit research consortia. The bill also makes a number of \ntechnical and clarifying adjustments to the basic research credit, so \nthat it will be easier to use.\n  I am not the first Member of this body to propose to make the R tax \ncredit permanent, or to propose improvements in its functioning. I plan \nto work with other similarly-minded Senators in the days to come to see \nif we can construct an even broader coalition to make these permanent \nimprovements in the R tax credit a reality this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2268\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act with \nrespect to raising the level of the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve \nratio and with respect to refunds of excess assessments, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n    Legislation to Provide a Refund of Excess Reserves in the Bank \n                             Insurance Fund\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, in 1991, the Congress reformed the FDIC \nand mandated that the fund keep a reserve to deposit ratio of 1.25%. \nFortunately, no government funds were used to keep the FDIC solvent \nwhen this was mandated in 1991. It was thought by many that it would \ntake years for the fund to reach that level, but, enough funds flowed \ninto the Bank Insurance Fund that this reserve level was met relatively \nquickly.\n  What has been happening for the past few years, however, is that the \nFund is generating billions in interest and is now well over the \ndesignated reserve ratio of 1.25%. The Fund can only be used to provide \nfor losses to the insurance fund, however, because the BIF is \nconsidered on budget these excess funds are effectively being used to \nexaggerate the government surplus. The law envisioned a stop in the \nneed for additional premiums once that fund hit its legal limit, but it \nnever made provisions for excess reserves building and building year \nafter year.\n  Rather than this money piling up in the Bank Insurance Fund, I think \nit would be put to greater use if these funds were recycled back into \nthe banking system, and back into our economy.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that would require that the Fund \nprovide a refund of this excess revenue when it reaches a reserve level \nof 1.5%. This means that the Fund could maintain a cushion of 20% above \nthe level that is required by law, but once that outer level is \nreached, the excess would have to be refunded.\n  Mr. President, the Bank Insurance Fund is composed entirely of non-\ngovernment funds. The money in this Fund is derived from assessments on \nthe banking industry. The Congress chose a level at which the Fund \ncould operate safely, and that level is being met, in fact, it is being \nexceeded. At the end of 1997, the Fund held nearly\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\n$28 billion. I think it is wrong, however, to use the money paid by the \nbanking industry to earn revenue for the government and not recycle \nthat money back into the economy. The Fund earned nearly $1.5 billion \nin interest last year.\n  If this amount of money were put back into the economy, $1.5 billion \nin capital could sustain another $15 billion in loans.\n  I do not know when the Fund will reach 1.5% reserve to deposit ratio. \nThe FDIC is projecting that the reserve ratio could be anywhere between \n1.36% and 1.43% by the end of this year. Clearly, my legislation means \nthat sometime within the next two years, there will be a level reached \nat which this money will be put back into the economy.\n  When I first came to Washington, I noticed that many believed money \nwas simply appropriated. Actually, money has to be created. Somebody, \nsomewhere had to do something, drive a truck, wait on a table, build a \nhouse--somebody had to create wealth. This is the point of this \nlegislation--we need to send money back into the private sector so that \nit can be used to create new wealth, new jobs and new opportunities. \nLetting this money accumulate in Washington will not create new \nopportunities for the American people. That is why I am introducing \nthis legislation, which I think is balancing the need for both a safe \nand sound deposit insurance fund and the need to keep dollars in \nbanking system for new lending and new growth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7574-8", "month": "07", "year":

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 107--AFFIRMING U.S. COMMITMENTS TO TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nLugar, Mr. Mack, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Thomas, Mr. McCain, Mr. Gramm, Mr. \nHutchinson, Mr. Bond, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \nAbraham, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Burns, Mr. Warner, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \nFaircloth, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Craig, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, and \nMr. Brownback) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 107\n\n       Whereas at no time since the establishment of the People's \n     Republic of China on October 1, 1949, has Taiwan been under \n     the control of the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas the United States began its long, peaceful, \n     friendly relationship with Taiwan in 1949;\n       Whereas since the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act in \n     1979, the policy of the United States has been based on the \n     expectation that the future relationship between the People's \n     Republic of China and Taiwan would be determined by peaceful \n     means;\n       Whereas in March 1996, the People's Republic of China held \n     provocative military maneuvers, including missile launch \n     exercises in the Taiwan Strait, in an attempt to intimidate \n     the people of Taiwan during their historic, free and \n     democratic presidential election;\n       Whereas officials of the People's Republic of China refuse \n     to renounce the use of force against democratic Taiwan;\n       Whereas Taiwan has achieved significant political and \n     economic strength as one of the world's premier democracies \n     and as the 19th largest economy in the world;\n       Whereas Taiwan is the seventh largest trading partner of \n     the United States and imports more than twice as much \n     annually from the United States as does the People's Republic \n     of China;\n       Whereas no treaties exist between the People's Republic of \n     China and Taiwan that determine the future status of Taiwan: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) affirms its long standing commitment to Taiwan and the \n     people of Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act \n     (Public Law 96-8);\n       (2) affirms its expectation, consistent with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act, that the future of Taiwan will be determined \n     by peaceful means, with the consent of the people of Taiwan, \n     and considers any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by \n     other than peaceful means a threat to the peace and security \n     of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United \n     States;\n       (3) affirms its commitment, consistent with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act, to make available to Taiwan such defense \n     articles and defense services in such quantities as may be \n     necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-\n     defense capability;\n       (4) affirms its commitment, consistent with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act, that only the President and Congress shall \n     determine the nature and quantity of defense articles and \n     services for Taiwan based solely upon their judgment of the \n     needs of Taiwan; and\n       (5) urges the President of the United States to seek a \n     public renunciation by the People's Republic of China of any \n     use of force, or threat to use force, against democratic \n     Taiwan.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution does not break new ground \nwith regard to Taiwan. It simply reaffirms our support of the \nprinciples of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. It calls on the President \nto seek a Chinese renunciation of the use of force to affect Taiwan's \nfuture.\n  President Clinton gave two impressive performances at Beijing \nUniversity and at the joint press conference, but I am very much \nconcerned about the perception of what he had to say, of what the \neffect is of what he had to say with regard to Taiwan. Instead of \npressing Beijing to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, President \nClinton accepted Beijing's position on Taiwan. By ending the ambiguity \nof the U.S. position, we have harmed democratic Taiwan's position.\n  Congress has pressed previous administrations to change its policies \nwith regard to Taiwan. In fact, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 was a \nclear example of congressional restraint on executive actions on \nTaiwan. In 1995, we urged the President to grant a visa to Taiwan's \nPresident to enter the U.S. for a college reunion. The administration \nchanged its position after Congress took that action.\n  This resolution is necessary to correct the effects of the statements \nthat were made in Shanghai. Before Shanghai, U.S. policy was to \nacknowledge\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\nBeijing's position. Now we have prepared to make Beijing's position our \npolicy.\n  China refuses to take the use of force off the table. We should not \nunilaterally deny Taiwan membership to international organizations, and \nwe should not take action in concert with the dictatorship in Beijing \nwithout even consulting the 21 million people under democratic rule in \nTaiwan.\n  Instead of undermining Taiwan, we should support our fundamental \nnational interest in the peaceful resolution of differences. We do not \nwant to see a war in the Taiwan Straits. Deterrence is the way to avoid \nsuch a possibility.\n  We should support the provision of missile defenses to Taiwan so that \nthey can protect their democracy from a dictatorship's missiles. We \nshould support Taiwan's membership in international organizations where \nthey are willing and able to help an organization's goals--such as free \ntrade and economic stability.\n  There is a second resolution, S. Con. Res. 30, on the issue of \nTaiwan's membership in the IMF and the World Bank. It has already been \npassed out of the Foreign Affairs Committee by unanimous vote. I hope \nwe can pass that resolution this week.\n  I thank Senator Torricelli and the rest of our cosponsors. I urge \nother colleagues to join us because this is certainly a bipartisan \nissue. I look forward to rapid Senate action on the resolution to \nreaffirm our relationship with Taiwan and the primacy of the Taiwan \nRelations Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that editorials from the Wall \nStreet Journal and the Washington Post be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 2, 1998]\n\n                       Siding With the Dictators\n\n       The outlines of a deal are beginning to emerge. China gives \n     President Clinton air time for his speech. Mr. Clinton says \n     what China wants to hear on Taiwan. Then, in classic Clinton \n     fashion, the White House tries to have things both ways, \n     denying that U.S. policy has changed when in fact it has, and \n     not for the better.\n       Past administrations recognized the Beijing government as \n     the legitimate government of China and ``acknowledged'' \n     China's position with regard to Taiwan. But ``acknowledge'' \n     did not mean ``accept.'' The ultimate fate of Taiwan was \n     something for Taiwan and China to work out, peacefully. \n     Beyond that, the United States deliberately left its policy \n     shrouded in ambiguity.\n       But recently officials of the Clinton administration have \n     explicitly adopted a ``three no's'' formula much more \n     pleasing to the Communist Chinese: no support for one Taiwan-\n     one China; no support for Taiwan independence; no support for \n     Taiwan membership in international organizations such as the \n     United Nations. Now Mr. Clinton has given that policy a \n     presidential stamp of approval--and on Chinese soil, to boot.\n       Why does it matter? Because Taiwan's 21 million people have \n     forged a prosperous democracy over the past decades. There is \n     no justification for the United States to oppose their right \n     eventually to determine their own future. It would be fine \n     for U.S. officials to reiterate that such a determination \n     must take place peacefully and to encourage Taiwan-China \n     dialogue. It would be fine for U.S. officials to warn Taiwan \n     not to expect U.S. support for a unilateral declaration of \n     independence. What's not fine is for the United States at \n     this time to rule out independence or any other option the \n     Taiwanese people eventually might choose.\n       When China threatened Taiwan militarily in 1996, Mr. \n     Clinton responded with admirable resolve. But now he is \n     trading away the human rights of Taiwan's 21 million people \n     and sending an unfortunate signal to other democracies that \n     might hope to rely on U.S. moral support.\n       As a practical matter, he's also significantly weakening \n     Taiwan's bargaining power if and when Taiwan and China begin \n     negotiations. China's main card always has been the threat of \n     force; Taiwan's has been its campaign to establish \n     sovereignty through membership in world organizations and \n     other means. By explicitly and needlessly slamming the door \n     on that campaign, Mr. Clinton has sided with the dictators \n     against the democrats. To pretend this is no change only \n     heightens the offense.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 2, 1998]\n\n                             Bill's Kowtow\n\n       Just when we were giving President Clinton credit for \n     sounding the right notes in China, he managed to turn his \n     visit into a fiasco after all. His kowtowing to China's \n     ``three no's'' over Taiwan is likely to set off a cycle of \n     reactions and counterreactions that ultimately will damage \n     rather than improve Sino-American relations.\n       The bedrock of U.S. policy toward Taiwan has always been \n     the Shanghai Communique, issued in 1972 as the two nations \n     began their rapprochement, and affirmed in later agreements \n     and the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. In this document the \n     U.S. declared that it ``acknowledges that all Chinese on \n     either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one \n     China and that Taiwan is part of China. The United States \n     government does not challenge that position. It reaffirms its \n     interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by \n     the Chinese themselves.'' This was careful ambiguity, for \n     example in not dealing with the possibility that what the \n     U.S. acknowledged might someday no longer be true.\n       A shred of this policy remained, of course, in President \n     Clinton's remark that U.S. policy ``has been'' that \n     reunification ``has to be done peacefully.'' This is \n     something short of a demand that China renounce the use of \n     force. And Mr. Clinton's mouthing of the ``three no's'' \n     formula tool place only in a carefully choreographed exchange \n     with a specially selected Chinese scholar, with National \n     Security Adviser Sandy Berger rushing around with notes. That \n     is to say, it was something the Administration was rather \n     ashamed of, despite the claim that is was no change in \n     previous policy.\n       On that point, consider the President's language: ``We \n     don't support independence for Taiwan; or two Chinas; or one \n     Taiwan, one China. And we don't believe that Taiwan should be \n     a member in any organization for which statehood is a \n     requirement.'' Anyone who reads English can see that this is \n     miles beyond the careful language Richard Nixon and Henry \n     Kissinger crafted in 1972.\n       So President Clinton got access to Chinese TV for some \n     statements about human rights and Tibet, giving him the aura \n     he wanted back home, and we continue to believe, some \n     beneficial impact within China. Mr. Clinton also got a dollop \n     of personal frosting with Jiang Zemin's public assurance that \n     his government had investigated ``the so-called political \n     contributions in the United States'' and discovered ``there \n     never was such a thing.'' There were also some trade \n     contracts.\n       Yet even with the President in Shanghai, the on-again, off-\n     again U.S. visit by a local opera company was definitely \n     called off. This is not a trifle, since the pique of some \n     petty official overrode contracts supported by both the \n     Chinese parties and the U.S. parties. This is precisely the \n     danger of business with China, as a visiting U.S. President \n     should take time to notice.\n       President Jiang, by contrast, got his number one priority, \n     Mr. Clinton carving the next slice of salami toward the \n     Chinese goal of getting the U.S. to coerce Taiwan to join \n     China, or alternatively to stand aside while China invades. \n     Only two years ago, after all, the People's Liberation Army \n     was ``testing'' its missiles over the Taiwan Strait, closing \n     Taiwan's major ports and forcing the U.S. to dispatch two \n     aircraft carrier battle groups to the area.\n       The issue of Taiwanese membership in international \n     organizations is especially ridiculous. We can dismiss the \n     United Nations as congenitally symbolic, and the sovereignty \n     requirement would not preclude Taiwan's application to the \n     World Trade Organization, which recognizes ``customs \n     territories.'' But Taiwan is already excluded from presumably \n     serious organizations such as the International Monetary Fund \n     and the World Bank, though it is among the world's top 20 \n     economies and holds enormous monetary reserves. The world's \n     remaining superpower should be acting to curb this ongoing \n     farce, not entrench it.\n       Mr. Clinton climbed to the pinnacle of politics by pleasing \n     the audience of the moment, but the ultimate impact of his \n     demarche will depend on others offstage, on Taiwan and \n     Capitol Hill. The Taiwanese are understandably upset, with \n     their foreign ministry declaring that the U.S. and China \n     ``are in no position to conduct bilateral negotiations on \n     anything related to our future.'' Even more to the point, \n     Parris Chang, a leader of the pro-independence Democratic \n     Progressive Party said, ``It's wrong, morally and \n     politically, for Clinton to collude with the Communist \n     dictatorship to restrict the future of a democratic country, \n     Taiwan.''\n       The Democratic Progressives' position is that Taiwan is \n     plainly a separate country, and that recognizing reality is \n     always progress. They are already likely to form the next \n     government in Taipei, and Mr. Clinton's acceding to the three \n     no's almost surely improved their standing among Taiwan's \n     voters. Back in Washington, Congress, historically supportive \n     of Taiwan and already restive over its foreign-policy \n     prerogatives, will resist Mr. Clinton's unilateral change in \n     long-standing American policy.\n       Taiwan is now plainly a democratic nation, and has every \n     right to determine its own future. In the end, the U.S. will \n     not resist this principle, whatever Mr. Clinton said in \n     Shanghai this week. The danger in Mr. Clinton's words is that \n     the Chinese leaders who heard them will not only be \n     disappointed but turn truculent.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. These articles, certainly newspapers that don't always take \nthe same editorial positions, certainly agree in this case and express \ntheir concern about siding with Beijing on this very important issue \nrelating to the freedom and the democracy of Taiwan.\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\n  I thank the handlers of this bill and the managers for yielding of \nthis time. We wanted to get this submission done this afternoon.\n  I am glad to yield to Senator Torricelli.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I want to thank the majority leader for yielding the \ntime. I am very pleased to join with the majority leader and my \ncolleagues in offering this resolution regarding the commitment of the \nUnited States to Taiwan.\n  Like the majority leader, I, too, want to congratulate President \nClinton for an extraordinarily successful visit to the People's \nRepublic of China. He covered the issues of human rights, security, our \neconomic relationships--I believe there was real progress made.\n  Mr. President, it is sometimes said that international conflicts \nbegin more often from miscalculation than design. I believe it is of \nservice to the Senate and to our country to make clear upon President \nClinton's return both what was said and accomplished and, indeed, what \nremains in place with regard to the U.S. relations with the people and \nthe government on Taiwan.\n  American policy toward Taiwan is governed by the Taiwan Relations \nAct. There are 4 principle components of this Act, accepted by this \nCongress, the bedrock policy of this country, and they remain \nunchanged.\n  First, the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means. The \nTaiwan Relations Act does not say that the people of Taiwan and the \nmainland will be reunited by peaceful means. It says the future will be \ndetermined by peaceful means. That has not been altered.\n  Second, the United States affirms that one of its principle \nobjectives is the preservation and enhancement of the human rights of \nthe people of Taiwan.\n  Third, that the United States does not maintain as its policy the \nisolation of Taiwan, its government, or its people but there are many \nmembers of this institution, and, indeed, in this government, that \nbelieve it would enhance the security of the region and both peoples if \nTaiwan were admitted to international organizations.\n  Fourth, the United States remains committed to sell those defensive \nmeans necessary for the security of the people of Taiwan.\n  Mr. President, at a time of economic turbulence in Asia, it is \nnotable that there is one government and one people that are a bedrock \nof economic stability. Taiwan is a model of development of democratic \ncapitalism. It is a leader in technology and international trade, with \na standard of living obtained for its people that is the envy of Asia. \nIt is also notable that at a time when it is necessary for the \nPresident of the United States to discuss human rights with other \ncountries, to discuss their means of government, that Taiwan remains a \nstable democracy, respecting the freedom of religion and of speech and \nof expression, where people choose their own leadership.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. President, it is important that there not \nbe any miscalculation. The policy of this country toward Taiwan is \ngoverned by the Taiwan Relations Act. We remain committed to that \ndemocracy and to its security. This is not of some small moment. This \nis, after all, the 19th largest economy in the world. Taiwan is the \nseventh largest trading partner of the United States--a vibrant \ndemocracy in the family of democratic nations.\n  There are many of us who believe that in future years the security of \nthe region would be enhanced by Taiwan's enhanced relationship with the \nUnited Nations, by its entry into the World Trade Organization and the \nAsian Development Bank, where its economic power could be heard and, \nindeed, enhance its economic stability.\n  Mr. President, for all those who have watched this recent trip to \nAsia, it bears reminding that this Congress wrote the Taiwan Relations \nAct. The Taiwan Relations Act governs the relationship between the \nUnited States and all issues affecting the future of Taiwan and its \npeople. Only this Congress can change the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  Mr. President, we are all proud of President Clinton's trip to China. \nI believe that he came home with real substantive accomplishments. I \nbelieve it is also useful, as the majority leader has pointed out, to \nmake clear both what has changed and what has not. The American \ncommitment to Taiwan has not changed. It will not change. It is a \nbedrock of the American commitment to maintain special relationships \nwith nations that choose their own leaders and live in the democratic \nfamily of countries.\n  I thank the majority leader for his leadership on this issue. I am \nproud to join with him on this concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of Taiwan \nand the events concerning Taiwan which transpired during our \nPresident's trip to China. While President Clinton maintains that he \ndid not make any concessions on Taiwan, or in any way alter our \nlongstanding policy towards Taiwan, I am concerned that, indeed, he may \nhave; and I think the facts back me up and show that President Clinton \nmay have, in no small way, initiated changes in our policy towards \nTaiwan.\n  I am specifically concerned with two incidents, Mr. President. First, \nduring a question-and-answer period at Beijing University, President \nClinton responded to a question on Taiwan. He remarked that ``when the \nUnited States and China reached agreement that we would have a one \nChina policy, we also reached agreement that reunification would occur \nby peaceful means.''\n  Well, Mr. President, to my knowledge, the United States and China \nhave never reached an agreement that the Taiwan question would be \nresolved through reunification. While the United States has not ruled \nout reunification as a possibility, we have also not ruled out the \npossibility that the question of Taiwan could be resolved in some other \nmanner, as long as it was done peacefully. So there is a difference.\n  Our Federal law on this question is quite clear. Section 2(b)(3) of \nthe Taiwan Relations Act states that ``The future of Taiwan will be \ndetermined by peaceful means.'' The United States has also signed three \njoint communiques with the People's Republic of China which further \nelaborate our position on Taiwan. While they all speak to the peaceful \nresolution of the Taiwan question, none--none--go so far as to speak to \nthe question of reunification.\n  So why am I concerned with the President's choice of words while he \nwas in China? Because I think it is misleading, dangerously misleading. \nIt indicates to the Chinese and the Taiwanese that our policy on Taiwan \nhas changed, when the President says it has not.\n  The second incident which raises concern, Mr. President, is when \nPresident Clinton seemingly adopted the ``Three-No's'' policy long \nadvocated by China. The ``Three-No's'' policy states the United States \ndoes not support one Taiwan, one China; the United States does not \nsupport Taiwan independence; and the United States does not support \nTaiwan's membership in nation-state based international organizations.\n  As the July 2, 1998, editorial in the Washington Post correctly \npoints out, the United States has long ``acknowledged'' China's \nposition on Taiwan, but has never ever accepted China's position on \nTaiwan. There is a significant difference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this editorial be printed in \nthe Congressional Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Considered collectively, which I know the Chinese \nGovernment is doing, this could appear to be a major concession by the \nUnited States on the issue of Taiwan. My guess is that the Chinese now \nbelieve that if the Taiwanese people declare independence, the United \nStates will not support them. What does that say for democracy and the \nideals that we have sworn to uphold and support?\n  In 1996, when the Chinese military conducted military exercises off \nthe coast of Taiwan in order to influence Taiwan's national \nPresidential elections, President Clinton rightly responded; swiftly \nand with resolve. He showed that the United States will not tolerate \nthe threat of the use of force against Taiwan, just as we will not \ntolerate the use of force against Taiwan.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that the President's statements made in\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\nChina have now sent the wrong message, and one that could be \ndestabilizing both to Taiwan and to the entire Asian theater.\n  I think the United States should pursue our own ``three-no's'' policy \non the question of Taiwan, and they are: We will not accept any \nnonpeaceful resolution of the Taiwan question; we will not force Taiwan \nto the table with China, nor will we be an intermediary in resolving \nthis dispute; and we will not turn our backs on democracy and the right \nof the Taiwanese people, or any people, to live according to free \ndemocratic principles.\n  So finally, Mr. President, well in advance of President Clinton's \ntrip to China, I and a number of colleagues in the Senate sent a letter \nto the President urging him to press the Chinese Government on \nrenouncing the threat of the use of force against Taiwan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nCongressional Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I, again, call on the President to insist that the \nChinese Government renounce the threat of the use of force against \nTaiwan and take great effort to clarify that our position in support of \nTaiwan and our commitment to Taiwan has not changed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the floor manager, \nSenator Bond, for the courtesy extended me at this time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       Siding With the Dictators\n\n       The outlines of a deal are beginning to emerge. China gives \n     President Clinton air time for his speech. Mr. Clinton says \n     what China wants to hear on Taiwan. Then, in classic Clinton \n     fashion, the White House tries to have things both ways, \n     denying that U.S. policy has changed when in fact it has, and \n     not for the better.\n       Past administrations recognized, the Beijing government as \n     the legitimate government of China and ``acknowledged'' \n     China's position with regard to Taiwan. By ``acknowledge'' \n     did not mean ``accept.'' The ultimate fate of Taiwan was \n     something for Taiwan and China to work out, peacefully. \n     Beyond that, the United States deliberately left its policy \n     shrouded in ambiguity.\n       But recently officials of the Clinton administration have \n     explicitly adopted a ``three no's'' formula much more \n     pleasing to the Communist Chinese: no support for one Taiwan-\n     one China; no support for Taiwan independence; no support for \n     Taiwan membership in international organizations such as the \n     United Nations. Now Mr. Clinton has given that policy a \n     presidential stamp of approval--and on Chinese soil, to boot.\n       Why does it matter? Because Taiwan's 21 million people have \n     forged a prosperous democracy over the past decades. There is \n     no justification for the United States to oppose their right \n     eventually to determine their own future. It would be fine \n     for U.S. officials to reiterate that such a determination \n     must take place peacefully and to encourage Taiwan-China \n     dialogue. It would be fine for U.S. officials to warn Taiwan \n     not to expect U.S. support for a unilateral declaration of \n     independence. What's not fine is for the United States at \n     this time to rule out independence or any other option the \n     Taiwanese people eventually might choose.\n       When China threatened Taiwan militarily in 1996, Mr. \n     Clinton responded with admirable resolve. But now he is \n     trading away the human rights of Taiwan's 21 million people \n     and sending an unfortunate signal to other democracies that \n     might hope to rely on U.S. moral support.\n       As a practical matter, he's also significantly weakening \n     Taiwan's bargaining power if and when Taiwan and China begin \n     negotiations. China's main card always has been the threat of \n     force; Taiwan's has been its campaign to establish \n     sovereignty through membership in world organizations and \n     other means. By explicitly and needlessly slamming the door \n     on that campaign, Mr. Clinton has sided with the dictators \n     against the democrats. To pretend this is no change only \n     heightens the offense.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1998.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton, \n     The President, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you prepare for your summit with the \n     leaders of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, we \n     thought it appropriate to share with you our thoughts \n     regarding U.S. relations with the people and the government \n     of Taiwan. We believe Taiwan has made extraordinary progress \n     in recent years as the Republic of China has moved to \n     establish a vibrant democracy with free elections, free \n     press, and improved trading practices.\n       We believe the American people are united in their support \n     for freedom and democracy in Taiwan. Time and again, Congress \n     has made clear our commitment to Taiwan, beginning with the \n     1979 Taiwan Relations Act, and through many resolutions and \n     bills since then.\n       Although we do not know what will be on the summit agenda, \n     we do know that the PRC is often eager to try and persuade \n     the United States to compromise our support for Taiwan and \n     its democracy. Mr. President, we urge you to oppose any \n     efforts at the summit by the PRC leadership to diminish \n     American support for Taiwan. We believe it is important for \n     the United States to make clear at the summit that while the \n     U.S. supports a peaceful dialogue between Taipei and Beijing, \n     the U.S. has committed not to pressure Taiwan on this issue \n     and to not play any mediation role. You should reiterate \n     statements made recently by members of your administration \n     calling on the PRC to renounce the use of force or the threat \n     of force against Taiwan.\n       Further, we urge you to reject any plans for a ``Fourth \n     Communique'' on issues related to Taiwan; to not weaken our \n     defensive arms sales commitment to Taiwan (either by agreeing \n     to set an end date or by agreeing to hold prior consultations \n     with the PRC); to not make any commitment to limit future \n     visits by the elected representatives of the Republic of \n     China; to not agree to revise the Taiwan Relations Act; and \n     to not alter the U.S. position regarding sovereignty over \n     Taiwan.\n       We in Congress are prepared to reiterate the commitment of \n     the American people to freedom and democracy for the people \n     and government of Taiwan. We look forward to your reassurance \n     on these issues in advance of the summit.\n           Sincerely,\n     Frank H. Murkowski.\n     Robert G.

Such option shall be made available to the \n     participant at the time of enrollment under the plan or \n     coverage and at such other times as the plan or issuer offers \n     the participant a choice of coverage options.\n       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect \n     to a participant in a group health plan if the plan offers \n     the participant--\n       (A) a choice of health insurance coverage through more than \n     one health insurance issuer; or\n       (B) two or more coverage options that differ significantly \n     with respect to the use of participating health care \n     providers or the networks of such providers that are used.\n       (b) Point-of-Service Coverage Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``point-of-service coverage'' means, with respect to \n     benefits covered under a group health plan or health \n     insurance issuer, coverage of such benefits when provided by \n     a nonparticipating health care provider.

If \n     such an individual's care would most appropriately be \n     coordinated by such a specialist, such plan or issuer shall \n     refer the individual to such specialist.\n       (B) Treatment as primary care provider.--Such specialist \n     shall be permitted to treat the individual without a referral \n     from the individual's primary care provider and may authorize \n     such referrals, procedures, tests, and other medical services \n     as the individual's primary care provider would otherwise be \n     permitted to provide or authorize, subject to the terms of \n     the treatment plan (referred to in paragraph (1)(C)(i)).\n       (C) Ongoing special condition defined.--In this paragraph, \n     the term ``special condition'' means a condition or disease \n     that--\n       (i) is life-threatening, degenerative, or disabling, and\n       (ii) requires specialized medical care over a prolonged \n     period of time.\n       (D) Terms of referral.--The provisions of subparagraphs (C) \n     through (E) of paragraph (1) apply with respect to referrals \n     under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in the same manner \n     as they apply to referrals under paragraph (1)(A).\n       (3) Standing referrals.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, and a health \n     insurance issuer in connection with the provision of health \n     insurance coverage, shall have a procedure by which an \n     individual who is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and \n     who has a condition that requires ongoing care from a \n     specialist may receive a standing referral to such specialist \n     for treatment of such condition. If the plan or issuer, or if \n     the primary care provider in consultation with the medical \n     director of the plan or issuer and the specialist (if any), \n     determines that such a standing referral is appropriate, the \n     plan or issuer shall make such a referral to such a \n     specialist.\n       (B) Terms of referral.--The provisions of subparagraphs (C) \n     through (E) of paragraph (1) apply with respect to referrals \n     under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in the same\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\n     manner as they apply to referrals under paragraph (1)(A).\n\n     SEC. __105.

provision of health insurance coverage, and a health care \n     provider is terminated (as defined in paragraph (3)), or \n     benefits or coverage provided by a health care provider are \n     terminated because of a change in the terms of provider \n     participation in a group health plan, and an individual who \n     is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee in the plan or \n     coverage is undergoing a course of treatment from the \n     provider at the time of such termination, the plan or issuer \n     shall--\n       (A) notify the individual on a timely basis of such \n     termination, and\n       (B) subject to subsection (c), permit the individual to \n     continue or be covered with respect to the course of \n     treatment with the provider during a transitional

coverage between a group health plan and a health \n     insurance issuer is terminated and, as a result of such \n     termination, coverage of services of a health care provider \n     is terminated with respect to an individual, the provisions \n     of paragraph (1) (and the succeeding provisions of this \n     section) shall apply under the plan in the same manner as if \n     there had been a contract between the plan and the provider \n     that had been terminated, but only with respect to benefits \n     that are covered under the plan after the contract \n     termination.\n       (3)

under this subsection with respect to \n     provider's treatment of the pregnancy shall extend through \n     the provision of post-partum care directly related to the \n     delivery.\n       (4) Terminal illness.--If--\n       (A) a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee was determined \n     to be terminally ill (as determined under section \n     1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act) at

plan or issuer after the date of the \n     termination of the contract with the health insurance issuer) \n     and not to impose cost-sharing with respect to the individual \n     in an amount that

quality assurance \n     standards of the plan or issuer responsible for payment under \n     paragraph (1) and to provide to such plan or issuer necessary \n     medical information related to the

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) although damage awards in product liability actions can \n     encourage the production of safer products, they also can \n     have a direct effect on interstate commerce and our Nation's \n     consumers by, among other things, increasing the cost and \n     decreasing the availability of products;\n       (2) some of the rules of law governing product liability \n     actions are inconsistent within and among the States, \n     resulting in differences in State laws that can be \n     inequitable to both plaintiffs and defendants and can impose \n     burdens on interstate commerce;\n       (3) product liability awards can jeopardize the financial \n     well-being of individuals and industries, particularly the \n     Nation's small businesses;\n       (4) because the product liability laws of one State can \n     have adverse effects on consumers and businesses in many \n     other States, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to \n     enact national, uniform product liability laws that preempt \n     State laws; and\n       (5) it is the constitutional role of the Federal Government \n     to remove barriers to interstate commerce.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based on the powers under clause 3 of \n     section 8 of article I of the United States Constitution, the \n     purposes of this Act are to promote the free flow of goods \n     and services and to lessen burdens on interstate commerce \n     by--\n       (1) establishing certain uniform legal principles of \n     product liability that provide a fair balance among the \n     interests of product users, manufacturers, and product \n     sellers;\n       (2) providing for reasonable standards concerning, and \n     limits on, punitive damages over and above the actual damages \n     suffered by a claimant;\n       (3) ensuring the fair allocation of liability in product \n     liability actions;\n       (4) reducing the unacceptable costs and delays in product \n     liability actions caused by excessive litigation that harm \n     both plaintiffs and defendants;\n       (5) establishing greater fairness, rationality, and \n     predictability in product liability actions; and\n       (6) providing fair and expeditious judicial procedures that \n     are necessary to complement and effectuate the legal \n     principles established by this Act.\n                   TITLE I--PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM\n\n     SEC. 101.

and\n       (II) any corresponding insurer's subrogation lien; and\n\n       (ii) the manufacturer or product seller shall have no \n     further right by way of contribution or otherwise against the \n     employer.\n       (D) Certain rights not affected.--Notwithstanding a finding \n     by the trier of fact described in subparagraph (C), the \n     insurer shall not lose--\n       (i) any right of subrogation related to any--\n\n       (I) intentional tort committed against the claimant by a \n     coemployee; or\n       (II) act committed by a coemployee outside the scope of \n     normal work practices; or\n\n       (ii) any rights to credits against future liability \n     established pursuant to applicable State workers' \n     compensation law.\n       (b) Attorney's Fees.--If, in a product liability action \n     that is subject to this section, the manufacturer or product \n     seller raises the issue of employer fault pursuant to this \n     section and the trier of fact finds that the fault of the \n     employer was not a substantial factor in causing the harm to \n     the claimant, the court shall require the manufacturer or \n     product seller to reimburse the insurer for reasonable \n     attorney's fees and court costs, as determined by the court, \n     incurred by the insurer in litigating the issue of employer \n     fault, unless the court finds that the position of the \n     manufacturer or product seller was substantially justified or \n     that special circumstances make such a reimbursement unjust.\n                TITLE II--BIOMATERIALS ACCESS ASSURANCE\n\n     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress find that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) move in interstate commerce;\n       (B) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (C) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and component parts;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices for a number of \n     reasons, including concerns about the costs of such \n     litigation;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) because medical devices and the raw materials and \n     component parts used in their manufacture move in interstate \n     commerce, a shortage of such raw materials and component \n     parts affects interstate commerce;\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs;\n       (16) the several States and their courts are the primary \n     architects and regulators of our tort system; Congress, \n     however, must, in certain circumstances involving the \n     national interest, address tort issues, and a threatened \n     shortage of raw materials and component parts for life-saving \n     medical devices is one such circumstance; and\n       (17) the protections set forth in this title are needed to \n     assure the continued supply of materials for life-saving \n     medical devices; however, negligent suppliers should not be \n     protected.\n\n     SEC. 203.

The discovery conducted pursuant to this \n     subparagraph shall be limited to issues that are directly \n     relevant to--\n       (i) the pending motion to dismiss; or\n       (ii) the jurisdiction of the court.\n       (3) Affidavits relating status of defendant.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) \n     of subparagraph (B), the court shall consider a defendant to \n     be a bio-materials supplier who is not subject to an action \n     for harm to a claimant caused by an implant, other than an \n     action relating to liability for a violation of contractual \n     requirements or specifications described in section 205(d).\n       (B) Responses to motion to dismiss.--The court shall grant \n     a motion to dismiss any action that asserts liability of the \n     defendant under subsection (b) or (c) of section 205 on the \n     grounds that the defendant is not a manufacturer subject to \n     such section 205(b) or seller subject to section 205(c), \n     unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that \n     demonstrates that--\n       (i) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending the \n     defendant is not a manufacturer, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a manufacturer under \n     section 205(b); or\n       (ii) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending that \n     the defendant is not a seller, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a seller under \n     section 205(c).\n       (4) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss.--\n       (A) In general.--The court shall rule on a motion to \n     dismiss filed under subsection (a) solely on the basis of the \n     pleadings of the parties made pursuant to this section and \n     any affidavits submitted by the parties pursuant to this \n     section.\n       (B) Motion for summary judgment.-- Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, if the court determines that the \n     pleadings and affidavits made by parties pursuant to this \n     section raise genuine issues concerning material facts with \n     respect to a motion concerning contractual requirements and \n     specifications, the court may deem the motion to dismiss to \n     be a motion for summary judgment made pursuant to subsection \n     (d).\n       (d) Summary Judgment.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Basis for entry of judgment.--A biomaterials supplier \n     shall be entitled to entry of judgment without trial if the \n     court finds there is no genuine issue concerning any material \n     fact for each applicable element set forth in paragraphs (1) \n     and (2) of section 205(d).\n       (B) Issues of material fact.--With respect to a finding \n     made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a \n     genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence \n     submitted by claimant would be sufficient to allow a \n     reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the \n     jury found the evidence to be credible.\n       (2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for \n     summary judgment.--If, under applicable rules, the court \n     permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary \n     judgment made pursuant to this subsection, such discovery \n     shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine \n     issue of material fact exists as to the applicable elements \n     set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 205(d).\n       (3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier.--A \n     biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in \n     connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary \n     judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section \n     205(d) or the failure to establish the applicable elements of \n     section 205(d) solely to the extent permitted by the \n     applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against \n     nonparties.\n       (e) Stay Pending Petition for Declaration.--If a claimant \n     has filed a petition for a declaration pursuant to section \n     205(b)(3)(A) with respect to a defendant, and the Secretary \n     has not issued a final decision on the petition, the court \n     shall stay all proceedings with respect to that defendant \n     until such time as the Secretary has issued a final decision \n     on the petition.\n       (f) Dismissal With Prejudice.--An order granting a motion \n     to dismiss or for summary judgment pursuant to this section \n     shall be entered with prejudice, except insofar as the moving \n     defendant may be rejoined to the action as provided in \n     section 207.\n       (g) Manufacturer Conduct of Litigation.--The manufacturer \n     of an implant that is the subject of an action covered under \n     this title shall be permitted to conduct litigation\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\n     on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal filed by a \n     biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under this section \n     on behalf of such supplier if the manufacturer and any other \n     defendant in such action enter into a valid and applicable \n     contractual agreement under which the manufacturer agrees to \n     bear the cost of such litigation or to conduct such \n     litigation.\n\n     SEC. 207. SUBSEQUENT IMPLEADER OF DISMISSED DEFENDANT.\n\n       (a) Impleading of Dismissed Defendant.--A court, upon \n     motion by a manufacturer or a claimant within 90 days after \n     entry of a final judgment in an action by the claimant \n     against a manufacturer, and notwithstanding any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations, may implead a biomaterials \n     supplier who has been dismissed from the action pursuant to \n     this title if--\n       (1) the manufacturer has made an assertion, either in a \n     motion or other pleading filed with the court or in an \n     opening or closing statement at trial, or as part of a claim \n     for contribution or indemnification, and the court makes a \n     finding based on the court's independent review of the \n     evidence contained in the record of the action, that under \n     applicable law--\n       (A) the negligence or intentionally tortious conduct of the \n     dismissed supplier was an actual and proximate cause of the \n     harm to the claimant; and\n       (B) the manufacturer's liability for damages should be \n     reduced in whole or in part because of such negligence or \n     intentionally tortious conduct; or\n       (2) the claimant has moved to implead the supplier and the \n     court makes a finding based on the court's independent review \n     of the evidence contained in the record of the action, that \n     under applicable law--\n       (A) the negligence or intentionally tortious conduct of the \n     dismissed supplier was an actual and proximate cause of the \n     harm to the claimant; and\n       (B) the claimant is unlikely to be able to recover the full \n     amount of its damages from the remaining defendants.\n       (b) Standard of Liability.--Notwithstanding any preliminary \n     finding under subsection (a), a biomaterials supplier who has \n     been impleaded into an action subject to this title, as \n     provided for in this section--\n       (1) may, prior to entry of judgment on the claim against \n     it, supplement the record of the proceeding that was \n     developed prior to the grant of the motion for impleader \n     under subsection (a); and\n       (2) may be found liable to a manufacturer or a claimant \n     only to the extent required and permitted by any applicable \n     Federal or State law other than this title in an action \n     alleging harm caused by an implant.\n       (c) Discovery.--Nothing in this section shall give a \n     claimant or any other party the right to obtain discovery \n     from a biomaterials supplier defendant at any time prior to \n     grant of a motion for impleader beyond that allowed under \n     section 206.\n        TITLE III--LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABILITY; EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n     SEC. 301.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding young Maryland woman, Jenny Chuasiriporn. Yesterday, Jenny, \na 20-year-old amateur golfer, placed second in the U.S. Women's Open \nfollowing a ``sudden death'' round with the ultimate winner, Se Ri Pak. \nAlthough Jenny did not place first in the U.S. Women's Open, she won a \nplace in my heart and in the hearts of many others.\n  Jenny Chuasiriporn is a senior at Duke University and is from \nTimonium, Maryland. Her pursuit of excellence in golf is truly a family \naffair. Her 21-year-old brother, Joey, was her caddy and coach. Her \nparents were also at the Blackwolf Run Golf Course in Wisconsin to \ncheer on their daughter, having closed up their family business, the \nBangkok Place restaurant on York Road, to be with her.\n  Now, I will be the first to admit that I do not share much with Jenny \nin regard to the quality of my golf game. My golf handicap is pretty \nclose to the height of the Washington Monument! But I do think I'm a \npretty good putter. And I know from first hand experience that the game \nof golf takes an extraordinary amount of concentration and consistency \nto drive down the fairway, angle that chip shot, and putt slowly and \nsurely. Jenny has that great concentration and consistency. She is and \nwill be a great golfer. I, on the other hand, will stick with the \nSenate!\n  Jenny also exhibited strong endurance. On Sunday, she hit a forty \nfoot birdie putt that forced the tournament into a playoff round. After \nan 18-hole playoff round, the game was still tied between Jenny and Se \nRi. Then the tournament went into what they call a ``sudden death'' \nround. It was the first sudden death round in the U.S. Women's Open 53-\nyear history. Finally, on the second hole of ``sudden death'', Se Ri \nPak hit an 18-foot birdie to win the tournament. But Jenny \nChuasiriporn, the young Maryland amateur, had held on tight for five \nlong days of golf and can surely call herself a winner.\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\n  More and more Americans are turning to golf as a recreational sport. \nJenny Chuasiriporn's game is not recreational. Hers is a game of hard \nwork. Jenny and Se Ri went through weeds and water trying to win the \ntournament. That is not your typical Saturday afternoon golf game. \nJenny played tough golf against seasoned professionals for five days, \non the tough Blackwolf Run Golf Course in Wisconsin.

Mr. President, I am pleased to return to my \nSenate duties today after a relatively brief period of convalescence \nfollowing by-pass surgery at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas \nJefferson University, one of our nation's great medical institutions.\n  This experience has again led me to marvel at our health care system \nand to make me more determined than ever to support federal funding for \nbiomedical research and to make health care available to all Americans.\n  At Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, I was \nthe beneficiary of outstanding hospital care and a superbly qualified \nmedical team headed by renowned cardiologist, Dr. Howard Weitz and \ndistinguished surgeons Dr. Richard Edie and Dr. James Diehl. (Dr. Weitz \nhas assisted me for many years going back to his student days when he \nvolunteered for my campaign for Mayor of Philadelphia.)\n  My concern about health care has long pre-dated my own personal \nbenefits from the MRI and other diagnostic and curative procedures. My \nconcern about health care began many years ago and has been intensified \nby my service on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education which I now have the honor to chair.\n  As the Record shows, I have introduced and cosponsored legislation \ngoing back to the 98th Congress designed to provide health care \ncoverage to all Americans. Among my proposals were the Health Care Cost \nContainment Act of 1983 (S. 2051), the Community Based Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion Projects Act of 1985 (S. 1873), the \nHealth Care Affordability and Quality Improvement Act of 1992 (S. \n3176), the Comprehensive Health Care Act of 1993 (S. 18), the Health \nCare Assurance Acts of 1995 and 1997 (S. 18 and S. 24), and the Healthy \nChildren's Pilot Program Act of 1997.\n  In conjunction with the distinguished ranking member of the \nSubcommittee, Senator Tom Harkin, our Subcommittee has taken the lead \nto increase NIH funding from $11.3 billion in FY95 to $11.9 billion in \nFY96 to $12.7 billion in FY97 to $13.6 billion in FY98. This year we \nare targeting an increase of $2 billion which will be difficult \nconsidering the Subcommittee's other priorities; but, I think, \nattainable.\n  I have long been convinced that our Federal budget of \n$1,700,000,000,000 could provide sufficient funding for America's needs \nif we establish our real priorities. The real question is whether we \nhave enough doctors, hospitals, medical personnel, etc. to take care of \nAmericans in need of medical attention. I am convinced that we do. The \npart which has yet to be accomplished is to work out the financing for \nthe delivery of such health care. As specified in the legislation which \nI have introduced, I am convinced that sufficient savings are possible \nwithin the current system to provide health care to all Americans \nwithin the current expenditures.\n  I return to the Senate today with renewed commitment that every \nAmerican should have the quality medical care I had at Jefferson \nMedical College of Thomas Jefferson University. In recognition of \nhealth care providers everywhere in America, I consider it appropriate \nto identify, compliment and thank members of the medical team which \nprovided my superb medical care at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas \nJefferson University:\n  Dr. Stephen McNulty, Dr. Michael Savage, Dr. Herbert Patrick, Dr. \nBeckie Michael, Dr. Geno Merli, Dr. Arnold Greenspon, Dr. A.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sherrie M. \nSuzuki of Hawaii Baptist Academy in Hawaii for winning first place in \nthe 11th Annual National Peace Essay state-level competition. More than \n5,000 participants from various countries around the world, including \nthe United States and U.S. territories entered this contest. Each \nstudent wrote on issues concerning war crimes and human rights \nviolations in various international conflicts.\n  Miss Suzuki's essay entitled, ``Cleansing the Wounds of War'', sheds \nlight on an ongoing issue concerning how war criminals should be \nbrought to justice. Her solution examines the United Nations' tribunal \nexpected to be permanently implemented in 1998. She writes ``an \ninternational tribunal is one logical solution'' to the problem of \nmaking war criminals pay for their atrocities. Her essay discusses the \npositive outcomes of the Nuremberg trials and the negative effects of \nRwanda's mistakes.\n  Mr. President, it is inspiring to witness the active role that young \npeople play in enhancing their understanding about peace relations. Ms. \nSuzuki is proof that young students today are getting more involved in \nactivities that address peacemaking issues. I am proud that Ms. Suzuki \nhas received such a prestigious award. Her determination to expand her \nknowledge of peace and conflicts that arise in a changing global \nenvironment is admirable. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring a \nyoung woman of outstanding potential and achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7606-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7606-S7607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR EMPLOYER SUPPORT OF THE \n                           GUARD AND RESERVE\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nthe National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve \n(NCESGR)--its 4,200 volunteers and DoD staff --marking 25 years of \nservice to this Nation.\n  The National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve \nwas established in 1972, the year the United States ended the Selective \nService System and established an all-volunteer military force. The \nDepartment of Defense realized that a loss of support from employers \nand communities could be a roadblock to maintaining Reserve component \nmembership. NCESGR was created to obtain employer and community support \nfor the National Guard and Reserve and to promote the role of Reserve \nforces in the national defense.\n  NCESGR has lived up to that task and accomplished much more. Since\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\n1972, with the help of the Advertising Council, Inc., NCESGR has \nbenefited from more than $591 million in pro bono advertising reaching \nthe six million employers with one or more employees in the United \nStates.\n  Employers have, in turn, signed NCESGR Statements of Support, \npublicly committing to support the National Guard and Reserve. The \nformer Chairman of the Board and CEO of General Motors, Mr. James H. \nRoche signed the first Statement of Support in the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense on December 13, 1972. The next day, President \nRichard Nixon signed a Statement of Support covering all Federal \ncivilian employees. Since the inception of this program, Presidents \nFord, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton have all signed Statements of \nSupport, along with hundreds of thousands of employers. To date, over \n300,000 employers have signed statements of support.\n  NCESGR offers Ombudsman services designed to provide information to \nemployers and Reservists regarding their rights and responsibilities \nunder the law and to resolve conflicts through informal mediation. This \nprogram is operated in cooperation with the Department of Labor, which \nis responsible for conducting formal investigations. Hundreds of \nthousands of hours and dollars are saved through the use of community \nvolunteers.\n  Mr. President, the National Committee for Employer Support of the \nNational Guard and Reserve is smart government in action. The small \nNational Committee staff in Washington, DC, under the direction of the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, provides guidance \nand support to a network of 4,200 volunteer business, civic, and \ncommunity leaders.\n  These volunteers educate employers on their rights and obligations \nunder the law and recognize employers who actively support employee \nparticipation in the National Guard and Reserve. Volunteers also \neducate members of the National Guard and Reserve regarding their \nrights and responsibilities and the value of employer support. \nCommittees can be found in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, \nPuerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam.\n  With the end of the Cold War, the Reserve components have been called \nupon with increasing frequency. During the Gulf War in 1990-91, more \nthan 250,000 Reserve component members were called to active duty to \nsupport military operations in the Persian Gulf. Last year, National \nGuardsmen and Reservists contributed nearly 13 million mandays in \nsupport of Active duty operations and exercises.\n  Mr. President, thousands of employers, local and State government \nofficials, Active and Reserve component leaders, and military members \nfrom across the Nation and around the world request NCESGRs employer \nsupport expertise on a daily basis. When National Guardsmen and \nReservists return home following mobilization, ESGR committee members \nare there to provide information and support services to those in need.\n  The U.S. Congress passed the Uniformed Services Employment and \nReemployment Rights Act, (USERRA) of 1994, and updated it in 1996. This \nlaw completely revised the Veterans Reemployment Rights Act of 1940. \nUSERRA articulates the rights and responsibilities of the Reservist \nwith regard to job protection and explains employer rights under \nfederal law. NCESGR helps employers and Reservists understand this law \nand helps them informally resolve any employment conflicts that may \narise.\n  Mr. President, again, I want to congratulate NCESGR and its 54 ESGR \ncommittees on their 25 years of service and commend this network of \nover 4,200 volunteer patriots for their time and talent. They are \nserving their country and maintaining the much needed support of our \nemployers and communities for the Guard and Reserve. Through the \nefforts of people like Mr. Robert J. Cameron, the State Chair of the \nGreat State of Idaho, we can call on our Reserve forces to answer our \nNations call without the fear of job loss. Thank you Mr. President, and \nthank you, NCESGR.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7606-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7607-S7608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT A.

Ultimately, he rose to command the more \nthan 70,000 member Air Force Reserve.\n  He is a highly-decorated Vietnam veteran for his extraordinary aerial \nachievement and devotion to duty while assigned as an A-37 pilot with \nthe 604th Special Operations Squadron at Bien Hoa Air Base in South \nVietnam.\n  General McIntosh separated from active duty in August 1971 to join \nthe air reserve technician program as a full-time civil service \nemployee with active participation as an Air Force reservist. He is a \ncommand pilot with more than 4,000 flying hours in the A-10, A-37, C-\n130 and F-4. His military awards include the Distinguished Service \nMedal; Legion of Merit; Distinguished Flying Cross; Meritorious Service \nMedal with oak leaf cluster; Air Medal with 18 oak leaf clusters; Air \nForce Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster; and Vietnam Service \nMedal with three service stars.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, he has commanded an Air Force \nReserve wing, two Reserve numbered Air Forces, served as the vice \ncommander of the Air Force Reserve, and his most recent position as the \nchief of the Air Force Reserve and commander of the Air Force Reserve \nCommand--a dual hatted position.\n  General McIntosh's outstanding leadership, sense of purpose and \nsingular dedication to duty was crucial in the continuing successful \nintegration of the Air Force Reserve into the total Air Force, \nculminating in the Congressionally-directed activation of Air Force \nReserve Command as the service's ninth major command.\n  Through initiatives he has sponsored, the Air Force Reserve has \nsuccessfully entered new mission areas during his service as the chief \nof the Air Force Reserve, including the Reserve instructor pilot \nprogram; Space Command Group; Fighter Reserve Associate Test; Airborne \nWarning and Control System; and Combat Camera.\n  In today's environment of shrinking budgets, downsizing and the \nincreased role the Reserve Component plays in the national defense of \nour country, General McIntosh has provided us with a clear and concise \nview of the contributions and the versatility of our citizen-airmen.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nCity of Anoka Police Department on its selection as a semifinalist in \nthe 1998 Innovations in American Government Awards competition.\n  As my colleagues may know, Innovations in American Government is \nconsidered one of the most prestigious public-service awards granted \neach year in the United States. This awards program is sponsored by the \nFord Foundation, and administered by Harvard University's John F. \nKennedy School of Government in partnership with the Council for \nExcellence in Government.\n  Since 1986, Innovation awards have been given to those programs and \npolicies that represent effective and innovative government \ninitiatives. This year, the City of Anoka Police Department Juvenile \nJustice Alternative Police Accountability Conferencing Program has been \nselected as a semifinalist from among 1,400 applications submitted by \nfederal, state, county, and city and town organizations. Later this \nyear, the number of semifinalists will be narrowed to 25 finalists, ten \nof which will receive awards for $100,000 from the Ford Foundation. The \nremaining 15 finalists will each receive $20,000.\n  At a time when juvenile crime is on the rise in my home state of \nMinnesota and across the country, I am pleased that the Anoka Police \nDepartment has been recognized for its unique and effective efforts to \naddress this important public safety issue in our communities. \nInitiatives such as those implemented by the Anoka Police Department \nwill help to ensure that the young first-time offenders of today do not \nbecome the career criminals of tomorrow.\n  Through the leadership of Police Chief Andrew Revering, the Anoka \nPolice Department developed a program in 1994 to address the challenge \nof rising juvenile crime and the increasing rate of repeat juvenile \noffenders. The Juvenile Justice Alternative Police Accountability \nConferencing Program allows for specially trained police officers to \nfacilitate and supervise meetings between first time offenders, so the \noffender can be held accountable for his or her actions such as minor \ntheft, vandalism, assault or disorderly conduct.\n  Under this program, the offender is required to admit guilt to the \npolice, and with parental consent, he or she takes part in a police \naccountability conference. The Police Accountability Conferencing \nProgram ensures victims of crime, offenders, and communities a right to \nparticipate in the process of determining how to address the \nconsequences which result from criminal behavior.\n  Through interaction with police and victims, offenders develop a \ngreater understanding of the effect their actions have on a victim and \nhis or her family. More importantly, this program has demonstrated a \nproven record of success since only a small number of those who have \nentered the Anoka Police Accountability Conferencing Program have \nbecome repeat offenders.\n  The Anoka Police Department's success with this program has led many \nagencies in Minnesota and throughout the country to begin implementing \nsimilar programs. To its credit, Anoka Police have also educated and \ntrained officers from Arizona, Colorado, California, Iowa, Indiana, \nMinnesota and North Carolina about the police conferencing program. \nClearly, the City of Anoka and its Police Department have demonstrated \nexceptional leadership in fulfilling a local government's primary \nresponsibility: to protect citizens from crime and its debilitating \neffect on communities.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have shared the success of this \ninnovative program with my colleagues in the Senate. I look forward to \nvisiting this program in the future, and learning more about similar \ninitiatives in Minnesota that will help to prevent crime and keep our \ncitizens safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7608-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7608-S7609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF PAUL O'DWYER\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Saturday, June 28, as Congress began \nits most recent recess, New York City bid a fond farewell to one of \nCounty Mayo's finest gifts to our city and nation.\n  Paul O'Dwyer, former New York City Council President and champion of \ncountless progressive causes, was a towering figure in our politics for \nwell over half a century, playing a significant role in such disparate \nmovements as the efforts to create a United Ireland and an independent \nState of Israel, the American civil rights and peace movements and the \nNew York City reform movement that remade the face of our city's \npolitics in the late 1950's.\n  From running guns to the Irgun in 1947 to organizing black voters in \nMississippi in 1964, Paul O'Dwyer was on the cutting edge of every \nmajor social and political issue that shaped our nation's politics. He \nmay have only won two of the dozen elections he contested in his long \nand colorful career, but his legacy lives on in the lives he touched \nand the issues he championed. Paul O'Dwyer and I were not always on the \nsame side of every issue. You could question his strategy or even his \njudgement, but you could never question his abiding integrity or his \nremarkable capacity to sustain passion about human dignity and equal \njustice.\n  Paul O'Dwyer was born on June 29, 1907 in the Irish village of \nBehola, the eleventh and last surviving child of Patrick and Bridget \nMcNicholas O'Dwyer. He arrived on our shores in 1925, working on the \ndocks as he went to night classes, first at Fordham University and then \nat St. John's Law School.\n  It is a measure of how quickly he moved through life that he had to \nreceive special permission from Chief Justice Benjamin Nathan Cordoza \nof the New York Court of Appeals to take his bar exam in 1929, four \nyears after arriving from Ireland and two years before he could receive \ncitizenship or be formally admitted to the bar. As the younger brother \nof Tammany Hall fixture (and future mayor) William O'Dwyer, he might \nhave easily become a successfully well-connected lawyer. But that was \nsimply not the way Paul O'Dwyer chose to live his life.\n  ``If I thought at the end of the year that all I did was make a \nliving, I'd regard it as a pretty incomplete year'', he once said of \nhis rich life as an agitator within the system. He must, on retrospect, \nhave had paying clients during his 67 years as an attorney, but they \nwere hardly the reason every segment of New York City's diverse \npolitical and ethnic spectrum joined in mourning this remarkable \nindividual.\n  New York City and our nation are inspired by the quality of Paul \nO'Dwyer's example and enriched by the legacy of his accomplishments. I \nask to have printed in the Congressional Record The New York Times' \nreport on Paul O'Dwyer's funeral.\n  The report follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 28, 1998]\n\n         Political Elite Out in Force To Mourn Democrat O'Dwyer\n\n                            [By Mike Allen]\n\n       New York's political royalty packed an Upper West Side \n     sanctuary yesterday for the funeral Mass of Paul O'Dwyer, the \n     gritty liberal who once led the City Council.\n       Mr. O'Dwyer, who died Tuesday, was remembered for the \n     crunch of his eyebrows and the splay of his glasses as he \n     fought for causes as perpetual as Irish nationalism and as \n     fleeting as a strike by flight attendants. Tomorrow, which \n     would have been his 91st birthday, his ashes are to be \n     scattered at his birthplace, his family's three-and-a-half-\n     acre farmstead in County Mayo, in western Ireland.\n       The bagpipes and drums of the Police Department's Emerald \n     Society led the cortege to Holy Trinity Roman Catholic \n     Church, stepping off to the anthem of Irish rebellion, ``A \n     Nation Once Again.''\n       Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sate with his arms folded in a \n     front pew. He was separated from the recent nemesis, Peter F. \n     Vallone, the Council Speaker, by Barrie Robinson, the Irish \n     consul general.\n       Frank Durkan, a nephew and law partner of Mr. O'Dwyer, used \n     his eulogy to reel off a list of public officials Mr. O'Dwyer \n     had known and tormented.\n       ``Mayor Giuliani,'' Mr. Durkan said, ``you're lucky, in a \n     way, that you're not in his line of fire at the moment.'' The \n     congregation of 700, mostly Mr. O'Dwyer's fellow Democrats, \n     laughed and applauded.\n       In the homily, the Rev. Thomas P. Leonard, Holy Trinity's \n     pastor, said Mr. O'Dwyer's style was ``confrontation, with \n     wit and sagacity.'' Father Leonard told of a conversation he \n     had overheard Thursday afternoon in the rectory between two \n     friends who were reading Mr. O'Dwyer's obituary.\n       ``One said, `Wasn't he an anarchist?'' Father Leonard said. \n     ``The other answered, `No, no, no! He was Irish.' ''\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\n       Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough President, \n     remembered Mr. O'Dwyer's flights to help Soviet Jews, and bus \n     rides to help elect a black man in Alabama.\n       ``You see,'' Mr. Sutton said, ``Paul O'Dwyer was not just \n     Irish. Paul O'Dwyer was Italian. Paul O'Dwyer was Jewish. \n     Paul O'Dwyer was Greek. He was Polish. Paul O'Dwyer was also \n     African-American. In his involvement in the causes that were \n     not necessarily his, Paul O'Dwyer was us.''\n       Mr. Sutton concluded, ``At that place, where he should \n     finally rest, you can bet one thing: There'll be an \n     organizing of protests there. Because that is the nature of \n     Paul O'Dwyer.''\n       A niece, Joan O'Dwyer Savarese, invoked the notion that at \n     death, life plays back like a movie. ``Uncle Paul,'' she \n     said, ``what a show you're in for.''\n       That show would have included boarding house life and night \n     law school after immigrating to Manhattan, defense of Irish \n     Republican Army members facing extradition, registration of \n     black voters in Mississippi, marches against the Vietnam War, \n     four losing races for United States Senate, and election as \n     Councilman at Large in Manhattan and City Council President.\n       His wife, Patricia, recalled a Board of Estimate meeting \n     when a fight broke out between landlords and tenants (``Odd, \n     that,'' she said to appreciative laughter), and Mr. O'Dwyer \n     descended into the skirmish as peacemaker. She went on to say \n     that her husband ``is truly not dead.''\n       ``We have evidence of his physical passing,'' Mrs. O'Dwyer \n     said. ``But that spirit and that passion--it will stay alive \n     if we all leave here today committed to making the lives of \n     our fellow human beings better.''\n       At the service's close, the white pall that shrouded the \n     coffin was replaced by the Irish flag. Friends, certain Mr. \n     O'Dwyer would be delighted to be wrapped in the tricolor, \n     gave a standing ovation as the casket passed by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7608-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LAURIE DONOVAN\n\n Mr. BOND.

She \nhas served Missouri's 74th District since 1982, and done so with a \ncombination of conviction, compassion, and just plain good humor.\n  There is no question that Laurie has been a maverick.

I join all Missourians in wishing \nher well, and thanking her for her many years of dedicated \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7609-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NORTH DAKOTANS DARIN ERSTAD AND RICK HELLING\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's \nattention today to two young men from my state who are making their \nmarks this year where few North Dakotans have before: in major league \nbaseball. They are Darin Erstad of the Anaheim Angels and Rick Helling \nof the Texas Rangers. A few weeks ago, ESPN referred to Darin Erstad as \n``the all-star no one's heard of.'' That will change after his \nintroduction tonight at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in \nDenver. Although baseball fans did not elect Darin to the all-star \nteam, the American League coaching staff recognized his brilliant play \nand named him as a reserve. So far this season, the Jamestown, North \nDakota, native is batting .313, and his 115 hits ranks second in the \nAmerican League. He currently leads his Angels' teammates in home runs \n(18) and runs batted in (59). I am sure that few who watched him play \nas a youngster in North Dakota, or as a college player with the \nNebraska Cornhuskers, are surprised at his success at the major league \nlevel. He is clearly a disciplined, hard-working player, and his \nelection to this year's all-star team is well deserved.\n  Rick Helling's success in Texas this summer has been no less \nspectacular. As a starting pitcher with the Rangers, the Devils Lake, \nNorth Dakota, native finished the first half of the season with an \nimpressive record of 11 wins, 4 losses, and an earned run average of \n4.40. Only two pitchers in the American League have posted more wins \nthis season. Unfortunately, Rick was not chosen to the all-star squad. \nThat is a shame, but the rosters for the game are limited and each year \ndeserving players are left out. Rick deserved to be on the team and his \nomission should not overshadow what has so far been an outstanding \nyear. He is well on a pace to win 20 games, the benchmark all starting \nmajor league pitchers strive for. I know he has the talent to do it and \nI wish him continued success.\n  Considering how few North Dakotans have ever played in the major \nleagues, my state is understandably proud that two of them are \nachieving such terrific success at the same time. But it is even more \nfitting that Darin Erstad and Rick Helling are having breakthrough \nseasons this year. Those who follow baseball know that the summer's \nbiggest story has been the attempt by several players, most notably \nMark McGwire, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Sammy Sosa, to break the single \nseason record for most home runs. That enduring record of 61 home runs, \nwhich has stood for nearly four decades, was set by the New York \nYankees' slugger Roger Maris. Roger Maris, I am very proud to say, was \nraised in Fargo, North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7609-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  16TH ANNUAL METRO DETROIT YOUTH DAY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nspecial event that will take place in the City of Detroit. July 8, 1998 \nwill mark the 16th Annual Metro Detroit Youth Day on Belle Isle in \nDetroit. This event is designed to help improve relationships between \nyoung people and community businesses in the Metro Detroit area. More \nthan 16,000 young people are expected to take part in the daylong \nactivities.\n  This event is significant in that community volunteers, from across \nMetro Detroit, have come together to make a difference in young \npeople's lives. The many organizers of this event have recognized the \nneed for more youth activities, emphasizing physical education and good \nsportsmanship in improving the lives of Metro Detroit Youth. It is for \nthis reason that they have sponsored this wonderful program that has \ngrown more successful each year.\n  Over the course of the last 16 years, this event has garnered \ntremendous support from the people within the Metro Detroit community \nfrom both the private sector and from all levels of government. This \nyear over ninety organizations serve as co-sponsors. At this time I \nwould like to extend my appreciation and best wishes to Mr. Ed Deeb who \nhas again chaired this event and brought it to new levels of success. I \nwish all the children participating and the sponsors tremendous \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7609-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7609-S7610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IRAN MISSILE TECHNOLOGY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to express my serious \nconcern about Iran's continuing efforts to obtain missile technology.\n  It has been widely reported that Iran has produced chemical weapons \nand is actively pursuing the development of biological and nuclear \nweapons. When these deadly technologies are coupled with advanced \nballistic missiles, they become true weapons of mass destruction, \nposing a grave and direct threat to U.S. troops stationed in the \nPersian Gulf are as well as our key ally in the Middle East, the State \nof Israel.\n  Iran's quest to develop ballistic missiles has been aided by several \nRussian corporations, who have sold Iran key technology and provided \nimportant technical support. Public reports indicate that Iran is \nextremely close to deploying advanced ballistic missiles. If we fail to \ntake meaningful action quickly, Iran could deploy chemical-tipped \nballistic missiles within one year.\n  Congress reacted appropriately to this threat by passing the Iran \nMissile Proliferation Sanctions Act in May by a vote of 90-4. The bill \nwould impose sanctions on individual companies--not governments--that \nassist Iran in developing ballistic missile technology.\n  To its credit, the government of Russia, after considerable prodding \nfrom the U.S. State Department, has taken meaningful steps toward \nhalting the export of sensitive technology. Unfortunately, these \nmeasures alone are not sufficient to freeze the Iranian missile \nprogram. The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act is needed.\n  I regret the Administration's decision to veto this important bill. I \nunderstand its view that the Executive Branch alone should attempt to \nresolve\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\nthis issue. However, I believe the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction is an issue of such tremendous importance that legislation \nis warranted.\n  I hope the Majority Leader will schedule a vote on the veto message \nsoon, and I hope my colleagues will continue to show strong support for \nthe Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7609-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO RICK METTS: 1998 GREATER DERRY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ``CITIZEN \n                             OF THE YEAR''\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Rick Metts of Derry, New Hampshire, on being named the \n1998 ``Citizen of the Year'' by the Greater Derry Chamber of Commerce. \nRick has earned this very special honor as a result of his many years \nof volunteer work for a variety of different organizations in the City \nof Derry.\n  At the Derry Village Rotary Club, Rick has been Sergeant at Arms for \nthe past seven years and has participated in every fundraiser, project \nand event the club has held. As a member of the club's Social \nCommittee, Rick has helped organize Pot-Luck suppers and Yankee Swaps, \nand has served as the Master of Ceremonies for Pictionary Games. Rick \nhas also demonstrated his commitment to education, as he and his family \nhave co-sponsored scholarships given to outstanding vocational \nstudents.\n  In addition to his work at the Rotary Club, Rick is also active in a \nnumber of other organizations in his community. He is currently serving \nhis second three-year term on the Derry School Board and has held the \nposition of Chair twice. Rick also has shown his true dedication to \nchildren through his work with the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Derry. \nFor the past two years, Rick has chaired the Club's largest fundraiser, \nwhich features a gourmet dinner as well as both a silent and live \nauction. He has also coached and refereed many basketball games for the \nclub and recreation teams. Rick has also been a longtime member and \nsupporter of the Greater Derry Chamber of Commerce.\n  According to one of his close friends, Rick Metts ``never has to be \nasked, he always volunteers.'' The many ways Rick has found to be \ninvolved in his community are a true testament to that statement. Rick \nembodies that great spirit of volunteerism that helped make this nation \ngreat. I want to again congratulate Rick Metts on being named ``Citizen \nof the Year'' and it is with great pride that I represent him in the \nUnited States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7610-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NEED FOR HMO REFORM\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, our health care system is in a \nstate of crisis--a crisis of confidence. Many Americans no longer \nbelieve that their insurance companies can provide them with the access \nto care or quality of service they need.\n  Today I continue our series of stories describing how some managed \ncare plans seem to have put cost saving before life-saving. The \nexperience of Jacqueline Lee is just one more example of the pressing \nneed for Congress to act now to protect the rights of patients.\n  Jacqueline Lee lives in Bethesda, Maryland. A lover of the outdoors, \nshe took a trip to hike in the Shenandoah Mountains in the summer of \n1996. While walking on one of the trails, she lost her footing, and \nplummeted off of a 40-foot cliff to the ground below.\n  Luckily for Jacqueline, she was quickly airlifted from the mountain \nto a hospital in Virginia. Amazingly, she survived the fall, sustaining \nfractures in her arms, pelvis, and her skull.\n  Incredibly, her HMO refused to pay the more than $10,000 in hospital \nbills. They said Ms. Lee had failed to gain ``pre-authorization'' for \nher emergency room visit. To this insurer, the fact that she was \nunconscious was no exception. For over a year, she challenged her HMO \nand faced personal bankruptcy. Ultimately, the Maryland Insurance \nAdministration ordered the insurer to pay the hospital and fined them \nas well for their initial refusal to cover Ms. Lee's medical expenses.\n  Yet her struggle wasn't over. Within a year, after follow-up surgery \nfor her injuries, Ms. Lee found herself back in the emergency room, \nfearing that she was suffering complications from surgery. Not wanting \nto go through another ordeal, this time she called her HMO beforehand. \nThey told her they would pay only for her screening fees because the \nvisit was not considered ``a medical emergency.''\n  Mr. President, we must take up and pass meaningful patient \nprotections this year. We have a bill, S. 1890, that would prevent \nsituations like this from occurring. Under our bill, Jacqueline Lee \nwould have access to emergency care without preauthorization, and when \nshe feels her life is in danger--not when the insurance company tells \nher it's okay. Under our bill, Jacqueline would have been covered for \nher injuries--she would not have had the rug pulled out from under her \nby the HMO.\n  We have only a few weeks of legislative business left to act. \nWhatever we do will not alleviate the stress that Jacqueline Lee has \nendured, but we can ensure that others do not have to spend time \nfighting insurers that would be better spent fighting for their health. \nWe must guarantee patients the peace of mind that comes with knowing \nthat their health plan will be there to help them recuperate, not deny \npayment because it improves their bottom line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/07/senate-section/article/S7610-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 2271\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
