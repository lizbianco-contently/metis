Mr. President, in the United States we have the best \ndoctors and hospitals in the world, and the investments we have made in \nresearch pay off each day in the form of new therapies and procedures \nthat save lives or dramatically improve the quality of life for \ncountless patients. Yet, too many people are being denied access to \nmedically necessary care by cost-driven insurance companies that are \nbent on putting profits before patients.\n  People across the country are concerned. In a recent survey by NBC \nNews and the Wall Street Journal, 80 percent of the respondents said \npassing a bill of rights, a health care bill of rights, a Patients' \nBill of Rights, is very important--including 33 percent who said it was \nvital.\n  So, what is wrong with today's health insurance system? We could ask \nGlenn Nealy's young widow. But before we go through that rather tragic \nstory, I will just review very quickly the essential elements in our \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  It guarantees the access to specialists and emergency rooms and other \nneeded care.\n  It expands the choices, which enable patients to select doctors and \nplans, and it removes the gag law which, in too many instances, denies \ndoctors the ability to tell their patients about the best medical \nprocedures to take care of their particular needs.\n  It ensures independent appeals. If individuals find they are denied \naccess to certain types of procedures, there will be an opportunity for \nan independent appeal--to make sure the kind of care that those \nindividuals are receiving is really the best.\n  It holds plans accountable for medical decisions. That is extremely \nimportant. We should not be excluding these health plans from \naccountability for the decisions that they make. I am confident that \nthe good plans have nothing to fear from this proposal. They make \nmedical decisions that are carefully considered and justified. But \nthere are increasingly too many plans in this country that are putting \nthe bottom line first and are not living up to their responsibilities. \nAnd there is no reason in the world that those plans should not be \naccountable, consistent with what the State laws provide.\n  It restores the doctor-patient relationship. All patients who are \nbeing treated need to know they are receiving the treatment that is \nnecessary from the medical point of view, rather than from the \ninsurance company's point of view, or some accountant's point of view, \nback in an office that may be practicing almost cookbook medicine. That \nis, obviously, not in the interest of the patient and doctor. This is a \nproposal that allows doctors--who have dedicated themselves to good \npatient care and then find themselves restricted by the various HMOs \nand insurance plans--the opportunity to practice the best in medicine.\n  And it establishes quality and information standards so patients have \ninformation available to them and are able to make informed and good \njudgments.\n  As one who was the principal sponsor for HMO legislation in the \n1970s, I am a great believer in using the concept of preventive \nmedicine in the treatment of patients and in trying to build into our \nhealth care system the concept that the system should generate income \nfor those who are going to keep the patients healthy, rather than \nreward a system that treats patients only when they are sick. That was \na very basic and fundamental concept. The good HMOs, and we have many \nof them in my own State of Massachusetts, have done this. They have \ninvested a great deal in preventing illness and disease. That is not a \ngeneral feature of our health delivery system today. But some HMOs have \ndone that and have been very aggressive in doing it, in keeping people \nhealthy. In those areas where they have been very successful in keeping \npeople healthy and then providing quality care for those who are sick, \nthey are an extraordinary example for good health care delivery in this \ncountry today, and we salute them. We salute them.\n  But, what we are finding is that these excellent groups are, too \noften and increasingly, put at a disadvantage by those who are going to \nrepresent that they are going to provide those kinds of services to the \npatients and then, when the time comes, cut back on those services \nbecause they are being driven by the economics of treatment of the \npatients and are making decisions that are based on interest in the \nbottom line of these HMOs, rather than what is in the interest of the \npatients.\n\n  So we have developed legislation here in the Congress for the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It is legislation that also has strong \nsupport over in the House of Representatives. There is a broad group of \nMembers of this body who have supported this legislation. There is a \nvery considerable number of our Republican colleagues and friends who \nhave supported this and similar legislation--Congressman Norwood, \nCongressman Ganske and others in the House of Representatives. There \nare some differences in the proposals, but there is a general \nrecognition of the need for action in this Congress. That is what we \nare hopeful of, at least having some action in this Congress.\n  This past week, we attended to the abuses in the IRS and its reform. \nIt seems to me that we ought to now turn to the abuses that exist out \nthere in the delivery of health care systems which, in many, many \ninstances, mean the difference between life and death.\n  All of us were shocked and horrified after learning of the abuses of \nbureaucrats in the IRS and how they treated individuals. That was \nshocking for, I think, all Americans. We passed legislation responding \nto that. We acted quickly.\n  We have even more egregious challenges that are facing patients \nacross this country, and this issue demands action as well. It is \nreally going to be a question of whether we are going to have the \nopportunity to debate these issues and come to a resolution on those \nitems and do it in the next several days, because we do not have a \ngreat deal of time in this session. The time is moving on. We are now \ninto May. Only about 75 legislative days remain before we move towards \nadjournment.\n  I cannot think of many measures that are more important than having \nlegislative action to debate and pass this, and to send it to the \nPresident.\n  The President of the United States supports it. There is strong \nindication by the vote that we had during the budget consideration that \nalmost half of the Members of this body support these concepts. And I \nbelieve if we have a full opportunity to debate and discuss these \nissues, we can certainly develop broad support for this type of \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\n  There is strong support by the American Medical Association. There is \nstrong support because doctors know what is at risk. There is strong \nsupport from consumers. We have the support of more than 100 \norganizations across the country, representing all different factions \nof the health care system. That is an extraordinary--extraordinary--\ngroup of representatives who have strong interests in different aspects \nof our health care system. But I daresay, I rarely see that kind of a \ncoalition support legislation. When they do, we ought to at least have \nan opportunity to address it on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We should \nnot be effectively denied that opportunity, and we won't be denied that \nopportunity.\n  We will not be denied that opportunity, Mr. President, because the \ngreat majority of American people believe that we should address this \nissue. And those of us who are in strong support of the bill that has \nbeen introduced by Senator Daschle, and of which many of us are \ncosponsors, know where there are areas of this bill that can be altered \nor changed. But we ought to have that opportunity on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate to do so.\n  What is not right is telling the American patients in this country, \ntelling the doctors in this country, telling the families in this \ncountry who have suffered abuses of the managed care system that, ``You \nare going to be denied any kind of redress.'' That is effectively what \nwe will be saying if we do not have the opportunity to debate this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, let me give you an example. We have been listening to \nthese examples over the past several days. They go on and on. People \nmay say, ``Well, you can always find one or two instances out there, \nand that is not a sufficient reason that we ought to provide a \npatients' bill of rights.''\n  Of course, that is hogwash, Mr. President, when you look at the range \nof challenges and problems we are facing in local communities across \nthe country. The type of situation that I will mention in a moment is \nbeing replicated every single day in communities all across this Nation \nand cries out for action, and action we will have, Mr. President. Let \nme assure you: There is no shortage of tragic stories about families \nwho have been hurt by the current system. And we will continue to raise \nthese examples until this body passes legislation to address the \nabuses.\n  I mention this morning a story about a young man, Mr. President, a \ngentleman called Glenn Nealy. Glenn had a heart condition and was under \nthe care of a cardiologist. In March of 1992, his employer switched \nhealth plans, and Glenn chose a new plan after gaining assurances from \nthe plan's agent that he would be allowed to continue seeing his \ncardiologist from the old plan. He was told that he simply had to \nchoose a plan doctor as his primary care physician and that the plan \ndoctor would then refer him to his current cardiologist for continued \ntreatment.\n\n  We are talking about access to a specialist for care that is clearly \nneeded by the patient. Here is a young person, a worker, who changes \nhealth plans. He is concerned about changing health plans, but it is \nrepresented to him that he can change and continue to use his \ncardiologist who has been treating him for many months. He goes ahead \nand signs up with this new program, but he has to follow the procedures \nto go to a primary care doctor before he can see his cardiologist.\n  On April 9, 1992, Glenn went to see his new primary care doctor to \nobtain the referral to his cardiologist, but the new doctor refused to \nsee Glenn because he was not yet issued his new HMO card. It was \nrepresented to him, if he switched, there would be a continuity of \ncare, better services. He believed that he would be treated in this \nmanner. He was given assurances of continued care under his \ncardiologist, and all he would have to do is effectively get the \nsignoff from his new primary care doctor. So he went ahead.\n  As I mentioned, he went this primary care doctor, and he was told \nthat his new HMO card had not been prepared. For 3 weeks, Glenn \ncontacted the plan's offices to get the necessary paperwork and was \ntwice issued incorrect cards. When Glenn finally was able to see his \nnew primary care physician, his request for a referral to his \ncardiologist was refused.\n  The family had indicated that they never would have signed up for \nthis plan if they were going to be denied access to that doctor. They \nwere given the assurances that they were going to be able to have a \ncontinuity of care, but the primary care doctor said no. The doctor \nprofessed not to know the HMO rules governing referrals.\n  In addition, Glenn's prescriptions to treat his heart condition went \nunfilled because the HMO provided incorrect information to the local \npharmacy. Yet another instance of ineptitude that contributed to the \ntragic result.\n  On April 29, the HMO formally denied Glenn's request because they had \nanother so-called participating provider in the area. That means they \nhave another provider. It was not the cardiologist that he wanted. He \nhad no idea whether that cardiologist had the training, had the \nbackground, or experience of his old cardiologist. He was just told \nthat there was a participating provider for the kind of services that \nhe needed related to his heart. He was assigned, by the plan, a new \ndoctor.\n  The promises they made while recruiting Glenn to join their plan were \nmeaningless. For 2 weeks, Glenn fought with the plan to continue care \nwith his old doctor, but when faced with no care at all, he agreed to \nsee the HMO's cardiologist. An appointment was made for May 19.\n  But Glenn never saw the plan's cardiologist. Tragically, he suffered \na massive heart attack on May 18, the day before his appointment. He \nleft behind a wife and two children. Glenn was only 35 years old.\n  This should not happen in America. Health plans must be held \nresponsible for the information they give patients, and patients must \nhave the right to access the care that they bought with their premiums. \nIt is fundamentally unfair to provide HMOs with immunity from \nbureaucratic decisions that mean the difference between life and death.\n  Mr. President, we must take up and pass meaningful patient \nprotections this year in the Congress. The legislation, as I mentioned, \nis supported by more than 100 groups representing millions of patients, \nhealth care professionals, and working families. We have the bill, the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, to prevent tragedies like this from \noccurring. Our bill would protect and restore the doctor-patient \nrelationship.\n  Our bill would guarantee that a change in plans does not mean an \nabrupt change in providers. Our bill would allow the Glenn family to \nhold their plan accountable for their negligence.\n  The Senate must show the American people whether they stand with the \npatients or with the greedy guardians of the status quo.\n  So next week the Senate may turn to a bill targeted only to breast \ncancer issues, but the women's community and the breast cancer \ncommunity and the broader coalition of patients and professionals \nsupport comprehensive managed care reform legislation. They want the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  They understand the need for the Patients' Bill of Rights because \nthis legislation will provide access to important clinical trials. \nClinical trials are critical to promoting the discovery of new life-\nsaving treatments and therapies. They offer hope and opportunity for \npatients who have nowhere else to turn.\n  This will be the new century of life sciences. No one can help but \npick up the newspaper every single day and find these extraordinary--\nextraordinary--changes that are taking place, to the benefit of all \nmankind. Whether we are discussing pharmaceutical breakthroughs, \nvarious kinds of surgical procedures, or other treatments--these \ndiscoveries are all taking place at this time.\n  Those that have been afflicted with the terrible tragedy of breast \ncancer want to be able to participate in clinical trials. And they will \nbe guaranteed that under the Patients' Bill of Rights. But they will \nnot be guaranteed it under the legislation that has been referenced \nbriefly here on the floor this last week.\n  These women need access to the right specialists. They will be \nguaranteed that under our bill--but not under the other legislation--\nand they need to know that care will not be abruptly interrupted when \nthe plans change.\n  Mr. President, our bill includes the right to an independent and \ntimely appeal, but the other bill does not. If a\n\n[[Page S4558]]\n\nbreast cancer patient or her doctor believe that she is not getting the \nkinds of treatment, she must have the right to be able to go through \nher HMO and, if necessary, outside the HMO for a timely appeal. Time is \nof the essence in these situations. Results are needed quickly--\nquickly.\n  Let me be clear. I am strongly opposed to drive-through mastectomies. \nI cosponsored Senator Daschle's legislation to end that practice. And I \nbelieve strongly that insurance companies that cover mastectomies have \nan obligation to also cover reconstructive surgery and prostheses when \na woman has had to have a mastectomy. I have worked closely with \nNational Breast Cancer Coalition and many others to correct these \ninjustices. But these two proposals address only a small portion of the \nserious problems faced by women with breast cancer. These are both \nincluded in our comprehensive bill, but they are augmented by \nadditional matters that are of enormous continued importance to those \nsame patients.\n  We are guaranteeing them in our bill access to the kind of specialty \ncare, the critically important clinical trials, and the ability to hold \nthe plan itself accountable. And when you have a process whereby you \ncan hold a plan accountable, where you have the possibility of \nenforcement, then you have real rights. When you do not have the \nability to enforce something, then that right is not meaningful.\n  That is true across the board. You can pass laws every day about \nburglary and robbery and other crimes, but unless you are going to have \na penalty, those laws are meaningless--they are meaningless. That is \nwhat we understand. We want to have those various plans held \naccountable for the decisions they make.\n  Mr. President, the HMOs that are providing good quality medicine have \nnothing to fear. It is understandable because they are living up to \nthese kinds of quality challenges. They are at a competitive \ndisadvantage by those plans that are trying to trim and reduce \nservices, and therefore claim that they are providing the same range of \nservices but doing so on the cheap. The obvious result is a diminution \nin care for those patients, and in a number of instances even the loss \nof life for those patients. And that is wrong.\n\n  Mr. President, many Americans have seen that movie, ``As Good As It \nGets.'' I think people understand this issue very well. Helen Hunt won \nan Oscar for her role in this movie. In it, she delivers a sharply \nworded criticism of her son's managed care plan, and audiences across \nthe country erupt in laughter and applause. These hoots and the hollers \nmake it very clear that the American people understand what is \nhappening in too many of these managed care systems.\n  Everyone loves their managed care system until they get sick. Then we \nfind too many instances where managed care becomes mis-managed care.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very hopeful that we can come to a full \ndebate and discussion on this issue. It is a matter, as I mentioned, of \nlife and death in many circumstances. Our colleagues on the floor of \nthe Senate have given these examples. And these examples are not going \nto go away. The problem is not diminishing; the problem is increasing. \nThis is an area that cries out for action, and the American people \ndeserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to carry out a model project to provide the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs with medicare reimbursement for medicare \nhealth-care services provided to certain medicare-eligible veterans; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     the veterans' equality for treatment and services act of 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to rise with my colleagues, \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Specter, Senator Hollings, Senator \nMurkowski, and my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, to introduce the \nVeterans' Equality for Treatment and Services Act, or VETS Act, of \n1998. This bill will give our Nation's veterans greater freedom to \nchoose where they receive their medical care.\n  Also known as ``Medicare Subvention,'' the VETS Act will authorize \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to set up 12 pilot sites around the \ncountry for Medicare-eligible veterans who are either barred from \ngetting care at VA facilities, or cannot afford costly VA copayments.\n  As members of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Rockefeller and I \nworked successfully last summer to pass this exact piece of legislation \nthrough the Senate Finance Committee. We were disappointed that before \nfinal passage of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act our legislation was \nreplaced with a requirement to simply study the matter and issue a \nreport.\n  Well, we have studied the issue and it is now time to act. The \nVeterans Health Administration under the able leadership of Ken Kizer \nhas devised Medicare Subvention payment methods and I have recently \nspoken with Secretary Togo West about our mutual commitment to the \npassage of Medicare Subvention in this Congress.\n  Under current law, the VA will not generally treat a non-service \nconnected Medicare-eligible veteran because they have no way to recover \nthe full cost of doing so. Under the VETS Act, this same veteran could \ngo to their VA for care and Medicare would reimbursement the VA at the \nnormal Medicare rate. Total Medicare reimbursements\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\nwould be limited to $50 million annually. The reimbursement level would \nbe reduced if the VA treats fewer Medicare eligible veterans than in \nthe prior fiscal year. The General Accounting Office would also monitor \nthe operation of the sites and report on any increase in costs to \nMedicare. If the Demonstration Project increases Medicare's costs, the \nVeterans Affairs would reimburse Medicare for any increased costs and \ntake action to suspend or terminate the program. Therefore, numerous \nsafeguards and limitations in the bill ensure that Medicare Subvention \ndoes not drain the Medicare Trust Fund.\n  Mr. President, we should give our veterans the ability to make the \nchoice of where they will receive their medical care. Although last \nyear's enactment of the Department of Defense Medicare Subvention \nprogram alleviated what veterans call a ``lockout'' from the military \nhealth care system, we need to finish the job by allowing all veterans \naccess to the VA health care facility of their choice.\n  In closing, the Veterans' Service Organizations strongly support the \nVETS Act. I look forward to working with them, Secretary West and the \nadministration, and my colleagues here in the Senate and in the House \nto get this legislation signed into law this year.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my \nsupport to the Veterans' Equality for Treatment and Services Act of \n1998. This bill will authorize a demonstration project to allow VA to \nbill Medicare for health care services provided to certain dual \nbeneficiaries. The legislation is known as VA subvention, which is a \nconcept that has been discussed over the years by those of us in \nCongress, by veterans service organizations, and by advisory bodies \nstudying the VA health care system. I join my colleagues Senators \nJeffords, Hollings, and Specter in this initiative.\n  Due to budget constraints, many VA hospitals and clinics have been \nforced to turn away middle income, Medicare-eligible veterans who seek \nVA care. To truly understand the need for VA subvention, I ask my \ncolleagues to couple these difficulties in accessing the system, with \nVA's frozen FY 99 budget. The frozen medical care budget obviously \ncannot cover even salary adjustments required by law, let alone allow \nfor any growth and expansion within the VA health care system.\n  For veterans, enactment of the Veterans Equality for Treatment and \nServices Act of 1998 would mean the infusion of new revenue and thus, \nimproved access to care. For the Health Care Financing Administration \n(HCFA), a VA subvention demonstration project will provide the \nopportunity to assess the effects of coordination on improving \nefficiency, access, and quality of care for dual-eligible beneficiaries \nin a selected number of sites. Finally, Congress would receive the \nresults of this feasibility study, which, once and for all, would give \nus the necessary data to make rational policy decisions in the future \nabout Medicare and VA's involvement.\n  The four VA medical centers in my own State of West Virginia spent \n$4.2 million caring for nearly a thousand Medicare-eligible veterans \nwith middle incomes in 1995. Though this is telling information, I \ncannot provide my colleagues with the truly crucial piece of the story, \nthat is, the number of these Medicare-eligible veterans who were turned \naway from the facilities created to serve them because of lack of \nresources. This demonstration project would encourage these eligible \nveterans who have not previously received care from the Huntington, \nBeckley, Martinsburg, and Clarksburg VAMCs to do so.\n  The Veterans Equality for Treatment and Services Act is designed to \nbe budget neutral. To that end, the VA would be required to maintain \nits current level of services to Medicare-eligible veterans already \nbeing served and would be effectively limited to reimbursement for \nadditional care provided to new users. Payments from Medicare would be \nat a reduced rate and would exclude Disproportionate Share Hospital \nadjustments, Graduate Medical Education payments, and a large \npercentage of capital-related costs. In effect, the VA would be \nproviding health care to Medicare-eligible veterans at a deeply \ndiscounted rate. HHS and VA would have the ability to adjust payment \nrates, or to shrink or terminate the program if Medicare's costs \nincrease. In the event that these safeguards included in the proposal \nfail--an event which the VA has declared unlikely--this proposal caps \nall Medicare payments to the VA at $50 million.\n  A HCFA representative testified before Congress and stated that this \nproposal will provide quality service to certain dual-eligible \nbeneficiaries and, ``at the same time, preserve and protect the \nMedicare Trust Fund for all Americans.'' Although the VA subvention \nproposal is a small effort compared to the other recent changes made to \nthe Medicare program and the changes to come, it is enormously \nimportant to our veterans and the health care system they depend upon.\n  Last year, Senator Jeffords and I successfully offered a similar VA/\nMedicare proposal at a Finance Committee markup because we saw it as a \nway to provide quality health care to veterans who are also eligible \nfor Medicare, while at the same time preserving and protecting the \nMedicare Trust Fund. The Senate later passed the provision, which was \nincluded in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. However, rather than \nenacting a modest VA demonstration project which would yield the \ninformation we need to make rational decisions in the future, budget \nconferees only approved a Department of Defense subvention plan. To put \nit bluntly, veterans got shortchanged.\n  Since that time, VA and HCFA have entered into a Memorandum of \nAgreement which closely outlines the terms by which Medicare will pay \nfor certain veterans receiving care at participating sites in the same \nmanner as other fee-for-service providers and health maintenance \norganizations.\n  I had hoped that the House of Representatives would have acted by now \nto approve a VA subvention proposal. Unfortunately, this has not \noccurred. Mr. President, veterans deserve the opportunity to come to VA \nfacilities for their care and bring their Medicare coverage with them. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues on the Committees on \nFinance and Veterans' Affairs to make this long sought-after proposal a \nreality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2055. A bill to require Medicare providers to disclose publicly \nstaffing and performance data in order to promote improved consumer \ninformation and choice, to protect employees of Medicare providers who \nreport concerns about the safety and quality of services provided by \nMedicare providers or who report violations of Federal or State law by \nthose providers, and to require review of the impact on public health \nand safety of proposed mergers and acquisitions of Medicare providers; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     the patient safety act of 1998\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Patient Safety \nAct of 1998. This legislation focuses on the major safety, quality, and \nworkforce issues for nurses employed by health care institutions and \nthe patients who receive care in these facilities. The Patient Safety \nAct establishes guidelines for hospital participation in Medicare in \norder to protect both health care consumers and workers.\n  Health care consumers need access to information about health care \ninstitutions in order to make informed decisions about where they \nreceive care. This legislation would require health care institutions \nto publicly disclose specified information on staffing levels, mix and \npatient outcomes. At minimum, health care institutions would have to \nmake public: the number of registered nurses providing direct care; \nnumbers of unlicensed personnel utilized to provide direct patient \ncare; average number of patients per registered nurse providing direct \npatient care; patient mortality rate; incidence of adverse patient care \nincidents; and methods used for determining and adjusting staffing \nlevels and patient care needs.\n  Nurses should be able to voice their concerns about dangerous patient \ncare conditions without the fear of retribution from their employers. \nThe Patient Safety Act of 1998 would add whistleblower protections to \nMedicare law. A violation of this provision would make an institution \nineligible for Medicare participation.\n  Finally, the Patient Safety Act of 1998 would direct the Department \nof Health and Human Services to review mergers and acquisitions of \nhospitals\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\nto determine their long-term effects on the well-being of patients, the \ncommunity and employees.\n  The Patient Safety Act of 1998 is a valuable information resource for \nconsumers. This legislation will ensure that the public has the data \nnecessary to make informed decisions about their health care providers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2056. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act and \ntitle 38, United States Code, to require hospitals to use only hollow-\nbore needle devices that minimize the risk of needlestick injury to \nhealth care workers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the health care worker protection act of 1998\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health Care \nWorker Protection Act of 1998. This legislation would reduce the number \nof health care workers who are accidentally exposed to potentially \ncontaminated, infectious blood via a needle stick injury.\n  The Health Care Worker Protection Act of 1998 would make the use of \nsafe needle devices, as determined by the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA), a condition of participation for Medicare. The bill would call \nfor the FDA to create an Advisory Council to establish safety standards \nfor hollow bore devices. The Advisory Council would be composed of \nconsumers, health care providers and technical experts. Finally, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services would be authorized $5 million \nto establish education and training programs for the use of the safe \ndevices identified by the FDA.\n  Approximately eighty percent of all reported occupational exposures \nresult from needle stick injuries, making this the most common cause of \nhealth care worker-related exposure to blood borne pathogens. More than \ntwenty pathogens can be transmitted through small amounts of blood \nincluding HIV, syphilis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, varicella-\nzoster, malaria, Hepatitis B and C, along with other forms of \nhepatitis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nAmerican health care workers report more than 800,000 needle sticks and \nsharps injuries each year.\n  The Health Worker Protection Act of 1998 is designed to reduce the \nrisks to health care workers from these accidents. This legislation \nwill ensure that the necessary tools--better information and better \nmedical devices--are made available to front-line health care workers \nin order to reduce the injury and death that have resulted from needle \nsticks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/08/senate-section/article/S4558-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 554\n\n  At the request of Mr. Harkin, the name of the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings] was added as a cosponsor of S. 554, a bill to \ninform and empower consumers in the United States through a voluntary \nlabeling system for wearing apparel or sporting goods made without \nabusive and exploitative child labor, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 897\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wyden, the name of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 897, a bill to make permanent \ncertain authority relating to self-employment assistance programs.\n\n\n                                S. 1525\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1525, a bill \nto provide financial assistance for higher education to the dependents \nof Federal, State, and local public safety officers who are killed or \npermanently and totally disabled as the result of a traumatic injury \nsustained in the line of duty.\n\n\n                                S. 2010\n\n  At the request of Mr. Campbell, the names of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye], and the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 2010, a bill to provide for business development \nand trade promotion for Native Americans, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 88\n\n  At the request of Mr. Ashcroft, the names of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Reed], and the Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] were added \nas cosponsors of Senate Concurrent Resolution 88, a concurrent \nresolution calling on Japan to establish and maintain an open, \ncompetitive market for consumer photographic film and paper and other \nsectors facing market access barriers in Japan.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 216\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lieberman, the names of the Senator from \nLouisiana [Mr. Breaux], the Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], the \nSenator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], the Senator from California [Mrs. \nFeinstein], the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], and the Senator \nfrom Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] were added as cosponsors of Senate \nResolution 216, a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate \nregarding Japan's difficult economic condition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/08/senate-section/article/S4560-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 226--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n     POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE 50TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE \n                    INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Abraham, \nMr. Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Gregg, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. \nTorricelli) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

On May 28, 1998, Marilyn will be the \nhonored guest at the annual Harry Kleinman dinner, where Democrats from \nWest Hartford and throughout Connecticut will have the opportunity to \nshow their appreciation for a job well done.\n  Marilyn has always been a hands-on Chairman; a tireless and dedicated \nleader who earned the respect and admiration of her entire community. \nBy any measure Marilyn Cohen has been the most successful Town Chairman \nin the history of West Hartford. During her tenure, Democrats have \nenjoyed an unmatched period of success and the high degree of \nsatisfaction of citizens with the town's administrative services serves \nas the best testament to Marilyn's skill as a political leader.\n  Many of those individuals counseled and supported by Marilyn have \nfound success both in and beyond West Hartford, and I am proud to be a \nmember of that group. Marilyn served as Political Director during my \nfirst campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1988. I know for a fact that \nwithout her unwavering support and finely-tuned political acumen, I \nwould not be a member of this esteemed Chamber today.\n  Marilyn may be retiring from her position on the Town Committee, but \nshe will never retire from this lifestyle that she loves so much. \nCurrently, she is serving as Political Coordinator for Barbara \nKennelly, the Democratic candidate for Governor of the State of \nConnecticut, and will no doubt provide the same high level of direction \nand support that has been her hallmark for so many years.

Goodwill Industries Week is a \nnational celebration to honor those who have overcome barriers to \nemployment and become independent members of their communities and to \nhonor the organization that helps make those achievements possible.\n  Goodwill Industries is much more than a business based upon the \nreselling of used merchandise at a discount price; it is an \norganization that is based upon volunteers providing leadership, \nadvice, and assistance to those in need everywhere.\n  Goodwill Industries was founded by Reverend Edgar Helms around the \nturn of the 20th Century under the philosophy of ``a hand up, not a \nhand out.'' Goodwill Industries was officially incorporated in 1910 and \nwas originally envisioned by Rev. Helms as both an ``industrial program \nas well as a social service enterprise . . . a provider of employment, \ntraining, and rehabilitation for people of limited employability, and a \nsource of temporary assistance for individuals whose resources were \ndepleted.'' Today, Goodwill Industries has expanded upon Rev. Helms' \noriginal mission to include people with physical, mental and emotional \ndisabilities, as well as those trapped by socio-economic barriers such \nas illiteracy, homelessness, advanced age, past substance abuse, lack \nof work experience or criminal history.\n  Goodwill Industries has grown from its original location in Boston, \nMassachusetts' Morgan Memorial Chapel into a $1.2 billion nonprofit \norganization with 187 autonomous members in the U.S. and Canada and 54 \nassociate members in 37 countries outside of North America. In 1997, \nGoodwill served over 200,000 people nationwide who needed assistance in \nlearning job skills and gaining employment.\n  As for Minnesota, Goodwill first appeared in Duluth, in 1916, and \nthree years later in St. Paul. During its first years in Minnesota, \nGoodwill provided jobs, low-cost merchandise, and training for young \npeople with disabilities during the Depression era. During World War \nII, Goodwill Industries aided in the rehabilitation of disabled \nservicemen.\n  Goodwill has continued to serve Minnesotans throughout the State and \nhas found ways to remain a successful and a profitable industry. The \nDuluth Goodwill merged with the Duluth Sheltered Workshop in 1979 and \ncontinues to serve Minnesota's northland. The St. Paul Goodwill merged \nwith the Easter Seal Society in 1984 and provides services for the rest \nof the State. With these changes, in 1997 alone, both of Minnesota's \nGoodwill Industries offices combined to process over 40 million pounds \nof donated clothing and household goods for salvage and sale. In \naddition, Goodwill served over 10,000 Minnesotans in need of \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, I commend Goodwill Industries for its continued \nservice to the American people and especially for its commitment to \nMinnesota. But most of all, I want to pay tribute to both the countless \nvolunteers who provide a ``hand up, not a hand out'' and all of the \nparticipants who use these resources to better themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/08/senate-section/article/S4561-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4561-S4562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ANNOUNCEMENT OF CELEBRATIONS OF ST. STANISLAUS AND MONSIGNOR GABALSKI\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to proudly announce \ntwo celebrations of major historical achievement. Our first event is \nthe 50th Anniversary of His Ordination to the Service of Our Lord, the \nPastor, Reverend Monsignor John R. Gabalski, P.A. The second event is \nthe 125th Anniversary of St. Stanislaus R. C. Church, B.M. The first \nevent will take place on Saturday, May 23, 1998, with a Mass of \nThanksgiving in St. Stanislaus R. C. Church at 4:00 p.m. A banquet will \nfollow at the Rt. Rev. Msgr. Peter J. Adamski Social Center, 389 \nPeckham Street, Buffalo New York. The second event will take place on \nSunday, June 7, 1998 at 4:00 p.m. with a Mass of Thanksgiving with his \nExcellency, Bishop Henry J. Mansell, Ordinary, of the Diocese of \nBuffalo. A civic reception will follow at the Hearthstone Manor, 333 \nDick Rd., Depew, New York.\n  Rt. Rev. Msgr. Gabalski, P.A., attended school at SS. Cyril and \nMethodius Seminary Orchard Lake in February 1945 to May 1948 and was \nordained on May 22, 1948 in Buffalo's St. Joseph New Cathedral by Most \nRev. John F. O'Hara. The Reverend attended undergraduate studies at \nCanisius College for math; Norte Dame and Catholic University, \nWashington for adolescent psychology; and at Manhattanville, New York \nfor music. In June 1948-August 1949 Msgr. Gabalski attended graduate \nschool at De Paul University, Chicago for Polish and in 1949 received \nhis M.A. in Polish. He also attended graduate studies in language at \nthe University of Detroit and obtained a M.E. in education at Canisius \nin 1968. Msgr. Gabalski has accomplished many achievements too numerous \nto count and has spent much of his time volunteering with different \norganizations. He was a Pastor of Queen of Peace from June 1974 to \nFebruary 1978. Moreover, Reverend Gabalski was a 16-year member at the \nOrchard Lake Michigan Schools and a faculty member and Director of the \nDiocesan Preparatory Seminary. Reverend Gabalski started pastoring St. \nStanislaus in February 1978. We compliment Msgr. Gabalski with his \naccomplishments with the church and outside achievements.\n  The second event is a great milestone in the history of St. \nStanislaus R.C. Church which is the 5th oldest parish and the 1st \noldest Polish parish in the Diocese of Buffalo. The nucleus of the \nfirst Polish parish in Western New York was formed in 1872 under the \ndirection of the Rev. Ivannef Gartner and a recent immigrant, Joseph \nKujawski. According to the 1870 United States census, there were no \nless than 135 natives of Poland within the city limits of Buffalo. John \nPitass, on June 8, 1873, organized St. Stanislaus Parish at a meeting \nof the St. Stanislaus Society. St. Stanislaus B.M. School opened in \nApril, 1874. On August 10, 1882 groundbreaking took place and in 1883 \nthe first level of the church was built. The founding Pastor was Dean \nPitass and Rev. Dr. Alexander Pitass was the second Pastor of St. \nStanislaus. The\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\nthird pastor, Rt. Rev. Peter J. Adamski, founded an all-girls high \nschool and was succeeded by the fourth pastor Rev. Msgr. Chester A. \nMeloch in 1974 who began construction of the Resurrection Mausoleum at \nthe St. Stanislaus Cemetery. After Msgr. Meloch retired, he was \nsucceeded by Msgr. Gabalski. During the current pastor's tenor, the \nMarian Mausoleum was constructed at the cemetery, a unit of the Knights \nof Columbus was established at the parish, the Outreach Center was \nopened, and the Msgr. Adamski Village with apartments for seniors and \nprivate homes became a reality. We wish St. Stanislaus the best in \ntheir 125th anniversary to be celebrated in 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/08/senate-section/article/S4561-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO DORIS STOCKLAN ON HER 90TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President. I rise today to pay \ntribute to a unique and wonderful woman, Doris Stocklan, of Dover, New \nHampshire. Doris will celebrate her 90th birthday on May 29, 1998. She \nwill be surrounded by family and friends at a party in her honor at the \nAshworth Hotel in Hampton Beach on May 24. Although I am unable to join \nDoris at the festivities, I would today ask that she count me among the \nadmirers who will be wishing her well on her special day.\n  Doris' parents came to America from Eastern Europe in the late \n1800's. She was raised in the Boston area where she met her husband, \nLouis. They were married for 61 years before he passed away in 1991. \nThey raised three children, Stephen Stocklan, 56, of Barrington, New \nHampshire; Maralyn Simond, 67, of Rochester, New Hampshire; and Joyce \nGoldberg, 65, of North Miami, Florida. They also had five \ngrandchildren; Sandra, Melody, Lisa, Lauren and Jennifer; and one \ngreat-grandchild, Thomas.\n  Doris and Lou moved to Dover in the 1930's, where Lou began work at \nDover Hardware. He eventually purchased the store, and business boomed. \nSoon they were able to buy two more stores in the Seacoast, and Doris \npitched in as a cashier and occasional bookkeeper. Steve and Maralyn \njoined the staff, and the operation was one of the most successful \nfamily-run businesses in the area. In the mid-1970's, Doris and Lou \nalso bought The Strand movie theater in Dover. Again, it was a family \naffair. Doris, Maralyn, and some of the grandchildren worked the ticket \nbooth and the concession stand. The success of Doris and Lou was the \nembodiment of the ``American Dream.''\n  The Stocklans were always active in their community, in politics, and \nin their synagogue. Doris' commitment to her community and her country \nstarted when she was a young mother, volunteering for the local Red \nCross during World War II. Doris is a life member of the Sisterhood and \nthe Hadassah of Temple Israel in Dover. She is also a life member of \nthe Wentworth Douglass Hospital, and a 50 year member of the Women's \nClub of Dover where she serves on the Board. She is loved and respected \nby her peers, her family, and all the people she has graced with her \nwarm smile and laughing eyes.\n  There is no one more deserving than Doris of the special honors and \nkind words that will be bestowed upon her at her 90th birthday \ncelebration. I have known Doris Stocklan for over a decade. She is a \nlovely and gracious woman with a heart of gold, and I am proud to \nrepresent her in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/08/senate-section/article/S4562-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4562-S4563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO UNIVERSITY OF UTAH ROTC CLASS OF 1944\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nUniversity of Utah ROTC Class of 1944 which responded to the call for \nactive military duty during World War II. On May 2, 1998, at the \nUniversity of Utah members of the ROTC Class of 1944 will hold a \nreunion commemorating the 55th anniversary of their activation into our \nnational armed services. I believe it is fitting that we honor them \ntoday in the United States Senate.\n  The University of Utah Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) was an \nunique organization. It was one of the few military units which were \ncalled into service during World War II from a specific community and \nwhich can return to that home area for a reunion. Most military units \ninclude individuals whose residences are scattered throughout the \ncountry. Through an Act of Congress in 1916, ROTC programs were \nestablished in higher education institutions across the country. Since \nthat time, they have been an important part of this nation's civil \ndefense--in times of war and peace--training generations of students \nfor service to their country.\n  In the early 1940s, this class trained at the University of Utah with \nhorse-drawn artillery working with an old French 77 millimeter cannon \nand with a 105 millimeter howitzer, new at the time. As a unit, this \nROTC class was first assigned to Camp Roberts in California, for basic \ntraining in truck drawn artillery. Later they were assigned to Fort \nSill, Oklahoma, for further training and ultimately received further \nschooling at the Infantry Officers School at Fort Benning, Georgia. \nAfter graduation from Fort Benning, these young men, whose average age \nat the time was slightly over 20, served as officers in various combat \nunits in Italy, France and the South Pacific.\n  These were brave and honorable men, each one of them. Of the 99 who \nwere called to active duty in 1943, two were killed in action while \nserving in the 10th Mountain Division in Italy. One was later killed in \nthe Korean Conflict. Of the group's original 99 members, 71 are still \nalive. Today, I speak for all Utahns and all Americans when I say, we \nhonor these brave men and pay tribute to them for their service and \nsacrifice for this great country. The Class of 1944's great tradition \nof discipline and leadership continues today as many of its members are \nrespected professionals in the public and private sector as well as \ntheir own communities.\n  I ask that a copy of the unit's activation orders for March 16, 1943 \nbe printed in the Record as part of this tribute.\n  And finally, Mr. President, before I close, I want to thank Chris S. \nMetos of Salt Lake City, Utah, for the outstanding job he has done to \nhelp organize this upcoming reunion and for the many years of service \nhe has provided to this country and to the people of the state of Utah.\n  The activation orders follows:\n\n Activation Orders: Headquarters Ninth Service Command, Fort Douglas, \n                          Utah, March 16, 1943\n\n       1.

Mr. President. I rise today to congratulate the \nColumbia University School of Social Work on the occasion of the \nCentennial of the oldest social work training program in the nation. \nEvolving from a summer program organized by the Charity Organization \nSociety in New York, the School of Social Work has a long and \ndistinguished history of pioneering research, informed advocacy and \nexceptional professional training.\n  Throughout the century, Columbia's faculty, students and alumni have \nworked tirelessly to address both the causes and symptoms of our most \npressing social problems. National movements, such as the White House \nConference on Children and the National Urban League, have emerged from \nprojects undertaken by the school's faculty and administrators in \ncooperation with professional and community organizations. The entire \nnation has benefitted from the work of people like Eveline Burns who \nworks in Social Security; Mitchell I. Ginsberg who works with the Head \nStart program; Richard Cloward who works with welfare rights and voter \nregistration; Alfred Kahn and Sheila B. Kamerman who works with cross-\nnational studies of social services; and David Fanshel who works with \nchildren in foster care.\n  It is a remarkable accomplishment that social workers have played key \nroles in every major social reform movement, from settlement houses to \nlabor reform, from the New Deal to civil rights and voter registration. \nMany of the things we take for granted today such as Social Security, \nchild labor laws, minimum wage, the 40-hour work week, and even \nMedicare came into existence simply because social workers saw \ninjustice. Social workers did not simply talk about the problem but \nthought up solutions to the problems and then implemented their ideas \ninto reality. Social workers are inspirational not only in their \nactions but also in their courage.\n  As Columbia University School of Social Work, and indeed the social \nwork profession, move into their second centuries, they will be \nchallenged to respond to social change, new social problems, family \nchange, and evolving societal commitments. Now more than ever, we will \nneed well-trained and dedicated social workers to conduct cutting-edge \nresearch, administer social programs, and alleviate society's most \nintractable problems.\n  It is with appreciation and admiration that I extend my best wishes \nto Columbia University School of Social Work on its Centennial and look \nforward to its future activity and achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/08/senate-section/article/S4563-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4563-S4600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  (The text of H.R. 2676, as amended, as passed by the Senate on May 7, \n1998, reads as follows:)\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2676) entitled ``An Act to amend the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 to restructure and reform the Internal Revenue \n     Service, and for other purposes.'', do pass with the \n     following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 226, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Snowe and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 226) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the policy of the United States at the 50th \n     Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am offering a resolution today which \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the United States, at the next \nmeeting of the International Whaling Commission in two weeks, should \nremain firmly opposed to commercial whaling and should oppose so-called \n``scientific whaling.''\n  This resolution is very timely and important. As we work here in the \nSenate today, representatives of nations from around the globe are \npreparing for a meeting in Oman later this month that could determine \nthe fate of the world's whales. The International Whaling Commission, \nto which the U.S. and many other countries belong, will be meeting \nthere to consider proposals to end the existing global moratorium on \ncommercial whaling. I think that the adoption of any such proposals by \nthe IWC would mark a major setback in the cause of whale conservation. \nIt is imperative that the United States remain firm in its opposition \nto any proposals to resume commercial whaling, and that we, as a \nnation, continue to speak out against this practice.\n  Commercial whaling has been prohibited for many species for more than \nsixty years, but whaling for some species persisted into the 1980's. \nDespite the partial protections in place for some species, however, \ncommercially targeted whale stocks continued to decline and the IWC \ndeclared a global moratorium on all commercial whaling which went into \neffect in 1986. The United States was a leader in the effort to \nestablish the moratorium, and since then we have consistently provided \na strong voice against commercial whaling and have worked to uphold the \nmoratorium. In addition, we have worked through the IWC process to \nestablish sanctuaries around the world to permanently protect whales.\n  Unfortunately, Norway, Japan, Russia and other countries have begun \nan aggressive campaign to eliminate the moratorium and to return to the \ndays when whales were treated as commodities. In fact, Norway has begun \nkilling hundreds of whales a year in defiance of the moratorium. \nDespite international efforts to protect and rebuild whale stocks, the \nnumber of whales harvested has increased in recent years, tripling \nsince the implementation of the global moratorium in 1986. This is a \ndangerous trend that does not show signs of stopping.\n  It is also time to close a loophole in the IWC rules used by nations \nto conduct so-called scientific whaling to kill whales without regard \nto the moratorium or established whale sanctuaries. The practice of \nscientific lethal whaling is outdated and the value of the data of such \nstudies has been questioned by many scientists who work on the same \npopulation dynamics questions as those who harvest whales in the name \nof science. Japan is the most prominent practitioner of scientific \nwhaling, killing 400 to 500 whales annually. Although the scientific \nmerits of Japan's program are dubious at best, the meat taken from \nwhales killed in the name of science is processed and sold in the \nmarketplace. Also, Japan has reportedly killed many whales in the \nSouthern Ocean Whale Sanctuary established by the IWC around \nAntarctica. In response to Japan's practices, the Scientific Committee \nof the IWC has repeatedly passed resolutions calling for the cessation \nof lethal scientific whaling, particularly that occurring in designated \nwhale sanctuaries.\n  The resolution that I am offering today reaffirms the United States' \nstrong support for a ban on commercial whaling at a time when our \nnegotiators at the IWC most need that support. It also addresses the \ndubious practice of scientific whaling by stating that the U.S. should \noppose scientific whaling unless it is specifically authorized by the \nScientific Committee of the IWC.\n  Mr. President, here at home we work very, very hard to protect whales \nin U.S. waters, particularly those considered threatened or endangered. \nOur own laws and regulations give whales one of the highest standards \nof protection in the world, and as a result, our own citizens are \nsubject to strict rules designed to protect against the accidental \ntaking or even harassment of whales. Intentional killing, including \ncommercial whaling, is, of course, completely prohibited. Given what is \nasked of our citizens to protect against even accidental injury to \nwhales here in the U.S., it would be grossly unfair to them if we \nretreated in any way from our position opposing commercial, intentional \nwhaling in other countries. Whales migrate throughout the world's \noceans, and as we protect whales in our own waters, so should we act to \nprotect them internationally. Indeed, the sacrifices that we make here \nat home to protect whales would be seriously undermined if those same \nwhales could be killed by commercial hunters the moment they leave the \njurisdiction of the U.S.\n  Whales are among the most intelligent animals on Earth, and they play \na critically important role in the marine ecosystem. Yet, there is \nstill much about them that we do not know. Resuming the intentional, \nlarge-scale harvest of whales is irresponsible, and it could have \necological consequences that we cannot predict. While the IWC was able \nto implement the global commercial moratorium, it has not had the \nopportunity to conduct thorough and updated population assessments to \ndetermine the status of whale stocks.\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\nTherefore, it is premature to even consider easing the current \nconservation measures. Mr. President, the right policy is to protect \nwhales across the globe, to oppose the resumption of commercial \nwhaling, and to halt the unscientific practice of scientific whaling.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and any statements with regard to the resolution \nappear in the Record at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 226) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 226\n\n       Whereas whales have very low reproductive rates, making \n     whale populations extremely vulnerable to pressure from \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas whales migrate throughout the world's oceans and \n     international cooperation is required to successfully \n     conserve and protect whale stocks;\n       Whereas in 1946 the nations of the world adopted the \n     International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which \n     established the International Whaling Commission to provide \n     for the proper conservation of the whale stocks;\n       Whereas the Commission adopted a moratorium on commercial \n     whaling in 1982 in order to conserve and promote the recovery \n     of the whale stocks;\n       Whereas the Commission has designated the Indian Ocean and \n     the ocean waters around Antarctica as whale sanctuaries to \n     further enhance the recovery of whale stocks;\n       Whereas many nations of the world have designated waters \n     under their jurisdiction as whale sanctuaries where \n     commercial whaling is prohibited, and additional regional \n     whale sanctuaries have been proposed by nations that are \n     members of the Commission;\n       Whereas 2 member nations of the Commission have taken \n     reservations to the Commission moratorium on commercial \n     whaling and 1 has recently resumed commercial whaling \n     operations in spit of the moratorium and the protests of \n     other nations;\n       Whereas another member nation of the Commission has taken a \n     reservation to the Commission's Southern Ocean Sanctuary and \n     continues to conduct lethal scientific whaling in the waters \n     of that sanctuary;\n       Whereas the Commission's Scientific Committee has \n     repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the scientific \n     need for such lethal whaling;\n       Whereas the lethal take of whales under reservations to the \n     Commissions policies have been increasing annually;\n       Whereas there continue to be indications that whale meat is \n     being traded on the international market despite a ban on \n     such trade under the Convention on International Trade in \n     Endangered Species (CITES), and that meat may be originating \n     in one of the member nations of the Commission;\n       Whereas 1998 is the International Year of the Ocean and the \n     Commission plays a leading role in global efforts to improve \n     the state of the world's oceans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) at the 50th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling \n     Commission in Oman the United States should--\n       (A) remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling;\n       (B) initiate and support efforts to ensure that all \n     activities conducted under reservations to the Commission's \n     moratorium or sanctuaries are ceased;\n       (C) oppose the lethal taking of whales for scientific \n     purposes unless such lethal taking is specifically authorized \n     by the Scientific Committee of the Commission;\n       (D) seek the Commission's support for specific efforts by \n     member nations to end illegal trade in whale meat; and\n       (E) support the permanent protection of whale populations \n     through the establishment of whale sanctuaries in which \n     commercial whaling is prohibited; and\n       (2) make full use of all appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, \n     relevant international laws and agreements, and other \n     appropriate mechanisms to implement the goals set forth in \n     paragraph (1).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/08/senate-section/article/S4600-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1046\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
