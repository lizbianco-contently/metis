Mr. President, this is a morning with a little bit of \nbreak between issues. It is an opportunity, it seems to me, to share \nsome of the thoughts some of us have as priorities. Obviously, when we \nget involved in a particular bill, as we did last week, it took the \nwhole week. Some of the things we care a lot about we tend to sort of \nset aside.\n  I speak this morning briefly on a couple of issues that I think are \nvery important, and are particularly important to me. One is the bill \ncalled Vision 20-20. It is the product of a great deal of effort that \nwe put in in the Parks Subcommittee with respect to revitalizing our \nnational parks. We have had one hearing in the subcommittee. We have \nanother planned for this week. Finally, we will have four hearings and \nthen, hopefully, bring it to the floor sometime in May or early June.\n  National parks, of course, are increasingly well thought of in this \ncountry. They are increasingly popular. Visitations go up. We have more \nand more people taking advantage of the parks, parks that preserve \neither natural resources or cultural resources that have been a \ntradition.\n  We celebrated last year the 125th anniversary of the first park, \nYellowstone Park in Wyoming, as a matter of fact. Unfortunately, at the \nsame time that we have increased our caring about parks, we find \nourselves, according to the park agency, in addition to being $5 \nbillion behind in the infrastructure, taking care of those parks and \npreserving those parks. The purpose, of course, of a park is to \npreserve those resources, whether they be natural or cultural. But \nequally as important, and the second issue, certainly is to provide a\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\npleasant visit to the owners of the park who are the people of the \nUnited States. That, of course, becomes more difficult as this \ninfrastructure needs repair.\n  We are seeking to do a number of things. We are seeking to increase \nthe resources that are available that will be supplemental to the \nbudget money, to the tax money that all taxpayers pay, by doing things \nlike extending the fee period where additional trial fees have been \nadded to the parks, and to extend that for some time to see that people \nwho enter the park can actually share more of the responsibility of \npaying for it. We are also talking about a stamp, collectible stamps, \nsuch as a duck stamp, in which the resources would go to the park. We \nare talking about those people who come on international tours to be \nable as part of their tour to buy a 30-day entry to parks with some of \nthose funds going to national parks.\n  We are talking about bonding many of the larger parks. Have things \nlike streets and sewers, and it is very difficult to keep those up on \nannual budgets. So we are seeking to do that which is difficult since \nthere is no real capital budget in the Federal establishment at work in \ndoing that.\n  In addition, we hope to give an opportunity for taxpayers to deduct a \nportion of their return--the money that comes back to them--and \ndedicate it to the parks, if they choose to. We think that is an \nopportunity to support the parks and those people who care a great deal \nabout it.\n  In addition, we are talking about the management. I think that is \nfair because they have more resources. There is evidence, of course, \nthat management is not always what it might be. The most recent one, of \ncourse, is the cost of some of the construction there that has been \nextremely, unusually, inappropriately high. We are asking that there be \na strategic plan, that is a national strategic plan also revisited on \ndown to each unit, and that each unit have a strategic plan that \ncomplies with the flat plan. That has a measurable goal in it. This is \na large business; there needs to be planning for it.\n\n  We are talking about the concessions--the way that the concessions \ncan contribute more financially to the parks. They are a commercial \nfunction within the park. We would like to see more private expertise \nin the management of these kinds of commercial activities within the \nPark Service. We also would like to have it more competitive so that \npeople who want to get into the business can do that. We deal with the \npreferential right. In addition to that, of course, in order to invest \nmillions of dollars, there needs to be some proprietary interest \nprotecting that as well.\n  These are some of the things we are doing. We are talking about \neducation of the park employees, which I think is an advantage for \nthem. Park employees are some of the most committed people I know of in \nthe Federal Government to their role in the parks.\n  We are excited about that, and hope that can be one of the things \nthat this Congress accomplishes as they strengthen in making sure that \nthe parks are going to be there for us in the next century and, \ntherefore, our kids and our grandkids.\n\n\n                           The Budget Process\n\n  Mr. President, we are also working, I think, as we move on into the \nallocation of funds through the budget and through the appropriations. \nI think we ought to take another look at a 2-year budget. We are going \nto find ourselves spending at least half of this year talking about \nbudgeting and appropriations. Many State legislatures have shown that \nit is successful to do it on a biannual basis. What we ought to do, in \nmy opinion--and we are also joined by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, as well as the majority and minority whip--is that we ought \nto do this on a 2-year basis so that we can do it 1 year, set up the \nbudgets the next year, and have oversight, which is something we need \nto do more of in Congress. I think it is good for agencies. They would \nhave a longer period of time to know what resources are available to \nthem. Somehow we don't seem to be able to get to it. It is a reasonable \nprocedural thing that we ought to do. But, as is often the case and too \noften the case in Government and in this Congress, we have always done \nit that way. That is not a good enough reason. That is not a good \nenough reason. If there are ways we can do things more efficiently, if \nthere are ways we can do things that will produce better results, that \nis what we ought to be doing. I am persuaded that is one of them.\n  We are also in the process of trying to set up a system that provides \nfor more entrepreneurial private involvement in some of the things that \nGovernment does. Basically, we have a bill that will probably be heard \nin the House this week that simply says to OMB to define those things \nthat are basically commercial in nature, that are done by the Federal \nGovernment, and then require under the so-called 876 process that each \nof those kinds of things be made available for private contracting if \nyou can show that it can be done more efficiently that way.\n  The private contractor should get to bid on those things that are \nbasically commercial in nature and be more efficient. We reduce the \nsize of Government, and I think it makes a lot of sense. Of course, \nsome of the labor unions in the Government agencies are not excited \nabout that. The fact is that many of those people would be also doing \nthe same thing in the private sector, and probably would be at least as \nwell off.\n  These are some of the things that we are doing.\n\n\n                   Elementary and Secondary Education\n\n  Mr. President, I guess as an expression of some frustration, I have \nbeen hearing reports of last week's talk about education. I am \nsurprised, frankly, that the national media has promoted some of the \nkinds of things that simply, it seems to me, are not the basis of the \ndiscussion. Yesterday, on TV, I heard them sitting around for 20 \nminutes talking about the idea that this bill was simply to define \nprivate school funding. It is not what it is about at all. It provides \nan opportunity for people to have a savings to use for their own \nchildren during kindergarten through college, an expansion of the $500 \ncredit that is now $2,000 set aside. It is your money. It is not tax \nmoney. It is money that you are allowed to set aside after taxes but \nthe income has not been taxed.\n  But the real issue, and what seems to be missed by most people, is \nwhat should the involvement of the Federal Government be in elementary \nand secondary education. What we are really debating is whether or not \nthere ought to be a set of Federal entitlements set up that would go on \nforever by the Federal Government and would eventually, of course, \nimpede or infringe upon local control of elementary and secondary \nschools. That is what the debate was about.\n  I am surprised sometimes that does not seem to permeate through the \nnational media. Part of that is, of course, because the administration \nand our friends on the other side of the aisle tried to make that \npoint. I guess when we govern and people are involved in self-\ngovernment, as we all should be doing, that there has to be some \nsemblance of factual information going out to people so that they can \nbe involved.\n  I spoke this morning with a group of kids. There is one from each \nState here to talk about Government. The point that I try to make and \nthat all of us try to make is that this is a government of the people, \nby the people, and for the people, and that all of us should try to \nmake that democracy work, to make the Constitution work, to make the \nsystem work, and that we have to participate. To participate, you have \nto have some facts, not media hype, and not show business, but facts.\n  It seems to me, increasingly prompted some by politicians, to be \nsure, that we find ourselves more and more being faced with the \npolitical process becoming something of show business. That is not what \nit is. It is government deciding based on facts what is best for \nfreedom, freedom for democracy, and for the American people. It is \nfrustrating from time to time that those issues that are really basic \nto the decisions get lost somewhere. They get lost somewhere. I find \nthem frustrating.\n  It is interesting, Mr. President, that in your home State,--as it is \nin Wyoming, where yesterday I had conversations--you hear things that \nare totally different than with some you talk with here. It is really \ninteresting that folks at home are thinking about those things that are \nreally important to them, and here we are talking about\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nthe gossip. But that is the way it works. So we all will continue to \nmake it work that way.\n  Mr. President, as you can tell, I have used this opportunity to share \nsome of the concerns and interests that I have having to do with \nnational parks, having to do with allowing the private sector to \nparticipate in many of the things that are commercial in nature in the \nGovernment; talking about what I think is a more efficient manner of \nhandling our budget on a 2-year budget cycle, and using the other year \nto have oversight to ensure those dollars are being spent in the best \nway they can.\n  They complain a little bit, I guess, which is OK, all of us do it, \nabout the lack of ability to really portray and get out into the public \nthe real issues and the real controversies. That is what we are really \nabout here--is talking about different views and different \ndirections. And to the extent that all of us can participate in making \nthose decisions through the political process, which is how we govern \nourselves, then it's important, I think--vital--to have that \ninformation available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3601-6", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a development that is occurring in my region with an \norganization that has long been an agent of change. The Missouri Basin \nMunicipal Power Agency is a joint action agency that provides \naffordable electricity, through its 58 municipal utility members, to \nover 200,000 consumers in my home state of South Dakota, and to \ncitizens of North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa.\n  The agency was formed in 1960 to coordinate municipalities' efforts \nto negotiate the purchase of power and energy from the Federal \ngovernment. In 1970, the Federal government informed public power \nsystems in the region that their growing power supply needs could no \nlonger be met through the Federal hydropower program. Missouri Basin \nstepped in and met the supplemental power supply of its member \ncommunities by participating in, among other arrangements, the Laramie \nRiver Station coal-fired plant, one of the cleanest coal plants in the \ncountry.\n  Over the years, the agency has played a vital role in meeting the \nenergy needs of the region. The agency has promoted integrated resource \nplanning, carried out an aggressive tree planting program, and \ncontinued to provide its customers with affordable, reliable \nelectricity.\n  Faced with a changing electricity market, Missouri Basin this month \nchanged its name to Missouri River Energy Services, signaling its \nreadiness to embrace a new era in which utilities will provide many \nadded services and benefits for their customers. Missouri River Energy \nServices is rising to meet this challenge admirably.\n  I appreciate the work Missouri River Energy Services has done for our \ncommunities and wish the agency the best of luck as it helps forge the \nfuture of the electricity industry.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3603-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and proceed to the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 16, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Treaty Document No. 105-36, Protocols to the North Atlantic \n     Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the \n     Czech Republic.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the treaty.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, prior to the Easter recess, there was some \nrather spirited discussion on the question of NATO expansion, and the \ndebate so far has shown, I believe, that most Senators are reaching the \ncorrect conclusion that bringing Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic into the NATO alliance is the right thing to do.\n  To be sure, there are some commentators who vow they know more than \nall the rest of us and who make a living on the talk shows and in \nnewspaper op-ed pages, and they have been wringing their hands \ndeclaring how awful it is that the U.S. Senate is not taking this vital \nforeign policy issue seriously. How awful, they lament, it is that the \nSenate is not paying adequate attention to this important issue.\n  Sometimes when I hear comments completely off the wall like that, I \nam tempted to say to these know-it-alls, ``Heal thyselves.'' In fact, \nmost of them have ignored the debate that the Senate has been having \nfor months on this issue, and most of the commentators have been \nfollowing something else, maybe an intern at the White House, or \nwhatever. If they had been paying attention, they would have known why \nthe Senate today appears to have reached a broad consensus as to the \nwisdom of NATO expansion and they would not be confusing that consensus \nwith the lack of serious discussion and debate.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, we have been working with the \nadministration leaders for 9 straight months now to fix their original \napproach to the NATO expansion. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nand the Senate NATO observer group have made concerted efforts to \naddress the contentious issue early on precisely to ensure that the \nmajor problems with NATO expansion were addressed by the time 12 noon \ntoday arrived and we reached the Senate floor with this proposal.\n  Last fall, when we began the Foreign Relations Committee's extensive \nhearings on NATO expansion, I gave the administration a clear warning \nemphasizing that there was a right way and a wrong way to expand NATO \nand that, in my view, and in the view of many Senators, the \nadministration was doing it the wrong way.\n  Some may recall that when Secretary Albright first came to testify \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee, I told that fine lady that \nwhile I wanted to be helpful to her in achieving Senate ratification of \nNATO expansion, it was essential that we work together to fix what was \nwrong with the administration's approach and make sure it was done the \nright way. During the ensuing months, that is precisely what we have \ndone.\n  We have held eight--count them--eight separate hearings in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee to discuss and debate every aspect of the \nadministration's plan for NATO expansion. We heard from 38 different \nwitnesses, who testified at some length each, and we produced a hearing \ntranscript that is 552 printed pages long.\n\n  In the Foreign Relations Committee, we had worked with Secretary \nAlbright\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\nto make the necessary course corrections in the administration's \noriginal approach to expansion. I can report now that we have \nsuccessfully made those course corrections. When we finally vote on the \nSenate's resolution of ratification, we will not just be voting to \nexpand NATO, we will be voting to expand NATO the right way.\n  The administration has agreed to a tightly worded resolution of \nratification which includes strict, legally binding language that, \namong other things, requires that the core purpose of NATO must \ncontinue to be the collective defense of the territory of all NATO \nmembers, not just peacekeeping or the achievement of so-called \nnonmilitary goals.\n  It requires that NATO defense planning command structures and force \ngoals be centered on ensuring the territorial defense of a number of \ncountries.\n  It builds impenetrable firewalls in the NATO-Russia relationship, \nensuring that Russia will have neither a voice nor a veto in NATO \ndecisionmaking and that the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council be a \nforum for explaining, not negotiating, NATO policy decisions.\n  It requires extensive consultation with the Senate in the case of any \nproposed changes in the strategic concept of NATO.\n  It reaffirms that NATO does not require the consent of the United \nNations or any other international organization to take any actions it \ndeems necessary to defend the security interests of its members.\n  It requires the administration to develop and to report to Congress \non a plan for a NATO ballistic missile defense system to protect \nEurope.\n  And it places strict limits on the cost to the American taxpayers for \nexpansion, ensuring that our current NATO allies pay their fair share \nof the cost and that the American taxpayers will no longer be required \nto subsidize the national expenses of any countries, including the new \nmembers--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--for them to meet \ntheir NATO commitments.\n  If the administration had refused to accept these and other \nconditions contained in the resolution, Mr. President, I guarantee we \nwould not have the consensus that we have here this afternoon. I would, \nunder that circumstance, be on the Senate floor all this week leading \nthe fight to delay NATO expansion until the administration did accept \nthose conditions, and the professional commentators would probably be \ncriticizing the Senate for holding this important administration \npriority hostage.\n  The consensus is not unanimity. A number of my Senate colleagues, for \nwhom I have enormous respect, still have concerns. For one, we have \nheard some Senators raise the issue of NATO dilution. I am concerned \nabout the dilution of NATO as well, but let's not confuse the issue. No \none--no one--should be concerned that adding these new members will \nsomehow dilute NATO. What we need to prevent is the dilution of NATO's \nmission and NATO's purpose, and we need to make sure that peacekeeping \nand nation building do not eclipse territorial defense as a primary \nalliance function.\n  I believe we have done that with our resolution of ratification by \nrequiring that NATO defense planning remain focused on territorial \ndefense and tied to the security of NATO members, not vague concepts \nlike stability in Europe. There is none of that in this resolution of \nratification.\n  The most important step we can take to stop NATO dilution is to bring \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into the NATO alliance, and \nthese countries know better than anybody else the need to keep NATO \nfocused on territorial defense. Each of these countries spent the \nbetter part of this century, remember, either under foreign occupation \nor as satellites of a hostile superpower. They represent three more \nvotes within the councils of NATO for the view of NATO with a clear-cut \nbut limited mission.\n  Some have suggested that we take steps to curtail NATO's ability to \nact ``out of area,'' as they put it; that is to say, outside of the \nNorth Atlantic area. That would be a serious mistake. The threats to \nthe NATO alliance are changing and evolving. The day may not be far off \nwhen the principal threat to the territory of NATO members would not be \na resurgent Russia but a missile strike or a terrorist attack launched \nby rogue states such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, or Libya.\n  The point is this, Mr. President: Would we really want to constrain \nNATO's ability to respond out of area with disproportionate force \nagainst a regime who dared to use chemical or biological weapons on the \nterritory of a NATO member? Would we want to bar NATO's ability to \nstrike out of area to prevent such attacks? Of course we wouldn't. With \nthe end of the cold war, NATO's ability to act out of area will be more \nimportant as threats to the territory of NATO members change and \nevolve.\n  Some have said that NATO expansion is unnecessarily provocative to \nRussia. That is just plain wrong. NATO expansion in no way threatens \nRussian democracy or precludes building friendly relations with Russia. \nIf anything, it will make it easier for us to maintain friendly \nrelations with Russia, because an expanded NATO will shut off Russia's \navenue to more destructive patterns of behavior.\n  Henry Kissinger pointed out that NATO expansion will ``encourage \nRussian leaders to break with the fateful rhythm of Russian history . . \n. and discourage Russia's historical policy of creating a security belt \nof important and, if possible, politically dependent states around its \nborders.''\n  In other words, what he was saying is Russia will no longer have the \noption, should the temptation ever arise, of seeking to restore its \nhegemony in Central Europe. With that avenue shut off, Russia is more \nlikely to seek constructive options in its relations with the West.\n  Some others have suggested that the Senate require that Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic first gain admission to the European \nUnion before we admit them to NATO. With all due respect to our friends \nin Europe, the European Union could not find its way out of a wet paper \nbag, and we need to face up to that.\n  Giving the European Union a veto over who does and who does not get \ninto NATO would be nothing less than the abdication of American \nleadership in Europe. The fact is this: Admitting Poland, Hungary, and \nthe Czech Republic to NATO is in America's best interest. If it were \nnot, I would not be standing here this afternoon. These nations will be \namong the most reliable pro-American NATO allies that we could ever \nhope for. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that not only do these \ncountries need NATO, America needs these countries in NATO.\n\n  That was certainly clear to me during the standoff with Iraq earlier \nthis year. While many of our current NATO allies stuck their heads in \nthe sand and wiggled their fannies, Poland and Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic did not do that. They immediately and without hesitation said, \n``We will send troops in alongside the American forces if a military \nresponse is necessary in Iraq.''\n  Furthermore, while many of our friends in Europe pursue policies in \nCuba and China--that is, self-serving policies--these countries stand \nwith us in working to promote human rights and to promote democracy in \nthose last few bastions of communism.\n  So, Mr. President, I am convinced that Poland and Hungary and the \nCzech Republic will be among the first to stand with us in times of \ncrisis and will support America as we work to ensure that NATO remains \nwhat it is today--the most effective military alliance in human \nhistory.\n  As I have tried to make clear, through the efforts of many Senators \nwe have ensured with this pending resolution of ratification that NATO \nexpansion is done the right way. I urge all Senators to vote for this \nresolution and right the historical wrongs of Yalta and support NATO \nexpansion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished majority \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is beginning to \nformally debate now the enlargement of NATO. I want to emphasize that \nthis is the ``formal'' beginning of the debate. The real beginning goes \nback more than 4 years.\n  I want to again commend and congratulate the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee for his work on\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\nthis issue and his leadership, and, of course, the ranking member, the \nSenator from Delaware. I note the presence of two other distinguished \nSenators on the floor, Senator Warner and Senator Moynihan. They have \nsome very important views which they will express, and they will have \nan amendment or amendments that I think will be very carefully \nconsidered by the Senate.\n  I do think it is important that we note that this issue has been \ndebated for years. We did have some discussion a month ago. But because \nSenators felt that they needed more time to consider the issues--at \nleast one Senator expressed the desire to actually go to Europe and \nmeet with our allies, meet with NATO ambassadors, go to the affected \ncountries. I thought that was a legitimate request, so some time was \nallowed to pass.\n  But now I think it is important that we stay focused on this. There \nwill be no other issue that will be debated today or tomorrow or \nWednesday other than NATO enlargement so that Senators will have a \nchance to focus, and so that the news media will feel this debate has \nbeen focused, and we can give it the consideration that a historic \ntreaty of this nature deserves.\n  I had hoped that the U.S. Senate could have been the first country to \nvote on the enlargement of NATO. But Canada, Germany and Denmark have \nalready ratified the enlargement by overwhelming margins.\n  I must express some surprise over media accounts which claim the \nSenate is giving NATO enlargement short shrift and we are rushing to \njudgment. We have not. We will not. The Senate should not rush to \njudgment on a treaty of this magnitude.\n  In 1994, in 1995, and in 1996 the Senate explicitly voted on urging \nNATO enlargement. The implications of this issue were all raised by \nopponents of that legislation, and in each case the legislation was \noverwhelmingly passed. But it has been debated and discussed and \nconsidered by the previous administration, by this administration, and \nby Congresses and the Senate since 1994.\n  Last April, I realized how serious this issue was. That is why I, \nalong with the Democratic leader, created a special group, with the \nendorsement of the President, beyond the existing committee structure, \nto make sure that Senators were involved and were thinking about this \nenlargement question, to make sure that Senators on both sides of the \naisle, not on the committees directly involved, would have a chance to \nattend hearings and go to Europe.\n\n  The Senate NATO enlargement group included 28 percent of the Senate--\n28 Senators. I made it a particular point to make sure that Senators \nwho had reservations that had already been expressed would be included. \nThat is why Senator Warner was in the group, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison was in the group. Senator Moynihan was included. And it did \ninclude members from the Appropriations Committee, the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees.\n  The observer group held 17 meetings with administration officials as \nwell as political and military leaders from Europe. Senator Roth led \ntwo observer group delegations to Europe.\n  I want to say at this point that I, too, took the time to go and meet \nwith our allies. I went to London, and then I went to Brussels. I met \nwith all of the NATO ambassadors. I went to Budapest, Hungary. I have \ntaken advantage of opportunities to meet with leaders from the Czech \nRepublic and Poland as well as Hungary to make sure I understood all \nthe ramifications of this very important issue.\n  I think the criticism that we moved too quickly or have not seriously \nconsidered the issues of NATO enlargement does a real disservice to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations. Their hearing record, for instance, \nfrom just 6 weeks last year is 552 pages long, reflecting six hearings \nwith 32 witnesses.\n  More than 20 Senators have already spoken on NATO enlargement here on \nthe floor when it was considered last month. GAO and CRS have issued \nmore than 30 reports on NATO enlargement. More than 1,000 op-eds, \neditorials and articles have been published in newspapers and academic \njournals on NATO enlargement. In fact, just recently I have seen \nendorsements, I believe, from the Washington Post and the Washington \nTimes and criticism from the New York Times. So there has been a lot of \nthought, and a lot of articles and editorials have been written on this \nvery important matter.\n  Let me provide an answer to one of the questions about the timing and \nnature of the Senate debate on this momentous issue. Why is there not \nmore controversy? The answer is the supporters of NATO enlargement have \nbeen successfully making the case for 5 years. The arguments in support \nof NATO enlargement have convinced an impressive array of individuals \nand organizations. Much of the groundwork has been laid. That is why \nthe 1996 platforms of both the Republican and Democratic Parties \nendorsed NATO enlargement. That is why every living former Secretary of \nState supports NATO enlargement.\n  I have made up my mind to support NATO enlargement. I believe it is \nin the strategic, moral, and political interests of the United States, \nas well as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.\n  Later this week all Senators will have a chance to vote on this \nissue. I think they will have all the time--I am going to make sure \nthey have all the time they need to express themselves. I think the \nvote will be decided by an overwhelming margin. And it is a question \nnot only of the security of the United States, but expanding the NATO \nalliance to these three countries. I think it will shape the future of \nEurope for many years to come.\n  I do subscribe to the view expressed by some--I believe Senator Biden \nhas said this--that it is a natural extension of having won the cold \nwar in that it is extending the ring of freedom to those countries that \nwould like to join NATO.\n  That is one thing that impressed me so much. In Hungary, they have \nmade progress toward democracy. They are making progress toward a \nstronger economy. They do want to have better communication and \ncooperation between our military capabilities. They are committed to \ndoing the things that are necessary to help their country as a member \nof NATO and as they move toward full membership in the European Union. \nI think they would be greatly disturbed if at this point, after all \nthese considerations and after the efforts they have taken after the \nvotes that they had in their own countries, if we walked away from this \nopportunity.\n  There are those who say, ``Well, what about Russia? Won't they be \nalarmed by this?'' First, it is interesting to me that some of our \ncolleagues who have felt the strongest against the Soviet Union and \nhave raised the most concerns about Russia are the ones now saying, \n``Oh, well, what will Russia think?'' Well, I think we should consider \nthat.\n  But look at Senator Lugar, who for years has been trying to make sure \nthat the United States worked on its relations with Russia. He is for \nthe NATO enlargement. He would certainly not want to do something that \nwould harm the interests we share in a developing relationship with \nRussia. The bottom line is that NATO poses no threat to Russia or \nRussians unless Russia has ambitions against current or prospective \nNATO members.\n  As I noted, Senator Warner will have an amendment to have a 3-year \npause before NATO acts to invite additional members. There is no Member \nwho is more thoughtful than Senator John Warner of Virginia when it \ncomes to our national security, our military, NATO, and European \nsecurity interests. I do not think that he is right in this instance \nthat we need this pause. I think it would send the wrong signals.\n  I think we can make the right judgment as to how much time should be \nrequired or when additional countries would be invited to join. But I \ndo think it is important we think about that and that we give all the \ntime that is desired to the Senators who want to advance this amendment \nso that we can think clearly about what will the future hold as far as \nother countries that might be considered for admission to NATO and \nwhere it will eventually lead.\n  But we do have unanimous support from, as I said, the former \nSecretaries of State. We have the support of former President Bush, \nformer President Carter, and a bipartisan group of five former \nSenators. I ask unanimous consent that their letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Houston, TX,\n\n                                                February 24, 1998.\n     His Excellency Vaclav Havel,\n     President of the Czech Republic,\n     Prague.\n       Dear Vaclav: I was delighted to receive your letter of \n     February 10 favoring NATO expansion. Though I have no \n     authority anymore, I certainly will take into consideration \n     your arguments when discussing NATO expansion, which I \n     strongly favor.\n       It is my view that Russia itself is better off with an \n     expanded NATO, though Russia clearly does not see it that way \n     yet.\n       On another subject, I was very pleased to see that picture \n     of you greeting one of your Olympic heroes. You look well and \n     that pleases me, for I have been concerned about your health.\n       Warm best wishes from your friend,\n     George Bush.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            The Carter Center,\n\n                                      Atlanta, GA, March 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       To Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott: I understand that the \n     full Senate will soon consider the amendments to the \n     Washington Treaty of 1949, which created NATO, to admit The \n     Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary as new members.\n       Given the strong bipartisan support for NATO expansion as \n     reflected in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote, I \n     hope that through your leadership the full Senate will give \n     its overwhelming endorsement as well.\n       I was initially very concerned about the potential negative \n     reactions within Russia. Like many, I was concerned that \n     forces within Russia who perceived NATO expansion as a \n     reflection of Russian weakness could marshall public opinion \n     in opposition to close ties to the West and to further moves \n     toward disarmament, particularly nuclear. My concerns have, \n     however, been considerably alleviated through the open and \n     forthright way Russia's fears have been addressed, although I \n     realize there are still many opposed in Russia, which may be \n     reflected in the Duma's debate over ratification of the Start \n     II Treaty.\n       I believe it is vitally important to US foreign policy and \n     security interests that NATO remain the cornerstone of \n     cooperation on security matters in Europe, all the more as we \n     witness the continued unrest in the Balkans. Strong, \n     bipartisan support from the Senate would be seen in Europe as \n     a clear indication of US commitment. I therefore encourage \n     all Senators to view NATO expansion as very much in the US \n     interest and give my full endorsement.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jimmy Carter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: In the next few days, the United \n     States Senate will be confronted with a historic vote: the \n     expansion of NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech \n     Republic.\n       We have watched the rapid progress of these three countries \n     as they have rejoined the free societies of the world \n     community. We are convinced that expanding NATO is good for \n     the Alliance and for the United States.\n       It is unquestionably in the interest of the American people \n     for Europe to remain free and democratic, safe and secure. \n     Having won the Cold War, we now have a fleeting chance to \n     secure through peace what we once fought to achieve through \n     war.\n       The Senate has held numerous hearings regarding NATO \n     expansion, all of which have examined the issues surrounding \n     the NATO debate. At least three different committees have \n     examined every aspect of NATO enlargement. Even more \n     importantly, the full Senate has acted on a number of \n     occasions on legislation that would help speed the transition \n     of Central European countries into NATO. The Senate has held \n     several major debates and taken recorded votes as early as \n     January 1994 that demonstrate overwhelming support for rapid \n     transition for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into \n     NATO. The process, therefore, has been protracted, intensive \n     and conclusive.\n       Now, the world watches for a sign of American leadership. \n     To hesitate would send a signal that the U.S. role in the \n     world has begun to drift. We urge our former colleagues to \n     shine forth with a strong signal of leadership by voting in \n     support of NATO expansion.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hank Brown.\n     Alan Dixon.\n     Alan Simpson.\n     Paul Simon.\n     George Mitchell.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I am looking forward to listening to the debate. I know \nthat it will rise to the standard that the Senate has always reached in \nconsideration of historic matters of this type. I think when we get to \nthe conclusion, hopefully by Wednesday, the American people will feel \nwe have done our duty appropriately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished leader and very dear friend for \nhis kind remarks. But I would say that if the issue of sufficient time \nto debate was ever an issue, then it is long since to be put aside \nbecause, as the distinguished leader recited very carefully this \nmorning, the Senate has given a lot of very conscientious deliberation \nto this issue, and now we have had a recess of some several weeks \nduring which a number of colleagues, I say to the leader, and others, \nhave had the opportunity to reflect adequately, in my judgment, on the \nseriousness of this question. It is time that we proceed today. I am \nconfident at such time as the Senate reaches the vote this week, there \nwill be no voice in opposition based on the absence of an adequate \nopportunity to consider it. So I thank the distinguished majority \nleader, and indeed the minority leader who collaborated in seeing that \nthe Senate had adequate time.\n  We have our differences, Mr. President. And I should propound a \nquestion or two to my distinguished colleague momentarily, the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee. But first I think it is important--\nSenator Moynihan and I have joined in our collaborative efforts to \nbring to the attention of the Senate our concerns in the form of two \namendments.\n  I will say, although not present at the moment on the floor, there \nare many others who have joined with us. Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, I \nspoke with him just moments ago. He will be joining in the debate this \nafternoon--Mr. Harkin.\n  It is truly, Mr. President, a bipartisan effort of some Senators who \nspent many long hours working together and discussing this issue very \nthoroughly. There is not to be found in this debate, in my judgment, a \nsingle element of partisanship. It is truly a debate of conscience.\n  For the assistance of Senators, Mr. Moynihan and I will put in the \nRecord today, without objection, Mr. President, a letter from Paul \nNitze, of the School of Advanced International Studies and a letter \nfrom Mr. George Kennan, former Ambassador to the then-Soviet Union--two \nmen who have dedicated much of their careers to the very issue about \nwhich we will be discussing, NATO and, most specifically, its \nenlargement. I ask unanimous consent those letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Johns Hopkins University, The Paul H. Nitze School of \n           Advanced International Studies,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: Your effort to introduce a more \n     deliberate approach to the question of NATO expansion is most \n     constructive. We are in a period of great change in the \n     security challenges for which our country must be prepared, \n     but it is also an era in which we would be foolish to \n     squander the opportunities opened by the end of the Cold War \n     and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n       Perhaps the most important such opportunity is the chance \n     to bring Russia into the community of nations. A sensible \n     policy to support that objective would concentrate on lending \n     political and economic support to the development of a \n     democratic, market-oriented society in Russia. NATO expansion \n     distracts both us and the Russians from that goal. Indeed, \n     the open-ended expansion being proposed for the alliance \n     points toward increasing friction with post-Communist Russia \n     for years to come. Driving Russia into a corner plays into \n     the arguments of those most hostile to forging a productive \n     relationship with the United States and its allies. It is not \n     a sound basis for future stability in Europe, particularly \n     when no current or projected threats warrant extending the \n     alliance.\n       As you and Senator Warner have proposed, the preferable \n     path surely lies in the direction of enlarging the European \n     Union to embrace the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. \n     Negotiations have now begun for the accession to the EU of \n     Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, along with others. \n     Encouraging those negotiations is the most useful emphasis \n     the Senate could give to current trends in Europe. It makes \n     no sense at all to enlarge NATO merely ``to fill the void,'' \n     as one senior administration official described the current \n     process. We should, on the contrary, use the period while the \n     EU is negotiating its own enlargement to demonstrate that the \n     Partnership for Peace--which now has more than 25 partners--\n     is the suitable relationship for European countries which are \n     not members of NATO.\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\n       In the present security environment, NATO expansion is not \n     only unnecessary; it is gratuitous. If we want a Europe whole \n     and free, we are not likely to get it by making NATO fat and \n     feeble.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul H. Nitze.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the World Policy Journal, Spring, 1998]\n\n                        Marooned in the Cold War\n\n(An Exchange between Mark Danner and George F. Kennan, Strobe Talbott, \n                          and Lee H. Hamilton)\n\n     (Mark Danner's article, ``Marooned in the Cold War: America, \n     the Alliance, and the Quest for a Vanished World,'' which was \n     published in the fall 1997 issue of this journal, elicited a \n     strong response from prominent writers in government and out. \n     An exchange of letters between Richard Holbrooke, former \n     assistant secretary of state for European affairs, and Mr. \n     Danner appeared in our winter 1997/98 issue. In the following \n     pages, we are pleased to publish letters in response to \n     ``Marooned in the Cold War'' addressed to Mr. Danner by the \n     eminent historian and diplomat George F. Kennan, Deputy \n     Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, \n     ranking Democratic member of the House Committee on \n     International Relations, along with Mr. Danner's replies.)\n\n       From George F. Kennan: I have read the article twice, once \n     upon receiving it and again just a short time ago, before \n     writing this letter. It is hard for me to express, without \n     pressing the border of the fulsome, my reactions to it. Let \n     me just say that I have seen no finer treatment than this \n     one, both as a summary of the salient features of the conduct \n     of American policy in earlier decades of this century, and as \n     a treatment of the bewilderments into which we are now \n     heading. What a pity, I find myself thinking, that this \n     article could not be given the wide exposure it deserves and \n     allowed to serve as corner-stone for a national debate on the \n     problems and directions of American policy at this crucial \n     post-Cold War moment. To put it briefly, the article is, to \n     my way of thinking, in all respects excellent.\n       That neither this article, nor any other broad and \n     thoughtful treatment of the questions you write about, could \n     serve the purpose I have just mentioned, is obvious. It would \n     be drowned in the cacophony created by the television, \n     computer, and advertising industries which, each in its way, \n     if they were to take any notice of it at all, would do so \n     only in order to tear it to pieces and to exploit individual \n     pieces as over-simplified sound-bites, here today and gone \n     tomorrow. In itself, as I am sure you would agree, what is at \n     stake in this sad state of affairs is a problem of tragic and \n     momentous importance; for the situation now prevailing stands \n     firmly in the way of the creation in influential American \n     opinion of any quiet thoughtful concepts of American policy \n     and hence of any really useful and constructive employment of \n     the great and unique potential weight of this country in \n     world affairs. But the national political establishment, as \n     now existing, has shown itself totally incapable even of \n     understanding the true dimensions of this problem, and much \n     less in tackling it effectively; and one cannot now look to \n     it for anything more than what it is capable of giving.\n       This was the reason why, in one of my books (Around the \n     Cragged Hill) I urged the establishment of a wholly \n     nonpolitical but prestigious advisory body, totally outside \n     the boundaries of the political process, to address some of \n     the deeper problems of the country and to let its advice, \n     conclusions, and recommendations be pondered by presidents, \n     Congresses, state and local governments, and people at large. \n     But never, I am sure, have any of my words ever met with less \n     resonance than did the pages on which that suggestion was \n     put forward; and with this total indifference facing me, I \n     have seen no reason to press it further.\n       So much for the article in general. Now for one nit-pick \n     and a couple of comments.\n       You refer to the Russians, on page 18, as having \n     ``accepted'' the expansion of the NATO borders. Whether this \n     is or is not a correct understanding depends on the meaning \n     you give to the word ``accepted.'' If it be taken to mean \n     that one accepts something highly unwillingly and \n     regretfully, persuaded that one has no other alternative, \n     that is one thing. But if one accepts it in the sense that \n     one has become persuaded of its merits, approves of it, \n     welcomes it, and would not wish things to be otherwise, that, \n     of course, is something else.\n       No one in authority in Russia today would, I am sure, \n     accept the NATO expansion in the latter of these two senses. \n     In the former? Yes, the vast majority would see it that way. \n     What, after all, could they do about it? They could not \n     oppose it by force of arms. The NATO leaders had said that \n     they would not discuss it. They repeatedly emphasized that \n     their decision was final, and that was that.\n       Yeltsin personally would probably accommodate himself to \n     this state of affairs more easily than others would have \n     done. He was plainly disinclined to make a serious issue of \n     it in his relations with NATO, and with the United States in \n     particular. But he too, has repeatedly stated publicly (and \n     most recently only in the last few days) that he could not \n     accept the expansion. On the contrary he regretted and \n     deplored it. And in other sections of the regime, in the \n     Parliament and among the military leadership, feelings were \n     plainly angry and resentful. Neither of these circles, after \n     all--neither the Parliamentarians nor the military leaders--\n     had been, so far as the outsider can see, consulted or \n     allowed to participate in the recent meetings between Yeltsin \n     and Western leaders where these questions of the NATO \n     expansion were discussed. The military, in particular, \n     have felt themselves humiliated and demeaned in their \n     professional dignity by this unilateral decision on the \n     part of the Western powers, and have seen it as a shameful \n     exploitation of a temporary and quite abnormal weakness in \n     their own military posture.\n       The American authors of the expansion, disquieted, I \n     suspect, by some of the adverse reactions their initiative \n     has unleashed, have been at pains to persuade us that the \n     Russians have actually accepted it voluntarily, that they are \n     now quite happy about it, and that it will cause no serious \n     difficulty. The nationalist elements in the Russian public, \n     they point out, consist primarily of older people, now a \n     passing generation, who have never had great electoral \n     support. The youth, they would say, have for the most part \n     supported Yeltsin. And the common people don't care.\n       Perhaps, perhaps. But the military have not yet been heard \n     from. And aside from that, a process has now been put in \n     motion that can hardly be stopped until NATO has come to take \n     in practically all of Europe except the Balkans, at the risk \n     of making of itself a dangerous absurdity rather than a \n     meaningful alliance.\n       But enough of that. There is one more comment that I should \n     like to make. Madame Albright is quoted as saying that NATO's \n     foundation, 50 years ago, ``gave Europe confidence in \n     economic recovery.'' I would have to challenge that statement \n     quite flatly. It was not all the foundation of NATO but \n     rather the Marshall Plan, put forward one to two years \n     earlier, that had this effect. The foundation of NATO was \n     actually a detraction from the beneficial effect that the \n     Marshall Plan was at that time having on European opinion and \n     particularly on the confidence of the Europeans in their own \n     economic recovery. The foundation of NATO demanded that very \n     large sums, which otherwise could have gone into the economic \n     recovery process, were now to be diverted into the \n     building up of armed forces in the center of Europe. And \n     this, a number of us felt, was not only unnecessary, given \n     the circumstances of that moment, but directly detrimental \n     to certain of the positive developments which the Marshall \n     Plan had put in motion.\n       The wider and more lasting basis for my own opposition to \n     the NATO expansion will be visible to you, I think, from the \n     enclosed copies of two of the final pages of my own last book \n     (At a Century's Ending), pages that were written, I seem to \n     recall, at the end of the year 1994.\n       My congratulations, once more, on the qualities of your \n     article, not the least, if not the most important, of which \n     was the excellence of the writing October 15, 1997.\n       Mr. Danner replies: As I sit down to write I must frankly \n     admit that I run the clear risk--as you so well put it--of \n     ``pressing the border of the fulsome.'' The fact is, the \n     beauty and extraordinary generosity of what you wrote left me \n     rather stunned.\n       In the last quarter century, I have read, I believe, nearly \n     everything you have written. To me you became--and here I am \n     afraid I tread very close to that perilous border--something \n     of a hero. In large part, this was because of the tenacity of \n     your principles (a phrase that should properly be redundant \n     but in our world today sadly is not). Perhaps in equal part, \n     though, it was because of the supreme artistry of your work.\n       Of course, I agree fully, and sadly, with you that ``the \n     national political establishment . . . has shown itself \n     totally incapable even of understanding the true dimensions \n     of this problem.'' And yet nonetheless I find myself \n     increasingly amazed by the steady and silent progress of the \n     enlargement policy. I suppose I go on hoping that the \n     debate must come; and yet as the days pass the phrases of \n     our senior public officials simply grow murkier and \n     murkier and the public discussion, what little of it there \n     is, is directed more toward obscuring the underlying \n     issues than uncovering and illuminating them. I wish, for \n     example, I had had the wit to point out, as you do, that \n     in declaring that NATO had originally given Europe \n     ``confidence in economic recovery,'' Mrs. Albright not \n     only speaks inaccurately but manages to falsify a history \n     of competing military alliances and civilian institutions \n     that might well have taught today's policymakers a \n     critical lesson, if they had bothered to look.\n       Now, of course, arguments of frank absurdity hold the \n     stage, notably Mrs. Albright's repeated declarations, as she \n     promotes the expansion of the alliance, that in Europe there \n     is now ``no more us and them.'' There is only one side.'' \n     Many erstwhile critics, meantime, let themselves sink into \n     bleak resignation.\n       I certainly agree, and hope I made clear in my message, \n     that the Russians can be said to have ``accepted'' the \n     expansion only in the most limited sense, so limited in fact \n     that the word ``accept'' used in this way, might as well be \n     meaningless. The least that can be said of this is that a \n     dynamic process has begun, and no one can doubt that it takes \n     relations between our two countries in a very different \n     direction from the one in which we were traveling only four \n     or five years ago. It seems impossible to say what might have\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\n     happened; but I am profoundly disappointed that some of the \n     positive elements of those relations are now very unlikely to \n     be pursued.\n       By the way, I know At the Century's Ending, and its \n     beautifully crafted last pages, very well. Rereading the \n     photocopies you sent has encouraged me to go back to the \n     book's beginning, and I am now happily in the midst of making \n     my way through its pages once more.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Also, Mr. President, I would like to place in the Record \nexcerpts from a speech delivered by the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New York, Mr. Moynihan, before the Associated Press on April 20, \nin which he outlined with some specificity, and indeed absolute \nclarity, his deep concerns. And he put it in a historical context. This \nis a document worthy of each Senator's consideration as they proceed to \nprepare themselves fully for this debate.\n  I will read one excerpt, as follows:\n\n       And there were reservations. George Kennan, for one, felt \n     economic recovery as embodied in the Marshall Plan provided \n     the best hope for peace. The eventual incorporation of a \n     prospering Federal Republic of Germany surely attests to this \n     thought. History is repeating itself, so much that it could \n     be said we are on the verge of fighting the last war.\n       Half a century ago, the Soviets kept their eastern \n     neighbors out of the Marshall Plan, so an Iron Curtain \n     descended across Europe. Five decades later, it is the west \n     Europeans who are not prepared to admit the Poles, \n     Hungarians, Czechs, Slovenians, Estonians, who have made \n     clear their hopes to join a continental common market, the \n     European Union, which would make for a united and secure \n     Europe. Last fall Ambassador Richard Holbrooke noted the \n     irony, ``Almost a decade has gone by since the Berlin Wall \n     fell and, instead of reaching out to Central Europe, the \n     European Union turned toward a bizarre search for a common \n     currency. So NATO enlargement had to fill the void.''\n       Allow me to suggest that wandering in this void we may \n     stumble into the catastrophe of nuclear war with Russia.\n       This would come about not from Russian strength, but \n     Russian weakness. This is an idea we find difficult to absorb \n     and understandably so. But we had better do [that].\n       Russians have been trying to tell us this.\n\n  I will have the remainder of the excerpts printed in the Record, but \nI think as we proceed in this debate there are a number of documents \nthat should be carefully considered. I ask unanimous consent that the \nexcerpts I referred to be printed in the Record, along with the most \nrecent cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, dated March \n17, 1998.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Excerpts From Senator Moynihan's Speech\n\n       The founding of NATO in 1949, then a pact of 12 nations, \n     was an act of rare foresight and political will. Yet, it had \n     its ambiguities. At the signing ceremony, President Truman \n     observed that the alliance was made necessary because ``one \n     of the major powers''--the USSR--had blocked the formation of \n     an international force provided for in Article 43 of the \n     Charter that was to have enabled the United Nations to \n     preserve world peace. By contrast, the AP account of the \n     signing ceremony recorded that the French Foreign Minister, \n     ``speaking in his native tongue,'' noted that the new treaty \n     in no way compromised his country's nonaggression pact with \n     the Soviet Union. Rather, said the French Minister in the \n     words of the dispatch, ``This is directed against a possible \n     future German menace.'' Indeed, in 1966, President Charles de \n     Gaulle, having developed an independent atomic potential, \n     withdrew France from NATO and unceremoniously threw our \n     headquarters cadre out of his country.\n       And there were reservations. George Kennan, for one, felt \n     economic recovery as embodied in the Marshall Plan provided \n     the best hope of peace. The eventual incorporation of a \n     prospering Federal Republic of Germany surely attests to this \n     thought.\n       Much of this history is repeating itself, so much that it \n     could be said we are on the verge of fighting the last war. \n     Half a century ago the Soviets kept their Eastern neighbors \n     out of the Marshall Plan, and so an iron curtain descended \n     across Europe. Five decades later it is the west Europeans \n     who are not prepared to admit the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, \n     Slovenes, Estonians, who have made clear their hopes to join \n     a continental common market, the European Union, which would \n     make for a united and secure Europe. Last fall Ambassador \n     Richard Holbrooke noted the irony, ``Almost a decade has gone \n     by since the Berlin Wall fell and, instead of reaching out to \n     Central Europe, the European Union turned toward a bizarre \n     search for a common currency. So NATO enlargement had to fill \n     a void.''\n       Allow me to suggest that wandering in this void we may \n     stumble into the catastrophe of nuclear war with Russia.\n       This would come about not from Russian strength, but \n     Russian weakness. This is an idea we find difficult to absorb \n     and understandably so. But we had better do.\n       Russians have been trying to tell us this. On December 7, \n     1988, Mikhail Gorbachev gave an extraordinary speech to the \n     General Assembly of the United Nations declaring, ``We in no \n     way aspire to be the bearer of ultimate truth.'' The Marxist \n     promise had failed in astonishing ways. (Thus, in 1996, a 16-\n     year-old Russian male had only a 54 percent chance of \n     surviving to age 60; two percentage points less than had he \n     been born a century earlier!) In the meantime, ethnic \n     hostilities, which were in theory meant to disappear, seemed \n     to rise on every hand. In 1992, Gorbachev spoke to us in \n     Statuary Hall in the Capitol of the problems of Russians now \n     outside Russia:\n       ``One problem which is assuming an acute and at times \n     dramatic character in Russia is that of ethnic enclaves \n     which, thanks to the breakup of the formerly unified state \n     organism are being violently separated from their accustomed \n     motherland, and now find themselves on the other side of a \n     national boundary. . . .\n       ``The situation is aggravated by the paroxysms of extreme \n     nationalism which have here and there generated direct \n     discrimination against minorities. Sometimes this is carried \n     to a point which resembles apartheid. In this situation, any \n     incautious step by anyone, however well intended it might be, \n     can be misinterpreted and used in a way contrary to what was \n     anticipated.''\n       ``Any incautious step.'' As, for example, expanding NATO to \n     the Soviet border of Kaliningrad. Or officials in Moscow \n     comparing the leader of Latvia to Pol Pot, as happened just \n     last week.\n       Also last week Charles Krauthammer, blunt as ever asked in \n     The Washington Post column: ``Is NATO expansion directed \n     against Russia?'' ``Of course it is,'' he answered.\n       If we don't see that, surely the Russians do. This is \n     painfully clear in their National Security Blueprint issued \n     by President Yeltsin on December 17, 1997. It is a 14,500 \n     word assessment of their bleak situation and their only \n     seeming option. ``The former defense system has been \n     disrupted, and the creation of a new one is proceeding \n     slowly. Long unprotected sections of the Russian Federation \n     state border have appeared.'' What does remain and does work \n     are the strategic nuclear forces. And so:\n       ``Russia reserves the right to use all the forces and \n     systems at its disposal, including nuclear weapons, if the \n     unleashing of armed aggression results in a threat to the \n     actual existence of the Russian Federation as an independent \n     sovereign state.''\n       Conspiciously, the Duma has yet to ratify the START II \n     Treaty signed in 1991. In a careful argument against NATO \n     expansion first published in The Los Angeles Times, Howard \n     Baker, Sam Nunn, Brent Scowcroft and Alton Frye termed this a \n     doctrine of ``inflexible response.'' A generation of arms \n     negotiations, beginning under President Eisenhower, all \n     directed against ``first use'' nuclear policies seems now to \n     have been rejected.\n       A Newsday editorial of March 15 began with George Kennan's \n     stark assessment: ``Expanding NATO would be the most fateful \n     error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.''\n       More recently Kennan has written in World Policy Journal:\n       ``. . . what is at stake in this sad state of affairs is a \n     problem of tragic and momentous importance; for the situation \n     now prevailing stands firmly in the way of the creation in \n     influential American opinion of any quiet thoughtful concepts \n     of American policy and hence of any really useful and \n     constructive employment of the great and unique potential \n     weight of this country in world affairs. But the national \n     political establishment, as now existing, has shown itself \n     totally incapable even of understanding the true dimensions \n     of this problem, and much less in tackling it effectively; \n     and one cannot now look to it for anything more than what it \n     is capable of giving.''\n       Now is the time to look to the Senate. There will be a \n     debate. Thanks to the insistence of Senators such as John \n     Warner, Bob Smith, and Tom Harkin, there will be a debate. As \n     of now there is not much doubt as to the outcome. This could \n     change. Public opinion would seem to be changing. As recent \n     Pew opinion survey found that approval for NATO expansion has \n     dropped to 49 percent, with a large undecided element.\n       But should the vote go as expected, may we at least hope \n     that the people and that the ``national political \n     establishment,'' as Ambassador Kennan has it, be alert to the \n     risk we will have taken? We might even change our mind one \n     day. We might even recall that Article 51 of the Charter of \n     the United Nations recognizes ``the inherent right of \n     individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack \n     occurs against a Member of the United Nations. . . .'' Which \n     includes every nation in Eastern Europe. This is grounds on \n     which we went to war with Iraq. It is the law of nations. \n     Concerning which at the General Assembly in 1988, Gorbachev \n     declared ``Pacta Sunt Servanda.'' Agreements must be kept. \n     That is all President Truman intended at that ceremony in \n     1949. The law of the Charter must be enforced. Such \n     ``idealism'' no longer resonates with Americans. But surely \n     it is the great standard we have given the world. Russia \n     included. It deserves our attention.\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 1998.\n     Hon.

O'Neill.\n                                  ____\n\n       Enclosure.\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\n          Resolution of Ratification of Treaty Document 105-36\n\n(Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on Accession of Poland, \n                    Hungary, and the Czech Republic)\n\n     Summary\n       The resolution would ratify protocols to the North Atlantic \n     Treaty of 1949 that would admit Poland, Hungary, and the \n     Czech Republic as members of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO). Expanding the alliance would require the \n     United States to contribute additional funding for equipment \n     or capabilities shared by members of NATO. CBO estimates that \n     those costs would initially be in the tens of millions of \n     dollars and would reach about $100 million a year after four \n     or five years. Ultimately, the United States and its NATO \n     allies have considerable discretion in how to implement the \n     protocols and, therefore, in the costs that would be \n     incurred.\n     Estimated Cost to the Federal Government\n       On December 16, 1997, the United States and the other \n     parties to the North Atlantic Treaty signed protocols to \n     expand NATO to include three new members. Article V of the \n     treaty commits each nation to provide assistance--including \n     the use of armed force--to restore and maintain the security \n     of any threatened member. The protocols, if ratified, would \n     extend full NATO membership to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n     Republic including a security guarantee under Article V.\n       In addition to spending for special national needs, NATO \n     members contribute funds for equipment and facilities needed \n     to accomplish common goals. NATO members share the costs of \n     the alliance's spending for civilian and military \n     headquarters, the Airborne Early Warning Force, various \n     science and public information programs, and the NATO \n     Security Investment Program (SIP) that covers common \n     infrastructure projects, communications and air defense \n     systems. Overall totals for the commonly funded budgets \n     are determined collectively, and individual contributions \n     are based on formulas for burden sharing.\n       Expanding the alliance would entail greater costs for \n     improving command, control, communications, logistics and \n     infrastructure--primarily the activities covered under SIP. \n     The United States and its NATO allies, however, would have \n     considerable discretion in how to implement the protocols \n     and, therefore, in the costs that would be incurred. For \n     example, standards for facilities, equipment, and training \n     cover a wide range. Depending on what standards NATO sets, \n     the budgetary consequences could vary substantially. \n     Nevertheless, NATO has provided some initial studies that lay \n     out basic military requirements.\n       At the December 1997 ministerial meetings, NATO's Senior \n     Resource Board (SRB) presented cost estimates for expansion-\n     related projects that would be eligible for common funding. \n     In that report, the SRB identified costs of $1.5 billion for \n     the next ten years. Assuming that current rules for burden \n     sharing would continue under the protocols, the United States \n     would cover 25 percent of those costs, or approximately $40 \n     million per year. Similarly, the Department of Defense (DoD) \n     assumes that NATO funding will increase gradually over the \n     next four to five years with U.S. assessments for additional \n     military costs reaching $36 million in 2002.\n       CBO's estimate includes an allowance of $25 million a year \n     for the likelihood that U.S. costs would rise as NATO \n     finalizes implementation plans, engineering surveys, and \n     eligibility criteria for common funding. U.S. costs might \n     also be higher if new member countries face difficulties \n     paying for infrastructure or if military plans become more \n     ambitious. In addition, the United States is likely to incur \n     bilateral costs for expanded exercises, training, and \n     programs to incorporate NATO compatible equipment into the \n     Central European militaries. CBO estimates these costs would \n     be low in the near-term but could amount to $30 million to \n     $45 million a year after 2001 based on additional exercise \n     costs for one brigade and two air squadrons every year plus \n     the cost of subsidies for weapons purchases by the new \n     members.\n       Thus, CBO estimates that the costs to the United States of \n     expanding NATO would total about $100 million a year after a \n     transition period of four or five years. Roughly 90 percent \n     of these costs would be charged to Defense Department \n     accounts for operation and maintenance, and military \n     construction. The remaining 10 percent would accrue to budget \n     function 150, International Affairs.\n     Previous CBO estimate\n       The CBO paper The Cost of Expanding the NATO Alliance \n     (March 1996) explored five different scenarios for extending \n     the NATO security guarantee to four central European \n     countries. The scenarios ranged from a low-threat security \n     environment that called for minimal NATO reinforcement of \n     Central Europe to a scenario assuming a resurgent Russian \n     threat that required the forward positioning of NATO troops \n     in Central Europe.\n       The cost estimates in that report focused on the total \n     costs to all NATO members, including the new members who \n     would bear the largest shares of the total. Average annual \n     costs to the United States over a 15-year period ranged from \n     about $300 million to $1.3 billion. However, since CBO \n     prepared that study, the SRB has provided clearer indications \n     of how NATO would use its discretion to implement the \n     protocols.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact\n       Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 \n     excludes from the application of that act any legislative \n     provisions that are necessary for the ratification or \n     implementation of international treaty obligations. CBO has \n     determined that these protocols fit within that exclusion, \n     because they make the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary \n     parties to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949.\n       Estimate Prepared by: Federal Costs: Jeannette Deshong \n     (226-2840); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Pepper Santalucia (225-3220 ; Impact on the Private Sector: \n     Eric Labs (226-2900).\n       Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n  Mr. WARNER. I shall read briefly from it the cost estimate.\n\n       The resolution would ratify protocols to the North Atlantic \n     Treaty of 1949 that would admit Poland, Hungary, and the \n     Czech Republic as members of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO). Expanding the alliance would require the \n     United States to contribute additional funding for equipment \n     or capabilities shared by members of NATO. CBO estimates that \n     those costs would initially be in the tens of millions of \n     dollars and would reach about $100 million a year after four \n     or five years. Ultimately, the United States and its NATO \n     allies have considerable discretion in how to implement the \n     protocols and, therefore, in the costs that would be \n     incurred.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is essential that the Senate spend a great \ndeal of time during the course of this debate on costs. Right now, the \nUnited States spends about one-fourth of the costs of the entire NATO--\nlet me repeat that--the taxpayers of the United States spend one-fourth \nof the entire cost of NATO, a membership of 16 nations, and now we are \nasked to add three more.\n  On each Senator's desk were the hearings in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I will ask a question of the distinguished chairman. I have \nlooked through this, and I suggest at some point today he have printed \nin the Record those references in this well-done document which relate \nto costs.\n  I have to say in all fairness to my distinguished friend and \nchairman, I find very little addressing the issue of cost in this. It \nwould be my hope that the committee could provide such supplemental \nmaterial that can be of assistance to Senators on this issue of cost. \nThe costs range from a low of $1.5 billion over 10 years--that is the \nNATO-U.S. estimate--to $125 billion over the same time; that was the \noriginal CBO estimate. The administration claims the U.S. share of \nexpansion will cost $40 million per year for 10 years. But the March 17 \nCBO estimate cost resolution of ratification had costs much higher--\n$100 million per year.\n  Mr. President, we are embarking here in a few days on a decision \nwhich will have far-ranging implications, not only to the men and women \nof the United States who proudly wear the uniform today and tomorrow \nand for a decade hence in terms of their own personal security, in \nterms of the admissions of NATO--and I will address that momentarily--\nbut to the American taxpayer, who for years, literally 50 years, have \nborne the majority of the costs associated with this treaty.\n  The time has come, I think, that we have to examine those costs and \nthe burdensharing very carefully, and we should do that in the context \nof the deliberation on this treaty.\n  Another document that is on each Senator's desk is legislative \nnotice--at least on our side of the aisle, and I presume a similar \ndocument is on the other side--and it points out NATO's new missions. \nIt is my understanding that the new mission of NATO is a subject which \nis under study at this time, yet to be determined by NATO itself, much \nless ratified by the 16 nations through the forum of the North Atlantic \nCouncil.\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\n  So, again, we are asked to vote on enlargement of the treaty without \nknowing the future missions to which men and women of our Armed Forces \nand the other nations could be committed in the future.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, would you be aware--and obviously this is a \nrhetorical question because the Senator is very much aware--that the \nresolution of ratification has a section, ``The Strategic Concept of \nNATO,'' in which I read, ``The Senate declares that NATO may also, \npursuant to article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, on a case-by-case \nbasis engage in other missions when there is consensus among its \nmembers that there is a threat to the security and interests of NATO \nmembers.''\n\n  Would my distinguished friend not regard that as a huge expansion of \nthe mission and territorially defined role from a specific North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization to a global treaty?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is so correct in his \nobservation.\n  In the course of addressing the press the other day, I said we are \nliterally trying to create, through this expansion and the indefinite \nnew missions, a 911 organization--``Call if there is a problem''--dial-\na-cop, dial-a-soldier.\n  Mr. President, the American public has no idea what is taking place \nwith regard to the expenditure of their tax dollars, with regard to the \ncommitment of their sons and daughters for future NATO service. That is \nwhy it is so important we focus on the very point the distinguished \nSenator from New York raises.\n  There is an amendment to be considered by the Senate, I presume \nshortly, by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft. I am \njoined as a cosponsor. It raises the precise question with regard to \nthe future missions--I think we should pass that amendment--the basis \nof which would be to reestablish the original purpose of NATO as a \ncollective defense of the member nations and not to go beyond the \nborder unless it is clearly a dispute that puts in jeopardy the \nsecurity of one or more members of NATO.\n  I hope the Senate will adopt that amendment, together with others, \nbecause we cannot allow this organization to become a response unit to \nany crisis in that part of the world. We will have lost its purpose, a \npurpose which has been magnificently served for over 50 years.\n  I challenge any Senator to point out another military alliance, \nanother military treaty, that has served the American people, that has \nserved Europe, that has served the cause of peace in half the world \nbetter than this. If it works, it works well; why try to fix it? We \nwould not turn our back on a clear act of naked aggression against \nthese three nations that are being considered for membership. I am \ncertain that there would be an alliance probably consisting of the \nprincipal members of NATO that would come to their defense.\n  We see a similar alliance today in war-torn Bosnia. I, for one, feel \nthat that is a conflict which represents the type of conflicts the \nworld is most likely to experience in the years to come. I just made a \ntrip to the Caspian Sea recently. That region has potentially one of \nthe largest oil and gas reserves in the world, a world which is \nbecoming desperate for more energy resources. But the nations that \nsurround it are still embroiled internally, and with their bordering \nnations, in old ethnic and religious hatreds that go back, some, for \ncenturies.\n  If I may depart for a moment, when I look at the magnificence of the \nUnited States of America, just over 100 or so years ago this Nation was \ntorn apart by a cruel, devastating civil war, but we put it behind us, \nwe have gone on. We took a north and a south and brought them together \nand reestablished ourselves militarily and economically to where we are \nthe strongest nation in the world today. And to the extent that we \nrefer to that tragic period, it is done only now with serious, \ncontemplative reflection on history, which remains perhaps the single \nmost studied chapter in history in contemporary America. I know my \nState, in which the majority of the battles of this region were fought, \nis host to hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. But the point \nI wish to make is that we put it behind us, we reconciled our \ndifferences, and we went on to become the strongest nation in the \nworld.\n  Somehow, that is not an achievement that so many other nations of the \nworld can seem to reach, and they still are embroiled in conflict. That \nis why I certainly am going to join in the debate and focus on this \nstrategic concept of what the future missions of NATO are, and do it \nvery carefully, and hopefully, even if these three nations are \npermitted to join, restrict it to what was a collective defense of the \nindividual nations.\n  Mr. President, I just want to ask my distinguished chairman here, the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, What is his view as to the \ncosts and what are the basic facts on which he relies in bringing forth \nthis treaty at this time to the Senate?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, my response to my friend from Virginia has \nto be in many parts. I just told my helpmate here that we did a drivel \nhere and a drivel there, all formal and official estimates. Before we \ngo any further, I want to get the Senator's question on paper, and then \nwe will give the citations for the various figures. The problem is that \nthe cost of operating NATO, oddly enough, reduces in the early years, \nand then it will go up, and then it will come down again. I want to \nexplain that so that the Senator will understand it and, to be honest, \nso that I will understand it a little better myself. It is things like \nthat. Why don't we get together and get the specific question about the \nspecific figures, and we will give the Senator the responses on which \nwe based our judgment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is a most reasonable reply. I will carefully \ndraft it up, submit it in a letter, and in due course I hope to have \nthe opportunity to debate a response to my letter with my distinguished \nchairman. We will try as best we can to at least refine the extremes of \nthe estimates and the likelihood that we can have any consensus--which \nI feel is unlikely--as to the costs, which I think is a very important \npart of this debate, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. HELMS. Of course it is.\n  Mr. WARNER. Because we are about to commit the American taxpayers, in \nmy judgment, to almost a blank check for almost an indefinite period of \ntime. So we will go to work on that together.\n  Mr. HELMS. We will respond to that in particular. I am not inclined \never to give anybody a blank check for the American taxpayers' money. \nWe will cover every detail the Senator wants to cover, as well as the \ndistinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mr. WARNER. My second question to the chairman is--and he can put it \nin writing or otherwise--I would like to have a clarified understanding \nof what the committee's view is as to the future missions of NATO and \nwhether or not my position is correct that it is undecided, undefined, \nand it is now being considered by the NATO staff and yet to be \npublished. That publication will come, regrettably, long after the \nSenate action on this question of the three nations.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator is on sound ground in wanting to get that \npoint cleared up. I will help him.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair and my distinguished chairman. I see my \ncolleague from New York on his feet.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I first join in thanking the revered \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for the openness with which \nhe has addressed this issue of cost, which has come to be a bit of an \nembarrassment. We start out by hearing it is only $150 billion, and in \nno time at all we learn that it is only $3.5 million. But those are not \nhis fooling with the estimates; that comes from downtown.\n  I would like, sir, to address, just for balance, the question of who \nhas entered objections, expressed fears, or concerns regarding NATO \nexpansion. The majority leader was quite correct that the Secretary of \nState and others have joined in supporting this measure. It was their \npolicy for many years, but it is also the case that the persons most \nresponsible for the formation of NATO and the formation of the \ncontainment policies which NATO implemented, in a far off time that not \neveryone remembers--I believe it is the\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\ncase, sir, that half of the Members of the Senate were born after 1940, \nsuch that many would have been aged 9 when NATO was established. It is \nin a distant time.\n  Following World War II, American foreign policy faced the maniacal \ndetermination of Stalin to extend his effective borders and power--\nsomewhat conceded by the United States at Yalta, in all truth. The \nSoviet expectation was that there would come a day, not far distant, \nwhen Socialism would manifest, with the U.S.S.R. and China leading the \nway to international unity. But the person who put in mind the notion \nthat the Soviet Union will fail if you just contain them, that the \ninternal contradictions are so awful, they can't pull this off, that \nman is George F. Kennan. He was a treasure then, and is doubly so now, \nas he is still alive to bear witness to the aftermath and the \nextraordinary success of his policy. His famous ``Long Cables From \nMoscow'' and the subsequent anonymous article publish in Foreign \nAffairs under the pseudonym ``X'' are part of the history of the United \nStates, not just this particular period.\n\n  Sir, George Kennan has said that expanding NATO would be ``the most \nfateful error of American policy in the entire post-world war era''--\n``the most fateful error.'' More recently, in the World Policy Journal, \nhe writes:\n\n       What is at stake in this sad state of affairs is a problem \n     of tragic and momentous importance; for the situation now \n     prevailing stands firmly in the way of the creation in \n     influential American opinion of any quiet thoughtful concept \n     of American policy and hence of any really useful and \n     constructive employment of the great and unique potential \n     weight of this country in world affairs. But the national \n     political establishment, as now existing, has shown itself \n     totally incapable even of understanding the true dimensions \n     of this problem, and much less in tackling it effectively; \n     and one cannot now look to it for anything more than what it \n     is capable of giving.\n\n  I have the honor to have known Ambassador Kennan for 30 years. He has \nbeen a historian for 45 years now at the Center for Graduate Studies at \nPrinceton. He does not normally speak with such disdain of those in, as \nShakespeare called ``our brief authority,'' here in Washington. He is a \nstatesman. But he says that the persons involved in a moment of \n``tragic and momentous importance'' are quite incapable of doing \nanything but what they have done.\n  That is George Kennan.\n  If there was one other iconic--and I will use that word--person of \nthe age still with us, still active, and in Washington, it would be, of \ncourse, Ambassador Paul Nitze. Paul Nitze, active adviser to President \nTruman at a time when we formed this policy we call containment and \nwhen NATO's article 5 military guarantee, that an attack upon any one \nof us is an attack on all of us, was extended. And don't make any \nmistake about that. That was the beginning.\n  Paul Nitze has just this moment written in almost the same terms as \nGeorge Kennan to say, don't do this. I am going to read, if I may, the \nletter which I received on Friday from Paul Nitze addressed, in effect, \nto me and to my distinguished colleague, Senator Warner. It is from the \nAmbassador Paul H. Nitze, the Paul Nitze School of Advanced \nInternational Studies at Johns Hopkins University. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: Your effort to introduce a more \n     deliberate approach to the question of NATO expansion is most \n     constructive. We are in a period of great change in the \n     security challenges for which our country must be prepared, \n     but it is also an era in which we would be foolish to \n     squander the opportunities opened by the end of the Cold War \n     and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n       Perhaps the most important such opportunity is the chance \n     to bring Russia into the community of nations. A sensible \n     policy to support that objective would concentrate on lending \n     political and economic support to the development of a \n     democratic, market-oriented society in Russia. NATO expansion \n     distracts both us and the Russians from that goal. Indeed, \n     the open-ended expansion being proposed for the alliance \n     points toward increasing friction with post-Communist Russia \n     for years to come. Driving Russia into a corner plays into \n     the arguments of those most hostile to forging a productive \n     relationship with the United States and its allies. It is not \n     a sound basis for future stability in Europe, particularly \n     when no current or projected threats warrant extending the \n     alliance.\n       As you and Senator Warner have proposed, the preferable \n     path surely lies in the direction of enlarging the European \n     Union to embrace the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. \n     Negotiations have now begun for the accession of the EU of \n     Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, along with others. \n     Encouraging those negotiations is the most useful emphasis \n     the Senate could give to current trends in Europe. It makes \n     no sense at all to enlarge NATO merely ``to fill the void,'' \n     as one senior administration official described the current \n     process.\n\n  Might I interject here, Mr. President, to say that was Ambassador \nHolbrooke, and I commented on this in my address to the Associated \nPress.\n  To quote further:\n\n     We should, on the contrary, use the period while the EU is \n     negotiating its own enlargement to demonstrate that the \n     Partnership for Peace--which now has more than 25 partners--\n     is the suitable relationship for European countries which are \n     not members of NATO.\n       In the present security environment, NATO expansion is not \n     only unnecessary; it is gratuitous. If we want a Europe whole \n     and free, we are not likely to get it by making NATO fat and \n     feeble.\n\n  Mr. President, one other question. I see my friend.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could I interrupt my colleague for a \nmoment,\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Certainly.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will ask him when it fits in with his presentation. \nLater on this week, I would like to speak on this. But I have some \nquestions that I would like to put to my colleague. I have had \ntremendous respect for Senator Moynihan over the years, long before I \ncame to the Senate. I think this is such an important debate. I wanted \nto ask my colleague, when it does not break up the flow of his \npresentation, some questions.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I could say to my distinguished friend, I have about \n5 more minutes at the most to comment on the nuclear matters. Then I \nwill open to questions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on the nuclear issue, I raised this in \nan address to the Associated Press, their 150th anniversary, which was \nheld in Dallas on April 20. I simply put the question: Could NATO \nexpansion lead to nuclear war? The thrust of these remarks was that \nRussia is now a much weakened country--terribly weakened. They have \nrecently issued the equivalent of our NSC-68, which Paul Nitze wrote in \n1950, a national security memorandum. In the Russian National Security \nBlueprint, issued in December, describes how Russian armed forces have \nseriously declined, the army has melted away, the navy is rusted, and \nthings like that. But it says, don't forget this. We have nuclear \nweapons, and don't think that we will not use them if our country is in \ndanger. The whole of 40 years of national security doctrine, from \nPresident Eisenhower on, of thinking of conventional forces, of a \ngraduated approach to conflict, of no first use of nuclear weapons--all \nthat is off the table. Not because the Soviet Union is so powerful but \nbecause it is so weak. We can almost feel them pleading in this \ndocument to say, ``Don't you understand our situation?'' Back to the \nhair trigger of the 1950s.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that address to the Associated Press be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Could NATO Expansion Lead to Nuclear War?\n\n (Address by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan at the 150th anniversary \n        annual meeting of the Associated Press, April 20, 1998)\n\n       As some of you may have learned, things are a bit confusing \n     in Washington just now.\n       I have had some personal experience of this.\n       Some while ago, I was most generously invited by the \n     President to a formal White House dinner. Our daughter had \n     never been to one of these affairs, and so off we went, \n     making our way past one Secret Service checkpoint after \n     another, until at last we arrived at the East entrance where \n     a bright young Agent, clipboard in hand, leaned through the \n     car window and proclaimed, ``Good evening, Senator \n     Thurmond.''\n       Next came my birthday, March 16, and a letter from the Vice \n     President which began:\n       ``Dear Daniel:\n       ``I was very pleased to learn about the recent birth of \n     your twins. Tipper joins me in sending our warmest \n     congratulations and best wishes to you. We know that everyone \n     close to you shares the excitement of the new additions to \n     your family.''\n       The more, then, do I welcome this opportunity to talk to \n     people who make it their business to get their facts \n     straight.\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\n       The Associated Press at 150! Conceived by David Hale of the \n     Journal of Commerce, still flourishing on West Street in \n     Manhattan, meeting with editors from five other New York \n     dailies. It happens that at that time there was another such \n     organization, operating out of Brussels. This was the network \n     of correspondence bureaus which Karl Marx and Frederich \n     Engels had established connecting various European capitals. \n     Soon they had a Communist League across Europe, and in 1848, \n     issued the celebrated Communist Manifesto.\n       There is a sense in which the age that followed was a \n     competition between the ideas embodied in these respective \n     organizations. As an early AP correspondent, Lawrence A. \n     Gobright, put it, ``My business is to communicate facts.''\\1\\ \n     To the Marxists and the other ideologues that would follow, \n     facts were merely an epiphenomenon of vast historical forces, \n     which could and should be shaped to great historical ends. \n     That much grief came of the latter is well known. Lesser \n     known, perhaps, is the achievement of the Associated Press \n     and the ideals it represented in large polities in which \n     democratic politics become possible because people basically \n     have the same information, and accordingly, can reach common \n     understandings.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This was the beginning of modernization. We go straight \n     from Hale and Raymond and Greeley to the Internet. The whole \n     world now has the same facts.\n       The transition has not been smooth and, indeed, at times \n     seemed doubtful. There were many reasons, but in essence they \n     were those that Marx and Engels set forth, namely that the \n     transition to a modern world meant we would enter a period of \n     ever mounting economic crises which would eventually destroy \n     the system that created them. For a half century, until just \n     recently, the world has been frozen in a Cold War between the \n     Soviet Union, committed to this proposition, and the West, \n     led by the United States which, well, hoped it wasn't so.\n       There was one person, however, who you could say knew it \n     wasn't so, the English economist John Maynard Keynes. In 1932 \n     he published here in the United States a small volume \n     entitled, ``Essays in Persuasion.'' The whole of the Western \n     world was then seized by a devastating economic crisis. How \n     right Marx and Engels appeared to have been; how hopeless our \n     own situation. Nonsense, wrote Keynes. His thesis was simple.\n       . . . the profound conviction that the Economic Problem, as \n     one may call it for short, the problem of want and poverty \n     and the economic struggle between classes and nations, is \n     nothing but a frightful muddle, a transitory and an \n     unnecessary muddle. For the Western World already has the \n     resources and the technique, if we could create the \n     organization to use them, capable of reducing the Economic \n     Problem, which now absorbs our moral and material \n     energies, to a position of secondary importance.\\2\\\n\n     He estimate it might take until about a hundred years.\n       Well, here we are, two thirds of the way and it begins to \n     look as if Keynes might have been right. The past half \n     century has been one of near continuous economic growth for \n     the United States, and most of the industrial democracies. A \n     story by David Skidmore on the AP wire last Tuesday began, \n     ``Inflation disappeared from the U.S. economy for the second \n     time in three months in March. . . .''\\3\\ We have full \n     employment and steady growth. Other nations that pay \n     attention are having the same experience.\n       Just last week our distinguished Secretary of the Treasury \n     Robert E. Rubin outlined an American initiative to avoid \n     future economic convulsions of the kind that have unsettled \n     Asia. It is time, he said, to update the international \n     financial institutions which Keynes, for the British, along \n     with various Americans, established at the end of the World \n     War II. Time for international financial systems ``to be as \n     modern as the markets.''\\4\\ Which means as the AP would say, \n     to get the facts out fast and straight. Work on the \n     optimistic hypothesis, Keynes would say, and the hypothesis \n     will tend to be realized.\n       A final reference to Keynes. In the preface to his essays, \n     he has this seeming simple, but profound forecast:\n       ``. . . [t]he day is not far off when the Economic Problems \n     will take the back seat where it belongs, and that the arena \n     of the heart and head will be occupied, or re-occupied, by \n     our real problems--the problems of life and of human \n     relations, of creation and behavior and religion.''\\5\\\n       Human relations, behavior, religion Hmm. We may yet long \n     for the age of the General Strike! For, as we look about the \n     world, we see dreadful civil strife, ethnic warfare, \n     religious hatred of the most appalling kind. This is seen as \n     somehow pre-modern, in that much of the most conspicuous \n     conflict seems to occur in pre-modern settings. But I would \n     offer you the thought that a number of us have been writing \n     about for years that it is essentially post-modern, and is \n     not about to go away. To be sure, we are developing \n     international institutions to deal with such matters, from \n     election observers to international criminal courts. An \n     international common law is emerging, along with an ever more \n     elaborate network of legal agreements. And yet, the Cold War \n     no more ended, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, than \n     the first European war in fifty years broke out in what had \n     been Yugoslavia. I got into Sarajevo in 1992; one could feel \n     the future.\n       This comes to us of a sudden, and our grasp of it all is \n     only just beginning to develop. For it was sudden, the end of \n     the Cold War. I spoke to your annual luncheon in 1976, almost \n     a quarter century ago. It was a somewhat sullen talk. I felt \n     we had been conceding too much to the Soviets, and for my \n     pains had just been fired as U.S. Representative to the \n     United Nations. I had previously been Ambassador to India and \n     had left the subcontinent asking how long could anyone \n     seriously suggest that the Russians would hang on to, let us \n     say, Tajikstan. I remarked at lunch:\n       ``Russia, after all, is merely the last 19th Century \n     European Empire left, and it is just as likely to come apart \n     one of these days as did its onetime peers.''\\6\\\n       This, I argued, would come about principally from \n     centrifugal forces of ethnicity, religion, nationalism, which \n     drive international politics in our age. But there was \n     something more; the near death of the universalist Marxist \n     belief in world communism in the Soviet Union itself. Moscow \n     might then have been dispatching Cuban forces to Angola, \n     invading Africa, if you like, but with small conviction. What \n     I was not able to tell you in that talk was that Arkady N. \n     Shevchenko, Under Secretary General of the United Nations, a \n     man on most anyone's short list to succeed Andrei Gromyko as \n     Foreign Minister of the U.S.S.R., had that winter defected to \n     the United States. No such event had ever occurred. An \n     official near the center of Kremlin policy had looked about \n     him and decided that the whole Soviet idea had failed. No one \n     in the Kremlin any longer believed in it, or, for that \n     matter, understood it. Dissolution was inevitable. Shevchenko \n     was kept ``in place,'' \\7\\ in the tradecraft term, for \n     another two years. But his insights and forecasts were \n     available from the first, even if few in Washington paid much \n     heed.\n       This is central. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 \n     took the West almost completely by surprise. We now have \n     volumes like that of former Red Army political commissar, \n     Dmitri Volkogonov, whose Autopsy for an Empire was published \n     posthumously. It describes the stagnant decades in which \n     decline became irreversible. In a review in The Wall Street \n     Journal, Gabriel Schoenfeld writes that we should ask \n     ourselves:\n       ``. . .[W]hat failure of will led the West to behave so \n     timidly, pursuing unobtainable friendship and detente with \n     doddering mediocrities who engaged in the ceaseless \n     accumulation of arms and who recklessly lit bonfires around \n     the globe?''\n       We have never asked this question in Washington. At lease \n     we have never answered it. Instead, we continue to act as \n     through the Cold War is still a central reality of foreign \n     policy, withal there has been a turnover and we now have the \n     ball and it is time to move downfield. How else can we \n     explain the astonishing decision to expand NATO to include \n     three former members of the Warsaw Pact. And only the \n     beginning. As Amos Perlmutter recently wrote in The \n     Washington Times: ``the second phase, sometime at the end of \n     1999, will usher the entry of Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, \n     Bulgaria, and assorted new and old entities.'' \\8\\ \n     Thereafter, the three Baltic nations and after that, who can \n     say?\n       Moreover, the Resolution of Ratification now before the \n     Senate providing for the Accession of Poland, Hungary and the \n     Czech Republic has this singular provision.\n       ``(1) The strategic concept of nato.--\n       ``(A) The fundamental importance of collective defense.--\n     The Senate declares that--\n       ``(i) in order for the NATO to serve the security interests \n     of the United States, the core purpose of NATO must continue \n     to be the collective defense of the territory of all NATO \n     members; and\n       ``(ii) NATO may also, pursuant to Article 4 of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty, on a case-by-case basis, engage in other \n     missions when there is a consensus among its members that \n     there is a threat to the security and interests of NATO \n     members.'' \\9\\\n       Does this not read suspiciously like a license to get into \n     a fight just about anywhere?\n       The founding of NATO in 1949, then a pact of 12 nations, \n     was an act of rare foresight and political will. Yet, it had \n     its ambiguities. At the signing ceremony, President Truman \n     observed that the alliance was made necessary because ``one \n     of the major powers''--the USSR--had blocked the formation of \n     an international force provided for in Article 43 of \n     the Charter that was to have enabled the United Nations to \n     preserve world peace. By contrast, the AP account of the \n     signing ceremony recorded that the French Foreign \n     Minister, ``speaking in his native tongue,'' \\10\\ noted \n     that the new treaty in no way compromised his country's \n     nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union. Rather, said the \n     French Minister in the words of the dispatch, ``This is \n     directed against a possible future German menace.'' \\11\\ \n     Indeed, in 1966, President Charles de Gaulle, having \n     developed an independent atomic potential, withdrew France \n     from NATO and unceremoniously threw our headquarters cadre \n     out of his country.\n       And there were reservations. George Kennan, for one, felt \n     economic recovery as embodied in the Marshall Plan provided \n     the best hope of peace. The eventual incorporation of a \n     prospering Federal Republic of Germany surely attests to this \n     thought.\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\n       Much of this history is repeating itself, so much that it \n     could be said we are on the verge of fighting the last war. \n     Half a century ago the Soviets kept their Eastern neighbors \n     out of the Marshall Plan, and so an iron curtain descended \n     across Europe. Five decades later it is the west Europeans \n     who are not prepared to admit the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, \n     Slovenes, Estonians, who have made clear their hopes to join \n     a continental common market, the European Union, which would \n     make for a united and secure Europe. Last fall Ambassador \n     Richard Holbrooke noted the irony,\n       ``Almost a decade has gone by since the Berlin Wall fell \n     and, instead of reaching out to Central Europe, the European \n     Union turned toward a bizarre search for a common currency. \n     So NATO enlargement had to fill the void.'' \\12\\\n       Allow me to suggest that wandering in this void we may \n     stumble into the catastrophe of nuclear war with Russia.\n       This would come about not from Russian strength, but \n     Russian weakness. This is an idea we find difficult to absorb \n     and understandably so. But we had better do.\n       Russians have been trying to tell us this. On December 7, \n     1988, Mikhail Gorbachev gave an extraordinary speech to the \n     General Assembly of the United Nations declaring, ``We in no \n     way aspire to be the bearer of ultimate truth.'' \\13\\ The \n     Marxist promise had failed in astonishing ways. (Thus, in \n     1996, a 16-year-old Russian male had only a 54 percent chance \n     of surviving to age 60; two percentage points less than had \n     he been born a century earlier! \\14\\ ) In the meantime, \n     ethnic hostilities, which were in theory meant to disappear, \n     seemed to rise on every hand. In 1992, Gorbachev spoke to us \n     in Statuary Hall in the Capitol of the problems of Russians \n     now outside Russia:\n       ``One problem which is assuming an acute and at times \n     dramatic character in Russia is that of ethnic enclaves \n     which, thanks to the breakup of the formerly unified state \n     organism are being violently separated from their accustomed \n     motherland, and now find themselves on the other side of a \n     national boundary. . . .\n       ``The situation is aggravated by the paroxysms of extreme \n     nationalism which have here and there generated direct \n     discrimination against minorities. Sometimes this is carried \n     to a point which resembles apartheid. In this situation, any \n     incautious step by anyone, however well intended it might be, \n     can be misinterpreted and used in a way contrary to what was \n     anticipated.'' \\15\\\n       ``Any incautious step.'' As, for example, expanding NATO to \n     the Soviet border of Kaliningrad.\\16\\ Or the mayor of Moscow \n     comparing the leader of Latvia to Pol Pot, as happened just \n     last week.\\17\\\n       Also last week Charles Krauthammer, blunt as ever, asked in \n     The Washington Post column: ``Is NATO expansion directed \n     against Russia?'' ``Of course it is,'' he answered.\\18\\\n       If we don't see that, surely the Russians do. This is \n     painfully clear in their National Security Blueprint issued \n     by President Yeltsin on December 17, 1997. It is a 14,500 \n     word assessment of their bleak situation and their only \n     seeming option. ``The former defense system has been \n     disrupted, and the creation of a new one is proceeding \n     slowly. Long unprotected sections of the Russian Federation \n     state border have appeared.'' What does remain and does work \n     are the strategic nuclear forces. And so:\n       ``Russia reserves the right to use all the forces and \n     systems at its disposal, including nuclear weapons, if the \n     unleashing of armed aggression results in a threat to the \n     actual existence of the Russian Federation as an independent \n     sovereign state.'' \\19\\\n       Conspicuously, the Duma has yet to ratify the START II \n     Treaty signed in 1991. In a careful argument against NATO \n     expansion first published in The Los Angeles Times, Howard \n     Baker, Sam Nunn, Brent Scowcroft and Alton Frye termed this a \n     doctrine of ``inflexible response.'' \\20\\ A generation of \n     arms negotiations, beginning under President Eisenhower, all \n     directed against ``first use'' nuclear policies seems now to \n     have been rejected.\n       A Newsday editorial of March 15 began with George Kennan's \n     stark assessment: ``Expanding NATO would be the most fateful \n     error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.'' \n     \\21\\\n       More recently Kennan has written in World Policy Journal:\n     ``. . . what is at stake in this sad state of affairs is a \n     problem of tragic and momentous importance; for the situation \n     now prevailing stands firmly in the way of the creation in \n     influential American opinion of any quiet thoughtful concepts \n     of American policy and hence of any really useful and \n     constructive employment of the great and unique potential \n     weight of this country in world affairs. But the national \n     political establishment, as now existing, has shown itself \n     totally incapable even of understanding the true dimensions \n     of this problem, and much less in tackling it effectively; \n     and one cannot now look to it for anything more than what it \n     is capable of giving.'' \\22\\\n       Now is the time to look to the Senate. There will be a \n     debate. Thanks to the insistence of Senators such as John \n     Warner, Bob Smith, and Tom Harkin, there will be a debate. As \n     of now there is not much doubt as to the outcome. This could \n     change. Public opinion would seem to be changing. A recent \n     Pew opinion survey found that approval for NATO expansion has \n     dropped to 49 percent, with a large undecided element.\\23\\\n       But should the vote go as expected, may we at very least \n     hope that the people and that the ``national political \n     establishment,'' as Ambassador Kennan has it, be alert to the \n     risk we will have taken? We might even change our mind one \n     day. We might even recall that Article 51 of the Charter of \n     the United Nations recognizes ``the inherent right of \n     individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack \n     occurs against a Member of the United Nations. . . .'' Which \n     includes every nation in Eastern Europe. This is grounds on \n     which we went to war with Iraq. It is the law of nations. \n     Concerning which at the General Assembly in 1988, Gorbachev \n     declared ``Pacta Sunt Servanda.'' \\24\\ Agreement must be \n     kept. That is all President Truman intended at that ceremony \n     in 1949. The law of the Charter must be enforced. Such \n     ``idealism'' no longer resonates with Americans. But surely \n     it is the great standard we have given the world. Russia \n     included. It deserves our attention.\n\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Charles J.

Finally, just a few comments. Some attention was paid \nto that address. On just last Friday there was an article in USA Today \nin which it says:\n\n       At a speech in Dallas this week Senator Moynihan raised \n     eyebrows when he said that NATO expansion at a time of \n     Russian weakness in conventional weapons and increased \n     dependence on nuclear weapons could cause the United States \n     and Russia ``to stumble into the catastrophe of nuclear \n     war.''\n\n  Then this paragraph:\n\n       ``That's not hyperbole,'' says Michael Mandelbaum of the \n     Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International \n     Affairs. ``If NATO continues to expand, as many envision to \n     include the Baltic States on Russia's border--Latvia, \n     Lithuania, and Estonia--we would be moving toward a hair-\n     trigger nuclear balance of the kind we had in the 1950s and \n     1960s.''\n\n  David Broder had a column last Wednesday in the Washington Post in \nwhich he quotes Jack Matlock, who is the former Ambassador to Moscow, a \nwonderful diplomat, who says:\n\n       There is no question that our decision to take on new \n     members now, when no country in Eastern Europe faces a \n     security threat from the outside, will greatly complicate our \n     efforts to see to it that the vast stocks of nuclear weapons \n     now in Russia are never used against us or our allies.\n\n  And finally, just from this morning's Newsweek magazine, there is an \narticle by Fareed Zakaria, who is the managing editor for Foreign \nAffairs who simply comments--this is my last remark\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\nso Senator Wellstone can ask some questions--he asks, ``Can't Russia \nJoin the Club, Too?'' But he makes one simple blunt assessment:\n\n       NATO could defend the Baltics by only one means, nuclear \n     attacks.\n\n  Nuclear attack and nuclear response. We are right back to where we \nwere in the 1950's, or we will be as we continue this. We have already \nsignaled we are going to move into the Baltic States. I cannot imagine \nthe thinking process that has led us to this point.

A vote could come as early as \n     Wednesday.\n       The measure, a treaty modification, requires 67 votes, or \n     two-thirds of the Senate. It does not go to the House. The \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization was set up in 1949 to \n     confront the Soviet Union in Europe. It now has 16 members.\n       Some opponents argue that including countries once part of \n     the Soviet empire will cost U.S. taxpayers billion of dollars \n     that could be better spent on social problems at home. Others \n     say expansion would alienate Moscow, force the United States \n     into dangerous military alliances and blur NATO's mandate.\n       President Clinton and congressional supporters say NATO \n     should be open to all new free-market democracies in Europe.\n       At least 20 senators have moved from being in favor of the \n     NATO expansion when Congress recessed three weeks ago to \n     undecided when it returned this week, said Sen. Tom Harkin, \n     D-Iowa. Bob Smith, R-N.H., says public support is waning as \n     Americans learn more about what NATO expansion might entail.\n       Supporters say they will have the votes they need. They may \n     have more trouble blocking amendments that would limit \n     expenditures or require a three-year pause before any further \n     growth.\n       ``What's the urgency?'' Smith asked at the news conference. \n     ``The greatest threat is a situation where Russia and the \n     United States are not allies.''\n       Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said Russia's more than 7,000 \n     tactical nuclear weapons--``loose nukes''--should be the \n     focus of U.S. concern. Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., worried \n     that a new NATO would become a ``911 for disorders around the \n     globe.''\n       At a speech in Dallas this week, Sen. Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan, D-N.Y., raised eyebrows when he said that NATO \n     expansion, at a time of Russian weakness in conventional \n     weapons and increased dependence on nuclear weapons, could \n     cause the United States and Russia to ``stumble into the \n     catastrophe of nuclear war.''\n       ``That's not hyperbole,'' said Michael Mandelbaum of the \n     Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International \n     Studies.

Broder)\n\n       With their heads presumably cleared by two weeks at home, \n     the members of the Senate have returned to the issue of NATO \n     expansion. They tried but failed to focus on it in March. \n     This time they vow to see it through to a vote. Let's hope \n     they have their thinking caps on.\n       Before they went out for Easter, Sen. John Warner of \n     Virginia, the Republicans' leading voice on national security \n     issues, told me he could count no more than 15 other senators \n     who shared his doubts about adding Poland, Hungary and the \n     Czech Republic to the alliance. Only if it appears the \n     potential opposition may approach the 34 votes needed to \n     block this questionable action will President Clinton feel \n     compelled to give the American people a clear explanation of \n     the course to which he is committing this nation, something \n     he has conspicuously failed to do so far.\n       Charles Krauthammer, whose column typically contains much \n     good sense, attempted last week to fill in for Clinton by \n     providing a rationale for expanding NATO more compelling than \n     what he called the ``pablum'' and ``rubbish'' offered by \n     administration spokesmen.\n       Cutting through all the State Department boilerplate about \n     ``extending the borders of peace,'' friend Charles says NATO \n     ``is expanding in the service of its historic and continuing \n     mission: containing Russia.''\n       ``It says to the world, and particularly to the Russians, \n     that the future of Central Europe is settled,'' Krauthammer \n     writes. ``The no man's land is no more. Poland, Hungary and \n     the Czech Republic are now securely part of the American-\n     allied West. Finis. And if any Russians entertain other \n     ideas, they can forget about it.''\n       You've got to admire that like-it-or-lump-it logic. But \n     even though Krauthammer calls NATO expansion ``the easiest \n     U.S. foreign policy call of the decade,'' he leaves one big \n     question unanswered: If it's smart to move NATO's front line \n     eastward with these countries, why not do a real job of \n     containment and sign up all the countries in Russia's \n     neighborhood?\n       Secretary of State Madeleine Albright might like the idea. \n     Soon after the first three recruits were invited last year, \n     she said, ``We must pledge that the first new members will \n     not be the last and that no European democracy will be \n     excluded because of where it sits on the map.''\n       Five other countries have been promised early \n     consideration: Romania, Slovenia, Lativa, Estonia and \n     Lithuania. Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Slovakia won't be \n     far behind. And why not Ukraine and other former Soviet \n     republics struggling for democracy? That would be containment \n     with a capital C.\n       Only two problems. Pull out a map and ask yourself how the \n     United States and its allies would guarantee these new NATO \n     members that an attack on their territory from any source \n     would be dealt with exactly as if it were an attack on Paris, \n     London or Chicago. That pledge has made NATO the most \n     successful military alliance of this century. It should not \n     be given lightly, especially if you agree with Krauthammer \n     that Russia may no longer be communist but is still a major \n     power that inevitably will seek to dominate its own region.\n       None of the current NATO countries envisages sending its \n     ground troops to fight on this vastly enlarged frontier. The \n     security guarantee will have to be underwritten by America's \n     nuclear force--a prospect that assuredly will motivate Russia \n     to maintain its own nuclear weapons, rather than join us in \n     scaling them down.\n       More broadly, a policy of aggressive containment will \n     inevitably be seen by Russians as threatening. Boris Yeltsin \n     has gone along so far, grudgingly accepting a Clinton policy \n     that effectively bars Russia from NATO membership but creates \n     a fig leaf NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, which \n     Albright promises ``gives Russia no opportunity to dilute, \n     delay or block NATO decisions.'' In his current weakness, \n     Yeltsin has no alternative.\n       But Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of the former president \n     and a student of Russian foreign policy, has documented \n     scores of statements by leading Russian figures, both \n     democrats and hard-liners, expressing anger at NATO \n     expansion. Even a moderate such as Grigory Yavlinsky has \n     declared, ``It is absurd to believe in NATO's peaceful \n     intentions.''\n       Jack Matlock, the former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, says, \n     ``There is no question that our decision to take on new \n     members now, when no country in Eastern Europe faces a \n     security threat from the outside, will greatly complicate our \n     efforts to see to it that the vast stocks of nuclear weapons \n     now in Russia are never used against us or our allies.''\n       Think, senators; think. And force Clinton to address these \n     issues.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From Newsweek, May 4, 1998]\n\n    Can't Russia Join the Club, too?--If the NATO Alliance Is About \n    Strengthening Democracy, the Troubled Nation Should Get Its Own \n                               Invitation\n\n                          (By Fareed Zakaria)\n\n       The expansion of NATO is a foregone conclusion.

Expansion, the \n     Clinton administration has stressed, is an ongoing policy \n     that could result in many new members. That will further \n     change the essential nature of the alliance, moving it from a \n     tight military camp to a larger crisis-solving and democracy-\n     strengthening organization. In this new context, Russian \n     participation becomes indispensable.\n       Few alliances survive victory. After having come together \n     to defeat Napoleon, the Quadruple Alliance soon fell apart in \n     the 1820s and 1830s. NATO has done better. It still exists, \n     has a large bureaucracy, conducts military maneuvers and is \n     used by the United States as its preferred military outfit \n     when force is\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\n     required. But its core function--defending its members from \n     Soviet attack--is dead; as dead as the Soviet Union.\n       The United States still has many problems dealing with \n     Russia, but they stem from Russian weakness rather than \n     strength. Russia's economy today is slightly more than half \n     the size it was 15 years ago, and has declined for five \n     straight years. Its military is in ruins, with salaries, food \n     and medicine in scarce supply, let alone modern tanks and \n     aircraft.\n       Additionally, Russia's new borders are farther away from \n     those of NATO members--including the new countries of Central \n     Europe--than they have been for 300 years. Yet NATO has \n     responded to this precipitous decline in Russian power and \n     its diminished imperial intentions by bulking up and getting \n     closer. The administration has given a wink and a nod to the \n     Baltic states, which want to be next in the club. Their \n     membership would almost certainly end any pretense of \n     credible security guarantees: NATO could defend the Baltics \n     by only one means--nuclear attack.\n       All this is old thinking, we are told by the Clinton \n     administration. The new NATO is meant to deal with the new \n     world. Precisely because there are no longer actual threats \n     to the security of Western Europe and other members, the \n     alliance must deal with those threats that exist--whether in \n     Bosnia or the Middle East--which require a new, expanded \n     alliance. ``NATO must go out of area or out of business,'' \n     says Sen. Richard Lugar. This turns NATO into a kind of off-\n     the-shelf army that might be used when its members can agree. \n     But as the war in Bosnia bloodily proved, NATO members can't \n     really agree on much. Out of area--in Libya, Iran, Iraq, the \n     peace process, China--the United States and Europe are out of \n     sync.\n       Hence, when the United States wants to use military force, \n     it will try to get NATO support. If not, it will go alone. \n     And if it gets a few NATO countries and a few non-NATO ones \n     to come along, it will construct a ``coalition of the \n     willing.'' So how exactly is the new, improved NATO helping \n     here? If global problem-solving is NATO's new mission, it can \n     work only with the cooperation of other great powers--\n     principally Russia, which straddles two continents and has \n     the world's second largest nuclear arsenal and a veto in the \n     Security Council. To try to construct an international \n     security system and leave Russia out because it lost the cold \n     war contradicts the most simple rule of strategy for the \n     victorious. Written across the first page of Churchill's \n     magnificent history of World War II is the four-line ``moral \n     of the work,'' which reads: ``In War--Resolution; In Defeat--\n     Defiance; In Victory--Magnanimity; In Peace--Goodwill.'' The \n     last time a losing power was excluded from the new order was \n     Germany in 1918, and things didn't turn out so well.\n       There is, finally, the moral argument. We are told that the \n     countries of Central Europe deserve to be recognized as full-\n     fledged members of the West, and their fledgling democracies \n     supported and strengthened. But if one of NATO's new goals is \n     to strengthen democracy, then surely its place lies with the \n     most important democratic experiment taking place on the \n     European continent--in Russia. The Czech Republic, Poland and \n     Hungary are in no real danger of backsliding on democracy. \n     What they need is access to West European markets. Membership \n     in the European Union, not NATO, can alone solve that \n     problem. But the fate of Russian democracy is in the balance, \n     and the outcome will have enormous consequences for the \n     democratic idea everywhere and for peace in Europe. Why not \n     help where help is needed?\n       As for belonging to ``the West,'' Central Europe has many \n     cultural affinities with Western Europe, but surely they are \n     matched by those of Russia. Which has made a larger \n     contribution to European culture: Hungary or the land of \n     Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Pushkin, Prokofiev, Kandinsky and \n     Shostakovich? Bringing Russia firmly into the West is a goal \n     worthy of the United States--and its Senate.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Senator Wellstone is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I came to the floor because I had just \ncome back and was in my office and I heard my colleague talk about the \nwisdom of George Kennan. I associate myself with his remarks. I have \nsaid on the floor before that my father was a Jewish immigrant who fled \nRussia. He had a chance to meet with George Kennan on a number of \ndifferent occasions. He always marveled at Kennan's command of the \nlanguage. My father also was always so respectful of his wisdom.\n  George Kennan has argued that this could, indeed, be a fateful \ndecision. I want to, first of all, ask Senator Moynihan whether or not \nhe believes that we run the risk--I know he has talked about this--\nwhether or not he believes that we run the risk of really poisoning \nrelations with Russia and playing into the hands of the militaristic \nforces in Russia? Susan Eisenhower talks about a visit that she had \nwith Gorbachev and that Gorbachev was deeply disturbed by NATO \nexpansion. I quote what Gorbachev had to say to Susan Eisenhower. \n``Russia has been swindled,'' he asserted, ``and it is feeding into the \nwild ideas of those who hold `conspiracy' theories, that the West is \nintent not only on the Soviet Union's demise but also Russia's. NATO \nexpansion has poisoned the atmosphere of trust.''\n  I have two questions for my colleague. Do you believe that that is, \nindeed, the mistake that Kennan is talking about?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Needlessly risking poisoning relations with Russia? \nAnd second, can my colleague discern what are the reasons for doing \nthat as opposed to the expansion of the European Union? I am trying to \nfind--I am puzzled by this. Why are we doing this at this time in the \nhistory of our country and the world?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would like to respond first to the absolutely \nessential question Senator Wellstone has put, or so I judge, in the \ncontext of Mr. Gorbachev's response to Susan Eisenhower. That all takes \nplace in the context of the reunification of Germany when the wall came \ndown and western Germany moved into eastern Germany. There was a clear \nunderstanding that that is as far as NATO would go. That is why I \nbelieve the word ``swindled'' was used.\n  Now I would like to make a point which I know my friend would \nsympathize with, and I think his father might sympathize with, which is \nto say this: That the Russians have the right to claim that they freed \ntheir own country from the horrors of a decayed Marxist-Leninist \ndictatorship. It was not always such in Russia.\n  I have, Mr. President, a certain advantage which comes with age. \nThere are not many others. But when I grew up in New York City, \nAlexander Kerensky would come around to speak to our high school \nclasses from time to time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Kerensky, the ``Social Democrat.''\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Social Democrat. So I had the opportunity to learn \nearly in life--which most people never seem to recall--there wasn't one \nRussian revolution, there were two. There was a democratic revolution, \na provisional government came in, recognizable Social Democrats, as we \nsay, and they were overthrown by the Bolsheviks. All right, now, in \nturn, the Bolsheviks have been overthrown. The Russians have a right to \nsay, ``we are back on course.''\n  There was a rather striking meeting of Woodrow Wilson's Cabinet in \nWashington in the spring of 1917 after this first Russian revolution. I \nknow my friend would be interested in this. On March 20, 1917, before \nthe United States had entered the war, the cabinet was called together \nfor a discussion on ``the question of war with Germany and the \nabandonment of the policy of neutrality'' as Secretary of State Robert \nLansing wrote in a memorandum of the Cabinet meeting. They were very \nclear that war was coming with Germany and the President asked the \ncabinet if he showed call for a meeting of Congress to so declare. And \nthen Lancing had this comment. He said:\n\n       I said that the revolution in Russia, which appeared to be \n     successful, had removed the one objection to affirming that \n     the European war was a war between democracy and absolutism.\n\n  We welcomed the Mensheviks, the Social Democrats, and we said--I will \nsay that once again. Here it is 1917, the United States is about to get \ninto the First World War--and the Second World War is just an extension \nof the first--and the Secretary of State believed ``that the revolution \nin Russia, which appeared to be successful, had removed the one \nobjection to affirming that the European war was a war between \ndemocracy and absolutism.''\n  Do we want to put that in jeopardy? Don't we want the Russians to be \nable to say, ``We are back where we were at the beginning of the \ncentury; we have a democratic tradition, not a perfect one, but we have \none, we were moving there, and the Bolsheviks just stole it; we \nliberated Poland and we liberated the Baltic States that Stalin had \nseized; we have done things for which the world ought to sort of say \nthank you.''\n  I spent most of my adult life thinking would we go to war with the \nSoviet Union this week or next week. It is a bit late in life that that \nprospect declined and has gone away, until now.\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\nWouldn't the Senator agree that the Russian people and their leaders \nhave something of which to be proud?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New York \nthat--and I appreciate his historical perspective, because this is \ngoing to be a very important debate; this is a very important debate. \nWe are going to be making a decision on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nthat is going to crucially define the quality or lack of quality of \nlives of people throughout the world, because what happens in Russia is \nkey to what happens in Europe and key to what happens with our children \nand our grandchildren.\n  My colleague is absolutely right. Kerensky was a democrat, overturned \nand then the Bolsheviks came in, Lenin and the Bolsheviks.\n  I say to my colleague, my father, who was almost 50 when I was born, \ncame to this country. He fled czarist Russia. He was born in the \nUkraine, Odessa, trying to stay one step ahead of the pogroms, where \nbasically soldiers would come in and destroy my dad's dad's business \nbecause he was Jewish. My dad fled the country at the age of 17 in \n1914, 3 years before the revolution. Then he was going to go back. He \nwas excited because it looked like the czar had been overthrown and \nthere would be democracy. Then his parents wrote him and said, ``Don't \ncome back, the Communists have taken over.'' My father never saw his \nfamily again.\n  When Sheila and I finally visited--I wish my dad could have gone back \nto Russia after the democracy forces were able to succeed--it was clear \nto me that all his family was murdered during the Stalin years.\n  What has happened is that finally what we have is no longer a Soviet \nUnion. We have the democracy forces and, I say to my colleague, Senator \nMoynihan, let's just talk about Dr. Arbatov, who was involved in the \nSTART I negotiations in Geneva and served as consultant through all the \nRussian-American arms control issues. You talked about your concern \nover the direction this takes us with the risk of nuclear war, \nincluding START II and the CFE treaties. Dr. Arbatov has said, and I \nwill read the end of his quote:\n\n       At best, NATO expansion to the east--\n\n  Right up to the border--\n     is regarded in Russia as a mistaken policy. At worst, it is \n     regarded as the consummation of the ``grand design'' to \n     encircle and isolate Russia, establishing strategic \n     superiority and finally destroying Russia, ending once and \n     for all Russia's role as a European power.\n\n  Let me finish with this quote. Dr. Arbatov, by the way, is a leader \nof the democracy forces. That is what he is about. The people whom I \ntalked with in Russia, the people whom I believe the American citizens \nare most committed to are the democracy forces. They are deathly afraid \nof what is about to happen if we adopt this agreement.\n  Let me quote Dr. Arbatov again:\n\n       NATO expansion will plant a permanent seed of mistrust \n     between the United States and Russia. It will worsen \n     everything from nuclear arms control to policies in Iraq and \n     Iran. It will push Moscow into alliance with China and rogue \n     regimes.\n\n  I say to my colleague, yes, I think this undercuts the democracy \nforces, and it also undercuts a people who are proud of overthrowing \ncommunism and are now trying to build a market economy and build a \ndemocracy and who had no inkling whatsoever that what we would now do \nis expand what is a military alliance eastern right up to their border \nand redivide Europe.\n  This is exactly the opposite of what they thought would happen. The \nEuropean Union, that is where we should be using our leverage as a \nnation--expand the European Union. That is about markets, that is about \ndemocracy. But I fear that people in Russia feel betrayed by this, and \nI am even more frightened that the very forces that we do not want to \nsee in power in a post-Yeltsin Russia--and there will be a post-Yeltsin \nRussia--will come into ascendancy as a result of this. This is a very, \nI think, serious mistake we are about to make.\n  I ask my colleague this question. One American scholar has defined \nNATO expansion as ``a bad idea whose time has come.''\n  Can my colleague explain to me why this is--I think it is a bad idea. \nWhy has its time come? Why are we doing this? In other words, we know \nwhat the risk is. We know that this is a real risk for democracy in \nRussia. We know that this is a real risk for arms agreements. We know \nthis is a real risk in perhaps setting off just the opposite of what \nall of us hope for, which is the use of nuclear weapons, the \nunthinkable. We know what the risks are--poisoning relations with \nRussia, instability in Europe. So the question is, why are we doing \nthis? Why are we expanding a military alliance? Is there a military \nthreat?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would like to say here that we have an element of \ncandor that is not always forthcoming in these matters. Ambassador \nHolbrooke said, what? Because Brussels won't expand the European Union, \nNATO expansion must fill a void. Is it filling a void because they \ncannot agree on a common agricultural policy in Europe? So filling a \nvoid to bring back the prospect of nuclear war, is that worth it? I \nknow there are a lot of farmers in Poland. Well, there are a lot of \nfarmers in Spain, too, and Ireland, too, and they got into the European \nUnion and they have lived through it.\n  The Europeans owe us something. Half--half--the defense outlays of \nthe United States for the last half century, Mr. President, have gone \nto protect Europe. I was there. I was called back in the Navy when the \nKorean War broke out for service in Europe in case that conflict became \nglobal. Oh, the ruin. But we, by God, were there, and the submarine \npens the British had managed to get a few bombs through, just testing. \nWe saved those people. And now because the common agricultural policy \nwould be a little bit inconvenient for them, we are proposing to expand \nNATO as a surrogate. And may I make a point to my friend, I am sure he \nknows it, but not everybody does. We say we are expanding the borders \nof NATO toward Russia. My learned friend knows there is a Russian \nenclave on the Baltic Sea which is called Kaliningrad, named after one \nof the original members of the politburo--Stalingrad is gone, Leningrad \nis gone, Kaliningrad continues--sitting right next to Poland.\n\n  We are not getting close, Mr. President, to the borders of Russia. We \nare on the borders of Russia. There it is, that little yellow spot--\nyellow for Russia. It says ``Russia.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask my colleague, what would be the reaction \nof people in our country if there was a Russian military alliance that \ncame to the border of the United States?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Nova Scotia?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Nova Scotia.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Well, there would be a lot more people on the Senate \nfloor this afternoon. But, I mean, I could not agree more. You heard \nGeorge Kennan say, in fact, ``Is this the only thing our policymakers \nin Washington can think to do?''\n  Now, the creating of NATO was a big event. It was a proposal by \nErnest Bevin, who understood these things in a way that not every \nAmerican did. There is a nice story that I think Senator Wellstone will \nenjoy, and you, Mr. President.\n  As some people recall--I recall, but I was in the Navy. After V-E \nDay, the British held an election. They had not had one for 10 years. \nSuddenly, Churchill and all his Cabinet--out they go. And in comes the \nLabor Government. Big change. Clement Attlee is Prime Minister. And \nErnest Bevin, the sometime head of the Transport and General Workers \nUnion, becomes Foreign Secretary. So he goes off to Potsdam, which is \njust a suburb of Berlin. And there is Stalin and all his people. And \nTruman--I doubt whether Harry S. Truman ever met someone he knew to be \na Communist until he got to Potsdam and was introduced to Stalin. They \ndo not have many of them in Kansas City. We had lots of them on the \nwest side of Manhattan, but that is another matter.\n  This story is apocryphal but true. Bevin comes back from Potsdam, and \nhe is in on the floor of the House of Commons. And a friend comes up to \nhim, a parliamentarian, and says, ``Ernie, what are those Soviets \nlike?'' And he says, ``Well, you know, they're just like the bloody \nCommunists.''\n  I mean, there are no shortage of Communists in the Transport and \nGeneral Workers Union. He could spot their behavior and so forth. It \nwas he who said we had to form a military alliance. The thing nobody in \nthis world\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\nwanted was more armies and navies, and so forth, but he knew. And our \npeople responded.\n  Harry Truman, who did not know there was an atom bomb being built as \nVice President, who had very little contact with any of this--he had \nbeen in Europe in World War I--supported it. God, there was a golden \nage.\n  Now, all we can do is expand NATO because the common agriculture \npolicy is making it difficult in Brussels to include the Czech Republic \nand Poland. That is not the standards we set for ourselves when the \ncold war began.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to Senator Moynihan, could I ask you one final \nquestion?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleagues who are on the floor, I know \nother colleagues want to speak, and I am sensitive to your schedules. \nBut I do think this is an important discussion and I never had the \nchance to do this in the 7 years I have been in the Senate.\n  I said I really believe that George Kennan has made enormous \ncontributions to the world. I think he is as profound a thinker and as \nknowledgeable a person about Russia as there is, and I put my \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, in the same tradition.\n  There are other points that I will make later on in the debate I have \nother than what I have made today. I find it interesting. There was a \npiece in the New York Times, front page story, about all the ways in \nwhich some of the bigger companies, military contractor companies have \nnow poured money into lobbying on behalf of this.\n  That makes me nervous because I really do not want to see this become \nkind of a proliferation of weapons in some of the new member countries. \nAnd then what will be the Russians' response? I have concerns about \nthat. Other Senators will talk about the cost, what will be the cost.\n  But we are talking, I say to Senator Moynihan, about what I am most \nworried about, which I think it is a profound mistake, because I \nbelieve that, again, this needlessly risked poisoning relations with \nRussia in creating the very kind of instability we do not want to see. \nI think that we do not want to see the people who are prodemocracy \nforces undercut.\n  But my question is this. You can help me out. I come from a State--I \nwill tell you this is probably maybe the most difficult for me. \nActually, the welfare vote was the most difficult for me on political \ngrounds, but this may be the second most difficult vote, because I have \nmet with some wonderful people--Czech community, Bulgarian community, \nPolish community, we have big populations in Minnesota.\n  They have been wonderful supporters of me, I say to the Senator. They \nare really disappointed in me. And I wonder, what would you say to some \npretty wonderful people in our country who feel so strongly that as a \nmatter of kind of almost historical justice that these countries should \nhave membership in NATO? How do you speak to their strongly held views, \nto how emotional--and I do not mean that in a negative way; I am not \nputting people down at all--they feel about this? How do you respond to \nthem? What do you say based upon your knowledge, your experience in \npublic service, your sense of history? Do you understand my question?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I understand your question perfectly, sir, because it \nis my question.\n  And I say this--and I would recommend to anyone who wishes to think \nabout it--if you love Poland, if you think that solidarity was the \nfirst real assault on the Soviet system, if you think that Pope John \nPaul has meant more in advancing freedoms in this age than anybody you \ncan think of, do not do this to Poland. See that Poland is in the \nEuropean Union, give them a common market, give them the same currency \nthat the Danes will have and the Spanish will have. Give them access to \na global market they have never been allowed into. Give them a common \nagricultural policy that will give their farmers a living.\n  That is what they deserve. And that is what is being denied them by \nthe bureaucracies, as bureaucracies will do. And what we do not want \nis--Poland has had enough in this 20th century. We do not want another \nperiod of hostilities that could lead not just to war but to \nannihilation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I see my distinguished friend from \nIndiana is on the floor. I have to apologize. In the colloquy with \nSenator Wellstone, I did not realize he had characteristically quietly \ncome aboard.\n  I yield the floor, and I look forward to his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the distinguished Senator from New York and the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota for a very constructive and \nhelpful colloquy. I enjoyed it.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that Kevin Johnson, a fellow in my \noffice, be permitted floor privileges for the duration of debate on the \nProtocols of Accession to the NATO Treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senate has begun a historical debate \nover NATO's future, one that surely will reverberate for many years to \ncome. I believe we have a historical window of opportunity to take \nsteps which will secure European peace and stability and which will \nlock in the freedom and independence won in the revolutions of 1989 and \nthe collapse of communism.\n  If the Senate ratifies enlargement, we will have set the foundation \nfor decades of European peace and prosperity; but if we fail, \nhistorians may look back at the early post-cold-war period as a tragic \nloss of opportunities. The more distant we are from the days of the \nfall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism, the clearer it \nbecomes that we have entered a new era. But dangers still abound in \npost-cold-war Europe. The revolutions of 1989 not only led to the \ncollapse of communism but also to the end of the peace orders \nestablished after two world wars.\n  What is at stake here and now is order and stability in Europe as a \nwhole. And that is why American interests are involved. Mr. President, \nNATO cannot by itself solve all of Europe's problems, but without a \nstable security framework, we run the risk that reform and democracy in \nEastern Europe will not persist but will instead be undercut by \ndestructive forces of nationalism and insecurity.\n  The failure of democracy in the east could not help but have a \nprofound consequence for democracy in the continent's western half as \nwell. If history teaches us anything, it is that the United States is \nalways drawn into such European conflicts because our vital interests \nare ultimately engaged. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are \ndemocratic, free-market nations with professional militaries under \ncivilian control. In addition to contributing to NATO's core mission of \ncollective defense, they are ready and able to support American and \nallied interests beyond their borders as they have demonstrated in \nDesert Storm, in Haiti, and in Bosnia.\n  Accession of these three democracies to NATO will eliminate immoral \nand destabilizing dividing lines in Europe. I point out, Mr. President, \nthose lines are there--not put there by us--and extend stability into a \nregion long troubled by conflict.\n  A stable and peaceful Europe will benefit all of Europe, including \nRussia and non-NATO countries. Expanding peace and stability in Europe \nlessens the chance of the United States again being pulled into \nconflicts in the region. NATO enlargement provides an opportunity for \nthe alliance to be proactive in shaping a stable and strategic \nlandscape in Europe.\n  Mr. President, it has been argued that we are rushing into 1992 \nenlargement. I have advocated, among others, expanding the NATO \nalliance since 1992. I have had countless discussions on the subject \nwith colleagues here in the Senate and in the administration since that \ntime. I have traveled to Europe and to the former Soviet Union many \ntimes in recent years, and the issue of NATO enlargement has been one \nof the most debated and talked about issues throughout that period of \ntime.\n  As an early advocate of enlargement, I do not agree that the Senate \nis rushing to expand NATO. Rather, I suggest that supporters and \ncritics of enlargement have been engaged in a debate\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\nand discussion of this topic for at least 6 years--hardly a hurried \nprocess. NATO enlargement has been endorsed by Congress each year since \n1994. NATO enlargement was endorsed in the Contract With America as \npart of the 1996 Republican Presidential platform.\n\n  Mr. President, the Foreign Relations Committee held 12 hearings over \nthe past 4 years to hear from nearly 50 supporters and opponents of the \npolicy of enlargement. In fact, I held the first hearing on the subject \nas chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Not only has the Foreign Relations Committee held \nhearings and studied the subject, but so has the Armed Services \nCommittee, Intelligence Committee, and Budget and Appropriations \nCommittees.\n  These committee hearings have thoroughly examined concerns about NATO \nexpansion, including projected cost, how we deal with Russia, and the \nfuture mission of NATO. The committee's resolution addresses all of \nthese points and was reported by a vote of 16-2. Our chairman, Senator \nHelms, and distinguished ranking member, Senator Biden, have done an \nexcellent job in constructing a very thoughtful and balanced resolution \nof ratification.\n  If Senate committee hearings and deliberations are not enough, \nSenators Lott and Daschle organized a Senate NATO observer group, which \nhad 28 members and met 17 times to study and discuss this important \nforeign policy initiative. NATO enlargement has received endorsements \nfrom every living U.S. Secretary of State, numerous former Secretaries \nof Defense and National Security Advisers, and more than 60 flag and \ngeneral officers, including 5 distinguished former Chairmen of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  This has been a long, serious debate among Members of Congress, the \nadministration, and our allies regarding the benefits and possible \npitfalls of enlargement. There has been no rush to judgment. We are now \nentering the final stage of the process; namely, Senate debate and a \nvote on the merits of NATO enlargement. I have listened carefully to \ncritics who suggest that there is no threat at the present time and \nthus we should not expand NATO now. They suggest there will be plenty \nof time to expand the alliance should a new enemy or threat appear on \nthe horizon. I strongly disagree with that point of view. We have \nlearned that the weapons used in Desert Storm were envisioned, planned, \nand produced in the 1970s. Thus, the systems which allowed us to \ntriumph in the Persian Gulf are 20 to 25 years old.\n  The organization and infrastructure to meet future threats must have \na similar root structure. We must begin to construct an alliance which \ncan meet the future and undetermined threats. Our military experts and \ntop strategic thinkers believe an alliance which includes Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic will be better able to meet those \nchallenges.\n  What might those challenges be? Perhaps the emergence of a hostile \nregional power, a threat from the Middle East or from North Africa, a \nresurgent imperialist Russia, nationalist or religious instability, or \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The systems needed to deter or defeat such future threats must begin \nto be constructed long before they can be expected to operate \neffectively. One cannot expect an alliance to be shelved during times \nof peace and simply dusted off when the threats emerge. The alliance \nmust begin to lay the foundation which will prepare us to meet an \nuncertain future. In my mind, expanding the zone of peace and security \nin Europe and adding three new willing, enthusiastic members will \ncontribute to that preparedness.\n  Four of our NATO allies--Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Germany--have \nalready ratified the protocols of enlargement. It is time for the \nSenate to act and to show leadership on this issue.\n  NATO's open-door entrance policy established by article 10 of the \nWashington treaty--which should not be misunderstood as an open-ended \npolicy--has given countries of Central and Eastern Europe the incentive \nto accelerate reforms, to settle disputes with neighbors, and to \nincrease regional cooperation. They have done so magnificently.\n  To retract the open-door policy, as some have suggested, would risk \nundermining tremendous gains that have been made for peace throughout \nthe region. The result of a ``closed-door'' policy would be the \ncreation of new dividing lines across Europe. Those nations outside \nmight become disillusioned and insecure and, thus, inclined to adopt \nthe competitive and destabilizing security policies of Europe's past.\n  NATO's decision to enlarge in stages recognizes that all new \ndemocracies and applicants in Europe are not equally ready or willing \nto be security allies. Some states may never be ready. At the same \ntime, NATO must not prejudge the future or draw new lines in Europe by \npre-emptively excluding or setting time lines for future cooperation or \nmembership.\n\n  The selection of future NATO members should depend on: (1) a \ndetermination by NATO members of their strategic interests; (2) NATO's \nperception of threats to security and stability; and (3) actions taken \nby prospective members to complete their democratic transitions and to \nharmonize their policies with NATO's political aims and security \npolicies.\n  This would clarify the security expectations of non-NATO members. It \nwould make clear that it is the intention of the United States that \nNATO remain a serious defensive military alliance and not slip into a \nloose collective security society. It suggests that enlargement will be \na careful, deliberate process, with consideration of all security \ninterests. Finally, it draws again on the principle of reciprocity, \nboth to encourage prospective members to align themselves with NATO's \nvalues and policies and to signal that threats will be \ncounterproductive.\n  Intellectually, I can understand the concern that we must not allow \nthe NATO Alliance to collapse under the strains, produced by multitudes \nof new members. But, neither can we seek a quick, painless remedy for \nserious debate and oversight of American foreign policy through \n``strategic pauses'' or ``NATO linkages''. The best way to ensure the \ncontinued vitality of NATO is for the United States to consider and \ndebate the qualifications and potential ramifications of new members on \na country-by-country or a stage-by-stage basis.\n  NATO's open-door policy has served the Alliance well for fifty years. \nThe Senate has always and will retain its prerogatives and powers in \nthe area of the North Atlantic Treaty and the Alliance. A two-thirds \nSenate majority is the best form of balance and oversight we can \nproduce without treading on executive privilege.\n  In the weeks leading up to the Alliance's Madrid summit in July 1997, \nmany of our current European allies pushed for a larger initial number \nof states to join NATO. The President decided to keep the initial round \nto three members. This was not a popular decision with some of our \nallies, who had championed the cause of Slovenia and Romania. And while \nneither the Administration nor the Senate can prevent other current \nmembers of the Alliance from promoting the membership of additional \nstates, both have the ability to prevent the accession of other \ncandidates--the Administration through its predominant voice in the \nNorth Atlantic Council and the Senate through its role in approving \nmodifications to the North Atlantic Treaty.\n  Consequently, I do not believe a legislatively mandated pause is in \nthe interest of this country, this institution, or the NATO Alliance.\n  Some propose that NATO enlargement be bound to the expansion of the \nEuropean Union (EU). EU enlargement is highly desirable in its own \nright, but must not be a condition to NATO membership. It would \nrestrict a trans-Atlantic Alliance led by the U.S. to the political \nexigencies of a strictly European organization.\n  I point out again, Mr. President, that NATO is the organization in \nwhich the United States is involved and in which we offer leadership, \nnot the European union.\n  The transfer of security decision-making power to an institution \nwhich has been unable to develop a common security policy and failed to \nstop the fighting in the former Yugoslavia would not bode well for the \nfuture of European security. The EU's decision-making procedures are \nnotorious for being cumbersome and slow. Moreover, the consensus-\nbuilding process they\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\nserve to tend to produce outcomes expressing the lowest common \ndenominator. All of these traits are antithetical to the demands of a \nmilitary alliance which places a premium on timely, decisive action \nrather than first meeting the test of political acceptability to a \ndiverse relationship.\n  Finally, subordinating NATO to the EU in this manner would make the \nAlliance, not a cornerstone of European security, but an appendage. The \nrole of the U.S., Canada, and Turkey, none of whom are members of the \nEU, would be significantly diminished in the enlargement process. This \npotential ``back-door'' approach to enlargement is fraught with \ndangers; I prefer the ``front-door'', the ``open-door''.\n  Critics assert that NATO enlargement repeats the mistake of the \nVersailles Treaty by mistreating Russia. One should be careful with \nhistorical analogies. NATO enlargement is not a punishment or isolation \nof Russia. During the period that NATO enlargement has proceeded, \nPresident Yeltsin was re-elected; reformers were elevated in \ngovernment; President Yeltsin pledged to press for ratification of \nSTART II and then to pursue deeper nuclear arms reductions in START \nIII; the Russian Duma approved the Chemical Weapons Convention; Russian \ntroops continue their participation in Bosnia; the West has extended \nsome $100 billion since 1991 to assist Russian democratic and economic \nreforms, and over $2 billion in weapons dismantlement and security.\n  NATOP members will continue to have both common and divergent \ninterests with Russia, whether NATO enlarges or not. It is a mistake to \nview Russia solely as a reactive power and to blame its actions on \nWestern behavior alone. There will be areas of collaboration and areas \nof discord in the relationship, and those distinctions will be \ndetermined by differences in geography, history, and economic standing, \nnot by ideology as during the Cold War and not by NATO enlargement in \nthe post-Cold War world. The only way to manage both areas of \ncoincident and conflicting interests is by building bridges where \npossible and drawing lines where necessary.\n  Many reject NATO enlargement out of a desire to preserve a Russian \nsphere of influence. If Russia cannot accept the legitimate right of \nits neighbors to choose their security arrangements, a policy they \nembraced in the NATO-Russia Founding Act, then NATO's role in the \nregion will prove even more important.\n\n  Some critics believe that NATO enlargement is somehow condemning the \nSTART II Treaty and cooperative U.S.-Russian nuclear dismantlement \nactivities to the dustbin of history. I do not believe this is the \ncase. Russia's recent ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention \nwould indicate that the linkage between NATO enlargement and arms \ncontrol is more political than strategic.\n  Many Russians, including liberal Duma members, simply do not like the \nSTART II Treaty. They believe the Russian side was out-negotiated by \nthe Americans, and oppose it whether NATO expands or not.\n  What is at issue among Russian arms control specialists is whether \nthe United States can be convinced to pay some additional price for \nmutual strategic nuclear arms control reductions that the Russians \nthemselves will have to undertake with or without a treaty. Continued \nstatements about the dire consequences that will accompany NATO \nenlargement become the means by which they hope to induce the U.S. to \ngo to a START III agreement sooner rather than later.\n  Perceived START II inequities constitute by far the primary reason \nfor the reluctance of many Duma members and defense specialists to \nratify the START II Treaty, not continuing, deep-seated resentment of \nNATO enlargement. It is not simply the nationalists but the so-called \nliberals in the Russian foreign policy elite who believe that START II, \nas currently written, is not in Russia's national interest. The latter \nwould also propose to substantially modify the START III elements of \nthe Helsinki joint statement agreed to by Presidents Clinton and \nYeltsin, arguing that the March 1997 START III principles do not go far \nenough to guarantee that Russia's smaller strategic forces of the \nfuture will be able to reliably deter the United States.\n  At the very time that prominent Russian ``arms controllers'' are \npublicly laying the blame for lack of Duma ratification of START II at \nthe feet of an expanding NATO, they are privately probing to determine \nhow far the United States would be willing to go in further lowering \nwarhead ceilings through START III, realizing that Russia cannot \nrealistically afford to maintain the proposed START II strategic force \nlevels. They want to drive the warhead ceiling down to a figure that \nRussia can afford! They are urging the beginning of START III \nnegotiations as soon as possible, in part, they say, to improve the \nprospects for Russian ratification of START II. They are arguing, in \nshort, that the entire strategic arms control dialogue is foundering, \nnot because of NATO enlargement, but because the U.S. insists on \nwaiting for START II ratification before beginning formal negotiations \non START III.\n\n  It is not so much NATO expansion that is eating away at the U.S.-\nRussia strategic relationship. Rather, it is Russian weakness and the \ndesire of some Russians either to stop the strategic nuclear arms \nreduction process at START I levels, or to convince American statesmen \nand political leaders, in part through a ``guilt trip'' over NATO \nenlargement, that a better deal needs to be offered to the Russian \nside--either in order to secure ratification of the START II Treaty or \nto supersede it with a START III agreement.\n  There is nothing inherently inconsistent between a strong, healthy \nU.S.-Russian relationship and an expanding NATO. Too many Americans \ncritics of NATO enlargement who posit this as an either/or choice fail \nto understand the nature of the debate within the Russian Federation.\n\n\n                               NUNN-LUGAR\n\n  In recent trips to Russia and the former Soviet Union it has been \nclear to me that NATO enlargement is unlikely to have a negative impact \non our broad and deep cooperation with the Russian government to reduce \nthe threat from weapons of mass destruction. My colleagues have \nexpressed their concern that our successful cooperative dismantlement \nand destruction programs may falter as NATO enlarges.\n  For the past year or two, while NATO issues were being addressed by \nsenior diplomats, Nunn-Lugar activities continued along their steady \npath, undisrupted. The programs are proceeding well, with no signs of \nNATO enlargement hindering or damaging our ongoing destruction and \ndismantlement efforts.\n  To date, the Nunn-Lugar program has deactivated 4,700 nuclear \nwarheads, destroyed 255 ICBMs, eliminated 252 ICBM launchers, destroyed \n37 bombers, eliminated 95 SLBMs, destroyed 80 SLBM launchers, and \nsealed 114 nuclear test tunnels. These numbers will continue to climb \nas we expand our cooperative efforts with Russia.\n  Our cooperative programs with Russia on these issues have not slowed \ndown; rather they have made remarkable gains in recent months. \nRecently, the Russians have indicated their willingness to move forward \non a range of new projects. Nunn-Lugar will support the elimination of \nover 20 Russian SS-18 ICBMs each year. At 10 warheads apiece, this \nremoves one of the most feared threats to U.S. strategic forces.\n\n  Nunn-Lugar will support the elimination of over 10 missile submarines \nper year at three Russian shipyards. Dismantlement projects will \ninclude DELTAs and ultimately TYPHOONs, the workhorses and mainstays of \nthe Russian submarine forces. Moscow has also proposed Nunn-Lugar \nsupport for transforming the fissile material from dismantled Russian \nwarheads into non-weapons-usable hockey puck shapes for storage at the \nMayak fissile material storage facility. This project would provide \nunprecedented conformation that the Russians are dismantling nuclear \nwarheads, and will speed the safe and secure storage of weapons-usable \nmaterial.\n  Ukraine has been similarly expansive in identifying new areas of \ncooperation. The Ukrainian government has requested Nunn-Lugar \nassistance in eliminating SS-24s and associated silos to meet its \nrequirements by 2000. Kiev has also asked for Nunn-Lugar assistance in \ndestroying 44 bombers, as well as over 1,000 advanced air-launch cruise \nmissiles.\n\n[[Page S3620]]\n\n  With these major advances in our cooperative destruction and \ndismantlement programs under Nunn-Lugar, it is difficult to find \nevidence to support the claim that NATO enlargement is interfering with \nthe larger problem of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \nJust the opposite, as NATO enlargement has progressed, so have our \njoint efforts with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union \nto deal with the threat of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Therefore I conclude that NATO enlargement and deeper NATO-Russian \nrelations both have immense value for the United States and Europe if \nthey are pursued properly. They are complementary and reinforcing \nobjectives. The best outcome for the United States and Europe is for \nboth tracks to succeed. A zero-sum debate about them, therefore, misses \nthe point.\n  The coming votes of European parliaments and the U.S. Senate on NATO \nenlargement will not simply be decisions over whether to add a few \nmembers to a military alliance. These votes will become a statement on \nthe roles of the United States and the countries of Western Europe in \nthe world. The U.S. vote on enlargement will be seen as a sign of \nwhether America intends to maintain its international leadership role, \nor whether, after the end of the Cold War, the United States intends to \nretreat and relinquish its status as the world leader.\n  It is my hope that America will maintain its position and engagement \nin the world's arena. We should ratify NATO enlargement and expand the \nzone of peace and security which has served Western Europe so well for \nthe last fifty years to the central and eastern portions of this \nimportant continent.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, Ronald Reagan once remarked that:\n\n       They say the world has become too complex for simple \n     answers. They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there \n     are simple answers.\n\n  Mr. President, with the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of \nthe Soviet empire, we must face the challenge of maintaining a zone of \nstability in Central Europe while preserving the freedom and \nindependence of these democratic states. Enlarging NATO to include \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is not an easy answer, but it \nis a simple answer. Most importantly, it is a simple answer that is in \nthe best interest of the United States.\n  This is not the first time that the Senate has considered the merits \nof NATO enlargement. NATO added new members on three other occasions, \nbringing Germany, Greece, Turkey, and Spain into the fold. With each \naddition, the military capability of NATO increased, and the stability \nof Europe was enhanced. I am confident that the inclusion of Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic in NATO will have the same effect.\n  This round of NATO expansion, however, is significant in that these \nare the first candidates for NATO membership to be considered that were \npart of the Soviet bloc. Nearly a decade after the fall of the Berlin \nWall, we have a chance to right the historical wrong of Yalta, and \nfirmly anchor Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in the West. \nWhile the accession of these three nations to full NATO membership \nshould not be supported for moral reasons alone, our moral obligation \nto these countries should not be ignored. We must look at NATO \nexpansion not just as a way to make up for past mistakes, but as a \nchance to secure the gains of freedom and democracy and ensure that \nthey will never again be encroached.\n  NATO expansion offers the United States a remarkable opportunity to \nbe proactive in shaping the strategic landscape of Europe. That this \nopportunity is a result of peace, and not the spoils of war, is a \ntribute to the effectiveness of NATO over nearly 50 years. It is not a \nresponsibility that we should take lightly; it is not a responsibility \nthat we can shirk.\n\n\n                             NATO'S MISSION\n\n  The Senate does not have merely the obligation to determine whether \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic should be admitted to NATO, but \nto safeguard the integrity of the organization they would be joining. \nNATO has been a successful military alliance with a clearly defined \nmission: protecting the territorial integrity of its members, defending \nthem from external aggression and preventing the domination of Europe \nby any single power. NATO's mission remains just as valid today as it \nwas at its inception. I am convinced that a NATO which includes Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic will be a stronger, more viable \ninstitution as long as NATO retains its essential character throughout \nthis transition.\n  I share the concerns of some of my colleagues that unless we are \nvigilant, NATO may evolve into a UN-style peacekeeping force. However, \nit is important to underscore that the expansion of NATO to include \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will inhibit--not promote--this \nobjectionable outcome. The prospective members are eager to join NATO \nto receive the same strong security guarantee that NATO members have \ntraditionally enjoyed. They understand what it means to be invaded and \noccupied, and do not want NATO's ability to carry out its mission to be \ndiluted or compromised. They will be on our side in the internal debate \nin the North Atlantic Council over NATO's strategic concept in the 21st \ncentury.\n\n\n                                 RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. President, others have argued that the inclusion of Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic in NATO will destabilize Russia and \nendanger our efforts to build a constructive relationship with that \nimportant nation. I do not believe this is the case. The Russian \nlegislature is refusing to ratify START II. Russia is forging closer \nties to Iraq and Iran and undermining US policy in the Middle East \nwhenever possible. Moscow is trying to disrupt US-backed plans to move \nCaspian Sea oil through an Azerbaijani-Georgian pipeline to the Black \nSea. But there is no evidence that any of these actions is linked to \nNATO expansion. Indeed, Russia was pursing these policies long before \nthe expansion of NATO was seriously contemplated. NATO expansion may be \na convenient excuse for Russia's stance on foreign policy issues that \nrun counter to US interests, but it is not the cause.\n  I have no doubt that Russia, if given the choice, would like to \nmaintain a ``sphere of influence'' in Central Europe, or barring that, \na buffer zone. But this is 1998, not 1948, and Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic have the right and the ability to reject the former, and \nthe United States has a vital interest in denying the latter. As former \nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger noted.\n  Basing European and Atlantic security on a no man's land between \nGermany and Russia runs counter to historical experience. A greater \nsecurity dilemma would be created by ceding to our own fears about \nantagonizing Russia than proceeding with enlargement.\n  Furthermore, appeasing the Russian extremists who object to NATO \nexpansion would only serve to undermine the very democratic forces that \nwe're trying to protect. I see no evidence of a brewing nationalist \nbacklash that critics keep warning us about. The Russian people are \nconcerned about securing jobs, protecting their pensions, and \npreserving their personal security. Opinion polls show that Russian \nvoters don't care one way or another about NATO expansion. As one \nexpert witness, Mr. Dimitri Simes, before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee remarked, the Russian leadership: engaged in terrible \natrocities in Chechnya against [. . .] many Russian civilians. They are \nnot paying wages and pensions at a time when people can easily observe \nthe huge mansions of the new elite [. . .]. None of this moves Russian \npolitics in a nationalist or reactionary direction. But somehow an \nobstruction like NATO enlargement is supposed to have a mystical, \ndestructive impact on Russian politics. It is very difficult for me to \nbelieve.\n\n\n                             EUROPEAN UNION\n\n  Mr. President, we should not let our fears of Russia's response stall \nNATO expansion; nor should we let protectionist elements of the \nEuropean Union have the same effect. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic are established democracies with free market economies. They \nhave resolved all territorial conflicts with their neighbors. Their\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\nmilitaries are firmly under civilian control and they have pledged to \nmeet all the responsibilities of NATO membership. These countries want \nto be engaged in Europe; they are willing to fully participate in the \ndefense of Europe and have pledged to do their fair share. There is no \nneed to wait until the European Union accepts Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic before we permit them to achieve full membership in \nNATO.\n  Right now, three of our current European allies are not members of \nthe European Union: Norway, Iceland, and Turkey. There is no reason to \nraise the bar for the admission of new members.\n\n\n                             MANDATED PAUSE\n\n  The accession of Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic to full NATO \nmembership must be regarded as the first--not the only--round of \nexpansion. A mandated pause would create a new dividing line in Europe \nand send a signal to the Central European countries who were not \nincluded in the first round that enlargement has not just stalled, but \nhas stopped. Many of these countries are making positive changes toward \ndemocracy and free markets with the view of joining NATO. It would be \ndestructive to remove that goal.\n\n\n                       RESOLUTION OF RATIFICATION\n\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I raised a number of \nconcerns about the Administration's proposal to expand NATO and I am \npleased that these have been addressed in the Resolution of \nRatification. This Resolution of Ratification underscores that NATO's \ncentral mission remains the territorial defense of its members and that \nNATO command, structures, force goals, and defense planning must \nreflect that fact. It confirms that Russia will not have a voice or a \nveto on NATO decision-making and that the Permanent Joint Council will \nbe a mechanism for explaining NATO policy, not creating it. It also \nensures that there will be a clear, equitable distribution of the \nfinancial costs of expansion. American taxpayers should not pay the \ncosts of modernizing the forces of our current allies, because they \nhave failed to live up to their previous commitments. Nor should our \ntaxpayers pay more if any of our European allies refuse to pay their \nfair share for the costs of bringing in new members.\n\n\n                               Minnesota\n\n  Some of my colleagues have stated that the American people have not \nbeen informed about the issues surrounding NATO expansion. Well, I can \ncategorically state that is not the case in Minnesota. Minnesotans have \nparticipated in an ongoing dialogue on the merits of expanding NATO at \nevery level--from the Minnesota legislature, to academic symposia, to \ntown hall meetings. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record the remarks of three Minnesotans who have \nworked diligently for the inclusion of Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic in NATO: Mr. John Radzilowski, Mr. Lazlo Fulop, and Ms. \nPaulette Will. They made an extraordinary effort to make sure that \ntheir fellow Minnesotans had the opportunity to become well-informed \nabout the issues surrounding NATO expansion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement by John Radzilowski in Favor of a Resolution Memorializing \n  Congress To Support the Admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n      Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (HF 2417)\n\n\n before the minnesota house of representatives, committee on economic \n  development and international trade, january 21, 1998, rep. michael \n                              jaros, chair\n\n(John Radzilowski is president of Polish American Cultural Institute of \n   Minnesota. He is a historian, and a freelance writer and editor, \ncurrently in the final stages of his Ph.D. candidacy. He is the author \nof three books, the co-author of four others, as well as many articles, \n   reviews, and stories. He has written on topics such as Minnesota \n   history, east European history, immigration, and American ethnic \n                                groups)\n\n       Mr. Radzilowski: I would like to thank the committee for \n     providing me the opportunity to speak today and I am very \n     pleased to be able to speak in favor of the resolution \n     supporting NATO membership for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n     Republic. As a Polish American who grew up in Minnesota, I am \n     especially proud to see the legislature considering this \n     vital issue. Since the beginning of American history, the \n     interests and values of the Polish and American peoples have \n     coincided. During our war for independence, Americans were \n     aided by many Polish patriots. Kazimierz Pulaski founded the \n     U.S. Calvary and died fighting the British at Savannah. \n     Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a close friend of Thomas Jefferson, \n     played a key role in the American victory at Saratoga, and \n     designed the fortress of West Point (which later became our \n     military academy). Kosciuszko was also a fierce of foe of \n     slavery and on hearing that Congress had awarded him a \n     plantation for his services, he ordered Jefferson to free its \n     slaves, sell the plantation, and use the money to educate \n     freed blacks. Poland's 1791 Constitution was based on the \n     U.S. Constitution, and was only the second democratic \n     constitution in the world.\n       Although Poland lost her fight for independence, Pols kept \n     their dream alive. When they could not win their own freedom, \n     Pols battled for the independence of oppressed peoples around \n     the world, becoming known as the scourge of tyrants. \n     Fleeing political oppression and economic hardship, Poles \n     found a haven here in America. Today, there are about 10 \n     million Polish Americans, while Minnesota boasts about a \n     quarter million Polish Americans, making us the state's \n     sixth largest ethnic or racial group. [According to the \n     1990 U.S. Census.] Polish Americans have distinguished \n     themselves in America's service. According to the 1990 \n     U.S. Census, Polish Americans have the highest per capita \n     percentage of veterans in their population than any of the \n     other ethnic and racial groups the government keeps track \n     of.\n       After World War I, Poland regained her independence, thanks \n     in part to the efforts of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who \n     is still considered a hero in Poland today. Following the \n     shameful Munich Pact of 1938, in which an independent \n     Czechoslovakia was turned over to Hitler, Poland refused to \n     give in to German threats and was attacked in September 1939 \n     and defeated by Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union \n     after a month of desperate fighting. Many Poles escaped to \n     the West, where they helped make up the fourth largest Allied \n     force in the fight against Nazism. On many occasions Polish \n     and American troops fought side by side. Polish fighters \n     escorted American bombers on raids deep into Germany. Polish \n     destroyers watched over merchant convoys in U-Boat infested \n     waters. In Italy, the Polish victory at Monte Cassino allowed \n     the Americans to break out of the Anzio beachhead and capture \n     Rome. On August 19, 1944, soldiers of the Polish 1st Armored \n     Division linked up with Gen. George Patton's 90th Infantry \n     Division near the French town of Falaise to close the trap on \n     60,000 Nazi troops, destroying the bulk of the German army in \n     the West.\n       World War II cost the lives of some 6 million Polish \n     citizens (a number divided about evenly between Christians \n     and Jews), as well as incalculable losses of property and \n     cultural and artistic treasures. Despite the terrible cost, \n     and despite fighting for the winning side, Poland did not \n     regain her freedom. Her struggle against tyranny was \n     forgotten. Instead, Poland, like her neighbors Hungary and \n     Czechoslovakia, became a satellite of the Soviet Union, a \n     nation that was responsible for the deaths of almost 1 \n     million Poles. Yet, Soviet communism proved a failure in \n     Poland, and the people did everything they could to \n     undermine a system that became increasingly corrupt, \n     unworkable, and morally bankrupt. Given this history, it \n     is no surprise that the unraveling of the Communist system \n     in Europe began in Poland. Although we did not know it at \n     the time, the election of Pope John Paul II and the \n     formation of the Solidarity independent trade union in \n     Poland spelled the beginning of the end for the Cold War. \n     The momentum that began in Poland was furthered by the \n     people in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The rest of story \n     is, as they say, history.\n       After breaking with the communist past, Poland, Hungary, \n     and the Czech Republic began an effort to re-enter the family \n     of democratic nations from which they had been unnaturally \n     separated in 1945. They transformed their economies from \n     state-run command systems, to free, open markets. They \n     reformed their political systems, reintroducing real \n     democracy, a free press, and civilian control of the \n     military. These changes have taken root and borne fruit--\n     there have been a series of free and fair elections, and the \n     economies of all three nations are doing well. Poland, for \n     example, has the fastest-growing economy in Europe. Each of \n     these three nations has taken the initiative and solved its \n     outstanding border disputes and tensions. In short, Hungary, \n     Poland, and the Czech Republic have met the objectives we in \n     the West set for them as conditions for NATO membership.\n       NATO enlargement will expand the borders of peace and \n     security. It will spread more evenly the burdens of defense \n     within the alliance. It will add to the ranks of our allies. \n     It will encourage those who want to reject politics based on \n     hatred, division, and spheres of influence. As Czech \n     president Vaclav Havel put it, NATO ``is first and foremost \n     an instrument of democracy intended to defend mutually \n     held and created political and spiritual values.'' It is \n     not an alliance aimed at an enemy, but ``a guarantor of \n     Euro-American civilization and thus a pillar of global \n     security.'' [New York Times, May 13, 1997.]\n       The consequences of the U.S. Senate not ratifying NATO \n     expansion would be serious indeed. Hardline nationalists in \n     Bosnia, Belarus, Serbia, and elsewhere would be encouraged, \n     while friends of democracy and\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\n     free markets would be disheartened. Furthermore, U.S. \n     interests would be severally harmed. We depend on stability \n     in the heart of Europe. An expanded NATO is the best \n     guarantor of that security. With NATO membership for the \n     Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, no dictator will ever \n     again dream of a central European empire based on force and \n     violence. We only need to remember the price the U.S. paid in \n     two major European wars and the protracted commitments of the \n     Cold War to understand how important this is.\n       For Minnesotans, east-central Europe is of increasing \n     importance. The three NATO candidates have some of Europe's \n     fastest growing economies and many Minnesota companies are \n     doing good business in Hungary, Poland, and the Czech \n     Republic. The list of major companies with interests in these \n     three countries reads like a who's who of corporate \n     Minnesota: Cargill, 3M, Honeywell, Pillsbury, Land O'Lakes, \n     NRG. We can add to this many medium and smaller companies, \n     especially in the high technology area (many of which were \n     started by recent immigrants). Ask the officials of these \n     companies what NATO enlargement means for them.\n       In just two weekends this summer we collected some 1,400 \n     signatures of Minnesotans from all over the state on a \n     petition in support of NATO membership for Poland, Hungary, \n     and the Czech Republic. This was a grassroots effort \n     conducted by volunteers with little or no political \n     experience. Since then, there has been a flood of letter \n     writing, faxing, and calling to our U.S. Senators. One \n     senator supports NATO expansion, while the other is \n     officially undecided. The debate continues. Thus, it is \n     important that the state legislature make its voice heard on \n     this important issue, to tell the U.S. Senate that NATO \n     expansion is good for global security, good for America, and \n     good for Minnesota. I thank Rep. Jaros, and other state \n     legislators who have helped on this issue, for their good \n     work, and I urge members of this body to support the \n     resolution.\n       NATO membership is the final step in the return of Poland \n     and its neighbors to their place as our allies. As President \n     Clinton recently noted, Poland is not a new ally for America, \n     but an old friend returning home.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement by Laszlo G. Fulop, in Support of Why Hungary Should Become a \n                              NATO Member.\n\n\n  before the minnesota senate committee on government operations and \n                                veterans\n\n       Mr. Fulop. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to \n     appear in front of your committee and speak in support of \n     Hungary's--along with Poland's and the Czech Republic's--\n     admission to NATO.\n       Let me introduce myself: Laszlo G. Fulop, architect and \n     planner of Minneapolis, MN., representing the Minnesota \n     Hungarians.\n       The question many of you have in mind is, Why should \n     Hungary become a NATO member? Before responding to this \n     question let me make a few brief remarks, that are pertinent \n     to this issue.\n       Hungary has existed in Europe for over 1100 years, and of \n     those over 1000 was oriented to Western Europe. In the course \n     of this orientation she found herself in situations where she \n     fought for and defended the Christian culture of Western \n     Europe, often just by blocking great expansionist endeavors \n     from the East.\n       Hungary also had a 200+ year interest in the United States. \n     Many Hungarians fought in the American War of Independence. \n     Indeed a Hungarian, Colonel Michael Kovats serving under the \n     famous Polish General Pulaski, organized the first US \n     Cavalry, while fighting for American independence. Later, \n     when the Hungarians fought for their freedom with the \n     Hapsburg empire in 1848-49 and declared their independence, \n     the new Hungarian Constitution was modeled after the American \n     Constitution of 1787. By the way, the Hapsburg forces were \n     able to put down that valiant revolution, only because they \n     asked for Russian help. A Russian army of 175,000 together \n     with the Hapsburg armies eventually subdued the Hungarians \n     fight for freedom. Unfortunately this intrusion was not an \n     isolated occasion.\n       Until just 9 years ago East and part of Central Europe was \n     relegated to the Soviet Sphere of interest and even the US \n     conducted her relationship with the region through Moscow. \n     Since the defeat of Communism in 1989-90 the Czechs, Poles, \n     Hungarians, regaining their independence, had to overcome \n     great difficulties in their efforts to reestablish democracy.\n       The dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, initiated by Hungarian \n     Prime Minister Antall in 1990, along with the absence of \n     existing security guarantees has left a strategic vacuum in \n     the region. This effectively dissolved a bipolar world order, \n     and also changed the situation of European security. The \n     threat of nuclear war was replaced by much more limited in \n     scope, yet expanded in types of threats. Aggression in \n     Yugoslavia that went on unchecked for too long has shown just \n     one major cause why this vacuum has to be filled.\n       The practical view of this membership: what's good in it \n     for me and what's in it for you? Let's look at a few areas:\n     Security\n       The Enlargement means expanded security for Europe, and for \n     the individual countries. It means ensuring common interests, \n     common values. NATO was never an aggressive organization, but \n     was an effective deterrent of active war. NATO always \n     professed to protect the ``status quo''. In this case NATO's \n     Enlargement simply means the ``eastward expansion of the \n     region of security and stability.''\n       Hungary values its security, exactly because it had been \n     threatened so often during her history.\n       Also a new security system seems to be evolving in Europe \n     that is based on cooperation and partnership and these are \n     driven by democracies in Western Europe. In orienting herself \n     to the West, it will be imperative for Hungary (and to Poland \n     and the Czech Republic) to participate in the economic, \n     political and security aspects of this newly evolving \n     mechanism. This will require modernization in more fronts, \n     including security.\n       European stability is in the interest of the United States, \n     as well, as NATO has been one of the major guardians of that. \n     Today, it is still viewed in that role, and its enlargement \n     will simply expand the security enjoyed by the current NATO \n     countries, to establish conditions for peaceful, and \n     democratic development in the new member countries. This \n     enlargement is not viewed as pushing the military line \n     established during the Cold War further east, but to expand \n     the state of stability. A war in the area would cost the US a \n     great deal more both in political efforts and in military \n     spending than the costs associated with the NATO Enlargement. \n     These countries will mean a net gain for NATO and the United \n     States.\n     Developing democracies\n       Hungary also intends to become member of the EU, but, as \n     NATO has become more than just a military organization, HU \n     views NATO as complimenting her integration into the ranks of \n     western democracies.\n       These three countries mean market, strong sources of \n     educated manpower, and devoted allies to the West in \n     political as well as on economical turf.\n       The association with NATO provides a vision that can \n     galvanize people in these three countries (and hopefully \n     later with others) to achieve higher levels of co-operation \n     in areas of common concern and shared destiny. Collectively \n     these people will have a greater power to integrate their \n     future within this alliance. This is perhaps truer today than \n     it ever was before, and the recognition is becoming more \n     pervasive than before. Partially, the margin of vote (85.5%) \n     in Hungary attested to this recognition.\n       The threat of a large scale military conflict is currently \n     not real, however, smaller scale conflicts can occur. Their \n     potential can never be ignored. For Hungary the upgrading of \n     military will be a costly affair, but it is estimated to cost \n     less over the same period than as if she had to provide for \n     her total defense alone.\n       Since the reestablishment of democratic governmental forms \n     in Hungary, the military is under civilian control.\n     Nature of concerns\n       We are aware that some people are concerned about this step \n     of NATO and has urged a wide ranging discussion on this \n     topic. The main concern seems to be that this expansion will \n     ``. . . bring the Russians to question the entire post-Cold \n     War settlement, and galvanize resistance in the Duma . . .''. \n     It, however, appears that Russia's benefits from the enhanced \n     security adjacent to her borders are being recognized. \n     Serious attempts are being made to re-focus Russia's main \n     goals for the 21st century to the economic development front, \n     [see recommendations prepared by the prestigious Foreign and \n     Defense Policy Council which in its 1997 report came out and \n     said: ``Russia should not busy itself with the blocking of \n     enlargement but adjust itself within a short time to the new \n     situation as effectively as possible.'' Further, ``(if) \n     Russia does not want to completely withdraw from it (i.e. the \n     Central European region) economically, it must adjust itself \n     to the present economic and political conditions for the sake \n     of its own interests.]\n       Additionally, NATO and Russia has worked out a unique \n     cooperative deal that did more for enhancing Russia's \n     diplomatic position in Europe than she could have hoped for \n     without the enlargement-issue being pursued. We also heard \n     from an authentic and very reliable source that the NATO \n     Enlargement issue is on the low end of concerns of Russian \n     citizen on a Moscow street. On the other hand, even the \n     customarily reserved Encyclopedia Britannica in ``The role of \n     NATO'' brands those trying to do away with NATO as ``neo-\n     isolationists''.\n       Finally, we also see this world as becoming more and more \n     globalized. Minnesota firms are doing business in Europe, and \n     increasingly in the Central European countries, as well. The \n     University of Minnesota has several student exchange \n     agreements with other countries including the Central \n     European countries. We believe the enlargement of NATO and \n     the attendant security will be but one step to insure \n     increased cooperation, and better understanding of people in \n     an atmosphere of enhanced security and stability.\n       These are only a sampling of reasons why this action should \n     be supported. Indeed, President Clinton should be commended \n     for seeking solutions in an atmosphere conducive to stability \n     in Central Europe, and anchor security in this area while \n     there are problems in the Middle East. This creates a safer \n     environment for all of us.\n       Therefore, we urge you to pass a supporting resolution to \n     this most important foreign policy consideration and express \n     your support to the United States Senate. Thank you for \n     allowing me to talk on this issue.\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n   Statement of Paulette Will in Favor of a Resolution Memorializing \n  Congress To Support the Admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n      Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (HF 2417)\n\n\n minnesota house of representatives, committee on economic development \n  and international trade, January 21, 1998, Rep. Michael Jaros, Chair\n\n       Ms. Will: Chairman Jaros and Members of the Committee, My \n     name is Paulette Will, I am President of the Minnesota \n     Czechoslovak Center and a partner in Bohemian Traders, a \n     Minnesota-based company importing leather bags from the Czech \n     Republic.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to express my support for the \n     Czech Republic's entry into NATO along with Hungary and \n     Poland. The Czech Republic is, as you probably know, a very \n     young country. On January 1, 1993 Czechoslovakia, founded in \n     1918, ceased to exist and the Czech Republic and Slovakia \n     became independent nations as a result of an agreement by \n     their respective governments the previous year. Before World \n     War II Czechoslovakia had a flourishing economy surpassed \n     only by France and Switzerland. Since 1938 the history of the \n     region includes occupation by the Nazis, loss of religious \n     and personal freedoms in the 1968 Prague Spring Soviet \n     crackdown, countless personal losses in terms of families \n     being torn apart from Czechs seeking freedom from an \n     oppressive regime and just this year both the Czech Republic \n     and Poland were struck by catastrophic rains and floods. \n     Today the Czech Republic has a population of 10.3 million \n     people. The country is strategically located in the center of \n     Europe and as such is in an ideal position for trade and \n     investment. Geographically, Prague is located to the west of \n     Vienna, Austria.\n       According to the last Federal census in 1990 almost 100,000 \n     people in Minnesota are of 50% or more Czech descent (87,748 \n     Czech and 11,466 Czechoslovak) 238,039 are of Polish descent \n     and 12,349 are of Hungarian descent. Minnesotans of Czech \n     heritage are dispersed throughout the state with significant \n     concentrations in LeSuer (New Prague & Montgomery), Rice, \n     Steele, McCleod, Jackson, Pine, Polk, Pope, Renville and St. \n     Louis counties. Many German-Bohemians settled in Minnesota as \n     well, mostly in the New Ulm area.\n       Recently, the Czech Ambassador to the United States, \n     Alexandr Vondra journeyed here in Minnesota. He said that \n     NATO membership would be the fulfillment of the ``century's \n     goal of the Czech state''. Here in the center of the United \n     States, Minnesota's business community is significantly \n     invested in the Czech Republic. NRG, a subsidiary of NSP is \n     the 5th largest investor in the Czech Republic where they are \n     building an electric power generating plant in Kladno. Other \n     Minnesota corporations with substantial business interests in \n     the Czech Republic include: 3-M, the Carlson Companies, \n     Ecolab, Honeywell, H.B. Fuller, Land O'Lakes, Midwest \n     Imports, Pillsbury, Radisson Hotels, Toro, Thermo-King and \n     many smaller companies such as mine. In the past eight years \n     all of Minnesota's major educational institutions have had \n     Czech students studying here and returning to work in law \n     firms, private industry and the media as many Americans have \n     lived and settled in the Czech Republic.\n       But something curious is happening in the United States. \n     It's called isolationism. David Gergen said in a U.S. News \n     and World Report article, October 27, 1997 ``Americans from \n     boardrooms to college classrooms are embracing the rest of \n     the world as never before. Business people and students are \n     heading overseas  . . . while our political leadership is \n     staying at home. U.S. companies have increased their exports \n     by 40%, many now earning more than half of the revenue \n     overseas  . . . Not long ago, our public leaders personally \n     knew the chancellor of Germany and the prime minister of \n     Japan at least as well as the President did. In 1995, some \n     200 members of the German Parliament came to Washington, not \n     one member of Congress visited Bonn. The National Security \n     Caucus Foundation in Washington reports that one third of \n     today's Senate and House members do not even have passports. \n     Some American political leaders are signaling that it is time \n     to disengage from world affairs.'' This attitude has serious \n     long term implications, not least for Americans peace, \n     security and economic stability. For, like it or not, we are \n     a major player on the world stage and we are inevitably \n     called upon to defend freedom. No one wants to see Central \n     Europe remain isolated between the East and West. Central \n     Europe's security and economic interests are Europe, Canada, \n     America and Minnesota's security and economic interests. NATO \n     ratification is a simple vote to help guarantee civil and \n     safe societies.\n       A few days ago, on January 18, NATO peacekeeper troops \n     surrounded key buildings in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     just hours after a deeply divided Parliament elected a \n     moderate Prime Minister for the Bosnic Serb Republic. NATO \n     peacekeepers also circled a ministry building in the eastern \n     town of Bijeljina. The Bosnia Serb conflict has cost billions \n     compared to the estimates for NATO expansion. The lesson to \n     be learned is simple; pay now or pay later.\n       So, here in Central United States, I trust that the \n     Minnesota House and Senate will each enact resolutions \n     joining other State Legislatures around our country urging \n     the United States Senate to ratify the expansion of NATO to \n     include the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. In conclusion, Mr. President, this Resolution of \nRatification provides the Senate with a historic opportunity to shape \nthe strategic landscape of Europe.\n  At the end of the Cold War, there was a lot of discussion about the \n``peace dividend''--the financial savings which would accrue from the \nend of the superpower rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. \nWell, the expansion of NATO reflects the true ``peace dividend''--the \nextension of a zone of security to codify the gains of freedom and \ndemocracy for three more nations and ensure that they will never again \nbe encroached.\n  Mr. President, the United States has a national security interest in \nassuring the stability of Central Europe. I am convinced that the best \nway to do that is to enlarge NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic.\n  As Czech President Vaclav Havel, a man who I respect and admire, has \nwarned, ``If the West does not stabilize the East the East will \ndestabilize the West.'' Mr. President, we have an obligation to our \ntroops stationed in Europe and to future generations of Americans to do \neverything in our power to make sure it is the West which stabilizes \nthe East and war will never again be precipitated by a power vacuum in \nCentral Europe.\n  Mr. President, I will cast my vote in favor of expanding NATO to \ninclude Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, recognizing that this \nis one of the most important votes that I will take in the Senate. I \nurge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for allowing me about \n20 seconds. May I also say to the Senator from Minnesota, who has just \nspoken, and the Senator from Indiana that I subscribe to their remarks \nand appreciate the strength of their statements.\n  Mr. President, the United States Senate today has the rare \nopportunity to right a historical wrong. In the years immediately \nfollowing World War II, Europe was forcibly divided. As the United \nStates helped to rebuild the nations of Western Europe, the nations of \nCentral and Eastern Europe were subjugated under the heavy hand of \nSoviet domination. To counter this Soviet expansion into Europe, the \nUnited States and its Western European allies forged the most effective \ndefense alliance in modern history, the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization. The military and political strength of this alliance made \nit the guarantor of an unprecedented period of peace in Western Europe \nand contributed significantly to the eventual demise of the Soviet \nUnion.\n  Today, the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are free, and three \nof them--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--are seeking to take \nadvantage of an opportunity denied them following World War II, the \nopportunity to join NATO, an alliance described by Harvard Professor \nSamuel Huntington as ``the security organization of Western \ncivilization [whose] primary purpose [in the post-Cold War world] is to \ndefend and preserve that civilization.'' It is my hope that the United \nStates Senate will grant them this opportunity--an opportunity that \nthese nations deserve and have earned.\n  In the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, these \nthree nations have demonstrated a commitment to the Western ideals \nembodied by the NATO alliance. Their dogged pursuit of democratic \ninstitutions, free market economies, and human freedom will serve to \nremind the existing members of NATO what it means to be a part of the \nWestern world. Indeed, their dedication to these ideals is all the more \nzealous because they know first hand what it is like to suffer under a \nregime that denies its citizens basic human freedom.\n  The enlargement of the NATO alliance to include Poland, Hungary, and \nthe Czech Republic serves America's national interests. The essence of \nthe U.S. national interest in the world is promoting the security, \nwell-being, and expansion of the community of nations that respect \ntheir citizens' democratic rights. Although this is a moral policy, it \nis not an entirely altruistic one. The freedom, prosperity, and \nsecurity of Americans--our standard of living and\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\nour domestic civil liberties--all are enhanced and bolstered when this \ncommunity of free nations grows bigger and stronger, especially when it \ndoes so in Europe, where our closest allies and our most profound \ninterests are concentrated.\n  The enlargement of NATO will also send a clear message to any power \nwho may wish to interfere with the ongoing process of democratization \nin Europe: you will not succeed, so do not even try.\n  I know that the enlargement of NATO will not be free. Clearly, \nadditional financial resources will be required on the part of all NATO \nmembers--old and new alike. These new costs must be shared equitably by \nall allies. Although enlargement will ultimately require an increased \nfinancial commitment by the United States, I believe that the \nsubstantial dividends that will accrue to the U.S. from enlargement \njustify our strong support for this endeavor.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the admission of Poland, Hungary, and \nthe Czech Republic to NATO, so that, as Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright recently noted, ``three nations who have long been our allies \nin spirit will become our allies in fact.'' It is the right thing to \ndo, and it serves our national interest.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2310\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I call up an amendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2310.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In paragraph (1) of section 3, after ``(1) The strategic \n     concept of nato.--'' insert the following:\n       (A) Policy of the united states toward the strategic \n     concept of nato.--The Senate understands that the initial \n     adaptation of NATO's strategy for the post-Cold War \n     environment is contained in the Strategic Concept of NATO (as \n     defined in (1)(E)), and that its core concepts remain \n     relevant today as the North Atlantic Alliance approaches the \n     21st century. The Senate understands that the policy of the \n     United States toward the revised Strategic Concept shall \n     reflect that fact and shall be based upon the following \n     principles:\n       (i) First and foremost a military alliance.--NATO is first \n     and foremost a military alliance. NATO's success in securing \n     peace is predicated on its military strength and strategic \n     unity.\n       (ii) Principal foundation for defense of security interests \n     of nato members.--NATO serves as the principal foundation for \n     collectively defending the security interests of its members \n     against external threats.\n       (iii) Promotion and protection of united states vital \n     national security interests.--Strong United States leadership \n     of NATO promotes and protects United States vital national \n     security interests.\n       (iv) United states leadership role.--The United States \n     maintains its leadership role of NATO through the stationing \n     of United States combat forces in Europe, providing military \n     commanders for key NATO commands, and through the presence of \n     United States nuclear forces on the territory of Europe.\n       (v) Common threats.--NATO members will face common threats \n     to their security in the post-Cold War environment, \n     including--\n       (I) the potential for the re-emergence of a hegamonic power \n     confronting Europe;\n       (II) rogue states and non-state actors possessing nuclear, \n     biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver \n     these weapons by ballistic or cruise missiles, or other \n     unconventional delivery means;\n       (III) threats of a wider nature, including the disruption \n     of the flow of vital resources, and other possible \n     transnational threats; and\n       (IV) conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from \n     ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic disputes \n     or the actions of undemocratic leaders.\n       (vi) Core mission of nato.--Defense planning will reaffirm \n     a commitment by NATO members to a credible capability for \n     collective self-defense, which remains the core mission of \n     NATO. All NATO members will contribute to this core mission.\n       (vii) Capacity to respond to common threats.--NATO's \n     continued success requires a credible military capability to \n     deter and respond to common threats. Building on its core \n     capabilities for collective self-defense of its members, NATO \n     will ensure that its military force structure, defense \n     planning, command structures, and force goals promote NATO's \n     capacity to project power when the security of a NATO member \n     is threatened, and provide a basis for ad hoc coalitions of \n     willing partners among NATO members. This will require that \n     NATO members possess national military capabilities to \n     rapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations \n     for extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the \n     United States in high intensity conflicts.\n       (viii) Integrated military structure.--The Integrated \n     Military Structure of NATO underpins NATO's effectiveness as \n     a military alliance by embedding NATO members in a process of \n     cooperative defense planning and ensuring unity of command.\n       (ix) Nuclear posture.--Nuclear weapons will continue to \n     make an essential contribution to deterring aggression, \n     especially aggression by potential adversaries armed with \n     nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. A credible NATO \n     nuclear deterrent posture requires the stationing of United \n     States nuclear forces in Europe, which provides an essential \n     political and military link between Europe and North America, \n     and the widespread participation of NATO members in nuclear \n     roles. In addition, the NATO deterrent posture will continue \n     to ensure uncertainty in the mind of any potential aggressor \n     about the nature of the response by NATO members to military \n     aggression.\n       (x) Burdensharing.--The responsibility and financial burden \n     of defending the democracies of Europe will be more equitably \n     shared in a manner in which specific obligations and force \n     goals are met by NATO members.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, again, thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the resolution calling upon the \nSenate to advise and consent to the ratification of the Protocols of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hungary \nand the Czech Republic.\n  This is an important debate, an important week for this Chamber, for \nthis country, for our alliance with our friends in Europe and, indeed, \nfor global security. I appreciate very much the quality of the debate \nand the thoughtfulness of it as it has proceeded this afternoon. I must \nsay that I am honored to be part of this debate and grateful to my \nconstituents in Connecticut for giving me the chance to do so.\n  It is a debate that looks backward and forward, and its significance \ngoes in both directions.\n  Looking backward in our history and in the history of Europe, it \ncould well be said that the enlargement of NATO to now encompass these \nfirst three countries that lived under Soviet domination is a \nratification of the end of the cold war. It is a validation that we \nhave learned the lessons of that war.\n  Looking forward, it is, in my opinion, and respectfully, directly at \nodds with those who oppose expansion and spoke earlier this afternoon, \nit is the best step that we can take to protect and sustain the peace \nand freedom that now has broken out across the European Continent. So I \nappreciate very much the opportunity to participate in this debate.\n  Mr. President, there are three principles, three values, three ideas, \nthree purposes that I want to speak about this afternoon in supporting \nNATO enlargement. They are freedom, collective defense and the \npromotion of peace. Each of those three, I think, speaks powerfully on \nbehalf of the need to enlarge NATO, on the wisdom of that move.\n  I want to speak particularly about freedom, because that principle \nmay be lost in the strategic discussions and in the practical and \ntactical concerns that people in the circle may have about the effect \nof NATO enlargement.\n  Freedom is at the heart of what it means to be an American. Freedom \nis at the heart of the American experience, and it is at the center of \nNATO and the NATO experience. The quest for freedom is what drove the \nfounders of our country here, and they, in turn, were motivated by \ntheir faith, by their own quest for personal freedom and by the \nunderstanding their faith gave them that they expressed at the very \noutset of the Declaration of Independence, that all of us are created \nequal and we are blessed with certain rights--life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness--not by any assemblage of our fellow human beings, \nlegislators, lawyers, philosophers, but we are endowed with those \nrights to freedom by our Creator. Freedom, the pulsating, motivating \nprinciple of the American experience, expressed in the declaration, \nfought for throughout our history, fought for particularly in this \ncentury in two great and terrible wars in Europe.\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\n  After the second of those, when another threat arose to freedom in \nEurope from Soviet communism, the leaders of the Western European \ncountries and the leader of the United States at that time, President \nHarry Truman, saw the need to come together in a military alliance, \nNATO, to protect what had been won, the freedom that had been won \nduring the Second World War and to try to roll back the advance of \ntyranny and communism that had begun to occur in Europe under Soviet \ndomination.\n\n  That is what NATO is all about. Yes, I understand it is a military \nalliance, but it is a military alliance in defense of a principle, and \nthat principle is freedom, individual human dignity and worth, as \nexpressed in our Declaration, as I described a moment ago.\n  Political freedom, religious freedom, the right to express oneself, \nthe right to pursue one's own economic well-being without being \ndictated to by a central government--that is what NATO is about, a \nmilitary alliance in defense of a principle. And that is what the cold \nwar was about, not just a clash of blocs or power groupings; it was a \ngreat clash of ideas.\n  Freedom against tyranny, the right of the individual against the \nright of the state to dictate to the individual; state-controlled \neconomy against market economies. And freedom won, individual dignity \nwon, market economies won. It is a remarkable story whose heroes are \nnumberless, the soldiers in NATO who stood guard over those decades of \nthe cold war, the proud and effective leaders of the Western \ndemocracies, the people who understood what was at risk and stood side \nby side in defense of these principles.\n  In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union began to collapse, \nand the countries that lived under its domination, not just the people \nof Russia, among whom there are so many heroes who brought this about, \nbut the people in the constituent countries of the former Soviet Union \nwho had lived under tyranny, whose national identities had been \ntemporarily erased, at least from public expression, certainly not from \nwithin their own conscience, whose right to worship as they wished had \nbeen suppressed and stifled, whose drive to better themselves by \nworking to build a better life for their family, to profit, to achieve \nsuccess was undermined, was crushed by the power of the bloated \nbureaucratic Communist state.\n  Those people who were suddenly freed, freed by the collapse of the \nSoviet Union, understood what the cold war was about, understood it was \nabout freedom and understood what NATO is about. That is why they have \ncome to us to ask for inclusion.\n  After all those years of living in effective slavery, they have \nturned to us and said, ``By the grace of God and good leadership and \nfaith, now we have the opportunity to express our national will, our \nindividual selves to be free, to prosper,'' and they have turned to \nNATO and not to the European Union, as some of my colleagues would urge \nthem to do, because they understand what the past was about and what \nthe future is going to be about.\n  Yes, NATO is a military alliance, but it is a military alliance in \ndefense of a principle, which is freedom, and freedom and security \nprecede commerce.\n  Of course, inclusion in the European Union is important. But these \ncountries now knocking at the door of the family of freedom, asking to \nbecome members of our community of freedom, they understand the \nsignificance of NATO.\n\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the Chair.)\n  And for us, who for years during the cold war would speak out across \nthe Iron Curtain that dropped in the middle of Europe and say to the \npeople in the suppressed countries--we used to call them the people of \nthe captive nations; they were captives --``Rise up. Be strong. Have \nfaith. A day will come when the Soviet Union will collapse or be \ndefeated. You will have your opportunity to be free and we will welcome \nyou into the community of free nations.''\n  That is what they are asking. Will we now turn our backs on them and \nthe principle, the idea, the value of freedom that motivated us \nthroughout the cold war and motivates them today? I hope not. I do not \nthink so. I do not believe we will.\n  Mr. President, collective defense is the second reason why we ought \nto expand the NATO alliance to embrace these three nations and keep the \ndoor open for others as they meet the tests, the standards.\n  NATO, from the outset, was a military alliance to provide for the \ncollective defense, to protect member nations from attack from an \noutside enemy. It was started quite clearly as a defensive alliance \nagainst Soviet aggression. We had hundreds of thousands of troops in \nEurope ourselves to protect our allies and ultimately ourselves from \nthat danger.\n  Now, times have changed. Fortunately, the threat of aggression from \nthe East is not there. Some say that an alliance, a military alliance \ncan only last as long as the threat that engendered it. Now that that \nthreat is gone, some say NATO really ultimately will dissipate.\n  Well, would that it were so that there were not threats in the world \nthat should tie the member nations and those who choose to be added to \nNATO together in common defense. My colleagues have mentioned them. I \nwill only repeat them very briefly. Today, the threats may be more from \nthe south of NATO than from the east, from weapons of mass destruction, \nfrom terrorism, from threats via ballistic missiles.\n  We may well--hopefully soon--work with our allies in NATO to form a \nregional missile defense to protect member nations from the threats \nposed by the high-tech war that we and our allies face.\n  So I would say, unfortunately, though security is greater than it was \non the European Continent during the cold war, there is still much to \nworry about. A strong NATO, working together, surely can provide a \nbetter defense against those common enemies than nations alone.\n  In fact, Mr. President, though the NATO treaty, as originally \nstated--article V--talked about each member being obliged to defend and \nprotect member states who might be attacked, it talked about focus on \nconflict within the area that is NATO. Clearly in our times some of \nthose threats may come from outside--threats to security of the member \nnations.\n  It was not so many years ago--it was 1990 and 1991--when Saddam \nHussein drove his Iraqi Army into Kuwait, threatening not just the \nindependence of that small country, but the energy supply on which not \nonly we but our European allies and others depend. The gulf war, \nOperation Desert Storm, was not explicitly a NATO action, but it was \nsurely NATO in the experience that we had together within NATO. That \nwas not only the place on which the defense and counteroffensive \nagainst Saddam could be fashioned and formed, but it was where over \nthose many decades we had learned to work so well together.\n\n  So, in fact, I view the enlargement of NATO in our time, the post-\ncold war time, as the best step that the United States can take to \nbring others to share our burden of world leadership. We say repeatedly \nwe are not going to be the policemen of the world, but the fact is that \nwe are the world's only remaining global superpower, and responsibility \nand interests come with that.\n  Our alliance in NATO is a place in which we can find allies to share \nthe burden when a threat affects the security of the United States and \nother member nations of the NATO alliance and organization. The three \nnations that seek accession to NATO, Hungary, Poland and the Czech \nRepublic, have already helped us in Bosnia and elsewhere. Some helped \nduring the gulf war. They add 200,000 troops to the NATO forces on the \nEuropean Continent, providing hope that less will be asked of the \nUnited States, or at least we will only be asked in a more \nproportionate way when these three nations and perhaps others in the \nfuture are added.\n  The third reason why I support this resolution so strongly, Mr. \nPresident, is the promotion of peace. That is to remember that NATO \nfrom the outset was never just a defensive alliance. It was always an \norganization which was aimed at promoting peace among its members, not \njust to bring its members together in alliance to protect them against \noutside threats. But acknowledging the war-torn history of Europe, \nfeeling still the pain, the sting, the horror of the two World Wars \nthat preceded it, NATO was formed to create an organization in which \ncommon interests could be stressed, yes, through\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\nmilitary alliance, but through the sharing of opportunities and \nchallenges. It has worked magnificently in that regard, and it will \nwork even better in this post-cold war period to bring nations formerly \nunder Soviet domination in Central and Eastern Europe within that zone \nof peace, within that community of which peace will be promoted and \nconflict will be avoided. That is the record of the now almost five \ndecades of NATO in terms of the amity, the civility, the cordiality of \nthe relations among previous enemies, now members, of NATO, and it will \ncontinue to play that role as we expand NATO to other countries on the \nEuropean Continent. The fact is that it has already begun to happen in \nanticipation of this effort to accede to NATO membership of the three \nwe are focused on today. And other nations hoping for NATO membership \nhave begun to resolve long-standing conflicts.\n  The conflict between the Hungarians and the Romanians comes to mind. \nThat is the drive--the momentum will be on the side of conflict \nresolution among the member states of NATO and those who choose to \nbecome members in promoting peace on the European continent and again \nlearning the lessons of the war-torn history of Europe.\n  Mr. President, a final word about Russia. It is from within Russia \nthat the Soviet Union and communism that I have spoken of and the \ndenial of freedom began. It is from within Russia under the historic \nprogressive leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and from within the hearty \nand heroic band who resisted tyranny even as it began to rear its head \nagain after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. It is from within Russia \nthat this historic change began.\n  It began, as I said earlier, and occurred because of the \nsteadfastness, the sense of purpose, the heroism of people in the NATO \nalliance and Western Europe and the United States, and it began after a \nlong period of suffering by those who lived within Russia and within \nthe member states of the former Soviet Union under Soviet domination.\n  It has to be a central tenet of priority of our foreign and defense \npolicy to develop good relations with Russia. We have worked mightily \nat that. But I must say, as I hear some of those who oppose expansion, \nenlargement of NATO, who are prepared to blame enlargement of NATO on \nanything that goes wrong in Russia, I simply cannot accept that \nprediction. Those who foresee the most dire consequences of NATO \nenlargement, including, as some have suggested here, the heightened \npossibility of nuclear war--I simply do not see it. These arguments in \nsome ways seem more psychoanalytical than geopolitical, more \npsychological than strategic.\n  Yes, I know that Russia has struggled and has much work to do. I \nsimply echo and embrace by association the comments of the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Lugar, on this course. The fact is that Russia has come \nsome distance in spite of the challenges it has faced. It has sustained \na democratically elected government. It has fought off attempts to \ncreate denials of freedom within the country. If there is a threat to \nthe continued movement forward of freedom within Russia, if there is a \nthreat that will somehow raise the possibility of nuclear conflict with \nRussia, it is not the enlargement of NATO.\n  I must say, as I speak to members of the Russian Government and \nprivate citizens, including businesspeople and think-tank people, I \nknow there are some in the political community who are opposed to the \nenlargement of NATO, but honestly I do not find it to be the priority \nof concern that some on this floor have suggested.\n  The fact is, as the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Grams, said, every \npoll I have seen taken in Russia shows that the people list NATO \nenlargement far down in their itemization of concerns they have about \nWestern behavior. Think about how we and our people would feel if we \nwere in Russia. What would be more important to us--that NATO is about \nto accept Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic into this alliance or \nthat I am not getting my paycheck for working at the shipyard, or I am \nnot getting my pensioners' check as a retired person, or my children's \neducation is not as good as it used to be? Those are the things that \nthe Russians are focused on. Those are the threats to stability if it \nexists within the Soviet Union. Those constitute the ground in which a \nmore aggressive and warlike leadership might--I hope never will--but \nmight arise again in Russia, not NATO enlargement.\n\n  It simply, respectfully, does not make sense to me that that is the \ncase. I have said before we have worked hard at building good relations \nwith Russia. The Founding Act creates an institutionalized relationship \nbetween Russia and NATO that some feel actually goes too far. I think \nit is appropriately balanced.\n  The relationship between President Clinton, President Yeltsin, Vice \nPresident Gore, former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and presumably the \nnew Prime Minister Kiriyenko, is very strong. If we have had a \nshortcoming in our policy, in our post-cold war reaction to Russia that \nmay have squandered an opportunity, which is a phrase that one of those \nwho opposed NATO enlargement spoke about earlier, it is not to enlarge \nNATO, it is that we did not rush in early enough and broadly enough to \nhelp the Russians build their economy in the period after the Berlin \nWall fell.\n  There were some great voices at that time--late President Nixon, most \nprominently at that point, speaking to the historic opportunity we had. \nThe truth is what we delivered was timid, was weak, was insufficient. \nIf we squandered an opportunity, it was at that moment when, as some \nsaid, we might well in our own self-interest have adopted the \nequivalent of a Marshall Plan for Russia, encouraging and creating \nincentives for American businesses to go over and invest there and \ncreate opportunity. Not enough of that has happened. Very little of \nthat has happened. It is in that neglect that we planted the seeds that \nmight--again we hope and pray never will--grow into a less democratic, \nmore aggressive Russian, but not NATO, enlargement.\n  Let us come back to this. So much of the opposition to this \nenlargement is based on the effect it will have on Russia. That is what \nI said earlier, and I say respectfully, this becomes an argument more \nin psychoanalysis than in geopolitics or reality. NATO is a defensive \nalliance. NATO has no hostile intent on Russia. Does Russia fear \nmilitary aggression from Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland? Of \ncourse not. So why do we yield to what we see or fear may be the \nopposition within Russia to the enlargement of NATO? When we do that, \nwhen we yield, we do something far more damaging. That is, we forget \nthe principle I spoke about at the beginning, which is freedom. We \nforget what Winston Churchill said about that Iron Curtain falling in \nthe middle of Europe. We forget what Harry Truman spoke to us when he \njoined in the creation of NATO, as he watched the Soviet threat in \nEurope against freedom. We forget what President Kennedy did at the \nBerlin Wall in the confrontation of Berlin in the 1960s. We forget what \nPresident Reagan said about the evil empire. Why was it evil? Because \nit denied its people freedom. And we forget we fought that cold war \nover an arbitrary, dictatorial, unnatural division in Europe which \ndenied the principle of freedom, the line Stalin forced in Europe.\n  So will we now, because of our fear--strange for a victor, the \nworld's global superpower, to have such fear--will we now redraw that \nline by shutting people in Central and Eastern Europe out of the \ncommunity of free nations? I don't believe we will. I am confident that \nmore than the necessary number of our colleagues here in the Senate \nwill see the historic opportunity we have to validate the end of the \ncold war, to uphold the principle on which it was at fault, and to \ncreate the conditions for peace and security in Europe among the member \nnations of NATO as those members expand and together between them, in a \nfree, secure, and strong Russia.\n\n  Mr. President, I close with words of one of the heroes of the century \nand certainly the heroes of the post-cold-war period, Vaclav Havel, who \nwrote almost a year ago in the New York Times, May 13, 1997:\n\n       The [NATO] alliance should urgently remind itself that it \n     is first and foremost an instrument of democracy, intended to \n     defend mutually held and created political and spiritual \n     values. It must see itself not as a pact of nations against a \n     more or less obvious enemy, but as a guarantor of Euro-\n     American civilization and, thus, as a pillar of global \n     security.\n\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\n\n  That is what this debate is about. I look forward to the dialog as it \ncontinues this week. It is a critically important debate, and I hope \nthat we will join it directly and not hesitate to speak forcefully but, \nof course, respectfully to one another. That much is at stake here.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nMissouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am happy to have this opportunity to \nrise and discuss some of the ramifications of the proposed expansion of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A number of issues have \nreceived attention, and it is appropriate that we focus on those issues \nand give them very, very close scrutiny. The cost of enlargement, for \ninstance, deserves our attention; the political and strategic benefits \nor deficits that of new NATO members deserves our attention; and \nfinally, the effect of NATO expansion on the relationship of the United \nStates with the Soviet Union deserve the Senate's full attention.\n  But while all these issues are important, I think in some respects \nthey divert inquiry into a fundamental issue regarding NATO's future, \nand that is, ``What is the purpose of the organization?'' Is the \npurpose of the organization being altered inappropriately? Is it being \ntransitioned away from that for which it was initially called into \nexistence?\n  The expansion of NATO and the question about whether it should or \nshould not be expanded is significant. But defining the purpose of the \norganization is even more significant.\n  I just might, in an aside here, mention that I am not sure we can \nredefine NATO. One of the most serious questions I raise is, Is it \npossible for NATO to be redefined without the redefinition being \nsubject to the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate? If a treaty, once \nit is enacted and ratified by the United States, could then be changed \nwithout the U.S. Senate again offering its advice and consent, we would \nnever need but to enter into one or two treaties, and then, \nsubsequently, administrations could transfer, transition, enlarge, \nsubtract, or shrink the treaty in accordance with the particular \nforeign policy strategy of the moment. A treaty's purpose might be \ndistorted from defense to trade, or otherwise changed, if it is \npossible to change a treaty without being subject again to the Senate' \nadvice and consent.\n  Now, we obviously find ourselves, with the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, looking at a treaty designed to protect the member states \nfrom a hostile foreign invasion. The Soviet Union no longer exists. \nThere are nations that were a part of the Soviet Union that now exist, \nbut we find ourselves with a significantly different configuration of \nforces and challenges to the United States. Challenges to the member \nstates of NATO are different than they were when the treaty was called \ninto existence in 1949.\n  So I think it is important now for the U.S. Senate--which is, if you \nwill, the quality control organization as it relates to U.S. treaties--\nto ensure that U.S. treaty commitments are not expanded inappropriately \nand the American people are not subjected to obligations that have not \nbeen approved through the proper constitutional processes. The U.S. \nSenate has a role of assessing the quality of treaties as they proceed \nthrough the Senate before the Senate's imprimatur of approval is given.\n  Here we stand at this moment in time debating perhaps the most \nsuccessful collective defense organization in the history of the world, \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO still stands, although the \nspecific threat for which it was created has disappeared for the time \nbeing. We have to ask ourselves at this juncture, ``What is the purpose \nof the treaty?'' Would some try to change the purpose of the treaty? Is \nit appropriate or possible to change the treaty, without amending the \ntreaty, just by beginning to lean everyone in one direction, to turn \nthe treaty to one side or another, or begin to assert that there are \nnew things to be considered because the treaty is evolving?\n  I have to say to you, Mr. President, I don't believe in treaty \nevolution anymore than I believe in the evolution of the Constitution. \nIf you could just evolve treaties, as I said, U.S. treaty commitments \nwould seldom have to be brought before the Senate. In this case, NATO \nwould be evolving and going on its way, entangling this country with \npotentially serious obligations which place in jeopardy the lives and \nfortunes of those who serve in our armed forces and those who support \nthe military. I think we have to be very careful that we don't allow \ntreaties to simply evolve.\n  It is interesting to me that as we work to address where NATO is and \nthe purpose of the organization, that we be clear about what it is \nsupposed to do. What is interesting to me is that there is a group of \nindividuals who now say that NATO is totally different than the \norganization created in 1949.\n  I want to call attention to this idea that NATO, which was once \ndesigned to protect individuals in the North Atlantic area, is now, \naccording to a number of people, becoming an organization with a global \nscope. Expanding the scope of NATO has serious ramifications: if the \nresponsibility of NATO is no longer confined to specific territory, but \nnow is global in nature, the kinds of required military devices, the \nkinds of technology, the kinds of cooperation, and the expenses are \ngoing to be massively different.\n  Here is what the immediate past U.S. Secretary of Defense, William \nPerry, said in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nthe 19th day of March of this year:\n\n       The original mission of NATO--deterring an attack from the \n     Soviet Union--is obviously no longer relevant.\n\n  Well, I would say the Soviet Union might be reconstituted, or there \ncertainly might be a threat, but we will give him that much.\n  The original geographical area of NATO responsibility is no longer \nsufficient'', Mr. Perry continues.\n  Sufficient for what? It is sufficient for the people who live in that \narea. NATO helps secure the homes and livelihoods of people in the \nNorth Atlantic area.\n  Mr. Perry states, The original military structure of NATO is no \nlonger appropriate.\n  We are going from a military alliance to something else.\n  He says:\n\n       The new missions--\n\n  I am taken aback. ``New missions''? How can a treaty organization \nratified by the U.S. Senate, in place for 50 years, all of a sudden \nhave new missions, new purposes?\n  Mr. Perry continues, ``The new missions of NATO should be preventive \ndefense--creating the conditions for peace in Europe.''\n  Mr. Perry refers to Europe--not NATO member nations. There are a \nnumber of nonmember nations in the European area. All of a sudden, we \nare expanding beyond the concept of a group of individual countries who \nhave agreed to defend themselves to the projection of a peace guarantee \non an entire continent.\n  Mr. Perry continues, ``The geographical area of NATO interests should \nbe anywhere in the world * * *''\n  Mr. President, that is a substantial change. That is a significant \ndeparture. This is not the traditional understanding of NATO. This is \nnot in the language of the original treaty. This is an effort to make \nNATO a worldwide organization. ``* * * anywhere in the world where \naggression can threaten the security of NATO members.''\n  I wish to emphasize that we need to be very careful about anybody who \nthreatens the security of NATO members. But what does this \nadministration mean when it makes statements endorsing a global NATO? \nWe don't have to rely on the former U.S. Secretary of Defense for \nguidance on that question. We can go to the current Secretary of State. \nAccording to the Washington Post, Secretary Albright ``also has urged \nthat an expanding national North Atlantic Treaty Organization must \nextend its geographic reach beyond the European continent and evolve \ninto a `force for peace from the Middle East to Central Africa.' ''\n  I think it is only fair that we go beyond focusing on three new \nmembers in Eastern Europe. If a new mission is really what we are \ntalking about, if this is what the intention is, the change here is far \nmore than adding three new countries. The transformation is a shift \nfrom the defense of territory--specified and outlined with\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\nclear boundaries--to an organization whose impact will be worldwide. \nAccording to the Secretary of State NATO should be a ``* * * force for \npeace from the Middle East to central Africa.''\n  If what the Senate is really considering here is the transformation \nof NATO's mission, then I think it requires us to ask, ``Is this what \nwas intended when this NATO agreement came into existence? Was it \ndesigned to have this kind of elasticity? Was it designed to evolve, as \nan ameba does, changing shape with different circumstances to fill any \nvoid? Not according to the folks who presided in the U.S. Senate in \n1949 when this great treaty organization was ratified.\n  Listen to the words of Senator Tom Connally, chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee at the time: ``Let us not forget that this \ntreaty is limited in scope. Its main purpose is to maintain the peace \nand security of the North Atlantic area. We do not propose to stretch \nits terms to cover the entire globe.''\n  It is interesting to consider these comments by Senators from the \npast. ``We do not propose to stretch its terms to cover the entire \nglobe'', stated Senator Connally. His statement offers a striking \ncontrast to the language of a globalist NATO offered by officials from \nthis administration. This administration is now supporting the \nexpansion of NATO to three new members, but is also presiding over an \nincredibly significant transition in the scope and shape of the \norganization itself.\n  In NATO, the United States was making a calibrated commitment. We \njoined NATO and considered the possible deployment of U.S. forces with \nthe utmost caution. In 1949, our Congress was not about to deploy U.S. \nforces willy-nilly around the world. The collective defense mission of \nNATO was defined explicitly in article V, and I quote: ``The parties \nagree that an armed attack against one or more of them''--of the \nparties, of the member nations--``in Europe or North America, shall be \nconsidered an attack against them all * * *''\n  Collective defense was meant to respond to an attack on the United \nStates or another NATO ally. This was an attack on the member nations \nin Europe within their borders. The allies would then take such action, \naccording to article V, as each ``deems necessary'' to restore the \npeace for those member nations.\n\n  The geographic scope of the article V commitment was defined \nexplicitly in article VI to make sure there was not any confusion. In \narticle VI, we made it clear. It said the United States would defend \nthe territory--territory of NATO members--not the interests, not the \ncommercial transactions, but the territory of the NATO members.\n  The geographical scope of Article 6 included the Mediterranean Sea \nand the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.\n  Article V says if you are attacked, you are to respond to the attack. \nArticle VI has the sort of precision of a real estate transaction, \nspecifically stating where the territory was and how it was to be \ndefended.\n  Article IV of the treaty is seen by some now as an escape hatch for \nexpansion of NATO's mission. Article IV of the treaty states: ``The \nparties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them \nthe territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any \nof the parties is threatened.'' Terms like ``territorial integrity'' \nand ``political independence'' and ``security'' flow from and reinforce \nNATO's collective defense mission.\n  As I will argue in more detail, undergirding NATO's collective \ndefense mission was the purpose of article IV. Article IV was not a \nloophole for any military operation the North Atlantic Council could \ndream up.\n  One of the things I think the Senate should consider carefully is the \nexpansion of NATO, not just by membership but by mission--from the \ndefense of territory to the defense of interests, which is the \ndirection in which things are pointed. If we go from defending \nterritory to defending interests and following those interests, as \nSecretary Perry indicated and Secretary Albright has indicated, to \nremote locations on the globe, that threatens some of the very \nessential purposes of NATO. If you squander defense resources or if \nyour forces are so thinly deployed, it can be very damaging and \nundermining to the capacity to respond to a real security threat.\n  It would be terrible to think that we would have our forces so far-\nflung that we could not respond to a real security threat. I have to \nsay this: Right now the administration is so willing to deploy U.S. \ntroops and so unwilling to provide resources for the military that we \nare stretching our resources very thin. If we want to put ourselves in \nreal jeopardy by stretching them thinner, we should change the mission \nof NATO so that we become an international policing organization \neffectively answering 911 calls anywhere around the world. Secretary \nPerry says anywhere around the globe. Secretary Albright says in the \nMiddle East and throughout central Africa.\n  The United States is extending defense commitments to these three new \npotential NATO countries while slashing its defense resources--a 27-\npercent cut in defense spending over the last 8 years. We need to be \nvery careful. If your defense spending is falling and your defense \ndeployments are rising, you have very low resources to meet high \ncommitments, placing yourself in serious jeopardy.\n  Most Americans have agreed we have to have an ability to fight at \nleast in two regions. If we cannot fight in two regions, and if we get \ninto any kind of a struggle somewhere, it is an invitation for an \naggressor somewhere else to start something. I mean, after all, if we \nwere involved in the Middle East and we only had a capacity to defend \none area, that would be the only area we could defend. It would invite \nrogue regimes, dictators, to be involved somewhere else pretty quickly. \nNorth Korea might decide to send its people over the border en masse. \nSo the United States has to sustain the capacity to fight in two \nregions.\n\n  John Hillen writes in the National Review that we are losing that \nkind of capacity.\n\n       In 1998, almost all the active Army's heavy-tank and \n     armored-cavalry units outside of Korea and Bosnia would have \n     to go to the Persian Gulf in order to equal the fighting \n     power of America's VII Corps in 1991. And the VII Corps was \n     only one of three American corps engaged in Desert Storm. In \n     other words, it would take all the fighting materiel we have \n     to make up one of the three corps that were fighting in \n     Desert Storm. Given the fact that we have the commitments we \n     have in both Korea and Bosnia, we have to be careful we don't \n     hollow out the force. And expanding the mission, broadening \n     the range of deployments, expanding NATO from the defense of \n     territory to the defense of interests could further hollow \n     out our armed forces.\n\n  Here's how NATO expansion will increase U.S. security commitments.\n\n       Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic comprise 301,000 \n     square miles of new NATO territory and 2,612 miles of new \n     NATO frontier to which the collective defense commitment is \n     extended.\n       Total national defense spending fell by 27 percent over the \n     last 8 years.\n\n  If we are going to be a part of defending this new territory, I \nwonder about whether we can do it with a plummeting rate of investment \nin national defense.\n\n       Outside normal training and alliance commitments, the Army \n     conducted 10 ``operational events'' between 1960-91, and 26 \n     since 1991.\n\n  There you have it. We are sending our troops all over the world, and \nyou wonder if we can do that without hollowing out the force when we \nhave a 27 percent drop in our funding.\n\n       The Marine Corps conducted 15 ``contingency operations'' \n     between '82 and '89, and 62 since the fall of the Berlin \n     Wall.\n\n  We are sending our people all over the place and we are not funding \nthem the way we really should.\n\n       According to the Army Chief of Staff Dennis Reimer, the \n     Army reduced manpower by 36 percent while increasing the \n     number of deployed operations by 300 percent.\n\n  Can you forever shrink your resource base and increase your \ndeployment?\n  President Reagan's Deputy Undersecretary of Defense states:\n\n       Like Gulliver's enfeeblement by the Lilliputians, [the \n     U.S.] will be tied down in so many parts of the world for so \n     long that it will be hard-pressed to respond to the major \n     threats against which only overwhelming force would prove \n     effective.\n\n  I think the point I want to make here is we have to be very careful \nin expanding the mission, changing the mission of NATO from a defense-\nof-territory to a defense-of-interest mission, projecting deployments \nin central Africa and\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\na wide variety of other places, as Secretary Perry indicated, around \nthe globe. Are we making sure we have the necessary defense resources \nin the event there is a real security challenge? If we are stamping out \nbrushfires on the other side of the world, can we defend ourselves \nagainst a firefight in our own backyard?\n  These are the kinds of things that I think are important. I don't \nthink this administration has made very serious strategic assessments \nabout NATO expansion. ``We must pledge that the first new members will \nnot be the last,'' according to Secretary Albright, ``and that no \nEuropean democracy will be excluded because of where it sits on the \nmap.'' In other words, come one, come all. We are not going to make \nstrategic judgments. In the real world, real soldiers die defending \nreal borders.\n  I intend to ask the Senate to make a clear statement on the mission \nof NATO, a mission that is a defense of territory, not just a defense \nof interests. I know that Senator Roberts of Kansas and Senator Warner \nof Virginia have expressed their interest in this respect. We need to \npass an amendment that will make sure that the Senate will not be \nendorsing what I call ``treaty creep,'' where we just allow a creeping \nmission to get us to the place where we are no longer able to sustain \nthose things which ought to be sustained.\n  It is with that in mind that I will be offering an amendment which \nwould be added to the resolution of ratification. I hope that Members \nof the Senate will take into account the importance of understanding \nthat we cannot dilute the capacity of the United States to defend its \nown freedom and to fulfill its collective defense commitment in NATO by \nmaking the breadth of this treaty so broad that it becomes a second \nUnited Nations, except this time with a standing army. NATO should not \nbecome an organization whose forces can be deployed and put at risk \ninappropriately and unduly in a wide variety of settings not defined by \nthe territory of the members of the North Atlantic area.\n  It is with that in mind that I look forward to submitting the \namendment and defending the opportunity to place in the resolution of \nratification clear language which will define and reassert the only \nvalid definition of NATO, its original purpose, which was the defense \nof territory, political independence, and security of member states in \nthat particular organization.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the matter of NATO expansion is perhaps \nthe single most important foreign policy or defense issue to come \nbefore Congress this year. Because of the complexity of the issues \ninvolved, the importance of this decision, and its implications for our \nrelationship with Russia, I have not rushed to judgment on this \nsubject. Today, however, I would like to explain why after careful \nconsideration, I have decided to support NATO expansion.\n  The past half-century has shown the cardinal importance of American \nengagement in European affairs. Throughout the Cold War, our \ninvolvement in Europe, principally through NATO, helped provide a \ncrucial framework of peace and stability in which the countries of \nEurope have been able to develop--giving them breathing room in which \nto leave behind wartime devastation and grow into prosperous trading \npartners and allies. Today, of course, the Cold War has ended. The \nimportance of U.S. involvement in Europe, however, has not.\n  With the end of the continent's artificial division along the inter-\nGerman frontier into hostile ideological blocks, the meaning of \n``Europe'' has changed and its role in the world has evolved. If they \nare to have relevance in this new post-Cold War era, institutions built \naround Europe's previous divisions must also evolve, or else face \ncreeping irrelevance. NATO may not be important to the world in \nprecisely the way it used to be--as a breakwater against Soviet \nexpansionism--but the cooperative security arrangements it embodies \nremain vital to European stability and to world peace.\n  Mr. President, NATO stands without peer in modern times as an \ninstitution capable of effective, coordinated international action in \ntimes of crisis. More important still, however, is the Alliance's much \nmore quiet, everyday role as the ultimate underwriter of European \npeace, providing a supportive framework within which allied democracies \ncan successfully consolidate themselves after difficult periods of \ntransition and become valuable friends and partners in the best sense \nof these words. NATO expansion to incorporate the newly-liberated \ncountries of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will help ensure \nthat the Alliance remains an important guarantor of continental peace \nand stability in the years to come--and that America continues to play \nan engaged and productive role in European security.\n  I do not mean to suggest that NATO expansion has no costs, or that I \nam entirely sanguine about its potential implications.\n  I have been extremely concerned both about the anticipated financial \ncosts of NATO expansion and about its potential impact upon U.S.-\nRussian relations.\n  With regard to the costs of NATO to the American taxpayer, I have \ndiscussed my concerns with both Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen and \nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright. In particular, I have been very \nconcerned about the great variation in cost estimates given during the \nlast year or so, estimates that have ranged from a total of $35 \nbillion, or even more, over the next 10 years to a total cost of a \nrelatively small $1.5 billion, with the United States share of that \n$1.5 billion being approximately $400 million.\n  As both Secretary Cohen and Secretary Albright have pointed out to \nme, the highest estimates anticipated expanding NATO to four countries, \nrather than three, and were not based on information now available \nabout the condition of Eastern Europe's military infrastructure. I am \nthus greatly encouraged by NATO's most up-to-date financial estimates \nwhich were based upon an intensive country-by-country survey of the \nPolish, Czech and Hungarian defense establishments.\n  This latest study, the methodology of which has been endorsed by the \nGeneral Accounting Office as well as by the Department of Defense, \nindicates that the likely costs of NATO expansion are much lower than \nhad been previously estimated.\n  Mr. President, this study does not pull the wool over anyone's eyes. \nThe shrinkage of the official cost estimates since early 1997, in fact, \nrepresents movement along a learning curve, and the pleasant surprise \nof discovering, after much analysis, that Eastern European militaries \nare in much better shape than previously thought is largely responsible \nfor much of the change in the estimate.\n  There will certainly be costs to military modernization in Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic, but most of these expenses will be \nborne by the new member countries themselves. Of the remainder, we will \nshare the burden with our present NATO allies through our proportional \ncontributions to the NATO common fund. All told, these expenses will \nnot be significant compared to the benefits we will all reap from \nensuring NATO's continuing role in securing European peace and security \nand stability.\n  With respect to U.S.-Russian relations, I have also been encouraged \nby the progress of our extensive Partnership for Peace Program with \nMoscow and of our mutual efforts to ensure that Russia's decaying \nstrategic nuclear infrastructure remains secure against terrorism, \ntheft and accident. Today, Russian and NATO diplomats sit together to \ndiscuss mutual concerns on a permanent joint council convened for this \npurpose. U.S. nuclear experts work very closely with Russian \nauthorities in protecting the security of Russia's nuclear \nestablishment.\n  Significantly, these crucial cooperative efforts with Russia have \ncontinued and even accelerated as NATO expansion has become more \nimminent. Most recently, the Russian Government announced in mid-April \nthat it will push very hard to persuade the Duma to ratify START II \nstrategic arms reduction agreement with the United States. These are \nnot the hallmarks of a government preparing for a ``new cold war'' if \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic join our alliance. To the \ncontrary, U.S.-Russian relations have been growing warmer, even as NATO \nhas been preparing to expand.\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\n  I look forward, in fact, to seeing Eastern Europe develop a whole new \ncontinuum of productive relationships with the United States and the \nWest, links that range from formal NATO military ties to expanded \nPartnership for Peace relations, to ever more important economic and \ncultural ties.\n\n  The Europe of the 21st century will not be one of haves and have-nots \nwhen it comes to transnational ties. Rather, it will be a Europe bound \ntogether in a mutually reinforcing web of different but complementary \nrelationships stretching across the entire spectrum of public affairs. \nThis is a Europe to which we should look forward with eager \nanticipation, and it is one in the creation of which NATO expansion to \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic can play an important role.\n  It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that after careful \nconsideration and much deliberation I shall cast my vote in favor of \nNATO expansion. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bill \nMonahan, a fellow in my office, be allowed the privilege of the floor \nduring the consideration of this NATO enlargement resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express serious concerns about \nthis proposal to enlarge NATO. The question of whether we admit Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic to NATO needs to be judged in the \noverall context of our security needs in this post-cold war period. \nToday's security environment is uncertain and vastly different from the \nclimate of the cold war for which the NATO alliance was created. New \nthreats dominate our national security agenda. The new threats are well \nknown to all of us. They are the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, terrorism and regional instability created by rogue states \nin the Middle East or northeast Asia, the specter of accidental nuclear \nlaunch and other high priority military threats. Those are the \nimmediate security concerns which we have.\n  Yet, when I look at the national security threats that we have, it \ndoes not strike me that enlarging NATO is likely to help us meet those \nthreats. An important distinction was made by Dr. Kissinger, a former \nSecretary of State and National Security Adviser, between the role of a \nmilitary alliance and a collective security system. Dr. Kissinger--who, \nby the way, is a supporter of NATO enlargement--stressed that NATO is a \nmilitary alliance which is established for the purpose of defending a \nspecified area. In contrast, a collective security system or agreement \nis formed in response to aggression on a case-by-case basis. It does \nnot maintain forces of its own and it is not restricted to defending a \nparticular geographical area.\n  We need to ask ourselves which of these two types of organizations \nenhances our security more: Expanding a military alliance that was \nformed to defend the territory of its members against a Soviet threat \nthat no longer exists--that is one option which is the one before us, \nunfortunately--or, on the contrary, pursuing collective security \narrangements designed to meet today's threats.\n  I am concerned that this near-sighted emphasis on NATO enlargement \nmay increase rather than decrease our threat to security interest in \nEurope. At best, NATO enlargement is a distraction in that it diverts \nour attention from other higher priority concerns and alternative \nsolutions, and, at worst, it could undermine our ability to address \nthese more immediate priority military threats and perhaps reduce the \ncohesiveness of the NATO alliance upon which we have depended.\n  Which one it results in will largely depend on how we address the \nlong-term risks of NATO enlargement, how this open-ended process \nbecomes limited, and what its impact is upon the cooperative efforts \nbetween the U.S. and Russia to enhance our security mutually, the \nsecurity of the U.S. and of Russia, in the spirit of partnership.\n  If we proceed with NATO enlargement, we must ensure that we do not \nerode our ability to meet our highest priority security concerns or \npreclude alternative collective security arrangements that may more \neffectively address these concerns.\n  Mr. President, I am considering introducing several amendments to the \nSenate resolution on the protocols regarding the accession of Poland \nand Hungary and the Czech Republic. These amendments are intended to \nsafeguard against some of the potential long-term risks associated with \nNATO enlargement.\n  First, let me express support for Senator Warner's amendment to \nestablish a 3-year moratorium on further rounds of NATO enlargement. I \nam an original cosponsor of that amendment. NATO membership for Poland \nand Hungary and the Czech Republic cannot be separated from the larger \nissue of the administration's seemingly open-door policy for enlarging \nNATO.\n  According to the administration, any state of Central or Eastern \nEurope that meets certain democratic criteria is a potential candidate \nfor NATO membership. Altogether there are nearly a dozen countries that \nare or may be candidates for NATO membership in the coming years. \nIncluded in that group are the three Baltic States, Slovenia, Romania, \nAlbania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Macedonia.\n  I support the goal of integrating Central and Eastern Europe into a \nunited and democratic Europe free of the divisive legacy of the cold \nwar. But the question is, how do we achieve that goal? In this regard I \nhave some serious concerns about the administration's open-door policy \non enlarging NATO.\n  There are some fundamental questions that remain unanswered. We do \nnot know whether these three candidate countries, the three we are \nconsidering in this resolution, are militarily and economically \nprepared to contribute to NATO's common defense.\n  As several of the speakers this afternoon have mentioned, cost \nestimates for enlargement vary widely. The burdensharing arrangements \nwithin NATO are still unresolved. NATO itself is still revising its \npost-cold war strategic mission.\n  At a minimum, I believe we in the Senate, if we proceed with \nexpanding the Atlantic alliance, it is in America's and NATO's interest \nto take the time to fully assess the effects, both the costs and the \nbenefits, of this round of expansion. A 3-year pause, as suggested in \nSenator Warner's amendment, would give alliance members a reasonable \ntime to do this. If things go according to NATO's plan, then alliance \nmembers, both the new ones and the old ones, will have updated NATO's \nstrategic military mission well within that time frame. A pause would \nallow cost-sharing arrangements to be reached and payments to be \nreceived.\n  Let me turn to a few other issues that I intend to deal with by \nproposed amendment, Mr. President.\n  Currently, the NATO resolution contains language intended to require \nthe President to consult the Senate prior to consenting to invite any \nadditional states to join NATO. I commend the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee for including that provision. It ensures that the Senate will \nbe a partner in any decision to invite a state to begin accession talks \nwith NATO.\n  We should have had such a provision in place before we got to this \nsituation with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. But I intend to \nintroduce an amendment that I believe complements and strengthens the \nprovision that is now coming to the Senate floor. This amendment would \nrequire the President to report to Congress on the qualifications of \nany country being considered for NATO membership prior to the United \nStates consenting to invite that country to begin accession talks with \nNATO as was done with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in Madrid \nlast year.\n  The amendment further specifies the kind of detailed information to \nbe provided, including each potential candidate's military preparedness \nto join NATO, the costs and burdensharing arrangements for integrating \neach potential candidate into NATO, and the impact that admitting each \npotential candidate would have on NATO's cohesiveness and other \npriority U.S. security concerns.\n  The second issue that I believe needs to be addressed by amendment \nrelates to the strategic mission of NATO. Right now we in the Senate \nare being called upon to sign up to a policy of enlarging the alliance \nwithout a clear,\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\ncoherent explanation of how expansion of NATO will serve NATO's \nstrategic interests. I am concerned because NATO itself does not seem \nto have an agreed upon strategic military mission.\n\n  For several months now, NATO members have been engaged in updating \nthe alliance strategic concept. The current concept, which was last \nrevised in 1991, is outdated, and all agree on that. It fails to take \naccount of such critical events as the collapse of the Soviet Union, \nNATO'S peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, or more recently the special \nrelationships that NATO has established with Russia and the Ukraine.\n  NATO is currently debating administration proposals to expand the \nalliance's military charter to include operations in the Middle East \nand North Africa, a subject of considerable controversy for existing \nand prospective members alike. The alliance will also be reviewing its \ncritically important nuclear policies. The updated strategic concept \nwill not be completed by the time the Senate is expected to vote on \nthis round of enlargement.\n  My amendment would withhold inviting additional countries other than \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for NATO membership until after \nNATO has approved a revised strategic concept. This is simply a matter \nof setting our priorities. NATO members need to decide on the \nalliance's mission before any new candidates are asked to join. Future \ncandidates need to know what obligations they would be undertaking in \nseeking NATO membership.\n  This should not cause a delay for anyone. The expectation is that \nthis revised strategic concept will be completed this summer.\n  Once a revised Strategic Concept is agreed, existing and prospective \nNATO members will be able to judge for themselves whether further \nexpansion will in the long-run strengthen--or undermine--NATO's \neffectiveness in fulfilling its mission.\n  The third issue that I believe needs to be addressed before we \nconclude action on this proposed ratification of this treaty relates to \nthe critical question of NATO membership for the Baltic States. The \nadministration has repeatedly welcomed the aspiration of the Baltic \nStates--Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia--to join NATO, most recently in \nsigning a charter of partnership with those states this past January.\n  At the same time the administration tells us that this charter is \nneither a precommitment by the United States to NATO membership for the \nBaltic States, nor is it a backdoor U.S. security commitment to those \nstates. I believe it is critical that we be clear on the Senate's \nunderstanding of the Baltic Charter for the record. I am considering an \namendment stating that the Baltic Charter neither precommits the United \nStates to Baltic membership in NATO nor provides those states with U.S. \nsecurity commitments.\n  In addition, the NATO resolution must also be clear that it is \nessential for the administration to consult with the Senate well in \nadvance of any vote in the North Atlantic Council to invite a Baltic \nstate to begin accession talks with NATO.\n  Our military commitments must be tailored to our national security \npriorities. An open-door policy for enlarging NATO will mean further \nexpanding U.S. security commitments. At the heart of NATO is the mutual \ncommitment under article V of the North Atlantic Treaty to the common \ndefense of all NATO members in the case of attack. Since the end of the \ncold war, even as our armed forces have been reduced by a third, our \nsecurity commitments have extended to Bosnia and Iraq and Northeast \nAsia and other hot spots around the globe.\n  As we consider setting an open-ended course for expanding our \nmilitary commitments, we must keep in mind that our defense resources \nare limited. I question whether we are prepared to allocate limited \ndefense resources to ever-expanding NATO military commitments ahead of \nour other defense priorities, priorities such as force modernization, \nreadiness, or investment in research and development needed to preserve \nour technological edge.\n  I am particularly concerned about U.S. and NATO preparedness to meet \nthese article V commitments if the Baltic States are invited to join \nNATO.\n  If the United States and its allies are not prepared to meet our \narticle V commitments to the common defense of all NATO members, then \nexpansion could create alliance-threatening divisions within NATO.\n  Mr. President, I do not propose to preclude the possibility of Baltic \nmembership in NATO sometime in the future. But any invitation to the \nBaltic States would be a serious step that should first be thoroughly \nconsidered with the Senate's participation. In any case, Senate consent \nto ratification of the current protocols for Poland and Hungary and the \nCzech Republic should in no way be interpreted as a preapproval of the \nBaltic States candidacy for NATO membership.\n  One final issue I want to raise today concerns continued U.S. support \nfor the enhancement of NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative. Some \nhave argued that if the Senate does not go along with NATO enlargement, \nthe countries of Central and Eastern Europe will be abandoned in \n``strategic ambiguity,'' exiled to a no-man's-land between NATO and \nRussia. I do not accept this view. An alternative already exists in \nNATO's Partnership for Peace initiative. In this initiative, there are \n28 partner countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former \nSoviet Union, including Russia, associating themselves with NATO. This \ninitiative is an essential element to current and future peace and \nsecurity in Europe extending to central Asia.\n  Experts on both sides of this NATO enlargement issue agree on the \nneed for a strong Partnership for Peace. Former Secretary of Defense \nBill Perry, an advocate of NATO enlargement, testified before the Armed \nServices Committee on this very need to ensure that the Partnership for \nPeace initiative is not undermined in the process of expanding the \nalliance. He stated, ``The Partnership for Peace should receive \nattention comparable to that accorded to enlargement. The experience of \nPFP membership should closely resemble the experience of NATO \npartnership.''\n  So the amendment that I intend to offer on this issue would be a \ndeclaration of support for the Partnership for Peace intended to place \nthe NATO resolution in an important context; that is, the complementary \neffectiveness of the Partnership for Peace initiative.\n  This amendment would declare that PFP is both an essential and \nenduring complement to the NATO alliance in maintaining and enhancing \nregional security. It would also endorse NATO efforts to enhance PFP, \nto strengthen its political consultative mechanism through the Euro-\nAtlantic Partnership Council, to expand the operational role of the \nPFP, and to provide for increased participation of Partner countries in \ndecision-making and planning within PFP. Many of these objectives are \nthe same ones voiced in favor of NATO enlargement.\n  I am concerned about contentions that the whole purpose of PFP is to \nprepare Partner countries for future NATO membership. For a significant \nnumber of PFP Partners, that simply isn't their primary purpose in \nparticipating. It is essential that PFP continue to be valued as an \nindependent component of the European security system and not be \nreduced or constrained to being a prelude to NATO membership. \nAccordingly, my amendment would also clarify that PFP membership does \nnot in any way prejudice a country's application or consideration for \nadmission to the NATO alliance.\n  I would note that, in contrast to NATO enlargement, Russian reaction \nto PFP is increasingly positive. While it has been a PFP Partner since \nthe initiative began in 1994, Russia is now completing its first-ever \nIndividual Partnership Plan, detailing the specific activities in which \nit intends to participate over the next few years. These include eleven \nPFP exercises, including one on its own territory.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to consider carefully the long-\nterm risks associated with NATO enlargement. The Senate must be an \nactive partner in any future decision to invite further rounds of \ncandidates for NATO membership.\n  In the meantime, we need to focus our efforts on meeting our top \nmilitary security priorities. We must ensure that NATO enlargement does \nnot undermine our ability to address our most pressing security \nconcerns. But I believe we should reserve higher priority for our \ncooperative efforts with\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\nRussia to eliminate strategic nuclear weapons under START I, to secure \nDuma ratification of START II, and to advance discussions on further \nreductions of nuclear weapons under a START III framework. The \ncooperation between the national laboratories in my state of New Mexico \nand their counterparts in Russia remains critically important to the \npressing problem of nonproliferation. In addition, the United States \nneeds to engage Russia in a dialogue on additional joint steps beyond \nSTART to reduce the nuclear threat.\n  In summary, our primary security goal must be to promote a safe and \nstable security environment for the United States, our NATO allies, and \nthe countries of Eastern and Central Europe, including Russia. No \nfurther enlargement of NATO should be considered unless and until it \ncan be clearly demonstrated that such a step serves this goal. We need \nto proceed cautiously, with clear priorities and thorough consideration \nof all options--whether NATO, the Partnership for Peace, or other \nsecurity arrangements--for promoting the security and safety of the \nNorth Atlantic area as a whole.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator take a brief question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am happy to respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to commend the distinguished Senator. He has \nworked from the beginning with Senator Smith, myself, and others as we \nbegan to examine the very serious questions.\n  The Senator raised an issue that caused me great concern, and that is \nthe nuclear aspect and how in his State so much valuable work is now \nbeing done and has always been done on this question.\n  My understanding, having met with a number of Members of the Russian \nDuma--and I believe the Senator was present at the time that Members of \nthe Duma came informally before the Armed Services Committee--there is \na considerable doubt as to whether or not they will ratify the current \narms control arrangements because of the question of NATO enlargement.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond to my friend from \nVirginia by saying that is my understanding. I have yet to speak to any \nhigh official in the Russian Government who felt this would be helpful, \nthat us going ahead with this resolution particularly at this time \nwould be helpful in bringing Russia along to ratify START II or to take \nany other actions that would be helpful in reducing the nuclear threat.\n  Mr. WARNER. In response, I say to my good friend, I talked with a \nnumber of Members of the Duma. I accompanied the Secretary of Defense, \nMr. Cohen, to Russia in the January timeframe, where we sat down in the \nU.S. Embassy in Moscow and listened to the protests of about half a \ndozen Members of the Duma for the better part of 2 hours. There was \nabsolutely no equivocation on their part that they felt that the future \nratification by the Russian Duma of the current arms control \narrangement now pending is in great doubt.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my friend from Virginia for his leadership on \nthis important issue. As I indicated earlier, I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the amendment that he is offering and hope we can gain the \nsupport of colleagues on that as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I might add to the comments of the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia in the discussion of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico \nthat we had had some testimony along the same lines in the strategic \nsubcommittee. General Xavier indicated he felt, likewise, that the Duma \nwould be less inclined to provide--they believe that if, in fact, NATO \nexpansion were to continue, this could very well jeopardize the START \nII talks.\n  I think it is also important to note--and I know the distinguished \nSenator made many visits to Russia, as I have in the past few years--\nthe worst part of this, I don't sense anger on the part of some of our \nRussian colleagues, but I do sense frustration, especially those who \nwant to see Russia move to a democracy and stay there. Small ``d'' \ndemocrats in Russia really believe--and I think they are correct--that \nthis is not going to help their cause.\n  President Yeltsin has been steadfast and brave and courageous as he \nhas tried to move, despite great odds and a lot of problems, especially \ninflation, to try to move Russia to the West and to democracy and to a \ngood free market.\n  I think this is going to hurt it, and I think hurt it needlessly, \nbecause there is absolutely, in this Senator's opinion, no urgency \nwhatever to make this decision, which is the part I just cannot \nunderstand--why there is this sense of urgency.\n  Only 2 short years ago, reading a quote from the President of the \nUnited States--actually 4 years ago, in which he gave a compelling \nreason not to have NATO expansion, and yet now it has all changed, and \nit didn't change that quickly.\n  Mr. WARNER. If my colleague would allow me, first I wish to thank the \nSenator. He has been an absolute leader on this issue from the very \nbeginning, and at the beginning there were fewer than there are now. We \nare fortunate there is a growing number beginning to look at it from \nthe perspective that the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire and I \nhave had for some period of time.\n  Just today, I was privileged to have lunch with the mayor of St. \nPetersburg, Russia. I was on his right, and to my immediate right was \nthe deputy chief of mission here of the Russian Embassy. Now, never \nshould the United States allow Russia to veto any of our foreign \npolicy. We always must do those things that are in our strategic \ninterest.\n  But I join the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire in his view \nthat there is no rush to do this. It is a window of opportunity that \nRussia has seized upon to try to solidify their movement toward a solid \ndemocracy, try to solidify their struggle in the free market system of \nthe world, at the same time they are dealing with tremendous political \ninstability at home both in elective office and indeed in law \nenforcement. Both of these persons told me, formally in the discussion \nover luncheon not over 2 hours ago, it is of grave concern to them \nindividually, of the timing of this move.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague for those remarks.\n  I just say to Senator Warner, on January 10, 1994, along the same \nvein, President Clinton himself made the following statement, only 4 \nyears ago:\n\n       Why should we now draw a new line through Europe just a \n     little further east? Why should we now do something which \n     could foreclose the best possible future for Europe? The best \n     possible future would be a democratic Russia committed to the \n     security of all of its European neighbors. The best possible \n     future would be a democratic Ukraine, a democratic \n     government in every one of the Newly Independent States of \n     the former Soviet Union, all committed to market \n     cooperation, to common security and to democratic ideals. \n     We should not foreclose that possibility.\n\n  That was the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, on January \n10, 1994. I simply say to my colleagues, what has changed? What has \nchanged?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. What does that quote have to do with anything? What does \nit have to do with anything relating to whether or not we should expand \nNATO? How is it inconsistent with expansion of NATO?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I think it has a lot ``to do with \nanything.'' The President made these statements at the NATO \nheadquarters in Brussels, Belgium, and his point is that drawing a new \nline through Europe a little further east might jeopardize the \nrelationship between the Russians and the United States and bringing \nthe Russians into the democracy, into the West as a democratic nation. \nThe Senator doesn't believe that is relevant to this?\n  Mr. BIDEN. With all due respect, the President never spoke of that in \nthe context of drawing any new lines; he spoke in the context of being \ndemocratic nations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I'm reading the President's quote. ``The\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\nbest possible future would be a democratic Russia committed to the \nsecurity of all of its European neighbors. We should not foreclose \nit.'' That was the time he followed in President Bush's footsteps of \nsupporting the Partnership for Peace, which I also support. Now \nsomething has intervened--perhaps the election of 1996--that caused him \nnow to change his mind, and suddenly now there is this urgent need to \nhave these three nations become part of NATO.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I don't want to take the Senator's time. He was kind \nenough to yield for a question. If he would like to, I could continue \nthis. Otherwise, I will let him finish his statement and I will respond \nand point out why, in my view, there is not the least bit of \ninconsistency between wanting to see Russia as a democratic nation and \nexpanding NATO.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Let me say, when I came into the room and \nprior to coming into the Chamber, I listened to some of the debate of \nmy colleagues on the other side of this issue. Very interesting. I \nthought for a moment that I was in a time warp, that I was back in the \n1950s and was somehow privy to the debate here. I heard terms like \n``cold war.'' I heard terms like ``evil empire,'' ``Iron Curtain,'' and \nStalin was mentioned, as was Yalta and the Soviet Union.\n  Unless I am missing something--and I try to pay pretty close \nattention to current events--I don't see that same situation in the \nworld today. I think Stalin is gone. It is my understanding that he is. \nThe Iron Curtain is no longer there, which Churchill talked about. \nYalta divided up Europe, unfortunately, and now we have these nations \nwho have sought and got a well-deserved freedom. Now the Senate is \nconsidering whether to add these three nations--Poland, Hungary, and \nthe Czech Republic--to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That is \nthe issue before us. The question is whether that is necessary or not \nin considering the situation right now in the world.\n  I just say to my colleagues, what is the threat today to those three \nnations or any other nation that may be coming into NATO in the future? \nWhat is the specific threat? Is there still a cold war? Is there still \nan Iron Curtain? Is there a massive Soviet army poised at the ready on \nthe borders of Poland or on the borders of Germany or on the borders of \nHungary or Romania or the Czech Republic? I don't see any. Is Russia \nnow an absolute to become a democratic nation, never to be a threat to \nthe United States? No, absolutely not. That is the point of the \ndiscussion. What is the best way to try to bring that nation into the \ndemocratic fold, not to turn to the East, not to turn to Red China, not \nto turn to Iran and other nations that could very well be a serious \nthreat to the United States before the end of the 21st century?\n\n  But a few weeks ago when this matter first came up, it seemed to be a \nforegone conclusion that we were going to run this thing through with \nno debate, essentially. Everybody was feel-good, emotional. These \nnations had ``earned it.'' They are free and now they have earned the \nright to fall under the umbrella of NATO--25 percent of which is funded \nby the United States, I might add--and earned the right to become \nmembers of NATO. Then, after several of us had written a letter to the \nleaders and requested some time--we had a little difficulty getting it, \nbut we did get the time to have a good debate, and I appreciate the \nfact that both Senator Daschle and Senator Lott responded to that \nrequest. However, unfortunately, there is still other information that \nis out there that we would like to have. For example, the NATO report, \nwhich is not due until perhaps late next month or early in June; it \nwould be nice to have that. We don't have that. Again, we are now \ntrapped in this urgency--this urgency. There is this huge threat \nlooming out there to these three countries. Yet, I have not heard \nanybody tell me what that threat is. I would be happy to yield to \nanybody on the floor now or later who would be willing to stand up and \ntell me what the threat is to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. \nWhere is the threat that forces us to immediately, this week, vote on \nNATO expansion?\n  Frankly, a growing number of us have come to the realization that \nexpanding NATO is unwise. At worst it is unwise and unnecessary at \nbest. It is time for a little thought. Some tried to get this thing to \ngo through without any thought. I think that was the goal initially, to \nrun this thing through before we had much time to think about it, \nanalyze the thoughts, and before we had time to realize that there \nwasn't any threat, that this was emotional, feel-good politics. That is \nwhat this is.\n  If NATO enlargement made sense, it would have gained strength as the \ndebate began, not lost strength. It is losing strength. There are more \nMembers now than there were several weeks ago who are opposed to NATO \nexpansion. The more it was discussed, the more opposition there was. My \nsuspicion has been that many of those clamoring for that speedy vote \ndid so out of fear that the case for enlargement may not just bear the \nscrutiny that is deserves--and it does deserve a lot of scrutiny for a \nnumber of reasons, which we will be getting into, costs among others. \nBut in discussions with constituents over the recess and colleagues \nover the past several weeks, my suspicion has been confirmed. When \nasked careful questions, the American people have serious reservations. \nI think initially--and I was one of them--when it first came up, the \nemotional response was, wow, they have gotten their freedom finally. We \nspent trillions to help them win it--trillions. We sacrificed American \nlives, millions of Americans in uniform, to help defeat the ``evil \nempire'' that Ronald Reagan spoke about. And it worked. But the \nquestion really is whether or not the so-called NATO umbrella makes \nsense right now. Now what are the people saying?\n  Hot off the presses is a poll from Opinion Research of Princeton, a \nnationwide poll, just completed today. They ask the following question \nto people across the country: ``Congress is currently debating \nexpanding the NATO military alliance to include Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary. Estimates of the cost to U.S. taxpayers from the \nfirst phase of expansion range from $400 million to $19 billion. Do you \noppose or favor expanding NATO? Answer: Favor, 32 percent; opposed, 56 \npercent.''\n\n  By almost a 2-to-1 margin, when you indicate that we do not have a \nhandle on the cost, people are opposed.\n  These are facts. This is information that deserves to be part of the \ndebate. This decision should not be based on polls. I will be the first \none to agree with that. We should not be making a decision as important \nas the expansion of NATO based on polls. But it shows that when the \nAmerican people understand and get information, they react accordingly. \nI think many members had the feeling that the American people were \noverwhelming in their support of this because it is an emotional feel-\ngood thing to do. These nations suffered immensely under communism for \na long, long time. And they earned their freedom.\n  The question is: How do we preserve and continue to protect that \nfreedom? The question is, Mr. President, do we look back at the last 50 \nyears, or do we look ahead at the next 50 years in terms of protecting \nthat freedom? Because that is the question we are talking about here \ntoday. We are not talking about Stalin and the evil empire and the cold \nwar. We are talking about the next 50 years, and hopefully the next 150 \nor 250 years. That is what we are talking about.\n  The best way to preserve and protect and defend these nations and \ntheir way of life is to have a Western Russia, a Russia that has moved \ninto the West, a democratic Russia, and we ought to be doing everything \nin our power to see to it that that happens, and anything we do in any \nway to hinder that is a serious mistake, a mistake that we are going to \npay for dearly down the road. It is a very shortsighted, a very, very \nshortsighted decision.\n  With or without NATO, the United States can come to the defense of \nany European nation next week, tomorrow, next year, or 5 years from \nnow. Should Europe ever be threatened by Russia, or by anybody else, we \ncan expand NATO. We can do it quickly.\n  But there is a lot to lose and very little to gain by expanding NATO \nnow. We basically say to Russia: Don't worry about it. Don't worry \nabout NATO expansion. It is OK. It is a defensive alliance. But it does \nnot matter what we say. It matters what the Russians think. They have \nstated clearly\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\nand officially they oppose expansion. It has been said by others on the \nfloor, and I agree that we should not set our foreign policy based on \nwhat the Russians say, I will be the first to admit that, but we ought \nto realize there is a lot going on inside Russia and there is no threat \nto these nations from Russia.\n  So why not leave the window open a little bit longer? What is the \nurgency? What is the threat? Let me keep asking that question. Somebody \nrise on the Senate floor sometime during this debate, if not now, and \ntell me what the threat is. Tell me what the urgency is. There is no \nurgency. There is no threat. It is an emotional feel-good thing to do. \nThey earned it. They are free. Let us put them under the umbrella of \nNATO and protect them. From what? We are still going to go to their \ndefense if anything threatens them. Every person in the Senate knows \nit. The most important requirement for the Poles, the Czechs, and the \nHungarians as far as their security is concerned is that America and \nRussia remain friends. That is the protection these nations need--that \nRussia and America become friends and remain friends. That is the issue \nhere.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator allow me to observe that \nthe American taxpayers, since 1992, have contributed $2.6 billion in \nthe spirit of that friendship to help Russia dismantle its weapons \nsystems. And here this comes along and takes a red-hot poker and jams \nit right in their ribs.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. It sure does. The Senator knows that. He \nknows the Senator has worked on this issue tirelessly in the Armed \nForces Committee and has visited Russia to see this.\n  I don't think anybody could deny that in the very near future Russia \nis going to be one of the, if not the, strongest nations in that region \nof the world. The question is, Whose side is it going to be on? Is it \ngoing to be on the Iranians' side? Is it going to be an alliance with \nthe Chinese Communists? Or is it going to be on our side? If it is on \nour side, why will the Poles care, or the Czechs, or the Hungarians, or \nanybody else? The point is they wouldn't.\n\n  What we ought to be doing again is keeping the window open, using the \nadvantages that we have to draw that out, to draw them this way. \nSenator Warner has mentioned how they have reached out to do that. We \nare taking down tremendous numbers of weapons that have been aimed at \nthe United States for decades.\n  But extending an alliance, which during the cold war the Soviet Union \nconsidered hostile, the countries that she doesn't threaten is \nbasically kicking this former giant, like the Senator from Virginia \nsaid, poking them in the ribs. That is exactly what we are doing. God \nknows. I have stood on this floor many times and in the House Chamber \nbefore that and extolled the virtues of the United States against the \ncold war Soviet Union and voted trillions to defeat it. But let's not \nwalk away from the victory. Let's not walk away from the victory. \nHistory shows that it is unwise to treat nations like that, and it is \nhighly dangerous for countries in the middle, because these are the \ncountries that are going to suffer if there is a confrontation that \ntakes place between the United States and Russia again. It is the \nnations in the middle in Eastern Europe that are going to get the \nsqueeze. That is where it is going to be fought. Those are the people \nwho are going to suffer.\n  We are talking about costs. The cost was in that poll question. I am \nnot sure what we are paying for it. Maybe someone else does. You have \nestimates as high as $125 billion, some $250 billion. It is not the \nissue of cost per se. It is that nobody knows what the facts are. \nNobody knows what we are dealing with. That is why there is this \nuncertainty.\n  What if there is a threat and these nations were actually threatened? \nThe question of cost would be irrelevant--I think. I think we would go \nto the defense of France, a current NATO member, and I would assume if \nthese nations become members we would go to their defense if there was \na threat. It would be irrelevant now as it was in the cold war, because \nwe made the commitment if one is attacked, we are all attacked and we \nare going to do our part. But unfortunately, our part becomes the \ndominant part in NATO, and as current members shrink back from \nresponsibility, this will increase our responsibility or our burden. \nThere is no foreseeable conventional threat to any country in Europe, \nand no credible analysis disputes this. I challenge anyone to give me \nan analysis that shows how any nation in Europe today has a \nconventional threat. Is there a Russian army, a strong Russian army \nthat has threatened France, Hungary, or the Czech Republic, or England, \nor anybody else? Where is it? If it isn't, then what is the urgency? \nWhat is the threat?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Certainly I will.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If there isn't a threat, what is the need for NATO?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is a good question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think what is really at the heart of this is what was \nsaid, if I am not mistaken, in a sort of dress rehearsal of this \ndebate--the Senator from Virginia and I appeared before a group of \nConnecticut voters who were down here at the request of one of our \ncolleagues, Senator Dodd. He may remember my saying the real debate on \nthe floor is going to be whether there should be NATO.\n  The only thing I would like to state now, before I make my opening \nstatement--in the context of a question so the floor hasn't been \nyielded to me; ordinarily I would not put it in the context of a \nquestion--is that isn't the real debate here, if there is no strategic \nrationale for expanding, if there is discussion questioning the \nstrategic doctrine of NATO as it exists now, as Senator Bingaman said, \nand if there is no threat at all, as my friend from New Hampshire says, \nthe real question is--this is a veiled way of us saying: Should we have \nNATO at all? If there is no threat to France, no threat to Germany, no \nthreat to Poland, then obviously don't expand but also don't have NATO. \nIf there is a threat at all to Germany or to France or the other 15 \nnations, or 13 nations, then there is clearly a threat to Poland or to \nthe Czech Republic.\n  You cannot have both. This call of no threat either present or \nanticipated, indicating there is no need to expand, I think, leads one \nto the conclusion that if they take that view, there should not be \nNATO. So I don't know why you don't just stand up and say why don't we \njust eliminate NATO because there we are spending, for assets devoted \nto NATO, counting our national budget, over $100 billion a year.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire because this is \nthe type of debate the Senate should participate in and it is a good \none. I will respond directly. The United States of America had to \nrescue Europe in 1917 and 1918. How well I remember; my father served \nas a doctor in the front lines of those battles. The United States came \nto the rescue again in World War II, and that is clearly in the minds \nof all of us. We have not had to respond with significant force in \nthese 50 years for the very purpose that NATO has served as a \ncollective defense, and to deter--to discourage, to put it in a \nlayman's term--an attack on any of its members.\n  Second, the United States is there because we need, as a nation, a \npresence in Europe, and that presence of leadership, both in a military \nform of NATO and an economic and every other way, gives us the \njustification for a strong voice of leadership in Europe--NATO. So it \nhas served a purpose and will continue to serve a purpose if we do not \ndilute it, as the Senator from New Hampshire has ably said.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator allow me 2 minutes to respond to that?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Go ahead.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think the Senator has just made an overwhelming case why \nthe Poles think it is so important. The Senator just points out, World \nWar I, World War II--by the way, for those wars to get to France they \nhad to roll over Poland first on the way. Then the reason why there was \nno war, as the Senator points out, after World War II--a cold war, not \na hot war--is we had NATO. And the nations that we extended the \numbrella of NATO to were kept free from fear of attack. Guess\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\nwhat. Poland was occupied during that whole period.\n  Now Poland is no longer occupied, and they are worried that the world \nmay have the same kind of amnesia that it had in 1917, and 1916, and \n1915--and 1938 and 1939 and 1940. They are kind of worried because they \nfigured it out, if you are under this umbrella, it dissuades anyone \nfrom invading you.\n  So if it is a rationale to keep Germany in NATO, and NATO protects \nGermany because that gives it that added security, you can kind of \nunderstand why the Poles think it also makes sense for them, since they \nhave been the doormat to Western Europe.\n\n  There is much more to say about this. I will not go on. But the point \nis that NATO membership significantly reduces the prospect that anyone \nnow or in the future would conclude that you are a worthy target of \ntheir aggression. That is the point the Senator is making. And the \nclear notion is that if in fact Poland were part of this alliance, to \ntake one country, they would not have to wonder any longer whether or \nnot they would have to wait for the Brits to do something--as occurred \nin World War II. They would not have to wonder if Russia or anyone else \nunderstood that Poland was no longer the doormat of Europe.\n  If all goes well, as I anticipate, and I vote with my taxpayers' \npocketbook to try to promote democracy in Russia--if all goes well, \nthen in fact there is not any greater need in Russia for Poland to be a \nmember of NATO than for Germany to be a member of NATO. There may be no \nneed for NATO. Or it may be that Russia is part of NATO. But we are in \na position, as the Washington Post says:\n\n       American interest in expansion lies in reducing \n     unpredictability and instability in an arc that has generated \n     the century's major wars.\n\n  One of the things, as the Post and many others have tried to point \nout, and as I have tried to point out on the floor before, part of \nRussia's necessary post-cold war evolution, mental evolution, if you \nwill, is to understand and consider the novel notion that its neighbors \nhave a right to whatever national orientation they want. Most other \ndemocracies in the world have figured that out. Most other nations have \nfigured that out. And if you are not going to--the current likelihood \nthat there is little danger that is posed for these three countries or \nany other part of Europe, it seems to me, again to paraphrase the Post, \n``makes it smart and a cheap buy for the extra security now, in case \nthings don't go the right way.''\n  But the bottom line is this: If, in fact, there is a rationale for us \nto continue to be a member of NATO, and I believe there is, and to \ncontinue to make commitments to the likes of Germany and other allies--\nif there is a rationale for expanding NATO on the Soviet Union's border \nbringing in Turkey not too many years ago, there is a rationale to \nbring Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary under that umbrella.\n  I will conclude--and I thank my colleague for allowing me to \nrespond--but I conclude by suggesting to you that the way to the \ngreatest certainty that Russia continues along its democratic trek and \nnonimperialistic instinct is to have these nations within NATO, forever \nremoving the realistic possibility that they are part of the hegemony \nof the former Soviet Union or Russia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague for his comments. I \nin no way object or feel interrupted. I think this is a good way to \ndebate the issue. It is much better than a series of monologues, I \nthink, in regard to this issue.\n  I would just say to my colleague, though, I am trying to accomplish, \nI think, the same thing that he is, which is that Poland or any other \ncountry not be a doormat for anyone else ever again. I think that \nreally goes to the heart of the debate here; what is the best way to \naccomplish that?\n  My point is--and I am a supporter of NATO, always was and still am--\nbut I believe that what we have here is a window of opportunity that \nallows us to try to pull the Russians to us. If the Russians right now \nwere threatening Poland, I would say it is urgent--or were even talking \nabout threatening Poland--it is urgent to move forward on this. We \nwould still go to their defense, in my opinion, anyway. But that is an \nacademic argument.\n  Mr. BIDEN. But we never did. We never did. Twice before we didn't, \nnot until after the fact, not until after they were no longer an \nindependent nation. We never did.\n  I believe--I hope we would, too. But understand it from their \nperspective. We never did.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. It is still going to take a commitment, \nwhether you are in NATO or not, it is still going to take a commitment \nto defend Poland, period. You have to have a will to do that, whether \nyou are in NATO or not.\n  The point here is we have an opportunity, where the Russians have \nreached out to us ever so slightly, but as the Senator from Virginia \nhas talked about in strategic weapons reduction, in trying to look at \nwhat Yeltsin has gone through, the market reforms--1000 percent \ninflation a few years ago down now to 8 percent. They have worked hard \nto try to make this thing work with a lot of strong leadership.\n  I don't think this is the way to encourage them to continue to do \nthat. This Senator, I guess much like Nixon going to China, is hardly \none who has been soft on the Russians or the Soviet Union over the past \nseveral years of my public life, and certainly I have been in as strong \nopposition to them as anyone else. But also a strategist has to look at \nthe real world, and I don't think we ought to be looking at just \nsimple, cheap analogies here. We ought to be looking at the real world, \nand the real world is today, not what it was yesterday. Yesterday the \nreal world was Stalin, was the cold war, was the ``evil empire,'' was \nexpansionist tendencies, and was the NATO which came forth to block all \nof that.\n  Today, we don't know what the future will bring; therefore, we do \nneed NATO. But the question is, ``Do we need NATO expansion?''; not, \n``Do we need NATO?'' Those are two different issues. Do we need NATO? \nYes. Do we need NATO expansion in order to make this transition? I \ndon't believe that we do. I think that is really the crux of this \nissue. There is no urgency.\n  Again, what is the urgency? I say with the greatest respect to my \ncolleague. What is the urgency? What now is the threat that is \nperceived, that you perceive to be, that makes this necessary to do \ntoday or tomorrow rather than to give the Russians some more time to \nmake these reforms work, to perhaps get the START II agreement that the \nSenator from Virginia was talking about? What is the urgency? That is \nreally the thrust of my involvement here.\n  I will be happy to yield for a comment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I can make a historical observation. \nYou raise the passions by saying we didn't come to the defense of \nPoland. It was September of 1939 when Hitler directed his forces across \nthe border with an element of surprise with the panzer divisions and \nwent against the Polish cavalry, in large measure, with lances. If you \nhave never seen the footage of that battle, it is extraordinary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have.\n  Mr. WARNER. Subsequently, Stalin and Hitler partitioned and cruelly \ncrucified the Polish people. But at that time, I say to my good friend \nfrom Delaware, the United States was holding its maneuvers with dump \ntrucks acting as tanks and with wooden rifles or broomsticks. We were \nnot the superpower, nor the military strength, as we are today.\n  I say to the Senator and my good friend, don't try to raise the \npassions that this country turned its back on Poland then and would now \ndo so. The keyword that the Senator from New Hampshire used is \n``instability.'' And where is that instability? It is not in Poland, it \nis not in Hungary, it is not in the Czech Republic, but with the \nRussian nation struggling to work with democracy and an economic free-\nmarket system and the problems at home of the succession of Yeltsin. \nThat is the instability. And, I might add, if we are going to use the \nmilitary argument, the Red Army barely put down a minor revolution in \nChechnya, which it had to fight for over a year, using every piece of \nmodern equipment that they have, and barely did they subdue that small \nsegment of the former Soviet Union.\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me respond, if I may, to the question of urgency and \nthe process to clarify the issue of going to Poland's defense.\n  My point about going to Poland's defense did not relate to whether \nAmericans were courageous, were good, were bad, or kept or didn't keep \na commitment. It was a statement of fact.\n  My friend talks about the real world. The real world, that was 1939. \nWe got in the war on December 7, 1941. In the meantime, nothing \nhappened. We were a major power. My colleague points out that we \nweren't militarily prepared. By our own choice, we weren't militarily \nprepared. But other nations that were allegedly militarily prepared \nwere powers on the continent. They also did nothing, and they watched.\n  All I am pointing out to you is, from a Pole's standpoint, it is of \nlittle consequence to tell them, ``Don't worry, if you're ever \nthreatened, we'll be there, we'll be there.'' That would be like saying \nto most Poles, ``The check's in the mail.''\n\n  They look at history, like other nations have looked at history, and \nthey know what has happened to them, and they know the powers who had \npower did not respond when power was available and they were in \ntrouble. I think it is unrealistic to think that we should expect the \nPoles to assume that, especially with some of the comments made by my \ncolleagues on the floor in this debate over the last couple weeks about \nwhether or not it is in our vital interest that Poland be free. That \nquestion was raised on the floor, and it is raised constantly in the \nminds of those who deal with the issue of European security.\n  So, from the Polish standpoint, there is a clear, clear reason for \nthem to know and understand that there is a big difference between \nbeing part of an alliance where the sacred word and trust of a nation \nis committed in advance and being left to the vagaries of \nrationalization on the part of a country after the fact to justify why \nthey did or did not go to the aid of a country in question. It is a big \ndifference. If it is not a big difference, then why do we have any \ntreaties at all?\n  With regard to the real world--let's look at the real world. The real \nworld is, as my friend from Virginia has pointed out, that we have \ncommitted over $2 billion dealing with arms control agreements and \nproviding American dollars to allow them to keep a commitment that they \nmade with regard to arms control treaties.\n  All of the Western European nations, the United States included, have \ncontributed over $100 billion to Russia since the wall has come down \nand the empire has broken up. We, along with our other NATO allies, \nhave taken the unprecedented step, accused by many on the right of \nhaving yielded our sovereignty to Russia by doing the NATO-Russian \naccords where they have full transparency within NATO.\n  We have and continue to seek ways in which to restore--``restore'' is \nthe wrong word; there never was a democracy--seek to provide the \ncircumstances where democracy can flourish in a market economy with \nAmerican tax dollars and German tax dollars and French tax dollars. So \nthere is no reason--no reason--whatsoever for the Russians--no real \nworld reason for the Russians to conclude that they are viewed as the \nenemy, the enemy by us. Any indirect comparison to the Weimar Republic \nis bizarre. We were exacting reparations from them; we are sending \ndollars, we are sending deutsche marks, we are sending francs, we are \nsending pounds to Russia, maybe not as much as we should, in the minds \nof some of us, but we are.\n  With regard to the urgency, the worst time in the world to have to \nenlarge an alliance is at the moment of threat, because then it leads \nthe other country in question to conclude that if they do not act out \nwhat we fear they will do before the alliance is reached, they will be \nin a weaker position.\n  I respectfully suggest that urgency isn't the question. The question \nrelates to, Is this the time and the moment, 9 years after the wall has \ncome down--almost 9 years now after the wall has come down--to end once \nand for all the artificial boundaries and the ability of any nation, \nincluding Russia, to suggest that individual nations within Central and \nEastern Europe do not have the ability to choose their own natural and \nnational alliances?\n  That is the urgency. The urgency is, the opportunity is here. It is \nthe cheapest way to do it. It did not come as a consequence of any fad. \nIt was debated and reflected among the NATO nations, not a decision \nmade alone by the United States of America.\n  Fifteen other European nations thought it was in their interest and \nthe interest of the West, did not feel that it would increase their \njeopardy and offend the Russians to do this, and unanimously all voted \nto take in these three nations. The only debate related to whether we \nshould take in three or five. That was the debate among our NATO \nallies.\n  So let me conclude--and I thank my colleague again for yielding this \ntime--the urgency is that this is the most propitious time to end--to \nend--the artificial division of Europe and the implicit recognition \nthat any country in Europe, including Russia, has the right to some \nbuffer zone or has the right to impact upon the national decisions of a \nneighbor in that neighbor's determination to enter into a defensive \nalliance they view in their national interest--and I emphasize the word \n``defensive.''\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Let me say to my colleague, I posed the \nquestion to you about urgency, and you answered it. And I commend you \nfor that. I do not agree with your assessment of urgency.\n  I think that, to me, ``urgency'' would be a military urgency, a \nperceived threat. It is not an urgent matter to make this decision \ntoday or tomorrow or within the next few months. It might be a matter \nthat could, in your opinion, enhance the situation to prevent an \nemergency or an urgency, but I do not see it as that right now.\n  You mentioned--the Senator from----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for one point?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask, would the Senator not acknowledge when we expanded \nto bring in Greece and Turkey, expanded to bring in Spain, there was \nalso no emergency?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No more urgent than now.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. There was a Soviet Union then.\n  Mr. BIDEN. A Soviet Union, but there was no specific threat that I am \naware--specific change.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The specific threat was the specific \nthreat of the Soviet Union that was still there.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I see. I am trying to define--I mean, I am trying to get a \nclearer picture of what the Senator means by ``urgent.'' He is not \nsuggesting it requires there be a Russian division breathing down the \nthroat, making threats to come across the line, merely that there was \nthis power, this entity, that existed that, if it chose to exercise its \nmilitary strength, was a real threat.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Clearly, yes. It clearly had the \ncapability to send an army into Western Europe if it so chose, if we \nhad not stood up to stop it.\n  I think the issue, though, of dividing lines--I believe the Senator \nused the term ``dividing line'' or ``artificial lines'' or \n``demarcations in Europe,'' saying, ``See, I think it's the opposite.'' \nI think by doing this, we are creating artificial lines in Europe, and \nwe are picking winners and losers. These three--why these three nations \nand not six, seven, eight others?\n  And I think we are going to have a permanent sense of disruptions, if \nyou will, now in Europe over the next several years as this debate \ncomes up over and over and over again as to who is next and who would \nbe the next country to go in.\n  As far as going back to 1939 and what happened--we have 100,000 \ntroops in Europe today. If we had 100,000 troops in 1939, Hitler may \nnot have come into Poland with his panzer divisions. I think that is a \nvery important point here. It is not that we are sitting there in a \nsterile vacuum in Europe with nothing there. We have NATO now. We have \narmed forces there. And, again, my objective here is to see to it that \nwe create an environment that, hopefully, will see a peaceful \nrelationship between the United States and Russia which will enhance \nthe protection of these very nations that we talk about.\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield on the point of 100,000 troops?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think again we should focus on what my \ncolleague from New Hampshire said about the real world. I think that is \na legitimate point to make.\n  The real world several years ago was, we had 338,000 American troops \nin Europe. Today we have 100,000. That should make it awfully clear to \nRussia that ours is not an aggressive posture. The expansion of NATO is \nnot for purposes of encircling and/or crushing Russia. The real world \nis, all indicia out there that are available for the Russians to look \nat--I understand the psychology, but the real world is, there is no \nthreat, this is a defensive alliance.\n  With regard to drawing lines--I do not suggest in any way, in \nmentioning what I am about to say, that my friend from New Hampshire in \nany way wishes to ratify Yalta, but the practical fact of the matter \nis, Yalta was a deal made out of at the time, viewed by that President \nat the time, a necessary requirement to basically say, ``Hey, look. \nHey, look, you've got this sphere of influence. This is the line drawn \nin Europe.'' At the time, there was not this anticipation there was \ngoing to be this carnage that would result, there would be this \noverwhelming suppression that would result. ``But here is the deal. \nHere is the line we are going to draw you. You have this buffer zone.'' \nThat is what it was all about.\n  To say now that these nations cannot come in is to ratify in a \ndifferent way but the same line. Why? ``You can't come in because the \nsuccessor to the Soviet Union--Russia--does not want you in.'' So when \nI say ``redrawing the lines,'' I say, to say they cannot come in \nratifies the old line drawn after World War II.\n  And when you erase that line, it is, in my view--and I respect the \nSenator from New Hampshire and all those who oppose expansion, but I \nargue it does not send a line closer to the Soviet Union for purposes \nof encircling; it says that there is no automatic line either of us, \nEast or West--Russia-the United States, Russia-Germany, Russia-anyone \nelse--is going to say, ipso facto, that no nation can make its own \nchoice as to wherein they wish to have their alliance reside. That is \nwhat it says. That is what it says.\n  So, therefore, when I say ``redrawing a line''--excuse me, ``erasing \na line,'' the line I am talking about erasing is Yalta. And separate \nand apart from the physical occupation of those countries, at its root \nit was an admission and an acknowledgment of a sphere of influence of \none country over--over--the fate of other countries in Central and \nEastern Europe on the grounds that to do otherwise would put them in \njeopardy, they had a right to at least indirectly control the national \ndecisions of those nations relative to where they viewed their security \nto lie, in what alliance, if any.\n  So to not extend, in fact, in my view, is a bold confirmation that \nthat sphere of influence still remains. And that is a tragic historic \nmistake, in my view.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I really would take issue with the \ncomparison between the situation today we are talking about with the \nexpansion of NATO and Yalta. We had a ground war, a terrible war that \nimpacted almost every nation in Europe, Western and Eastern, that was \ncostly, and at the end of it, with two sides converging, the Americans \nand the Russians converging on Europe, basically, I believe in a \nhorrible mistake--I think the Senator would probably agree--the \npoliticians sat down and carved up Europe and therein caused the \nproblem that we faced. And from that came NATO and the cold war and \neverything else.\n  This is not what we are talking about today. This is Russia today. \nThis is a country that has had its ears pinned back pretty well as far \nas its conventional forces. It still has a ton of nuclear material and \ncertainly nuclear weapons, tons of it, literally, that we are \ninterested in working with them to get rid of.\n  But I do not know what message it sends, not only to the American \ntaxpayers but also to the Russians themselves, to say, on one hand, as \nthe Senator is saying, that we would provide moneys to this empire, \nformer evil empire, to take down their strategic systems--and we are \ndoing that with Nunn-Lugar and other funds--and, on the other hand, \nspend as much as $250 billion to bring nations into an alliance to \ndefend ourselves against that very same nation. Now, there is an \ninconsistency there somewhere, that sooner or later somebody will \nfigure out that it doesn't make sense. I think we have to understand \nthat.\n\n  I say to my colleague from Delaware, I am about to wrap up. I know \nthe Senator has a statement. I have been on the floor quite some time \nand I will yield in a moment.\n  We are creating insiders and outsiders here. In my humble opinion, \nwhat we are going to do if we act on this this week is say to three \nnations, ``You guys are winners; we are picking you.'' You talk about \nYalta; if there is a comparison, that is it. They picked winners and \nlosers at Yalta. We are picking winners and losers. You three nations, \nthe Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, you are the good guys. You get \nthe protection of NATO.\n  Tomorrow, next year, or 3 years from now, depending on how this is \nresolved on the expansion vote here, depending on what amendments may \npass, we will see this revisited again with other countries--whether it \nbe Romania or some other country down the line, Slovenia, and on and \non, Latvian countries. We will see this come up again and again. The \nsame issue is going to have to be argued again and again and the same \nhard feelings.\n  Again, going back to the position of the point of urgency, I just \ndon't see what the urgency is to do that and to continue that kind of \ndialog and that kind of agitation. Basically, it is a permanent \nagitation that will go on for years and years and years. If at any time \nthe Russians, the nationalists in Russia, the Zhirinovskys of the world \nwere to assume power or even to look like they were going to assume \npower, we do what we have to do.\n  Adding these three insiders creates more outsiders. That is the \nissue. This is a perpetual anguish that will be taken up year after \nyear after year here on the Senate floor and will be debated \nnationally, and all the difficulties--and I think if the Senator would \ntalk to some of the arms control people in the current administration, \nhe might be surprised at some of the information they might give you on \nthe QT as to how they feel about NATO expansion and what it might do to \nthe strategic arms talks. I have talked to some of them, and it is \ninteresting what they have to say. This will be disruptive for the \nalliance as a whole, and as member nations are encouraged or compelled \nto take sides, it will cause stress in the whole alliance.\n  The end of the cold war, NATO faces internal issues, serious ones \nabout its means and its end, whether Bosnia-type missions are \nappropriate. Is a Bosnia mission appropriate for NATO? Do we know that? \nWe couldn't find unity in the Persian Gulf war when we had the threat \nfrom Saddam Hussein. We could not get unity. We saw evidence in the \nLibyan situation where the French Government refused to allow our \naircraft to fly over their country. We have not had a big, rosy picture \nof unity even among NATO nations at all times, although the alliance \nhas worked well on the whole. There are a lot of issues that need to be \ndesperately looked at regarding the current NATO before we start \nexacerbating the problem by adding new nations.\n  Enlargement, in my opinion, is a token, well intended, but a token \nand unimagined distraction from real problems. That is my concern. I \nget a little tired of the old cold-war dividing line reference and how \nwe left the countries out in the cold and somehow we owe them.\n  A lot of Americans died, a lot of Americans put on uniforms, a lot of \ntaxpayers ponied up to the tune of trillions and trillions of dollars \nto help them get that freedom. They earned it. I am glad they have it. \nNot letting them in NATO is not going to do one thing to harm it at \nall. It may enhance it. In fact, in my humble opinion it will enhance \nit because we will draw the Russians, I believe, out toward the West \nand not to the East, which I believe in the long run protects their \nfreedoms.\n  In conclusion, this should not be a sentimental decision about our \nhistoric relationship with Europe. It ought to be a hard-nosed decision \nabout extending a military guarantee to a precise piece of territory \nunder current strategic circumstances.\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\n  I think, again, it is about the next 50 years, not the last 50.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Before the Senator leaves the floor, let me thank him \nagain for allowing me to engage and be engaged while he spoke.\n  Before he leaves the floor, I indicated to Senator Warner, and at \nleast in an informal way I invite the Senator--it requires no \ninvitation--I invite the Senator from New Hampshire, maybe we can work \nout a time tomorrow where those interested in the cost issue would be \nhere to debate.\n  The cost of $250 billion for expansion of NATO is bizarre, in my \nhumble opinion. I will lay it out in detail why it is tomorrow. All of \nNATO combined, including our national budget now, doesn't cost but half \nthat, less than half of that. How adding three nations would more than \nincrease over 200 percent over the cost--I guess I assume the Senator \nis talking over a 10-year period--but essentially increase by 50 \npercent the costs of NATO is beyond me.\n  I think it may be orderly and useful to our colleagues and to the \npublic if those of us who, as the Senator from New Hampshire does, have \nspent a lot of time researching the detail related to the cost in \ntrying to decipher and explain the reasons for the inconsistent \nnumbers. The inconsistent numbers relate to what we talk about as the \nunified budget, the national budget, and so on, what we allocate as \npart of our--for example, we spend a lot of money, $300 billion a year, \nroughly, for defense. Is that all accountable to NATO? Do we say that \nthe United States is spending $300 billion a year on NATO? What portion \nof that is the consequence of us belonging to NATO? When we build a \nrunway and so on, is it because of NATO?\n  The NATO budget and the cost relating to expansion I think are very, \nvery important and warrant a very focused and coherent presentation by \neach of us.\n  I will be here tomorrow prepared to do my best to outline in detail \nwhy we are talking more on the order of $40 million a year rather than \n$200 billion, and I will lay out my reasons. Hopefully, Senator Warner \nand Senator Smith and others will come and lay out in detail why they \nbelieve rather than picking an estimate that has been set out by \nsomeone, explain how they arrive at those numbers.\n  I must say, if you tell my constituency to keep NATO--forget \nexpanding, if you told them to keep NATO--it was going to cost them \n$250 billion, I imagine the referendum in my State would go through \nlike a hot knife through butter. They would say get out. Obviously, if \nyou set a number where the costs could be from $40 million to $150 \nbillion, as I think the Princeton Survey was, although I may have heard \nit incorrectly, that came hot off the press, obviously a majority of \nthe people would say, ``I am not for that. You mean to tell me I'm \nsigning on for 150 billion bucks?''\n  I will be here tomorrow, and it might be useful to pick a time when \nwe can be here, all of us interested in the cost, to debate it in some \ndetail.\n  In the meantime, I will take this opportunity to make a broader \nstatement and I will respond to some of the things said today.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Your colleague has said he would have a formal estimate \nof costs for Senator Warner and that will arrive in a time we can do \nthat kind of debate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It will arrive in the form of the Senator from Delaware. \nWe do have a formal estimate of the cost, and the chairman of the full \ncommittee was, I think, being his usual diplomatic self in saying that. \nMaybe it is best that we debate this in a coherent way and a very \nspecific way. So that is why he asked the Senator to submit in writing, \nif I am not mistaken--Senator Warner submit in writing; I was not here \nat the time--his questions and the basis of his analysis of the cost \nand he would come back with a formal response.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Maybe we could all try to work out a time through our \noffices if they are listening, although I'm not sure when I speak my \noffice listens, but if they are listening, maybe the other offices \nmight see if we can coordinate a time on the floor tomorrow where we \ncould enlighten one another and enlighten the country about the cost of \nthe matter.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate begins reconsideration of the resolution \nof ratification for enlargement--and I and others who are for or \nagainst expansion all agree on one thing: I strongly believe it was a \nmistake, for whatever scheduling reasons, to have brought this up, then \ndelayed it, put other things before it, and then brought it back up. So \nmy hope is--and those who support expansion and those who oppose it \nhave all communicated to their respective leaders that we hope nothing \nwill intervene during the consideration of this debate so that we can \ngive it the time and attention and detail that the public is entitled \nto.\n  The truth of the matter is, all those folks sitting back behind the \nbar, back there on both sides, they, along with me and a number of \nothers, have already devoted hundreds of hours to this. This is not a \nnew deal. This is not something that all of a sudden we woke up one \nmorning and said, you know, I feel like expansion today, let's expand, \nand here we go, let's go through it. This has been a long, serious \ndebate, which has taken place within NATO among the military types and \nthe political types. It has taken place within the national governments \nof each of the other NATO nations. It has taken place within this \ncountry, within the administration.\n  There was a NATO observers group that, in my 25 years in the Senate, \nwas granted unprecedented access to the decisionmaking process. There \nwere 28 of us, the bulk of whom participated, while the decision to \ninvite, if to invite, and who to invite, to join NATO was being made. \nWe went to Europe on several occasions. I bet there were at least a \nhalf dozen trips of the NATO advisers to Europe to meet with the \nmilitary in each of the existing NATO countries and all of the aspirant \ncountries.\n  I myself spent time with my colleague, Dr. Haltzel, next to me here \nat the moment. We went to Russia, we went to Poland, we went to the \nCzech Republic, and to Hungary, and to Slovenia, and we met with all of \nthe relevant parties--every leader of every major faction within the \npolitical spectrum in Russia today. We had long, private, and sometimes \ncontentious, but always frank meetings. We met with military personnel. \nWe met with the Polish Chief of Staff of the military. We met with the \nDefense Minister, the Prime Minister, and every major player. We did \nthe same in each of the countries in question. We have hosted the NAC. \nI was at a meeting with Senator Roth--I am the cochair and he is the \nchair of the NATO observer group--where there was so much brass in the \nroom, I thought the floor was going to crack. If I am not mistaken--and \nI may be mistaken--I think the person comparable to our chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff was present for every one of the nations in \nquestion, every one of them. I am serious. We debated and we argued and \nwe discussed. It was open and frank. There is nothing new about this, \nand there is nothing quick about it.\n  The wall went down almost 9 years ago. The Soviet Union crumbled. It \nended its existence. That was not yesterday, but a long while ago, in \npolitical terms. No one rushed out to judgment. The other thing I \nshould point out is that we, under Secretary Perry, the predecessor to \nSenator Nunn, sent out a group of what he called the Perry principles, \nthe requirements that each--I said Senator Nunn, who was our colleague \nwho I wish was still here; he has a different view from me on this. \nSenator Cohen is the Secretary of Defense. I know it, Bill, if you are \nlistening, I know it is Senator Cohen. But the truth of the matter is \nthat Secretary Perry set out some criteria that were minimum \nrequirements for any aspirant country to have to meet. By the way, just \nsetting out criteria has fundamentally changed the dynamic and the \npicture in Central and Eastern Europe, without even joining NATO.\n  If I told my colleagues in 1992 that I believed by the year 1998 that \nwe would have a circumstance where there was an accommodation to the \nHungarian minority in Romania or that any border disputes or claims \nwere settled by\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\nEastern European countries--and I could name them--and a whole range of \nother things, that there would be total civilian control of the \nmilitary in Poland, et cetera, I think they would have thought that \nprobably wasn't going to happen. But because we said to all nations who \nwish to be part of NATO, hey, look, there are certain basic drop-dead \nrequirements to even be considered, democracies who lack imperial \ndesigns, abide by certain rules, and here are the minimum rules even to \nget in the game, and we laid them out--I might note, parenthetically, \nthat I attended a conference with some leading Chinese Government \nfolks--not dissidents--and we get the same kind of arguments with \nregard to China. If you want China to continue its market programs and \nmarket economies, you have to go easy on them. You have to back up and \nyou have to slow up.\n  The question I raised there was, hey, wait a minute, if in fact you \nwant to be part of the civilized world and seek civilized behavior and \ncivilized treatment, when you sign an agreement and make a deal, should \nwe not hold you to that deal? There are certain minimum requirements to \nbe able to establish your bona fides as even an aspirant democracy or a \nmarket economy.\n  In the case of Russia, can anybody in Russia say now, next year, or \ncould they say yesterday that the minimum requirement for a peaceful \ndemocracy is, by the way, my neighbor has a right to choose, assuming \nit is nonthreatening to me, whatever alliance they wish. It is called \ntheir national sovereignty. We relinquish any claim to hegemony. It \nseems to me to be a minimum nonstarter if you fail to do that, a \nminimum requirement, a nonstarter, if you fail to do that. How have we \nthreatened Russia? I am the author of the act that became the Freedom \nSupport Act under President Bush. What have we done to threaten Russia? \nThe irony is how the tables are turned here.\n  In the early 1970's, some of my conservative colleagues would look at \nme as if I were an apologist for the Soviet Union. And here I am now \nsaying expand NATO to include these three nations, assuming they meet \nthe criteria, and extend beyond what we already have, a hand of \nfriendship and help to Russia. They are not inconsistent. As a matter \nof fact, in my humble opinion, if you would like to diminish the drive \ntoward democratization in Russia, if you would like to diminish the \nprospects of an emerging market economy in Russia, let the browns and \nthe reds, let the nationalists within Russia crow about how their \nunsatisfactory response to expansion in NATO was the reason why the \nUnited States did not go along and vote to expand NATO. If you want to \ngive antidemocratic forces in Russia a boost, that is a good one. That \nis the one to do.\n  That is not the intention of any of my colleagues. This is a \nlegitimate, honest, and open debate. I am not questioning the motives \nof any man or woman in this body. Not a one of us desire anything other \nthan security in Europe and a democratic Russia. That is a universe \nthat all of us can agree on in this body.\n  I think we kind of have it backwards, because, as I said earlier, I \nthink what is strung throughout this, as Senator Warner and Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire--I do not want to put words in their mouths. So \nI will say they did not take strong exception to my saying what this is \nreally about is whether or not there should be a NATO; not whether or \nnot to expand NATO but whether or not there should be a NATO. That is a \nlegitimate debate. We have not addressed that in 50 years. For 50 \nyears, we have said this is a good thing. The world has changed, as \nthey point out. It is legitimate to debate whether or not we should \neven have NATO. But let's not confuse expanding to include these three \ncountries with whether or not there should even be a NATO. If it is \nabout NATO and its existence, let's debate it. Because, as I said, I \nconstantly hear, What is the threat? My response is, If you don't think \nthere is any threat now or in the future, why NATO? Why not save a lot \nmore money? Why not bring all 100,000 folks home? Let's do that. Some \nwould say, yes, let's do that. But I think it is real important we get \nour facts straight. After a tremendous amount of study and discussion \nby more than 70 Senators and 4 different committees, and the Senate \nNATO observer group, before we began the debate, we began on the floor \nlast month to focus attention on whether we were going to vote up or \ndown for or against expansion.\n  So I welcome this climactic debate. As with many momentous decisions, \nthere are legitimate questions to be asked, and it is always easier to \ncriticize than create. But, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to \nfall into the trap of failing to see the forest for the trees. Let's \nstep back a little bit and take a look at the big picture.\n  By enlarging NATO membership to include Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic, we will merely be catching up with reality. For \ncenturies, these three countries have been part of the West. Four \ndecades of Communist oppression and isolation was the historical \naberration that has been all but corrected culturally and economically. \nPrague, Budapest, and Warsaw are now every bit as European as Madrid, \nParis, and Berlin. It would be, in my view, indeed, perverse to \nrecreate Stalin's immoral and artificial dividing line through the \nheart of Europe. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic belong in \nNATO, and in the European Union. They will soon join these \norganizations.\n  I would parenthetically note, if you were a Russian and you had the \nchoice of having other European nations near you join NATO, or join the \nEU, I suspect they would view their economic interests as the most \nnegatively impacted upon by the EU being enlarged and them not being a \npart of it.\n  What are we talking about? We talk about how we are offending the \nEuropeans or expanding the EU. We are offending Russia to expand the \nEuropean Union. Great. Great. You are sitting in Russia. Hey, good \nidea. I now have bilateral relationships that work pretty well with \nPoland and with Hungary and with these other countries. But I will tell \nyou, they are now going to join the EU, and we don't get a piece of the \naction.\n  Look, you cannot have it both ways. If this is about Russian pride, \nRussians feeling they are not part of the West, Russians not being \ninvolved in a way that they see their future in the West, then how does \nisolating them economically in the same way it is isolating them \nmilitarily, how does that convince any Russian leader? ``They won't let \nme sell my widgets in Paris. But they say I am part of the West. They \nare welcoming me. I need to sell my widgets so I can employ my \npeople.''\n  The same polls we hear bandied about--the last poll I recall being \nconducted in Russia, the Russian people didn't even raise NATO on the \nscale of concern. Zero. Literally zero, of little or no concern to \nthem.\n\n  So it would be perverse if we were to say that, ``Hey, by the way, \nyou can't join NATO until you are part of the EU.'' As if Russian is \ngoing to say, ``Oh, that's a good idea. I really want Poland in the EU \nand a member of NATO. That will make me feel a lot better.''\n  It is kind of hard to get a handle on this. But let me just read this \npoll: 53 percent say Poland--this is in Russia, a Gallup poll, March 14 \nof this year--53 percent say Poland should be allowed to join NATO.\n  Did you hear what I just said? Fifty-three percent say Poland should \nbe allowed to join NATO; 57 percent say the Czech Republic should be \nallowed to join NATO; 54 percent say Hungary should be allowed to join \nNATO, and 25 percent had no view on the matter. Threat? That is one of \nthe reasons I think, by the way, that the Russian people think that, \nNo. 1. This is conjecture on my part; no poll says this. I cannot cite \nany evidence of this. But I think they are like the American people. \nThey are pretty smart, intuitively pretty smart. They know if Poland is \npart of NATO that any of the harebrained schemes any of their leaders \nmay have in the future about sending their boys to Poland will be \neliminated. I think they are pretty smart. They kind of have us figured \nout.\n  If, in fact, national Poland is a part of NATO, they realize their \npolitical leadership in the future, as well as what is already done \nnow, will have to finally shed 500 years, from czar through commissar, \nof a notion that somehow in American terms there is a manifest destiny \nfor Russia to control Poland or any other place west of their \nboundaries.\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\n  Don't you kind of find it fascinating that a majority of the Russian \npeople say these countries should be able to join? We talk about this \nlike it is a vacuum, where we are operating in a vacuum. How about all \nthose European countries, our allies? I am not suggesting we should \ntake a different kind of poll; that is, the more nations that agree, \nthe better it is. But in counter to the argument that you know the best \nway to bring Russia around permanently is not to have NATO expanded. \nBut the countries who are most threatened by Russia over the years, \ndon't you kind of find it fascinating they think expansion is a good \nidea? We hardly agree with the French on anything. We can't even agree \nwith them on Coca-Cola. We hardly have similar values. We hardly agree \non any foreign policy national matter, except NATO. They think it is a \ngood idea. The Brits think it is a good idea. The Danes and Spaniards \nthink it is a good idea. The Italians and Greeks think it is a good \nidea. It is the only thing the Greeks and Turks agree on.\n  Those who argue for expansion sometimes exaggerate the benefits that \nflow from this picture. I assure you that those who argue against \nexpansion vastly exaggerate it and the potential damage that can be \ndone to the emergence of a democracy in Russia.\n  I ask my colleagues: What are we worried about? Are we worried about \nRussia? Of course, in public most Russian politicians will grouse about \nNATO enlargement. Public pronouncements cost them nothing. But from my \nmany conversations with Russian politicians, both here and in Moscow, I \ncan tell you that not one--not one, I repeat, not one--think that the \nentry of Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO will \nconstitute a military threat to Russia, including a long private \nluncheon with Chernomyrdin not too long ago--2 weeks, 3 weeks ago, \nwhenever he was here last.\n\n  Now, it would be my opponents, the opponents of enlargement in this \ncountry, who will cite a range of issues on which Russia and the United \nStates have different policies and then point the wagging finger at \nNATO enlargement as the universal culprit. One size fits all. Secretary \nAlbright used an apt metaphor when she labeled NATO enlargement as the \nopponents' ``El Nino.'' They blame it for everything wrong in the \nUnited States-Russian relationship.\n  But even a superficial familiarity with the recent history of our \nrelationship gives the lie to such illogic. Russian Communists and \nultranationalists were against ratifying START II before NATO \nenlargement was even a gleam in the eyes of Lech Walesa and Havel, let \nalone U.S. policy. Why were Russian Communists and ultranationalists \nagainst it? I'll tell you why. Because American arms control \nnegotiators did a heck of a job, and Russia knew it.\n  That does not mean that ratifying START II isn't in Russia's self-\ninterest. It is. But it will take some hard swallowing for them to take \nthat step. It's all part of Russia coming to terms with the end of an \nempire. And this difficult psychological adjustment lies at the root of \nthe Russian rhetoric against NATO enlargement. But I repeat, when you \nget down to brass tacks in discussions with Russian leaders, absolutely \nnone of them think that their country's security will be threatened by \nPolish, Czech, or Hungarian troops being part of NATO--none.\n  Why should they worry? Do my colleagues really believe NATO is \nanything but a defensive alliance? Surely they don't want to validate \ncrude Russian cold war stereotypes of NATO as a rapacious aggressor \njust waiting to invade Mother Russia. We all know that NATO never had a \nplan to invade Russia. Do you know what? The Russians know it, too. How \ndo I know that? They know it because thanks to the NATO-Russia Founding \nAct, which was signed in Paris last May, Russians have a permanent \nphysical presence at NATO headquarters in Brussels and at SHAPE \nheadquarters in Mons, Belgium. They take part in all discussions with \nNATO members, and they see for themselves that NATO has no hostile \nintentions.\n  If they don't believe my analysis, let me quote from an article by \nthe Defense Minister of the Russian Federation in the spring of 1999 \nedition of the NATO Review. The very fact that the Russian Defense \nMinister is now contributing, I might add, to the NATO Review, I \nbelieve says something in itself, as does the title of his article: \n``We Are Not Adversaries, We Are Partners.''\n  Although the Russian Defense Minister repeats the obligatory negative \nattitude toward NATO expansion, the vast majority of his article \nstresses the positive. In particular, he declares:\n\n       Today it is an established fact that Russia and NATO no \n     longer regard each other as adversaries. * * * Moreover, a \n     partnership in maintaining peace and security on the \n     continent has begun to take shape in our relations. The NATO-\n     Russia Founding Act is an example of this.\n\n  It doesn't sound to me like a guy who thinks that expansion \njeopardizes the security interest of his country. So let's give the \nRussians a little credit for being intelligent, thinking people who are \nnot captives of outdated, ideological propaganda. From the Gallup Poll \nI read you, clearly the Russian people are not. And, obviously, the \nRussian military is not either.\n  If some of my colleagues still don't believe me, I direct their \nattention to the balance sheet of recent Russian international \nbehavior. On the negative side, from America's point of view, is their \nunwillingness to follow our lead on inspections of suspected Iraqi \nmilitary sites, weapons sites.\n  Does anyone really think this had anything whatsoever to do with NATO \nenlargement? Russia has two centuries worth of involvement in the \nMiddle East, has had Iraq as a major client for decades, has a foreign \nminister who specializes in that area and has had a lengthy personal \nfriendship with Saddam Hussein. It is nothing to do with NATO.\n  I may be wrong, but I doubt that when Mr. Primakov and Saddam Hussein \nget together, they talk about the evils of the enlargement of NATO.\n\n  And, I might add parenthetically, if the reason why the Russians \ndidn't go along with our plan--someone explain to me, my ancestors, the \nFrench, how did they arrive at that? Was their decision to side with \nRussia relative to inspectors because of NATO enlargement? I think it \nwas. I think it was. It is bizarre--I am only joking. I don't think it \nwas.\n  So, you can't have it both ways. It is often cited: You know, they \nwere with us in the gulf war. France was with us in the gulf war. It \nwas a different circumstance. A country had been invaded. They are not \nwith us now, nor is France with us this time.\n  How about Iran, another irritant in our relationship with Russia? \nRussia's involvement with Persia is even older than that with the Arab \nworld. We certainly must and do oppose Russian investment in Iran and \narms shipments and technology transfers to that country. But, again, \ntheir policies are grounded on historic geopolitics on their southern \nflank, economic distress, and lax controls--not on NATO expansion.\n  Or let me frame the issue another way. I ask the critics of NATO \nenlargement, if NATO rejects enlargement, rebuffs Poland, Hungary, and \nthe Czech Republic, who have met NATO's rigid membership \nqualifications, is anyone going to be prepared to come to the floor \nhere--the staffs of the opponents are listening here--is anyone going \nto come to the floor and say, if we reject NATO expansion, and we do it \non the floor in the next week or so, that out of heartfelt gratitude \nyou are going to see Russia break off relations with Iran, break off \nrelations with Iraq--which is what we wish them to do--and immediately \nratify the START agreement? What do you think?\n  If Senator Roth and I lose on this one, I'm willing to bet you a \nyear's salary, and that is all I have is my salary. It's plenty, but \nthat's all I have. I am willing to bet you a year's salary--that's a \njoke. I'm not allowed to bet on the floor. I don't really mean it. I'll \nget letters saying Biden is gambling with his salary. But I will bet \nyou anything that I'm allowed to bet that circumstances, in terms of \nthe ties with Iran and Iraq, will increase, not diminish; that there \nwill be less prospect for future arms control because the nationalists \nwill have prevailed and they will triumph, and they will trumpet their \ntriumph. So, look, if NATO expansion is the reason these bad things are \nhappening to the extent they are happening, then obviously, if it's \ndefeated, a lot of good things are going to happen. Don't hold your \nbreath.\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\n  Let's turn to the other side of the ledger and go back for a minute \nto arms control. What is Russia's recent record? I keep hearing from my \nfriend from Virginia: You know it's going to be the end of arms \ncontrol. Everything is going to come to a screeching halt because this \noccurred, because we voted to expand --so on and so forth. Let's look \nat the record. Much as opponents of NATO enlargement would like to \nforget, the facts are that within the past year the state Duma and \nFederation Council have ratified two critically important international \ntreaties. One is the Flank Document to the Treaty on Conventional \nForces in Europe. As the Presiding Officer and all my colleagues know, \nthat is the treaty that talks about how much materiel, armored \npersonnel carriers, et cetera, weapons, heavy weapons that each side \ncould have and where they could have them.\n  We just modified that agreement. They ratified it--an arms control \nagreement.\n  With regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention, I was told once we \npassed it here, that would be the end of it in the Duma. If I am not \nmistaken, it was almost the very day we were in either Paris or Spain \nwhere the President and the 15 other NATO heads of state were \ninviting--inviting--these three additional countries to join that by an \noverwhelming vote, their version of our Senate and House, the Duma, \nwent ahead and overwhelmingly ratified a very controversial arms \ncontrol agreement requiring them to destroy thousands of tons of \nchemical weapons.\n  Even now, the Yeltsin government has pledged to push for ratification \nof START II. Russia is well ahead of schedule in its destruction \nobligations under START I, and the Russians continue to work with us in \nimplementing the vitally important Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program. That doesn't sound like a country that is so blinded \nby hatred for NATO enlargement that it is opting out of international \narms control agreements.\n  How about cooperation in conventional weapons? I might add, \nChernomyrdin, when he met with us here, predicted by the end of summer, \nhe was confident that they would ratify the START II treaty. But how \nabout conventional weapons? Russia and the United States and 28 other \ncountries signed the CFE Treaty and, as a consequence, destroyed more \nthan 53,000 pieces of heavy equipment in this decade. And the process \ncontinues.\n  Does that sound like a country that is opting out, figuring there is \na threat and they are going to stop and start to rebuild? Not only not \nrebuild it, they are continuing to meet their obligations under the CFE \nTreaty and destroying military equipment.\n  Let me say that again. More than 53,000 tanks, armored personnel \ncarriers, artillery pieces and helicopters, and guess what, NATO \nenlargement hasn't stopped this remarkable process on multilateral \ndisarmament, and it won't stop it after Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic finally join the alliance.\n  Finally, NATO enlargement has not prevented Russian forces from \nserving side by side with U.S. forces under NATO command in Bosnia. In \nmy last of several trips to Bosnia, I was standing at what we call Camp \nMcGovern. I was standing out in the field talking to an American one-\nstar general. A Russian colonel who looked every bit like the guy who \nfought Sylvester Stallone in Rocky IV, whatever that was, ramrod \nstraight, 6 foot 3, wearing a Russian uniform, comes up, seeks to \ninterrupt, salutes the American general and asks what his orders are.\n  I don't know. For all this lack of cooperation we are talking about, \nhow much the Russians hate expansion, how much they view it as a \nthreat, how it is going to bring to a crashing end any cooperation on \nmilitary matters, on arms control, conventional and strategic, I don't \nsee it. I see no evidence to suggest that.\n  For someone like me of the cold war generation, this was mind-\nboggling to watch this Russian colonel salute an American general. In \nspite of the policy differences between Moscow and Washington with \nregard to Bosnian Serbs, cooperation on the ground is exemplary. I \nheard the same thing from the Russian Ambassador who is deputy to the \nAmerican civilian administrator in Brcko when I was in Bosnia. I \nscarcely need to say that neither the Russian colonel nor the Russian \nAmbassador had even one word to say about NATO enlargement. It was a \nnonissue to them. In fairness, there was no way I brought it up. It \nwasn't like they raised it and I responded. Nobody said anything to me.\n  The salient point which the naysayers would like to obscure is that \nNATO enlargement is simply a matter of catching up with reality. It \nwould be nothing less than grotesque, in my view, for the U.S. Senate, \nout of a totally misplaced fear of offending Russian sensibilities, to \nconsign the thoroughly Western Poles, Czechs and Hungarians either to \nMoscow's sphere of influence or to a ``gray zone'' in Central Europe.\n  Imposed spheres of influence have no place in Europe in the 21st \ncentury. Every country must have the right to choose its own political \nsystem, its own economic system, its own cultural direction and its own \nsecurity arrangements, including whether or not to join the alliance. \nIf we would reject the Poles, the Czechs and Hungarians for fear of \nantagonizing the Russians, the only people we would be helping would be \nthe Russian ultranationalists and Communists by validating their \noutdated, vicious portrait of the United States, a view not shared by \nthe democrats.\n\n  The worst you hear, by the way, in Russia from Russian democrats, the \nworst you hear is not that ``we think expansion is a threat, we think \nexpansion will be a problem to us.'' We know it is not. The worst you \nhear is ``this expansion will or might give fodder to the \nultranationalists and the Communists in our battle to establish \ndemocracy.'' That is the worst you hear--the worst you hear.\n  The only people, in my view, we would be helping if we rejected \nexpansion would be the ultranationalists and Communists by, again, \nvalidating their outdated and vicious portrait of the West and their \noutdated and dangerous notion of what they are entitled to do in terms \nof influencing their neighbors.\n  That rather obvious conclusion brings up a more basic point, which is \nregularly glossed over by the opponents of NATO enlargement. The choice \nis not between enlarging or maintaining the status quo; the harsh \nreality is that the status quo is not an option.\n  It is myopic, in my view, to believe that three booming, vigorous \nCentral European countries, all of whom have bitter historical memories \nof Russian domination, if rebuffed by NATO would sit idly by and trust \ngood fortune to protect them.\n  It should be obvious that they will not. They didn't do it in the \ninterwar period earlier in this century, and they wouldn't do it now. \nThe renationalization of security policy would take place, undoing all \nthe stability that has been painstakingly created since the fall of \ncommunism. It would allow the poisonous forces of ethnic and religious \nhatred and international crime to regain a foothold in that volatile \nregion.\n  Nearly 60 million highly educated, talented Central Europeans are \nready and willing to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic \narea. All three candidate countries have carried out rigorous reforms \nto conform to NATO's political and military standards. All three have \nalready contributed to NATO-led missions in the gulf war and in Bosnia. \nThey will be an invaluable asset in controlling the forces of chaos and \ndestruction that are now the real threats in Central and Eastern \nEurope. Indeed, this is the basic rationale for NATO enlargement--to \nextend the zone of peace and stability in Europe. It is a zone within \nwhich democracies do not fight with each other and which other \ncountries, Russia included, need not fear.\n  Obviously, there are certain risks associated with NATO enlargement, \nas there are with any policy initiative. But the risk of not enlarging \nNATO, of not catching up with history, in my view, are far greater.\n  One other word about history. In the frantic flurry of last-minute \nattempts to derail ratification of NATO enlargement, I have even heard \nthe accusation that we would be undermining the young Russian \ndemocracy, of helping to create a so-called ``Weimar Russia.'' Well, \nthat charge wins the prize for historic illiteracy.\n\n[[Page S3642]]\n\n  After World War I, the victorious allies imposed punitive reparations \nupon Weimar Germany and kept it out of the League of Nations until \n1926.\n  After the cold war, on the contrary, the victorious West has done \nexactly the opposite with Russia. The United States and Western Europe \nhave pumped more than $100 billion in aid and investment into Russia \nand have brought Russia into the international bodies where it was \nformerly not represented. They have even brought Russia into a working \nrelationship with the inner councils of NATO itself.\n  So please, in this round of Senate debate, let us spare ourselves \nhearing about ``Weimar Russias'' and ``Iron Rings'' and other \nridiculous historic constructions. We are building a partnership with \nRussia which can continue to grow. Later in this session, Senators will \nhave the opportunity to strengthen this process by voting resoundingly \nfor the administration's enhanced funding request for assistance to \nRussia and the Nunn-Lugar program. I want to see all those who are \nopposed to expansion of NATO on the grounds of, it is going to offend \nRussia, to step up to the ball and do what they say they really are \nconcerned about. Let us see them vote for enhanced funding for \nassistance to Russia and the Nunn-Lugar program.\n  Another canard of the opponents of enlargement is that we will saddle \nthe American taxpayer with mountainous new costs. Although I would \ninvite my colleagues who wish to debate this to set a time tomorrow to \ndo that, and do it in a coherent way, let me very briefly speak to \nthat.\n  Fortunately, we now have indisputable facts to refute this element of \nthe basic scare tactic which is being engaged in: Is it going to cost \n$250 billion? $125 billion? and so on. NATO officials estimate that the \ntotal common cost of enlargement is $1.5 billion over 10 years. Of \nthis, the share of the United States will be approximately $400 \nmillion, or an average of about $40 million per year over 10 years. And \nthat is based upon our accepting the same proportion of responsibility \nfor enlargement as we have for NATO thus far--burdensharing as we have \nbeen engaged in it for the past 20 years.\n  As I said, later in the floor debate I hope to have an opportunity to \nexplain this official cost estimate in some vivid detail. For now, \nhowever, I refer the doubters to the analysis of two U.S. Government \nagencies, the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  The GAO concluded last month that NATO's approach to determining the \n$1.5 billion estimate over 10 years is reasonable. The CBO, which \ntraditionally uses worst-case analysis as a hedge against any surprises \nin the future, set the common cost at $2.5 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  The worst estimate is one-tenth of what the worst estimate suggested \nby our colleagues is. Even the CBO figure, however, would yield an \nannual American contribution that amounts to only .15 percent of our \ntotal defense budget--.15 percent--almost only one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  One final word is in order. No resolution, or even final legislation, \nis perfect. And there may be a few areas in the resolution of \nratification that could be improved upon. Senator Helms and I plan to \noffer an en bloc managers' amendment that includes several of the \namendments proposed to date.\n  I anticipate that in these coming days several other amendments to \nthe resolution of ratification will be offered and we will have ample \ntime to discuss them. So I will not go into detail now. But, Mr. \nPresident, I see my senior colleague from Delaware is on the floor, so \nlet me wrap up what I am about to say and what I have been saying in \norder to give him a chance to speak.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that the resolution of \nratification is thoroughly a bipartisan product, as you will soon hear \nfrom my colleague from Delaware, a product in the committee crafted by \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms and \nmyself, with significant input from other members of the committee and \nour respective staffs. It was voted out of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee by a vote of 16-2 after hundreds and hundreds of pages of \nrecorded testimony for and against expansion.\n  I urge my colleagues to reread the resolution before offering \namendments, for upon careful scrutiny, some of them prove to be \nsuperfluous, others harmful, and some both.\n  An example of this is the amendment introduced by my friend and \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia which would mandate a 3-year \npause for additional countries before they could be invited to join the \nalliance, if they were to be invited. This would tie our hands \ndiplomatically, Mr. President, if, for example, a clearly qualified \ncountry like Austria should apply for membership, and will put an \narbitrary hold on Slovenia's case for membership which I believe is \nalready convincing.\n  Other amendments offered by my friend, the distinguished senior \nSenator from New York, for whom I have no higher regard, would require \nnew NATO members to first join the European Union. This, in my view, \nequates apples and oranges, forgetting that the criteria to qualify for \nthose two organizations are dramatically different.\n  Moreover, his amendment would turn the institutional history of the \nlast 50 years on its head. Traditionally, NATO membership has preceded \nEU membership. And I would further add that he chooses, as we are \ntrying to come up with a new architect for the security of Europe, a \nrequirement to go forward first by a group of which we are not a member \nand in which we have no say.\n  We are not a member of the EU. To suggest that, before we could \nconsider membership in NATO, it has to be decided by the EU whether or \nnot they can join essentially takes us out of the game. And every time \nwe have been taken out of the game in Europe--I might note \nparenthetically, this is not a direct analogy--but every time we have \nbeen taken out of the game or taken ourselves out, there has been real \ntrouble in Europe. We are still a European power. We must remain a \nEuropean power. We must continue to have a major say in the structures \nof Europe, because we have found, when we do not, nothing good usually \nhappens.\n  Still other amendments proposed by the junior Senator from Texas and \nthe junior Senator from Missouri would use the enlargement ratification \nprocess as a vehicle to alter the very fundamentals of the NATO treaty \nthat exists today, either by changing the rules of the North Atlantic \nCouncil or by putting severe restrictions on non-article V missions--an \nissue that is being debated right now within NATO.\n  I want to put my colleagues on notice that I will oppose any \namendments that will undermine the most successful military alliance in \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, nearly 50 years ago, NATO was founded to counter a \nSoviet threat in Western Europe and to establish stability in the rest \nof Europe. Today, the new threat is instability itself arising out of \nethnic and religious conflicts. And this is, at a minimum, a hedge \nagainst any future wrongheaded decisions by Russia. Enlarging NATO to \ninclude Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary is a unique opportunity \nto expand the zone of stability in the continent. It serves America's \ninterest, Europe's interest, and the world's interest. I am absolutely \nconfident, if we do this, history will record, as well, it serves \nRussian interests.\n  I thank the Chair, and I now am happy to yield the floor to my \ncolleague from Delaware, Senator Roth.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. First, let me express my gratitude and thanks to my \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Delaware, for his effective \nleadership in this most important foreign affairs matter. He, of \ncourse, speaks as an expert, as one who is the ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee and, of course, cochairs with me the Senate \nobserver group. I just want to publicly acknowledge the strong \nleadership role he is playing in what I consider the most important \nforeign policy matter that will come before this Congress.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent David Stephens of \nSenator Kyl's staff be permitted on the floor for the duration of the \ndebate on NATO enlargement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as the Senate resumes consideration of the \nresolution of ratification for NATO enlargement, I would like to \ncommend my colleagues for the debate that has occurred thus far.\n  In the few days that the Senate has already dedicated to this \nimportant issue, and I speak before the debate today, some 21 Members \nof this Chamber have expressed their views. I have listened intently to \ntheir arguments and I have been impressed by the substantive dialog. \nThis vote on NATO and its future is perhaps the most important foreign \npolicy decision we will make since the end of the cold war. I \nappreciate the efforts my colleagues have dedicated to this matter.\n  I have long felt that NATO enlargement is a policy whose time is past \ndue. The case for NATO enlargement is indisputable. The accession of \nPoland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, the only three countries that \nare the focus of the resolution before us, will, without a doubt, \nstrengthen the alliance. It will eliminate the stabilizing and immoral \ndividing lines imposed upon Europe by dictators of the past. It will \nconsolidate peace and stability on that continent. A stable and \npeaceful Europe will benefit the entire transatlantic community, as \nwell as Russia.\n  I could elaborate on these points and other important benefits of \nNATO enlargement, but I have done that on many occasions in the past. \nToday, instead, I wish to address a number of arguments that I have \nheard made directly against this important policy. For example, in the \ncourse of our debate it has been incorrectly asserted that the Senate \nis rushing this important debate and that it remains inadequately \nprepared to address this issue.\n  This is wrong. Few issues of national security have been as \nextensively examined by the Congress as well as the public. NATO \nenlargement has been the topic of countless editorials and opinion \npieces in national and local papers. By one estimate, over 1,000 \nscholarly article opinion pieces and editorials on NATO enlargement \nhave been published in leading journals since 1994. A quick count of \neditorials and opinion pieces in the New York Times found that it has \nrun some 72 such articles over the past 3 years. A quick survey of the \nWashington Post found another 90 over the same period of time. In other \nwords, these two nationally syndicated papers have published articles \non NATO enlargement at a rate exceeding one every 10 days. This does \nnot take into account the other important national, local journals.\n  I might suggest that those who believe this issue has not been well \nvetted may not be reading the right papers. Either that or they have \nnot been interested enough in the issue to be aware that a debate \nconcerning this policy has been waged for 3 years. Over the last 2 \nyears, some 15 States--including my first State, Delaware--have passed \nresolutions endorsing nuclear enlargement. Moreover, this policy has \nbeen endorsed by countless civic public policy, political, business, \nand veteran organizations.\n  I point to a chart beside me, the number of organizations that have \nsupported NATO enlargement. All of our outstanding veteran \norganizations, the AMVETS, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign \nWars--just to mention a few--have all endorsed NATO enlargement. We \ncould point to the many other organizations that have done exactly the \nsame.\n  Congress itself has been deeply engaged in NATO enlargement from the \nvery beginning of this policy initiative. In fact, Congress has not \nonly done its homework on this matter, Congress Has led the charge for \nNATO enlargement. I think that is particularly important to understand, \nthat Congress has been in the lead on NATO enlargement.\n  Its committees have examined in detail the military, intelligence, \nforeign policy and budgetary implications of this long overdue \ninitiative.\n  Since last July alone, thirteen hearings have been conducted on NATO \nenlargement by the Senate Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed \nServices, Appropriations, and Budget.\n  The Senate NATO Observer Group, which I chair with Senator Joe Biden, \nhas convened seventeen times with, among others, the President, the \nSecretaries of State and Defense, NATO's Secretary General, and the \nleaders of the three invitee countries.\n  In support of these Congressional initiatives, the Congressional \nResearch Service and the General Accounting Office have produced some \n30 objective, non-partisan reports and countless memos on the subject \nof NATO enlargement.\n  As I said when we began this debate, it is no surprise--indeed, for \nme, it is a matter of pride--that Congress has legislatively promoted \nNATO enlargement every year since 1994. Perhaps a good question is how \ncan we ensure that all dimensions of U.S. national security policy \nbenefit from this much public attention and endorsement.\n  The second argument that one often hears falsely asserts that the \nextension of NATO membership to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary \nwill dilute the Alliance because their military capabilities do not \nmatch those of Allied nations.\n  It is true that the militaries of these three countries must be \nmodernized. They do not deny that. That is why these three countries \nhave embarked on military modernization programs that involve regular \nincreases in their defense budgets. And, these programs have been \nendorsed by NATO's political and military authorities.\n  Earlier this year, I and a few members of the NATO Observer Group met \nwith General Klaus Naumann, a highly respected German military officer \nwho is Chairman of NATO's military committee. He stated that because \nPoland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are so committed to modernizing \ntheir militaries they may sooner rather than later find themselves \nbetter equipped and more technologically advanced than some of the \ncurrent Allies.\n  To see the level of contribution that these countries will make to \nthe Alliance, we need only look at what they have done and are doing \ntoday. Already, they are enhancing the Alliance's military \ncapabilities. They contributed forces to Operation Desert Storm. They \nhave forces serving by the side of U.S. Forces as part of S-FOR in \nBosnia. They were among the first to commit forces to stand by the \nUnited States in the recent stand-off against Saddam Hussein.\n  NATO commanders, including those from the United States, have stated \nclearly that the admission of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary \nwill increase the capabilities of the Alliance. And this view is shared \nby some sixty retired four-star admirals and generals, including former \nChiefs of the Joint Staff, former Supreme Allied Commanders of Europe, \nand numerous former Service Chiefs.\n  Mr. President, the facts before us today, and the endorsements of \nthese military leaders, can only leave one fully confident that the \nadmission of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary into NATO will \nleave the Alliance stronger. We can be confident that these three \ndemocracies will not only be model members of the alliance but also \npro-American Allies.\n  A third argument that has been voiced by some of my colleagues \nfalsely asserts that NATO enlargement threatens Russia, or that we \nshould abandon this policy because Russia perceives it as threatening.\n  The reality is that NATO is a defensive Alliance of democracies. Its \ndecision-making process is consensual, and I find it hard to believe \nthat any one of its members--all democracies--would ever advocate \naggression.\n  The fact is that NATO poses no immediate military threat to Russia. \nU.S. force deployments in Europe, arguably the Alliance's most mobile \ncomponent, has been reduced by two-thirds since the Cold War. Allied \nforce structures and defense budgets have declined steadily over the \nlast decade. The Alliance has stated that it has no intention to \npermanently station foreign forces or deploy nuclear weapons on the \nterritories of new member states. Where is the threat to Russia?\n  Those who argue that NATO enlargement threatens Russia have also \nasserted that this policy directly contradicts efforts to reduce the \nrisk of nuclear confrontation with Russia and to ensure that Russia's \nnuclear arsenal does not leak out to rogue states.\n  The evidence however shows that this assertion is false. Since 1994, \nwhen NATO first announced its intentions to open its membership to the \ndemocracies of Central Europe, the risks of\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\nnuclear war have not increased, but been reduced. There is no evidence \nthat NATO enlargement has hurt cooperation with Russia on nuclear \nmatters.\n  First, the actual number of Russian and American operational \nstrategic nuclear weapons have continued to decline. In 1990, that \nnumber was about 24,000 warheads. Today, that number is in the vicinity \nof 14,000 warheads, and Moscow is dismantling its strategic nuclear \nforces at a rate faster than that required by the START I treaty.\n  Second, the Russian government has again reiterated its commitment to \nratify the START II treaty, which will further reduce these two \nstrategic nuclear arsenals. Those who note that the Russian parliament, \nwhich has voiced its opposition to NATO enlargement and continues to \nblock the ratification of START II, should recognize that the same Duma \nhas blocked START II long before NATO enlargement was formally endorsed \nby the NAC.\n  And, let me add that the Russian government has agreed to pursue a \nSTART III accord once START II enters force.\n  Third, the Nunn-Lugar Threat Reduction Program continues to improve \nthe Russian's control and security of their nuclear arsenal. Indeed, \nthis program has been enthusiastically received by Russia. It stands \nout as one of the true success stories of Russian-American partnership \nin the post-cold-war era.\n  Our policies toward Europe must focus on these objective strategic \nrealities and must be structured to enhance economic, political, and \nmilitary stability in all parts of Europe. That is exactly what NATO \nenlargement does. That is in our national interest and in Russia's \nnational interest.\n  For those who are still concerned about Russia's fear of NATO \nenlargement, let me share with you a recent poll conducted in Moscow.\n  Earlier this year, a branch of the Gallup Organization, found that \namong respondents in Moscow: 53 percent said that Poland should be \nallowed to join NATO; 57 percent said that the Czech Republic should be \nallowed to join NATO; and 54 percent said that Hungary should be \nallowed to join NATO.\n  These polling results are not surprising if one takes into account \nthe fact that NATO enlargement is facilitating unprecedented \nreconciliation between Russia and its neighbors. The reconciliation now \noccurring between Warsaw and Moscow and Moscow and Kyev are positive \ndevelopments for Russian citizens, and they understand this. They also \nunderstand that such developments would not be occurring with NATO \nenlargement.\n  And, let us not forget the open and inclusive manner in which Nato \nand the West has approached Russia. The Alliance has extended the hand \nof partnership through the NATO-Russia Founding Act, and today Russian \ntroops serve with NATO forces in Bosnia. The West has extended some \n$100 billion in assistance since 1991, to help Russia's democratic and \neconomic reforms, and over $2 billion in weapon dismantlement and \nsecurity assistance. On top of that, Russia has regularly been invited \nto participate in the G-7 or G-8 meetings. This is hardly--as some \ndetractors might try to persuade--a policy of punishment and isolation.\n  It is false and even misleading to assert that Russia is being \nsurrounded by a ring of isolation. Rather, NATO's policies have been \nmore like a strong magnet drawing Russia out of its historically self-\nimposed isolation into a growing web of political and military \ncooperation. Such cooperation holds out the prospect of an entirely new \nand constructive relationship with a reforming and democratic Russia.\n  Mr. President, I hope that these three points have added clarity to \nthe Senate's consideration of NATO membership. There are few policy \ninitiatives as important as this one. There are few that stand to offer \npeace-living people throughout the transatlantic community and in \nCentral and Eastern Europe so much hope--hope for greater stability, \nincreased security, enhanced cooperation, and even a collective vision \nfor the future. I encourage my colleagues to support NATO enlargement. \nHistory is being made, and for the sake of those who have long-awaited \nthis moment, we must not keep it waiting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the NATO issue. I \nunderstand that we have 10 minutes before a vote. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to address the legislation \nbefore the Senate, the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 to include Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic as members of the NATO alliance.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by sharing a statement made to me last \nfall by Hungarian Ambassador Banlaki during his visit to my office. He \nsaid, ``The people of my country would like to be able to choose our \nown allies. We would like to enjoy all those things that history has \ndenied us.''\n  Mr. President, I am here today to say, this is the U.S. Senate's \nchance to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic's hopes come \ntrue--let them choose their own allies for they are choosing to join \nNATO where they have been denied in the past the right to choose their \nown allies. We all know that. We all understand that.\n\n  Let me be clear--I am fully supportive of this treaty before the \nSenate allowing these three countries membership into NATO. NATO is an \nalliance that has been a success beyond anyone's expectations--it has \nnever been permeated--and since its inception, no great wars have been \nfought within its borders.\n  NATO embodies our continued commitment to Europe. Its existence ties \nU.S. security to peaceful relations among our European allies. The \nhistoric, political and cultural connection between the U.S. and Europe \nprovide the foundation for this transatlantic alliance.\n  The objective of the myriad institutions and organizations created in \nthe aftermath of World War II were a reaction to the carnage of two \ngreat wars in the first half of this century. The NATO alliance, the \nOrganization for Cooperation and Development, and the European Union \nwere all created with one purpose in mind--preventing further conflict \nbetween the states of Europe. This goal of peace was achieved. The only \ntragic failure in the history of these alliances was their inability to \nencompass nations beyond the Iron Curtain.\n  Today we have the opportunity to realize what was impossible only a \nfew years ago--expanding a cooperative alliance to the nations \npreviously locked in a coercive pact.\n  I have listened to many of the arguments for amending this treaty and \nfor delaying this treaty. I have also heard the criticism aimed at the \nU.S. Senate for not debating it further.\n  So let me make this point--NATO was a defensive alliance. But it was \nnever an exclusive alliance. We in the free world waited for the day \nwhen the rest of Europe would be free--free from tyranny, free from \ncommunism, and free from the everyday controls placed on the people of \nEastern and Central Europe.\n  Mr. President, that day is here. These countries are free. They have \nbeen free for 7 years. They have struggled to establish democratic, \nfree market societies. To a greater or lesser degree, all three of them \nare being successful. They desire a place at the table among the \ndemocratic, free states of the West. And in my opinion, we should have \nallowed them to join NATO sooner than 1999, as this treaty before us \nstates.\n\n  This Senate would be foolhardy to turn its back now on these \ncountries or even to continue to delay the treaty's implementation.\n  In January, I visited the NATO headquarters in Brussels and met with \nNATO officials as well as the ambassadors from the new member \ncountries. I was impressed by their perspective that this was not NATO \nexpanding out to engulf these countries, but rather this was Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic asking to come into NATO.\n  It is crucial to remember that NATO is not expanding against any \nsovereign\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\nwill, but exactly the opposite. This treaty allows the West to let \nthese countries fulfill their destinies--and if this Senate does not \nallow the treaty to pass and pass quickly--we are denying them the \nultimate freedom--as the Hungarian Ambassador said--to choose their own \nallies.\n  I do not believe that Russia should fear the free association of \nallies, even those that might have been former enemies. There is \nnothing for Russia to fear. They should be reassured that the borders \nof Russia are peaceful today, that there is a united and growing \nEurope. They should be welcoming of NATO's ability to maintain peace \nand harmony among its members.\n  I would like to address those Senators who have expressed the need to \nlink European Union membership with NATO membership. We must recognize \nthat NATO enlargement, European Union expansion and monetary union are \ninextricably linked.\n  Last fall, I began considering the different arguments for and \nagainst this treaty. The Committee which I chair, the Senate Budget \nCommittee, held a series of hearings on U.S.--European issues which \ngave me a different perspective to the many questions about the U.S. \nand Western European roles in Eastern Europe.\n  We cannot ignore that it was the presence of a U.S.-led NATO that \nprovided the security for European Union that has facilitated its \neconomic development. Without sovereign security, economic security \ncannot happen. These are exciting, new times in Europe. We have Europe \nin the next months uniting beyond its original common market alliances \nto become a monetary union.\n  While I know European Union membership is desired by Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic, EU membership is very different from NATO \nmembership. And Monetary Union cannot even be considered until \nmembership to the EU has been granted. Someday, I am convinced, they \nwill become members of the European Union.\n  Some day, when they have developed their free markets which are \nemerging and their emerging new democracies, they will also be part of \nthe new monetary union, the new single currency that many European \ncountries will have in the not too distant future. They need the \nsecurity and the structures of democracy to make capitalism work. To \ntie NATO membership with European Union membership at this time would \nnot be wise. Defense security first will then lead to economic \nsecurity.\n  On costs, over the last few months, I have had CBO, GAO and the \nadministration explain their estimates of the costs of NATO expansion. \nCBO estimates that the costs to the U.S. will approximate $100 million \nper year for the next four or five years.\n  From the perspective of the Budget Committee, this cost is very \naffordable when compared to the overall levels of defense spending this \nyear of $272 billion that we approved for the 1999 budget resolution.\n  Let me conclude Mr. President, that while the debate on NATO has \nraised several issues, one issue keeps dominating my thoughts. Here is \nan alliance, that once was designed to respond to the threats of the \nCold War. Those threats included the armies of Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic. Now this same alliance is being asked by those same \nthree countries to be allowed to join today. How can we possibly say \nno?\n  I have no doubt that we are witnessing a major event in the histories \nof these former Warsaw Pact countries as well as the Free World.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article ``For \nExpansion: The Case Clinton Isn't Making'' from The Wall Street \nJournal, April 21, 1998, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              For Expansion: The Case Clinton Isn't Making\n\n                         (By Zalmay Kualilzad)\n\n       This week the Senate will start debating the question of \n     whether to allow the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to \n     join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A vote on the \n     issue is likely next week. Although the Clinton \n     administration supports NATO expansion, it has not made its \n     case forcefully enough. In its public defense of NATO \n     expansion, the administration has emphasized bringing the \n     three Central European states into the zone of democracy, \n     peace and prosperity. This argument is a good start, but a \n     much stronger case can be made. NATO expansion is vital not \n     only for the well-being of these potential new members, but \n     also for the security of the U.S. and its Western allies.\n       The first strategic argument for an expanded NATO is to \n     hedge against uncertainties in Russia. The administration \n     argues that NATO expansion is not directed against Russia. \n     This is true, to a point. As long as Russia is not \n     expansionist, it will have nothing to fear from an enlarged \n     NATO. In fact, a democratic and nonimperial Russia should be \n     NATO's partner. But Russia's future is not certain. Many in \n     the Russian elite are unhappy with the current international \n     system and the U.S.'s preeminence in it. They are nostalgic \n     for their lost empire and would like to reimpose hegemony \n     over the former Soviet territories and Eastern Europe.\n       Russia is too weak to dominate its former empire today. \n     However, even with its current difficulties, Moscow is \n     developing two new long-range nuclear missiles, is reluctant \n     to ratify the Start II treaty, and insists on interpreting \n     the Antiballistic Missile treaty in ways that put severe \n     limits on effective defense against ballistic missiles to \n     which both the U.S. and Russia are increasingly vulnerable. \n     Moscow's statements and behavior towards the Baltic states, \n     Ukraine, the Caspian Basin and Central Asia at times have \n     neoimperial overtones.\n       Russian weakness, however, will not last forever. Rich in \n     natural and human resources, it will eventually reemerge as a \n     great power. A revitalized and democratic Russia would most \n     likely seek greatness through economic prosperity and \n     political stability. However, should a revitalized Russia \n     prove hostile and expansionist, NATO membership for Eastern \n     European states will act as a powerful deterrent against \n     future Russian aggression in this region. Unfortunately, \n     Russia can go either way--and which way it goes will not \n     be affected by NATO expansion.\n       Second, an expanded NATO keeps Germany as part of an \n     American-led international system. Eastern Europe is \n     Germany's backyard, and the European Union is unable to look \n     after the security of Western Europe by itself, let alone \n     protect Eastern Europe. Therefore, if NATO does not stabilize \n     Germany's frontiers, Germany might do so alone. Germany is a \n     key democratic ally of the U.S. and prefers to cooperate \n     within NATO to stabilize Eastern and Central Europe. A \n     renationalization of German security policy will end NATO as \n     we know it and could lead to a less stable, less unified \n     Europe. This would create an enormous problem for U.S. \n     security interests, not only in Europe--both East and West--\n     but around the world.\n       Third, an expanded NATO strengthens the U.S. position in \n     Western Europe. The Eastern Europeans are more pro-American \n     than most of our current allies. They attribute their freedom \n     to the American-led containment of the Soviet Union, and they \n     know that the U.S. led the alliance to expand NATO eastward. \n     Within the alliance, they are likely to be strongly \n     supportive of the dominant U.S. role. And should they also \n     join the EU--as they are likely to--they will be a strong \n     force for a continued U.S.-European alliance.\n       Fourth, an expanded NATO ties Europe and the U.S. closer \n     together and opens the door for greater cooperation in other \n     parts of the world, especially the Middle East, a region \n     vital to both sides of the Atlantic.\n       NATO expansion eastward should be accompanied by an effort \n     to develop a common U.S.-European strategy for ensuring \n     energy security and for countering the spreading of weapons \n     of mass destruction and missiles. And we need to consider \n     steps to increase military cooperation between the U.S. and \n     European nations for the longer term and agree to financial \n     formulas for sharing the burden of Persian Gulf security as \n     the Europeans develop their military capabilities. The \n     Europeans have been freeloading at U.S. expense. Thousands of \n     the U.S. troops protect the gulf from Iran and Iraq. Europe \n     contributes little, though it is more dependent on the \n     region's oil and more vulnerable to its missiles. In \n     exchange, the U.S. should be willing to give Europeans a \n     greater say in decisions about the Middle East, including \n     policies towards Iran. As with NATO expansion such steps are \n     unlikely to be taken without U.S. leadership.\n       Although the administration may want to avoid publicly \n     voicing these strategic reasons for NATO expansion in order \n     to avoid offending Russia and some of our European allies, it \n     is important that we recognize that NATO expansion is \n     necessary to protect vital U.S. interests, increase \n     cooperation among European and North American democracies and \n     sustain America's global leadership. Given the stakes \n     involved, congressional support should be overwhelming.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would, \nhowever, like to take this opportunity to urge Mr. Fleming, in his new \ncapacity as Assistant Secretary of Education for Legislation and \nCongressional Affairs, to cooperate fully with the GAO investigation in \norder to resolve this matter expeditiously.\n  Mr. President, let me explain my involvement with this issue and my \nconcerns as they relate to allegations of an unusually close, and \nperhaps improper, relationship between the Department of Education and \ncertain lobbyists in this town.\n  This matter was first brought to my attention by an editorial that \nappeared in the Washington Post on September 4, 1997.\n  That editorial, written by nationally syndicated columnist Robert \nNovak, described how--each week while Congress was in session--senior \nDepartment of Education officials and special interest group \nrepresentatives gathered in Secretary Riley's conference room for what, \nin my opinion, amounted to `political action' or `legislative planning' \nsessions.\n  News of these meetings surfaced in a report published by the Alexis \nde Tocqueville Institution's, Paul Steidler. For seven months, Mr. \nSteidler attended these meetings and kept detailed minutes of what was \ndiscussed. What emerges from the Steidler notes, if substantiated, is \nextremely troubling.\n  Without discussing the particulars of this investigation, Mr. \nPresident, let me note that I take Mr. Steidler's allegations very \nseriously. Collusion between special interest lobbyists and the \nexecutive branch for the express purpose of defeating or promoting \nspecific legislation, at the grass roots level or here in Congress, is \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. President, the GAO investigation into these matters is still \nunderway. And, as I said, it does not appear that Mr. Fleming was a \ncentral figure in the formation or conduct of the weekly meetings in \nquestion.\n  My concern is that the Department of Education cooperate fully with \nthis investigation so this body and the American people can be certain \nthat the Department of Education's interests correspond with our \nchildren's best interests and not just the needs of those special \ninterests that dominate the landscape here in Washington.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Novak editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 4, 1997]\n\n                          Triumph of The Blob\n\n                          (By Robert D. Novak)\n\n       At 4 p.m. today, some 45 education lobbyists--``back to \n     school'' after the August congressional break--will resume \n     weekly sessions with Department of Education officials in the \n     secretary of education's conference room. There is doubt \n     whether these meetings are legal but no question that they \n     have been effective and, until now, a rare Washington secret.\n       They began in 1995, when what former education secretary \n     William J. Bennett calls The Blob--the special-interest \n     groups that want to maintain the educational status quo--\n     feared the worst from a newly Republican Congress. With more \n     than a hundred bills for abolition of the Department of \n     Education introduced, the Thursday meetings began without the \n     formal notification required by law for ``advisory \n     committees''. After 2\\1/2\\ years of this collaboration the \n     tide has turned on education, with the Republicans in full \n     retreat.\n       ``It's pretty much an open meeting,'' Acting Deputy \n     Education Secretary Marshall (Mike) Smith, who usually \n     presides, told me. He added that I would be welcome, which he \n     conceded would make me the first journalist there. In fact, \n     the sessions have been attended almost exclusively by The \n     Blob, providing intelligence for the government bureaucrats \n     who in turn disclose Clinton administration strategy. ``We \n     rely on you, partly, as your eyes and ears,'' Smith told \n     participants July 24.\n       But an interloper appeared at this year's meetings. Paul \n     Steidler, senior fellow of the conservative Education Reform \n     Project, heard about them and asked to attend. He got \n     permission after interrogation by reluctant education \n     officials. Steidler's subsequent weekly minutes offer a \n     wondrous insight into how Bill Clinton's Washington works.\n       ``There was boisterous conversation, and one could sense \n     the camaraderie in the air,''\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\n     Steidler said of the atmosphere preceding his first meeting. \n     The regulars represent such pro-Clinton groups as the \n     National School Boards Association, the American Association \n     of School Administrators and the American Federation of \n     Teachers. First among equals is the National Education \n     Association (NEA), the powerful teachers' union. Joel Packer, \n     the NEA's expert lobbyist, sits next to and is deferred to by \n     the Education Department's senior official present.\n       When an Education Department official described Republican \n     Sen. Paul Coverdell's proposal for $50 million in grants to \n     fund school-choice pilot programs somebody exclaimed. ``Yeah, \n     the fear voucher.'' Another voice joined in: ``You get it if \n     you are scared.'' Steidler noted: ``There was loud and \n     sustained laughter. I found this to be quite chilling.''\n       Through seven months of these minutes, the administration \n     and The Blob marched in lock step to maximize federal funding \n     and suppress school choice, with scarcely a critical word for \n     the Clinton administration and no kind word for Republicans.\n       When it was mentioned that former education secretary Lamar \n     Alexander would testify to Congress, ``moans and snickers'' \n     were followed by the NEA's Packer saying, ``It's called Mr. \n     Voucher time''. Commenting on a C-SPAN broadcast of \n     Republican congressmen discussing education, then-Education \n     Department lobbyist Kay Casstevens said: ``If you didn't see \n     it, you're probably better off.''\n       Ad budget negotiations neared their climax, Smith asked \n     everybody to make sure they could be reached if they left \n     town. The joint Education Department-NEA clout soon was \n     demonstrated.\n       At the June 16 meeting, the NEA's Adele Robinson alerted \n     the department to House committee approval of Democratic Rep. \n     Benjamin Cardin's proposed $150 tax credit for after-school \n     private tutoring. Smith declared: ``It drives a stake through \n     [the president's] America Reads [program]. It's close to a \n     voucher, folks.'' Cardin's proposal was eliminated, thanks to \n     administration pressure.\n       So was a Coverdell amendment to the tax bill permitting \n     parents to use their own tax-free savings for kindergarten \n     through 12th-grade private schools. ``On behalf of the NEA,'' \n     Packer said at the July 31 meeting, ``I want to profusely \n     thank the administration for its stand on Coverdell.''\n       Is the administration's failure to list these meetings in \n     the Federal Register a violation of the Federal Advisory \n     Committee Act (FACA)? ``The meetings are not covered by \n     FACA'' acting Education Department General Counsel Jiumenne \n     Studley told me, because they have no fixed membership or \n     specific purpose. ``Anyone who wants can join in,'' she said. \n     But her assertions are refuted by Paul Steidler's minutes, as \n     Mike Smith may hear when he comes up for Senate confirmation.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Garr ``Mike'' King\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, we have confirmed the nomination \nof an outstanding judicial nominee to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Oregon. Garr ``Mike'' King is a consummate professional, \nwho is universally respected within the Oregon legal community for his \nintegrity and professionalism. His long and distinguished legal career \nas a trial lawyer began as a Deputy District Attorney with the \nMultnomah County Oregon District Attorney's Office. He helped draft the \nOregon Rules for Civil Procedure and wrote the arbitration rules used \nin Multnomah County. Since 1971, as a partner with the Portland firm of \nKennedy, King & Zimmer, he has handled a variety of cases, including \ncommercial litigation, professional malpractice, products liability, \nand employment litigation in an exemplary fashion. In addition, Mr. \nKing has been active in the U.S. District Court mediation program, has \nserved as an arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association \nand, in 1995, was elected to the Board of Regents for the American \nCollege of Trial Lawyers.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that Garr ``Mike'' King will bring to \nthe U.S. District Court for the district of Oregon the same dedication, \nprofessionalism, and integrity that has exemplified his entire legal \ncareer.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today we confirmed an outstanding lawyer, a \nknowledgeable and diligent servant of justice and great judicial \nnominee from my State of Oregon. It was a great honor to present to the \nSenate the name of Mr. Garr ``Mike'' King to be a United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of Oregon.\n  Mr. King comes before the Senate today with the bipartisan support of \nthe Oregon Congressional delegation, and with broad support from both \nOregon's law enforcement community and our state's legal community. Mr. \nKing has served as a member of the Oregon State Bar Association since \n1963 and has distinguished himself as one of the finest attorneys in \nthe state. During this period of time, Mr. King has developed a \nsterling reputation for integrity, hard work, intelligence, and \ndiligence.\n  In addition to his outstanding career as an attorney in private \npractice, Mr. King also has served as Multnomah County Deputy District \nAttorney and was elected to the Board of Regents of the American \nCollege of Trial Lawyers. He helped draft the Oregon Rules for Civil \nProcedure, authored the arbitration rules for Multnomah County and \nserved as an arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association. \nHe has been active in the U.S. District Court Mediation program since \nit was initiated and has worked quite closely with the Court to improve \nthe federal mediation system.\n  Mr. King is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps who served \nhis country with honor from 1954 to 1957. He has lived in Oregon for \nthe past 35 years and is a proud father of seven children who is deeply \ninvolved in his church and community affairs. As those of my colleagues \nwho were at Mike's confirmation hearing can attest, I think he single-\nhandedly managed to fill about half of the hearing room with family \nmembers from all over the country, and I believe that speaks volumes \nabout the kind of caring, concerned and committed family man Mike King \nis.\n  As with previous recommendations that I have made for the federal \nbench, the recommendation of Mr. King was preceded by an extensive \nbipartisan screening effort undertaken by a committee of leading Oregon \nattorneys. The selection committee was appointed with input from all \nthe members of the Oregon Congressional delegation and the Governor's \noffice. All applicants reviewed by the committee were evaluated on \nthree criteria: judicial temperament, fitness to serve on the federal \nbench, and legal qualifications. Mr. King was rated very highly by the \ncommittee, and after personally interviewing him, I found him very well \nqualified for this position.\n  I want to again thank the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch for moving us to this point in the process. I am very \ngrateful for both the amount of time and good counsel you continue to \ngive me in the consideration of my region's needs on the federal bench.\n  I also thank my colleague, Senator Smith, for his efforts on behalf \nof this nominee. Senator Smith and I have now worked together in \nsupport of two other fine candidates to the federal bench, both of whom \nhave been confirmed by the Senate.\n  I am certain that Mike King will bring to the federal bench the same \nintelligence, legal skill and integrity that he has brought to his work \nas one of our state's most respected attorneys.\n\n\n                   The nomination of gregory m. sleet\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Judge Gregory Sleet, who \nwas confirmed by the Senate earlier today as a District Judge for \nDelaware. Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity to personally \ngreet him or his family when they came to the Capitol for his hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee just over a month ago. But today, it is \nmy pleasure to congratulate Judge Sleet, his wife Mary and their two \nchildren on this achievement.\n  Since 1994, Greg Sleet has served Delaware as our U.S. Attorney. From \nthat post, he was appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to serve as \nthe Vice-Chair of her Advisory Committee.\n  While his record of public service is impressive, so, too, is his \nprevious work in the private sector. You see, Judge Sleet served \nHercules Incorporated, an outstanding Delaware company, as legal \ncounsel before becoming our U.S. Attorney. Having worked in the same \ncapacity with Hercules some years earlier, I know first-hand that they \nhire only the sharpest young lawyers to handle their legal affairs.\n  Mr. President, the Senate needed not even four months to complete our \nwork on Judge Sleet's nomination. I thank Judiciary Committee Chairman \nHatch  for his efforts to review the nomination in such an expeditious \nmanner. Such prompt action speaks to the quality of the nominee, and I \nam happy to again congratulate Judge Sleet on the occasion of his \nconfirmation by the Senate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the confirmation of the \nnomination of Greg Sleet to be the 22d Federal district court judge in \nDelaware.\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\n  One of the most important duties of any U.S. Senator is the duty of \nadvice and consent to the President's judicial appointments. I have \nworked hard throughout my career to ensure that the Senate provides the \nFederal courts with a steady supply of judges to enforce our Federal \nlaws.\n  But, after serving on the Judiciary Committee for the last 20 years, \nand after serving as U.S. Senator from Delaware for the last 25 years, \nthis is my first opportunity to recommend a Federal district court \njudge for Delaware.\n  I took this responsibility very seriously. And I have no doubt that \nGreg Sleet is the most qualified and experienced person for this \nposition.\n  This is the second time President Clinton has put Greg's name through \nthe rigors of Senate confirmation. But this is no surprise--he enjoys a \nreputation for impeccable integrity in the Delaware legal community.\n  In 1993, when I recommended Greg as U.S. attorney for Delaware, \nPresident Clinton was wise to follow my advice--he could not have \nnominated a more qualified, well-rounded, experienced Delawarean.\n  Greg was confirmed unanimously and flawlessly, and for the past 4 \nyears has exceeded even my highest expectations.\n  And it is not only his distinguished service for Delaware, but also \nthe breadth of Greg's experience that has impressed Delawareans, and \nconvinced me that he will make a distinguished Federal judge.\n  Greg is a graduate of Rutgers University School of Law and completed \nhis undergraduate work at Hampton University in Virginia.\n  He began his legal career in 1976 by serving for 7 years as a \nPhiladelphia public defender--arguing before juries and representing \nindigent defendants at all stages of the criminal process--from pre-\ntrial through the appellate courts.\n  He than gained experience in civil litigation, civil rights, estates, \nand criminal defense as an associate in private firms--most recently as \na sole practitioner for his own firm. I know how tough--and rewarding--\nrunning your own firm can be.\n  In 1990, Greg began his service as deputy attorney general for the \nState of Delaware, where he gained experience prosecuting a variety of \ncriminal cases at the State level.\n  He has practiced corporate and commercial law as well--working as an \nattorney in the legal department for Hercules Inc., where he helped \nmanage corporate operations and litigation, and provided advice on \nacquisitions and antitrust matters.\n  Since Greg became U.S. attorney, he has demonstrated strong \nleadership as my State's chief Federal law enforcement officer--\n  He has developed a solid reputation by prosecuting many significant \ncriminal cases, including numerous Federal drug and gun cases.\n  He has prosecuted hate crimes and fraud cases more aggressively than \never before.\n  And, in addition to his accomplishments in the criminal court at the \nFederal level, he has made it a priority to strengthen the civil \ndivision in Delaware's U.S. attorney's office.\n  Mr. President, I will not take up any more time--other than to repeat \nmy ``bottom line'' from Greg's Judiciary Committee hearing:\n  Greg Sleet's record speaks for itself--the Federal bench needs judges \nlike him. His background makes him exceptionally qualified to service \non the Federal bench, and his record shows that he is tough--as we need \nour Federal judges to be--with the practical abilities and experience \nto do the job.\n  I am deeply proud to be associated with Greg's service as Delaware's \nU.S. attorney, and look forward to his service as a U.S. district court \njudge.\n  I commend my colleagues for taking the time to review Greg's record \nand thank them for their support for the candidacy of this fine \nnominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3646-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, on Friday, a new audit report was \nreleased by the Health Care Financing Administration. It is the Chief \nFinancial Officer's report. It shows that a staggering $20 billion of \ntax dollars were improperly paid through Medicare last year. That is 20 \nbillion reasons to defend the False Claims Act and oppose the bill \npercolating in the House that's being pushed by the American Hospital \nAssociation, and sponsored by Congressman Bill McCollum--H.R. 3523.\n  The audit is only the latest reminder of why the False Claims Act is \nthe law of the land. Whether it is the derivation of the law signed by \nAbraham Lincoln in 1863, or the amendments that I sponsored, which \npassed in 1986, the reason the law exists is to protect the public's \nvital interests.\n  In the case of health care, those vital interests are clear. The \nFalse Claims Act helps maintain the integrity of Medicare so that \nsenior citizens won't have to fear the possibility that the program \nwon't be there for them in the future. It helps maintain the standards \nwe want for our seniors with respect to the quality of health care. The \nFalse Claims Act is beginning to be used successfully by U.S. Attorneys \nto improve the quality of care in the health care industry, such as \nnursing home care.\n  Finally, the False Claims Act is the final yet most effective line of \ndefense to protect the taxpayers' hard-earned money. Since my \namendments in 1986, the Act has been used to return more than $4 \nbillion, fraudulantly taken, back to the taxpayers. Nearly $2 billion \nof that is from the health care industry. And somewhere between $150 \nand $300 billion-worth of potential fraud has been deterred.\n  There is a critical and obvious need for the False Claims Act to \nsafeguard the public interest. The Act is also highly successful. It \nhas built up a track record for accomplishing exactly what it was \ndesigned to do--to promote integrity in taxpayer-funded programs.\n  Suddenly, integrity in such programs is under a fierce attack. The \nattack is the McCollum bill, which would gut the False Claims Act. \nWhat's wrong with this picture?\n  The McCollum bill is a misguided missile in the war against fraud. If \nit passes, perpetrators of fraud will be celebrating in the streets. It \nis ill-founded, and would send the wrong message both to the public and \nto those who would commit fraud.\n  The bill is the product of the American Hospital Association. The AHA \ncame to me earlier this year and reported what they claim are examples \nof the Justice Department going after hospitals with heavy-handed \ntactics, and using the False Claims Act to prosecute innocent mistakes. \nI also visited with the Iowa Hospital Association, from my home State.\n  After listening to their concerns, it seemed to me that the examples \nthe AHA provided spoke more to problems in the implementation of the \nlaw, rather than to problems with the law itself. I agreed to approach \nthe Justice Department and help begin a dialogue between DOJ, the AHA, \nand myself and other members of Congress. The goal was to examine the \nevidence and see where the problems were occurring and why. And then to \nfix any real problems.\n  After much examination and discussion, I and others determined that \nthe AHA had some legitimate concerns involving the way some U.S. \nAttorneys were communicating with some hospitals around the country.\n  To its credit, the Justice Department has reevaluated its process and \nmade changes. It has changed its approach, and has taken steps to \nensure higher standards prior to any investigation for fraud. It is not \noften that the Justice Department willingly reexamines its process, \nadmits changes are needed, and then makes them. Because it did so in \nthis case, I believe that the Justice Department should be commended \nfor its responsiveness.\n  As a case in point, let me refer to a letter I received this month \nfrom the president of a medical center in Iowa. Next year, he will be \nin the leadership of the Iowa Hospital Association. He is one of those \nwho had expressed concerns to me months ago about how the Justice \nDepartment was implementing\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\nthe False Claims Act. After the dialogue, and after DOJ changed its \nprocess, this official wrote to me and said he was satisfied that the \nlaw doesn't need to be changed. This official further says that after \nmeeting with the local U.S. Attorney, he is confident in DOJ's \nintentions to not use the False Claims Act to go after honest mistakes.\n  In this case, the dialogue seems to have worked. Reason prevailed. \nWhere reason has not prevailed is with those supporters of the McCollum \nbill who believe that the False Claims Act should be gutted anyway. \nThere is a logical disconnect between the problems identified by the \nhospital industry, and the solution they now advocate.\n  Pure and simple, the False Claim Act is a tool against fraud. It is \nnot to be used, and is not used, against innocent mistakes. There is \nclearly an agenda behind this bill. It is to remove the taxpayers' most \neffective weapon in its arsenal against fraud. And it is being pushed \nby some in an industry that has been clearly ravaged by those who have \ncommitted fraud.\n  There is no question that the vast majority of hospitals and hospital \nemployees in this country are honest, civic-minded, and true public \nservants. Many are absolute heroes. Those in industry who get caught \ncommitting fraud threaten to give the industry a tarnished reputation.\n  If that is so, can't we also say that those who are pushing to gut \nthe law also threaten to give the industry a tarnished reputation? \nAfter all, given the changes made by DOJ, there is no empirical basis \nfor this bill. Just as changes were demanded of the Justice Department \nto refrain from taking action without a legal or factual predicate, \nshouldn't there be a legal and factual predicate for advancing this \nbill. There is none.\n  The McCollum bill is not designed to stop the prosecution of innocent \nmistakes. Rather, it would make fraud easier to accomplish more often. \nAnd, it would establish new ``look-the-other-way'' loopholes, including \nfor on-going cases such as Columbia/HCA. And remember, this bill would \ndo all that at a time when there's $20 billion of potential fraud out \nthere, fraud in the medical industry has been rampant, and the public \nhas had it up to their keesters.\n  Is this what the supporters of the McCollum bill really think the \npublic wants and needs? Do you really thing the public wants a white \nflag of surrender in the war against fraud?\n  Specifically, the McCollum bill would do the following:\n  First, it would create a ``fraud-free zone.'' No false claims case \ncould be brought unless the taxpayers' damages are a ``material \namount.'' That ``material amount'' is unclear but it could be as much \nas ten percent. In other words, we will write off the first 10 percent \nof fraud. In effect, it legalizes or legitimizes up to ten percent of \nwhat is now illegal. For a company like Columbia/HCA, for example, \nwhich pulled in more than $6 billion from the taxpayers last year, the \nfirst $600 million would be okay. For the entire Medicare program, \nwhich was $210 billion last year, we could write off the first $21 \nbillion. That is a $21 billion loophole. A real whopper.\n  Second, let us say a false claims case involved a ``material \namount.'' there are still three more ways a company could get off the \nbook anyway. The McCollum bill would open up three more whoppers to \nraise that $21 billion--``free fraud zone'' to substantially more. \nCompanies would be able to better insulate themselves from liability \nsimply by, among other things, showing a commitment to setting up \nbetter procedures in the future despite defrauding Medicare today.\n  Finally, the bill would make it much harder to provide that claims \nwere wrongfully submitted. The normal standard for civil statutes is \n``a preponderance of the evidence.'' The McCollum bill would raise it \nto ``clear and convincing evidence.'' That is basically a criminal \nstandard, not a civil one. Once again, reason has not prevailed in the \nformulation of this bill.\n  The McCollum bill would establish a fortress around the medical \nindustry. It would prevent legitimate efforts on behalf of the \ntaxpayers to punish those bad apples that undermine the integrity of \nhealth care programs and raid the treasury. The solution is not to gut \nthe law. The solution was and is to take the steps DOJ has already \ntaken, and to ensure DOJ stays on that rack in the future. We have \naddressed the process dealing with innocent mistakes.\n  At the same time, we need the toughest possible law to go after \nmistakes that aren't innocent. Those who continue down the road of \nsupporting this bill pose a clear and present danger to the public's \nvital interests--to the highest quality of health care for our senior \ncitizens, and to the integrity of how our tax dollars are spent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the State Department \nauthorization conference report debated on Friday and to be voted on \ntomorrow. Unfortunately, I was unable to participate in the debate on \nFriday, and I appreciate the chance to take the time now to express my \nviews on this legislation.\n  I would like to express my extreme regret and disappointment that the \ndebate over the important issues of the long-overdue payment of our \narrears to the United Nations and the reorganization of the U.S. \nDepartment of State has once again become a sideshow to an exercise by \nsome Members of Congress regarding the issue of reproductive choice. I \nfind it astounding that these members insist on holding our \ninternational commitments hostage to a desire to score political points \non a domestic issue.\n  We should be on the floor talking about the important foreign policy \npriorities that were articulated during the Senate debate on S. 903. \nInstead, we are spending the majority of our debate time on this \nmeasure talking about one narrow issue that shouldn't even be in here \nin the first place!\n  As we all know, a minority of our colleagues in the other body \nsuccessfully inserted language in this conference report that would \nimpose severe restrictions on U.S. assistance to foreign non-\ngovernmental organizations engaged in family planning activities. These \nrestrictions were inserted without consultation with the Democratic \nconferees. They were not consulted because they surely would have \nobjected to these provisions. The restrictions fall into two basic \ncategories.\n  First, the conference report would mandate that no U.S. population \nassistance may be given to any foreign non-governmental organization \nunless that organization certifies that it will not use its own funds \nto perform abortions during the period in which it receives U.S. funds. \nIf the President chooses to waive this restriction, which I am sure \nPresident Clinton would do, funding for family planning-related \nactivities would then be capped at $356 million.\n  The second category of restriction would prohibit funding for \norganizations that lobby to change abortion laws in their own \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, the authors of these restrictions see this version, \nthat is, the provisions as written in this conference report, as a \ncompromise of earlier iterations of restrictions on family planning. \nBut--let us be very clear here--not only is this not a compromise, but \nthe language is actually more restrictive than what we have seen \nbefore.\n  First of all, unlike the so-called ``Mexico City'' language, which \nhas been considered each year as a rider to appropriations bills, the \nrestrictions in this conference report would become permanent statutory \nchanges. That is a rather disturbing concept.\n  Second, the waiver provision included for the President would result \nin a greater decrease in funding for family planning than we have seen \nin earlier versions. Many observers believe that the $356 million cap \namounts to a decrease of $29 million, a cut that would come solely out \nof USAID's family planning account. But, the language in this \nconference report would also apply to ``all funds for programs\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\nand activities designed to control fertility or to reduce or delay \nchildbirths or pregnancies, irrespective of the heading under which \nsuch funds are made available.'' What this means is that the cap would \nalso apply to certain birth-spacing related programs that currently \nfall under other USAID accounts, and in fact, would represent a larger \ntotal decrease than is immediately evident--about $44 million. That \nrepresents an 11 percent decrease in funding for these programs, which, \nMr. President, I think we all would agree is rather substantial.\n  Third, the definition of ``lobbying'' that is used in the second \nrestriction is disturbingly broad in that it would ban all sorts of \npublic statements or the participation of individuals at public \nmeetings. It is so bad that many of us call it ``the global gag rule.''\n  Finally, the President would have no waiver authority over this gag \nrule provision.\n  Let me turn for a moment to the substance of these provisions.\n  While proponents of the Mexico City language say they do not want \nU.S. dollars to pay for abortions overseas, the adoption of the \nrestrictions in this conference report would actually increase the \nnumber of unintended pregnancies worldwide, and, correspondingly, the \nnumber of abortions and deaths of mothers and children due to high-risk \npregnancies.\n  The funding at issue here has nothing to do with performing abortions \nand everything to do with preventing them. It is about family planning, \nand about a woman's right to know about all options that are legally \navailable to her. It is about helping non-governmental organizations \neducate women around the world about family planning and other health \ncare issues.\n  I firmly oppose all of these restrictions and will oppose this \nconference report because of them for several reasons, which I will \ndiscuss in turn.\n  First, U.S. assistance for family planning initiatives abroad is a \nsound investment that pays dividends including healthy women and \nchildren. According to the Johns Hopkins Population Information \nProgram, approximately 120 million women in developing countries who \nneed family planning services do not have access to them. Family \nplanning services educate women about contraception, pre-natal care, \nbirth spacing, the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, and \nother important, life-saving issues. These programs have proven to be \nenormously effective--not only in improving the health of hundreds of \nthousands of women and children, but also in reducing the pressures \nthat rapid population growth places on food and water, housing and \neducation, and the environment in developing countries.\n  Second, this language reinstates--and expands--the Mexico City policy \nthat prevents U.S. population assistance from being disbursed to non-\ngovernmental organizations that use other funds to engage in abortion-\nrelated activities. This restriction does not prevent abortions, Mr. \nPresident, it increases their likelihood by cutting off funds to \nreputable family planning organizations which happen also to use their \nown money for abortion-related activities.\n  Finally, this language contains a troubling restriction on the \nfreedom of speech of those working for family planning programs which \nreceive U.S. funding. By linking funding for much-needed family \nplanning assistance to the stifling of freedom of speech, the language \nruns counter to the very principles upon which our own nation was \nfounded. We cherish our right to freedom of speech in this country, and \nthe promotion of democracy and respect for basic freedoms around the \nglobe represent an important aspect of our foreign policy.\n  The language in this conference report is an assault on free speech, \none of the most fundamental human rights. In this country, citizens are \nencouraged to speak their minds and participate in the political \nprocess. In fact, the First Amendment states that ``Congress shall make \nno law * * * abridging the freedom of speech * * * or the right of the \npeople * * * to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.''\n  If the language in this conference report were adopted, it would mean \nU.S. citizens who have this constitutionally-guaranteed right would be \nforcing people in other countries to give up similar rights if they \nwish to keep receiving U.S. funding for family planning programs. The \nonly way I can interpret this, Mr. President, is as an attempt by some \nMembers of Congress to control the free speech of people in foreign \ncountries relating to one particular issue about which they may not \nagree: abortion.\n  In essence, this language tells foreign non-governmental \norganizations which seek family planning assistance that they will get \nit if, and only if, they comply with a restrictive set of rules for how \nthey may use their own money. It is a thinly veiled threat to pull \nmuch-needed funding if the word ``abortion'' is uttered to any woman \nseeking counseling at any foreign family planning agency that receives \nU.S. funds. This language violates the spirit of the Constitution which \nwe have all sworn to uphold.\n  I would like to talk about two family planning programs that would be \njeopardized if this conference report were to become law.\n  The humanitarian organization CARE is working with a local non-\ngovernmental organization that promotes dialogue within local \ncommunities and at a national level regarding important issues facing \nBolivian women, such as violence against women, sexual harassment and \nlack of appropriate medical services. One of the most critical issues \nfor discussion is the alarmingly high rate of maternal mortality in \nBolivia--the highest in Latin America. According to the World Health \nOrganization, a women in Bolivia has a 1 in 27 chance of dying from a \npregnancy-related cause. This compares to women in the U.S., who have a \n1 in 3,500 chance of dying from such circumstances. CARE's Bolivian \npartner works to educate women and men about the importance of family \nplanning and the dangers of illegal abortion and how it contributes to \nBolivia's appalling rate of maternal mortality.\n  Under the language in the conference report, U.S. funding for this \nBolivian organization would be at risk because the organization makes \n``public statements'' about women's health issues that may be construed \nas lobbying for abortion rights. This is a capable, effective \norganization that is addressing real needs within Bolivia.\n  My second example relates to South Africa. As Ranking Member on the \nAfrican Affairs Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to learn much \nabout the success of family planning programs in Africa and, indeed, of \nU.S. assistance to such programs in Africa.\n  We all watched with awe and amazement as South Africans of all races \nparticipated in the first multiparty elections in that country in 1994. \nWe were further inspired by the country's adoption of its first \npermanent, post-apartheid constitution which was signed into law on \nDecember 10, 1996, by President Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest \nheros of our time. The Government of South Africa continues to consider \nvarious proposed amendments to the constitution on outstanding issues, \nand is also working on the implementation of many of its provisions. \nNot surprisingly, the Government is consulting widely with a variety of \ngroups and interested parties from around the country.\n  Why, you may ask, am I talking about the South African constitution \nand South African legislation during a debate over family planning \nassistance?\n  Because, the language of this conference report would actually put \nlimitations on the ability of South Africans to participate in the \ndemocratic process in their country.\n  The Government has asked Dr. Helen Rees, president of the Planned \nParenthood Association of South Africa, to become an advisor to the \nNational Department of Health and a member of the country's Medical \nAdvisory Board to assist the Government in its implementation of a law \nenacted in 1996 concerning access to safe abortion during the first \ntwelve weeks of pregnancy. Prior to this law's enactment, Dr. Rees had \nalso helped in its drafting.\n  Had this conference report been law at the time of Dr. Rees' \nparticipation in the drafting of that law, the Planned Parenthood \nAssociation of South Africa would have lost its U.S. family planning \nassistance, even though her activities related to the drafting process \nwere conducted without U.S. funds.\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\n  In other words, the Association might have been forced to suffer \nsimply because the South African government chose to invest in Dr. \nRees' expertise. Dr. Rees would have been forced to choose between \nallowing her organization to receive much-needed U.S. assistance or to \nbecome an active participant in the political process of her country. \nThis is a totally unfair choice, and one that we, members of the U.S. \nCongress, should not be forcing foreign citizens to make. In fact, it \ncontradicts what the Congress worked so actively for over the last \nseveral decades, and that is the freedom of all South Africans to be \nable to participate in their own political process.\n  I want to make my last point very clear, Mr. President. The language \ncontained in this conference report would be unconstitutional if this \nwere a piece of domestic legislation because it violates the First \nAmendment.\n  I repeat, this language would be unconstitutional if this were \ndomestic legislation.\n  Mr. President, the United States has a long history of promoting \ndemocracy and basic freedoms around the world. This global gag rule \nruns counter to that tradition. If adopted, this language would not \nencourage free speech--it would squelch it.\n  None of these restrictions belong in this legislation in the first \nplace, but now that they are there, I encourage all of my colleague, \nwho all profess to support free speech and our constitutionally-\nguaranteed liberties, to defeat this conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a February 27, 1998, \neditorial from the Washington Post, which makes some excellent \narguments as to why this report should be defeated, be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 27, 1998]\n\n                     Exporting the Abortion Debate\n\n       It is scandalous that an unrelated domestic dispute over \n     abortion is holding up congressional approval of funds for \n     international purposes of vital American interest. One such \n     purpose is to enable the International Monetary Fund to help \n     troubled Asian economies, among other things, buy more \n     American goods. A second is to pay up American arrears to the \n     United Nations, an organization in the center of American \n     efforts to banish proscribed weapons from Iraq.\n       The trouble arises from an amendment offered by Rep. \n     Christopher Smith (R-N.J.) and supported by the House \n     Republican leadership. Current law already bars any U.S. \n     funding for foreign abortion-related services, lobbying or \n     research. Mr. Smith would go on to revive the Reagan-Bush \n     ``Mexico City Policy.'' It denies American aid to any foreign \n     nongovernmental organization that performs abortions or \n     lobbies for abortion even with its own money.\n       In the domestic debate we support the side favoring choice. \n     But of course both sides are principled in their fashion, and \n     both stir important constituencies. You could call it a \n     difficult but unavoidable fight among Americans.\n       But why must this fight be exported onto foreign terrain? \n     The limitations that the Mexico City Policy imposes upon the \n     work of foreign nongovernmental organizations intrude \n     directly upon the options available to poor countries to \n     manage their own future. The anti-lobbying provision intrudes \n     especially egregiously not only into the medical standards \n     but also into the political practices of aid recipients. As \n     Secretary of State Albright put it, that provision punishes \n     nongovernmental organizations ``for engaging in the \n     democratic process in foreign countries and for engaging in \n     legal activities that would be protected by the First \n     Amendment if carried out in the United States.''\n       The current House Republican position is to demand that the \n     administration negotiate a compromise banning lobbying but \n     allowing limited family-planning aid. The Clinton \n     administration is right to want no part of a compromise that \n     narrows the personal choices open to women abroad, interferes \n     in the development policies of other countries and invades \n     the public space they maintain for policy debate. House \n     Republicans have attached the abortion measure to essential \n     foreign-policy legislation, including United Nations reform \n     and State Department reorganization. Their amendment \n     constitutes a rank intervention into other countries' \n     domestic business, and deserves defeat.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senate \nadoption of the Conference Report on the State Department Authorization \nBill, which we will be voting on tomorrow.\n  I do so with disappointment, and concern. As an advocate of many of \nthe good provisions in this bill, it is ironic to be arguing today \nagainst adoption of this Conference Report.\n  With its provisions to reorganize America's foreign policy \ninstitutions and to press for reform at the United Nations while paying \noff our arrears, I think it is fair to say that the State Department \nAuthorization bill is one of the most far-reaching and important bills \nthat we will consider this Congress.\n  I am disappointed, therefore, that Congress finds itself seemingly \nunable to pass this bill in a form which will allow it to become law.\n  Now, we find ourselves in this position today is because a few hard-\nline House Republicans, by insisting on the inclusion of language to \nrestrict international family planning assistance, have been unwilling \nto compromise and be flexible in the interests of American foreign \npolicy and national security.\n  Let me briefly state 3 reasons why I think that without the family \nplanning restrictions this is a good bill.\n  First, this bill authorizes funding of both existing needs and the \ncorrection of long-time existing problems, such as a failing computer \nsystem, the construction of two major long overdue embassies, and the \nremediation of security and maintenance problems around the world. \nInternational law enforcement, narcotics abatement, and refugee \nprograms are all increased under this bill.\n  Second, the State Department Authorization Bill takes an historic \nstep in working with the administration and Secretary Albright to \nreorganize the foreign policy bureaucracy of the United States, so that \nthe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the United States Information \nAgency, and the Agency for International Development are brought within \nthe State Department and other operations are streamlined.\n  The reorganization plan presented by this bill preserves the unique \nskills and capabilities of each of the current foreign affairs agencies \nwhile creating a new, streamlined, structure capable of meeting the \nchallenges of the twenty-first century. It is a plan supported by the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations Committee and by \nthe President and Secretary of State.\n  Finally, this bill also contains a package to allow repayment of our \narrears to the United Nations, some $926 million, with much-needed \nreform benchmarks designed to ensure that the United Nations will \nremain an effective organization in the decades to come.\n  I am an unabashed supporter of the United Nations. I believe a strong \nand effective United Nations is both important to the world and to the \nnational interest of the United States.\n  With little fanfare or recognition the United Nations serves American \ninterests each and every day. Through the UN High Commission for \nRefugees, it feeds and clothes homeless refugees in time of war. The \nWorld Health Organization fights diseases like AIDS. The United Nations \nChildren's Fund combats childhood poverty, hunger, and sickness. The UN \nDevelopment Programs helps the poorer nations of the world develop \ntheir infrastructures. The UN provides a forum for negotiating \nmultilateral agreements on arms control, protecting the environment, \nand other matters that affect all nations.\n  The United Nations helps to protect peace and security in dozens of \ntrouble spots around the world. Although we are often quick to \ncriticize UN operations, we are slow to credit those successful U.N. \npeacekeeping operations in such places as the Golan Heights, Macedonia, \nAngola, and Kuwait--all important to American foreign policy concerns.\n  This is not to say the United Nations is without its faults. The need \nto reform and streamline the UN bureaucracy, refocus the budget \nstructure, eliminate duplication, and add transparency to all its \noperations are all included in the 3 year time-period of this bill.\n  As the Ranking Member of the International Operations Subcommittee, I \nwas involved in the initial discussions on UN dues payment arrears. The \nfinal result negotiated by the Secretary of State, the Chairman, and \nthe Ranking Member is a tough, but achievable, series of reforms to be \nimplemented by the United Nations over the next three years, during \nwhich time the United States will pay the $926 million it owes in back \ndues.\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\n  Payment of these arrears is no trivial matter. The U.N.'s current \nfinancial difficulties are threatening to render it unable to implement \nmany of its most important programs. Prompt payment by the United \nStates of its arrears is the best way to ensure that the UN will be \nable to survive as a force for international peace and security in the \npost-Cold War era.\n  As someone who values the United Nations, I regard the United Nations \narrears and reform package included in this bill to be a major step \nforward, and one of which we can all be proud.\n  That is why I find it so unfortunate that we are faced today with the \nprospect that all of these achievements will be for nothing. And why? \nBecause a small group of abortion opponents in the House have tied up \nthis Bill over the issue of the so-called ``Mexico City'' family \nplanning language. In so doing, they are placing their own narrow \ndomestic concerns and political agenda ahead of all the substantial \nachievements and reforms encapsulated in this Bill.\n  In short, unable to advance their agenda through the normal channels \nof congressional policy making (an agenda unsupported by the vast \nmajority of the American people, I might add) they have decided to hold \nthis bill hostage to achieve a major blow to family planning throughout \nthe world.\n  Ironically, their opposition to family planning is antithetical to \ntheir goal of reducing abortions because family planning actually \nreduces the need for abortions, and without it terrible starvation and \ndeprivation is visited upon millions in other lands. The irony is that \nno U.S. international family planning funds are spent on abortion in \nthis or any other bill.\n  Since 1973, U.S. law has prohibited any USAID funds from being used \nto pay for abortions as a method of family planning or to coerce any \nperson to have an abortion. Today each and any program supported by \nthese dollars are voluntary, and none involve abortion. All programs \nare rigorously monitored to ensure strict compliance.\n  In Russia, where the average Russian woman used to have a stunning 7 \nor 8 abortions in her lifetime, family planning has made a huge \ndifference. An active family planning effort has actually reduced the \nnumber of abortions in Russia from 1990 to 1994 by over 20%, from 3.6 \nmillion to 2.8 million. That is 800,000 fewer abortions in a four years \nperiod of time due to family planning efforts.\n  The story repeats itself over and over, wherever family planning \nexists. As our esteemed former colleague Mark Hatfield, who was a \nproudly pro-life Senator, reminded us each time we debated this issue, \nfamily planning assistance prevents abortions.\n  I also find the prohibitions placed on free speech contained in the \nConference Report--in essence a global gag rule on responsible family \nplanning discussions--to be unacceptable. Foreign family planning \nproviders would only be eligible for U.S. dollars if they agree to have \ntheir voices silenced. They could neither lobby nor discuss or educate \nunder the terms of this Bill. The fact that the language included in \nthis Conference Report dictates what public statements can be made, \nwhat conferences can be attended, and what educational materials can be \nproduced with an entity's own funds I find an overreaching and \ndictatorial edict by a country that prizes free speech.\n  One of the most important and effective components of U.S. foreign \nassistance has for years been our family planning programs. These \nprograms reduce poverty, improve health, and raise living standards \naround the world by enhancing the ability of couples and individuals to \ndetermine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their \nchildren in some of the most overpopulated and depraved countries on \nearth. Most of us take these rights for granted. None of us knows the \nlevel of deprivation and suffering that exists outside our borders.\n  What we can not do now--what we should not do now--is allow a small \nminority of this and the other body to effectively stop any U.S. family \nplanning efforts worldwide.\n  The President has stated that if the Conference Report passes with \nthe family planning restrictions he will veto this bill. By including \nlanguage in this Conference Report which we know will result in a veto \nwe will sacrifice--needlessly and pointlessly--all the important work \naccomplished to date.\n  I sincerely hope and urge that there are sufficient votes in this \nbody to reject this Conference Report, return it to Conference, remove \nthe counterproductive language, and develop a report which the Senate \ncan support, and which the President can sign.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject adoption of this Conference Report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3649-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING LLOYD M.

Mr. Pelfrey, an ordained minister of the Christian Church \nsince 1953, will retire as President of the college on May 8, 1998.\n  President Pelfrey's service to Central Christian College started when \nthe school opened in September 1957. He has worn many hats during his \ntenure at the school, serving as: the President of the college, the \nActing President, the Executive President, the Dean of Faculty, the \nAcademic Dean, and a Professor of Old Testament. On April 6, 1973, Mr. \nPelfrey became the fourth President of Central Christian College.

This report is submitted \npursuant to section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. \n1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  1. On October 21, 1995, I signed Executive Order 12978, ``Blocking \nAssets and Prohibiting Transactions with Significant Narcotics \nTraffickers'' (the ``Order'') (60 Fed. Reg. 54579, October 24, 1995). \nThe Order blocks all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which \nthere is any interest of four significant foreign narcotics \ntraffickers, one of whom is now deceased, who were principals in the \nso-called Cali drug cartel centered in Colombia. These persons are \nlisted in the annex to the Order. The Order also blocks the property \nand interests in property of foreign persons determined by the \nSecretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General \nand the Secretary of State, (a) to play a significant role in \ninternational narcotics trafficking centered in Colombia or (b) to \nmaterially assist in or provide financial or technological support for, \nor goods or services in support of, the narcotics trafficking \nactivities of persons designated in or\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\npursuant to the Order. In addition the Order blocks all property and \ninterests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction of persons \ndetermined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of State, to be owned or controlled \nby, or to act for or on behalf of, persons designated in or pursuant to \nthe Order (collectively ``Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers'' \nor ``SDNTs'').\n  The Order further prohibits any transaction or dealing by a United \nStates person or within the United States in property or interests in \nproperty of SDNTs, and any transaction that evades or avoids, has the \npurpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, the \nprohibitions contained in the Order.\n\n  Designations of foreign persons blocked pursuant to the Order are \neffective upon the date of determination by the Director of the \nDepartment of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) \nacting under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. \nPublic notice of blocking is effective upon the date of filing with the \nFederal Register, or upon prior actual notice.\n  2. On October 24, 1995, the Department of the Treasury issued a \nnotice containing 76 additional names of persons determined to meet the \ncriteria set forth in Executive Order 12978 (60 Fed. Reg.  54582, \nOctober 24, 1995). Additional notices expanding and updating the list \nof SDNTs were published on November 29, 1995 (60 Fed. Reg. 61288), \nMarch 8, 1996 (61 Fed. Reg. 9523), and January 21, 1997 (62 Fed. Reg. \n2903).\n  Effective February 28, 1997, OFAC issued the Narcotics Trafficking \nSanctions Regulations (``NTSR'' or the ``Regulations''), 31 C.F.R. Part \n536, to further implement my declaration of a national emergency and \nimposition of sanctions against significant foreign narcotics \ntraffickers centered in Colombia (62 Fed. Reg. 9959, March 5, 1997).\n  On April 17, 1997 (62 Fed. Reg. 19500, April 22, 1997), July 30, 1997 \n(62 Fed. Reg.  41850, August 4, 1997), and September 9, 1997 (62 Fed. \nReg. 48177, September 15, 1997), OFAC amended appendices A and B to 31 \nC.F.R. chapter V, revising information concerning individuals and \nentities who have been determined to play a significant role in \ninternational narcotics trafficking centered in Colombia or have been \ndetermined to be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, \nor to be acting as fronts for the Cali cartel in Colombia. These \nactions are part of the ongoing interagency implementation of Executive \nOrder 12978 of October 21, 1995. These changes to the previous SDNT \nlist brought it to a total of 426 businesses and individuals with whom \nfinancial and business dealings are prohibited and whose assets are \nblocked under the Order.\n  3. OFAC has disseminated and routinely updated details of this \nprogram to the financial, securities, and international trade \ncommunities by both electronic and conventional media. In addition to \nbulletins to banking institutions via the Federal Reserve System and \nthe Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), individual \nnotices were provided to all relevant State and Federal regulatory \nagencies, automated clearing houses, and State and independent banking \nassociations across the country. OFAC contacted all major securities \nindustry associations and regulators. It posted electronic notices on \nthe Internet and over 10 computer bulletin boards and 2 fax-on-demand \nservices, and provided the same material to the U.S. Embassy in Bogota \nfor distribution to U.S. companies operating in Colombia.\n  4. As of March 25, 1998, OFAC had issued nine specific licenses \npursuant to Executive Order 12978. These licenses were issued in \naccordance with established Treasury policy authorizing the completion \nof presanctions transactions and the provision of legal services to and \npayment of fees for representation of SDNTs in proceedings within the \nUnited States arising from the imposition of sanctions.\n  5. The narcotics trafficking sanctions have had a significant impact \non the Cali drug cartel. Of the 133 business entities designated as \nSDNTs as of February 20, 1998, 41, or nearly a third, having a combined \nnet worth estimated at more than $45 million and combined income of \nmore than $200 million, had been determined to have gone into \nliquidation. As a result of OFAC designations, 3 Colombian banks have \nclosed about 300 SDNT accounts of nearly 100 designated individuals. \nOne of the largest SDNT commercial entities, a discount drugstore with \nan annual income exceeding $136 million, has been reduced to operating \non a cash basis. These specific results augment the less quantifiable \nbut significant impact of denying the designated individuals and \nentities of the cartel access to U.S. financial and commercial \nfacilities.\n\n  Various enforcement actions carried over from prior reporting periods \nare continuing and new reports of violations are being aggressively \npursued. Two criminal investigations are ongoing. Since my last report, \nOFAC has collected its first civil monetary penalty for violations of \nIEEPA and the Regulations under the program. OFAC collected $2,625 from \na commercial agent for ocean-going oil tankers for violative funds \ntransfers.\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from October 21, 1997, through April 20, 1998, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the national emergency with respect to Significant \nNarcotics Traffickers are estimated at approximately $620,000. \nPersonnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury \n(particularly in the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Customs \nService, and the Office of the General Counsel), the Department of \nJustice, and the Department of State. These data do not reflect certain \ncosts of operations by the intelligence and law enforcement \ncommunities.\n  7. Executive Order 12978 provides my Administration with a tool for \ncombatting the actions of significant foreign narcotics traffickers \ncentered in Colombia and the unparalleled violence, corruption, and \nharm that they cause in the United States and abroad. The Order is \ndesigned to deny these traffickers the benefit of any assets subject to \nthe jurisdiction of the United States and to prevent United States \npersons from engaging in any commercial dealings with them, their front \ncompanies, and their agents. Executive Order 12978 demonstrates the \nUnited States commitment to end the damage that such traffickers wreak \nupon society in the United States and abroad.\n  The magnitude and the dimension of the problem in Colombia--perhaps \nthe most pivotal country of all in terms of the world's cocaine trade--\nare extremely grave. I shall continue to exercise the powers at my \ndisposal to apply economic sanctions against significant foreign \nnarcotics traffickers and their violent and corrupting activities as \nlong as these measures are appropriate, and will continue to report \nperiodically to the Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 \nU.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the standard deduction amount to reduce the marriage penalty, \nsimplify the filing of individual tax returns, and provide tax relief \nfor lower and middle income individuals, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                   The Marriage Penalty Reduction Act\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is the time of the year when we are \ncertain to hear more ideas for tax reform. We're certain to hear many \ncolleagues discuss the unfairness of our current tax code. Although \ntaxes in this country remain lower than major competitors like the \nUnited Kingdom, Japan, and Germany, many families feel their tax burden \nhas been increasing.\n  One of the interesting reasons why some individuals feel squeezed is \nthe changing nature of the tax burden over the last few decades. For \nexample, individual income taxes--both as a percentage of all federal \ntaxes paid and as a percentage of gross domestic product--are at \nroughly the same levels as they were in 1970. Yet during that same time \nperiod the so-called social insurance taxes or payroll taxes have risen \ndramatically, primarily to fund Social Security and Medicare. And the \nportion of revenues collected from corporate income taxes has fallen by \nan equally dramatic amount. For example, in 1960, we collected $1.89 in \nindividual income taxes for every $1.00 in corporate income taxes. By \n1980 this ratio has risen to $3.78 in individual income taxes for every \n$1.00 in corporate income taxes. And today we collect $4.02 in \nindividual income taxes for every $1.00 in corporate income taxes. It \nis no wonder individuals feel squeezed.\n  As we begin to debate several tax reform proposals this year, perhaps \nnone will receive as much attention as the so-called marriage penalty. \nThe marriage penalty refers to the aspect of the tax code, which \nresults in many married couples paying more in taxes than they would if \nboth spouses remained single. Yet few will discuss--and I found this to \nbe very interesting--that 51 percent of married couples actually \nreceive a marriage ``bonus'', meaning they pay less in federal taxes as \na result of being married.\n  Let me repeat that. Fifty-one percent of married couples--a majority \nof married couples--pay less in federal taxes than they would if both \nspouses remained single. Last June CBO found that 51 percent of married \ncouples receive a marriage bonus averaging $1,300 per couple. If they \nwere required to file as single individuals, federal revenues would be \n$32.9 billion greater each year.\n  CBO also found that 42 percent of married couples are subject to a \nmarriage penalty, paying an average of $1,400 more per couple in taxes \nthan if both were single, for a total of $28.8 billion per year in \nadditional revenues. In other words, fully eliminating the marriage \npenalty costs $28.8 billion per year. However, if both marriage \npenalties and marriage bonuses were eliminated, there would actually be \na net increase in federal revenues of $4.1 billion per year. Forty-two \npercent of married couples would receive a tax cut, but 51 percent of \nmarried couples would receive a tax increase.\n  There is no way to make a statement about income tax exciting. There \nis nothing you can talk about that brings you out on the edge of your \nseat. I am not going to try to do that. So I am going to put into the \nRecord several examples of how couples, both making $20,000 a year and \nfiling jointly or filing single, and then one breadwinner making \n$200,000 while his spouse stays home and cares for the children--how \nmuch less they would pay than the married couple making $40,000.\n  I think you can already see the trend is to try to take care of that \nlower income and not increase the bonus, as S. 1285 does.\n  CBO found numerous causes for these differentials in tax treatment. \nHowever, two major factors explain most of the reason why married \ncouples are treated differently: (1) the standard deduction, and (2) \nthe tax rate schedules. In each case, the cutoff for married couples is \nabout two-thirds higher than for single individuals.\n  For example, in 1998, the standard deduction is $4,250 for singles \nand $7,100 for married joint filers--about 67% higher, but applying to \ntwo people instead of one. This has significant implications for \nmarried couples who do not itemize their deductions. For a couple where \none spouse earns all the income, this means a deduction of $2,850 more \nthan if both spouses were single, giving them a marriage bonus. \nHowever, for a couple where both spouses have significant income, the \nresult is a deduction of $1,400 less than if both were single.\n  Similar results occur when comparing tax rates. In 1998 the 15% \nbracket extends to incomes of $25,350 for singles, and $42,350 for \nmarried joint filers--about 67% higher. Most one-income couples receive \na marriage bonus because an additional $17,000 is taxed at the lower \n15% level. However, many dual-income married couples will find that \nless of their income is taxed at the 15% level.\n  So it is far more complex than some have been led to believe. For \ninstance, many married couples currently receiving a marriage bonus \nhave the impression that all married couples are penalized. Many \nmarried couples are unaware that there is such a thing as a marriage \nbonus. But remember--51 percent of all married couples currently \nreceive a marriage ``bonus'' and pay an average of $1,300 LESS in taxes \nthan if they were single, according to CBO. They tried to eliminate the \nso-called marriage penalty. But they increased the marriage bonus we \nnow have for over 50 percent of our filers. Therefore, I think that is \na little bit unfair for a $200,000-a-year filer to receive an \nadditional tax cut where we are just trying to make it even for those \nwho make $40,000 or less.\n\n  I believe we should consider taking reasonable steps to address the \nmarriage penalty. However, I strongly disagree with the approach taken \nin the leading Senate bill proposed on this topic--S. 1285. S. 1285 \nwould allow married couples to file ``combined'' returns where income \ncan be split 50-50, and each spouse taxed at single rates.\n  S. 1285 would add significantly to the complexity of the current Tax \nCode. Last year we went through all of this. ``We are going to reduce \nthe Tax Code; we are going to make it simpler.'' We only added almost \n900 pages to the Tax Code last year. We go out here and beat our chest \nand say, ``Oh, we have reformed the Tax Code. We have made it simpler, \nwe have given some tax cuts with 900 additional pages.'' No wonder H \nBlock and CPAs are doing business. We made it so complicated even the \nsmartest minds do not want to fool with it.\n  S. 1285 would add significantly to the complexity of the current tax \ncode, requiring many couples to calculate their taxes under both the \ntraditional ``married filing jointly'' category and also under the new \n``combined'' category. But even more troubling, it goes well beyond \nwhat is necessary to address the marriage penalty. The costs of the \nbill appear astronomical--somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 billion \nper year. For many couples who currently face a marriage penalty under \nS. 1285 their tax burdens would now be even lower than if they were \nboth single. In other words, many couples currently facing a marriage \npenalty would find that S. 1285 would not only eliminated the penalty \nbut create a new marriage bonus as well.\n  And beyond the impact on the marriage penalty, S. 1285 would have the \neffect of actually increasing the marriage bonus for many couples who \nalready receive a marriage bonus. Let me provide an example.\n  Consider a young, affluent family of four. Spouse No. 1 makes \n$200,000 while spouse No. 2 stays at home to raise their two children. \nThey have $30,000 in deductions. According to estimates supplied to me \nby Citizens for Tax Justice, this family currently receives a marriage \n``bonus'' of $3,161, but under S. 1285 the marriage ``bonus'' would \ngrow to $4,807.\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\n  Mr. President, I understand the marriage penalty, I also understand \nthe appeal of this issue politically. But why in the world would we \npass a bill to give a couple making $200,000 the chance to pay $4,807 \nless in taxes than if they were single, and claim we are doing this in \nthe name of fighting the marriage penalty? It seems that S. 1285 would \ngive very generous tax cuts to wealthy married couples who currently do \nnot face any marriage penalty whatsoever, Why would we do this?\n  I believe there is a much more logical approach. It is a simpler \napproach. It would significantly reduce the marriage penalty, \nespecially for lower and middle income families. And it would simplify \nthe tax code at the same time. And perhaps most importantly it would \nnot give huge tax windfalls to wealthy couples who already receive a \nmarriage ``bonus'' under current law.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing the Marriage Penalty Reduction \nAct. My legislation would significantly increase the standard \ndeduction, to $6,000 for singles, $9,000 for heads of households, and \n$12,000 for married couples. For many lower and middle income married \ncouples who face a marriage penalty, the current standard deduction is \nthe single most important reason. Under my proposal, the standard \ndeduction would no longer have any role in creating a marriage penalty. \nNone.\n  There are several advantages to this approach. By setting the \nstandard deduction for married couples at exactly twice the level of \nsingles, no marriage penalty can occur.\n  Mr. President, 70 percent of all individual tax filers currently take \nthe standard deduction. In other words, only 30 percent itemize their \ndeductions. For married couples who currently take the standard \ndeduction, my proposal will grant them a tax cut of at least $735, \nsignificantly reducing any existing marriage penalty. If this $12,000 \ndeduction were in effect in 1998, along with the current personal \nexemption of $2,700, a family of four would find that their first \n$22,800 would not be subject to income taxes.\n  Let me give a second example. Couple No. 2 is a young, newlywed \ncouple. Each makes $20,000 per year, for a total of $40,000. They take \nthe standard deduction. Under current law they owe $4,125 in income \ntaxes as a married couple, but would only owe $3,915 in combined income \ntaxes if both remained single. In other words, current law imposes a \n``marriage penalty'' of $210 on couple No. 2.\n  Under S. 1285, couple No. 2 would, in fact, be able to eliminate \ntheir entire marriage penalty. Their tax bill would be reduced by $210. \nHowever, under may proposal, since the standard deduction would also be \nraised overall, couple No. 2 would see their overall tax bill decline \nby $765. My proposal would completely eliminate the marriage penalty, \nand also provide tax relief for this moderate income couple.\n  There are advantages for some of those who currently itemize \ndeductions as well. Of the 30 percent who do itemize, the average \namount of deductions is about $16,000. However, for married couples \nwith itemized deductions under $12,000, they will no longer have to go \nto the trouble of making calculations under the legislation I am \nproposing today. They can simply take the higher standard deduction. \nFor many, this will greatly simplify the process of doing their taxes.\n  And my proposal will cost significantly less than S. 1285. Most who \nhave looked at the issue of tax relief in 1998 understand that S. 1285 \nis far more than we can afford. My approach costs far less. I intend to \nask the Joint Committee on Taxation for an official estimate of this \nproposal. If we are to debate a tax package later this year with a \nsignificant component devoted to the marriage penalty, it is my hope \nthat the proposal I am introducing today can form the basis for a more \nlogical, more rational approach, to the issue. It is also an approach \nwhich costs less and simplifies the tax code at the same time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nstraightforward proposal appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1989\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, I am introducing the ``Railroad \nCar Visibility Act,'' requiring that all railroad cars have some form \nof visible marker such as reflectors or reflective tape.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to reduce the number of accidents \nwith both moving trains at rail crossings, and with rail cars parked on \nsidings. In South Dakota a number of such accidents have occurred \nrecently at rural and small town rail crossings and sidings which are \noften unprotected or unlighted. Such accidents occur in rural areas \nacross the country.\n  As a result, last year I urged the Department of Transportation (DOT) \nto take appropriate measures to improve railroad car visibility. While \nDOT has begun enforcing rules governing locomotive visibility, rail \ncars are still not required to have reflective lighting. However, DOT \nresearch concludes that ``retroreflective materials are useful and \nsatisfactory for enhancing the visibility of railroad cars.''\n  This legislation has the support of both South Dakota's legislature \nand Governor Janklow. For relatively little cost, this legislation will \nimprove railroad car visibility and thereby reduce the number of \naccidents, unnecessary injuries and deaths at rail crossings and \nsidings. Therefore I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \nwork with me to secure its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this bill printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1991\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

H. NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF LIBRARY''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S. Res. 217\n\n       Whereas General H. Norman Schwarzkopf graduated from Valley \n     Forge Military Academy and College as Valedictorian in 1952 \n     and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West \n     Point in 1956;\n       Whereas General H. Norman Schwarzkopf served with \n     distinction with over 35 years of service, earning numerous \n     distinguished service awards including awards for valor and \n     two purple hearts, foreign decorations, as well as the \n     Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom;\n       Whereas General H. Norman Schwarzkopf commanded a multi-\n     national coalition of 34 members during Operation Desert \n     Shield/Desert Storm and freed and country of Kuwait on \n     February 26, 1991; and\n       Whereas the Valley Forge Military Academy and College \n     intends to build the General H. Norman Schwarzkopf Library \n     and to dedicate it as a national commemorative site for \n     Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate recognizes Valley \n     Forge Military Academy and College for establishing a \n     ``General H. Norman Schwarzkopf Library'', which will serve \n     as a national commemorative site for Operation Desert Shield/\n     Desert Storm.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Valley Forge Military Academy and \n     College.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I seek to submit a resolution \nrecognizing the Valley Forge Military Academy and College for \nestablishing the ``General H. Norman Schwarzkopf Library.''\n  The Valley Forge Military Academy and College, located near Historic \nValley Forge National Park and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the ideal \nsite to commemorate General H. Norman Schwarzkopf and his many \naccomplishments. The Academy broke ground in March, 1998 to begin \nconstruction of a Regimental Mess Hall, a section of which will serve \nas a Library to honor those Americans who participated in the Desert \nShield and Desert Storm campaigns. The Library, which would serve both \nthe Academy and the community, will contain some of the General's \npersonal papers, memorabilia, and artifacts commemorating Desert Storm \nand Desert Shield. It would be appropriate and beneficial for young \ncollegians to have access to history they have witnessed. In 1989, \nGeneral Schwarzkopf is quoted as having said, ``West Point prepared me \nfor the Army, but Valley Forge prepared me for life.''\n  General Schwarzkopf graduated from the Valley Forge Military Academy \nas Valedictorian in 1952, thereafter he entered the United States \nMilitary Academy at West Point. During Operations Desert Shield and \nDesert Storm, General Schwarzkopf served as the Commander in Chief of \nthe United States Central Command. From his days as an accomplished \ncadet, General Schwarzkopf has proven himself to be a\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\nsuperior and compassionate commander.\n  General Schwarzkopf has served the United States with distinction for \nmore than 35 years. Throughout his military career, the General has \nearned numerous distinguished service awards including commendations \nfor valor, two purple hearts, honoring decorations, as well as the \nCongressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  For these reasons, I take great pride in sponsoring this resolution \nto recognize the Valley Forge Military Academy and College for \nestablishing the ``General H. Norman Schwarzkopf Library,'' which will \nserve as a national commemorative site for Operations Desert Shield and \nDesert Storm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3656-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 218--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, \n               AND REPRESENTATION BY SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

No. 105-36) \nprotocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the accession of \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. These protocols were opened \nfor signature at Brussels on December 16, 1997, and signed on behalf of \nthe United States of America and other parties to the North Atlantic \nTreaty; as follows:\n\n       In paragraph (1) of section 3, after ``(1) The Strategic \n     Concept of NATO.--'' insert the following:\n       (A) Policy of the United States Toward the Strategic \n     Concept of NATO.--The Senate understands that the initial \n     adaptation of NATO's strategy for the post-Cold War \n     environment is contained in the Strategic Concept of NATO (as \n     defined in (1)(E)), and that its core concepts remain \n     relevant today as the North Atlantic Alliance approaches the \n     21st century. The Senate understands that the policy of the \n     United States toward the revised Strategic Concept shall \n     reflect that fact and shall be based upon the following \n     principles:\n       (i) First and Foremost a Military Alliance.--NATO is first \n     and foremost a military alliance. NATO's success in securing \n     peace is predicated on its military strength and strategic \n     unity.\n       (ii) Principal Foundation for Defense of Security Interests \n     of NATO Members.--NATO serves as the principal foundation for \n     collectively defending the security interests of its members \n     against external threats.\n       (iii) Promotion and Protection of United States Vital \n     National Security Interests.--Strong United States leadership \n     of NATO promotes and protects United States vital national \n     security interests.\n       (iv) United States Leadership Role.--The United States \n     maintains its leadership role of NATO through the stationing \n     of United States combat forces in Europe, providing military \n     commanders for key NATO commands, and through the presence of \n     United States nuclear forces on the territory of Europe.\n       (v) Common Threats.--NATO members will face common threats \n     to their security in the post-Cold War environment, \n     including--\n       (I) the potential for the re-emergence of a hegamonic power \n     confronting Europe;\n       (II) rogue states and non-state actors possessing nuclear, \n     biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver \n     these weapons by ballistic or cruise missiles, or other \n     unconventional delivery means;\n       (III) threats of a wider nature, including the disruption \n     of the flow of vital resources, and other possible \n     transnational threats; and\n       (IV) conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from \n     ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic disputes \n     or the actions of undemocratic leaders.\n       (vi) Core Mission of NATO.--Defense planning will reaffirm \n     a commitment by NATO members to a credible capability for \n     collective self-defense, which remains the core mission of \n     NATO. All NATO members will contribute to this core mission.\n       (vii) Capacity to Respond to Common Threats.--NATO's \n     continued success requires a credible military capability to \n     deter and respond to common threats. Building on its core \n     capabilities for collective self-defense of its members, NATO \n     will ensure that its military force structure, defense \n     planning, command structures, and force goals promote NATO's \n     capacity to project power when the security of a NATO member \n     is threatened, and provide a basis for ad hoc coalitions of \n     willing partners among NATO members. This will require that \n     NATO members possess national military capabilities to \n     rapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations \n     for extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the \n     United States in high intensity conflicts.\n       (viii) Integrated Military Structure.--The Integrated \n     Military Structure of NATO underpins NATO's effectiveness as \n     a military alliance by embedding NATO members in a process of \n     cooperative defense planning and ensuring unity of command.\n       (ix) Nuclear Posture.--Nuclear weapons will continue to \n     make an essential contribution to deterring aggression, \n     especially aggression by potential adversaries armed with \n     nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. A credible NATO \n     nuclear deterrent posture requires the stationing of United \n     States nuclear forces in Europe, which provides an essential \n     political and military link between Europe and North America, \n     and the widespread participation of NATO members in nuclear \n     roles. In addition, the NATO deterrent posture will continue \n     to ensure uncertainty in the mind of any potential aggressor \n     about the nature of the response by NATO members to military \n     aggression.\n       (x) Burdensharing.--The responsibility and financial burden \n     of defending the democracies of Europe will be more equitably \n     shared in a manner in which specific obligations and force \n     goals are met by NATO members.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CRAIG EXECUTIVE AMENDMENT NO. 2311\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CRAIG submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe resolution of ratification for the treaty (Treaty Doc. No. 105-36) \nprotocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the accession of \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. These protocols were opened \nfor signature at Brussels on December 16, 1997, and signed on behalf of \nthe United States of America and other parties to the North Atlantic \nTreaty; as follows:\n\n       Insert after subparagraph (A) of section 3(1) the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       (B) Requirement of united nations commitment for \n     reimbursement or crediting of united states expenditures for \n     certain nato missions.--Prior to the deposit of the United \n     States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to the Senate that he has obtained a commitment from \n     the United Nations that United States expenditures for costs \n     incurred in any mission described in subparagraph (A)(ii) \n     shall be treated by the United Nations as in-kind \n     contributions by the United States to a United Nations \n     peacekeeping operation and shall be--\n       (1) reimbursed to the United States out of funds available \n     to the United Nations; or\n       (2) credited toward contributions assessed the United \n     States by the United Nations for such operations.\n       Redesignate subsequent subparagraphs in section 3(1) \n     accordingly.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am filing an amendment related to \nthe\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\nresolution of ratification for the proposed expansion of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization.\n  Last May, President Clinton publicly embraced the idea of a ``new \nNATO'' mission. It is my concern that the President's vision of a new \nNATO will signal the end of NATO as a defensive alliance and begin its \nrole as a global peacekeeping organization.\n  I have several concerns about the President's vision for NATO, not \nthe least of which is cost for a ``new'' NATO. It seems to me that if \nthe President continues to eagerly commit our men and women in uniform \nto dangerous peace-keeping missions, for which, the U.S. invariably \npays the lion's share of the cost, the United Nations should either be \nforced to reimburse us for those costs, or relieve our so-called \narrears.\n  Therefore, I will be offering an amendment which requires that prior \nto the deposit of the instrument of ratification for NATO expansion, \nthe President must certify that the Senate has obtained a commitment \nfrom the United Nations that the U.S. will be reimbursed or credited \nfor costs incurred in peace-keeping missions.\n  I am offering this amendment because I am both concerned and \nfrustrated by the tremendous costs that the U.S. incurs in peacekeeping \nand humanitarian missions around the globe. Our men and women in \nuniform are asked to do more and more, with less and less. Meanwhile, \nAmerican taxpayers foot the bill for these missions. Yet, the United \nStates is handed the single largest assessed contribution for any U.N. \nmember, despite the huge commitments we maintain across the globe.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this common-sense amendment to \nforce the United Nations to account for the contributions that the \nUnited States has made to peace-keeping around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3657-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Had I been present I would have voted in favor \nof the resolution. I request that the official record so indicate.\n  Mr. President, Ireland has suffered thirty years of turmoil, a tragic \nset of circumstances which has taken a deep toll on the Irish people. \nThis toll can be measured in the loss of thousands of lives, and the \ninstability which arises from thirty years of constant fighting, and \nterror. Despite the best efforts of the governments of the Republic of \nIreland and the United Kingdom over the years to find an equitable \nsolution, these, until recently were to no avail.\n  Mr. President, finally I would note that the symbolism of this accord \nbeing reached on Good Friday should not escape us. It has been said \nthat Good Friday is the vortex to which all history is drawn, and out \nof which all history flows, forever transformed. Let us hope that this \nmomentous accord will set Ireland on a course towards peace and \nprosperity from which there is no turning back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3658-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    STEPHEN C. ROBINSON--U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are few issues as important as \nprotecting our citizens and keeping our communities free of crime. \nAmericans should feel secure in their homes, at their schools, and in \ntheir neighborhoods, and in recent years we have made tremendous \nprogress in this area, reducing the crime rate for a record five years \nin a row. But more work needs to be done. One of the most effective \nways to make our streets safer is attracting talented and committed \nindividuals to work in law enforcement. That is why I am so pleased \nthat my Senate colleagues have displayed great wisdom and unanimously \nconfirmed Stephen C. Robinson to serve as U.S. Attorney for the State \nof Connecticut.\n  Mr. Robinson has extensive and varied law enforcement experience in \nthe public sector and his legal and investigative work for the private \nsector well qualify him to serve in this position. I was proud to \nrecommend his nomination to the President, and I believe that he will \nbring a sense of intelligence, integrity, and energy to this office.\n  After graduating from Cornell University and Cornell Law School, Mr. \nRobinson was in private practice for several years. He then became an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York where he \ndirected the prosecution of narcotics cases and tax fraud and \nsecurities fraud cases. He also argued appeals in the U.S. Court of \nAppeals in the Second Circuit. In 1990, Mr. Robinson received the \nDepartment of Justice's Director Award for Superior Performance as an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney.\n  Mr. Robinson also has served as Associate General Counsel and \nManaging Director at Kroll Associates, the world's largest private \ninvestigation firm. In 1993, FBI Director Louis Freeh asked Mr. \nRobinson to join the Bureau as his Special Assistant and General \nCounsel. At the FBI, he oversaw counter-terrorism and counter-espionage \npolicy and investigation; revision of the selection and promotion \nprocess for Special Agents; and FBI undercover investigation proposals. \nMr. Robinson has most recently worked as Chief Compliance Officer for \nAetna U.S. Healthcare in Middletown, Connecticut, and he is also an \ninstructor of Trial Practice Law at Yale Law School.\n  Mr. Robinson's confirmation is particularly significant in \nConnecticut, because he is the first African-American to ever serve as \nour State's top federal prosecutor. He has spoken publicly about the \nsense of hopelessness amongst young blacks throughout the country. And \nhaving grown up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, Mr. \nRobinson hopes that young people from inner cities will look at him and \nsee someone who can not only relate to their circumstances, but who \nalso illustrates that if you get your education and work hard you can \nattain your goals, regardless of where you come from. Mr. Robinson \nstands as a positive role model for African-American youths, and in \nfact all young people.\n  By taking the post of Connecticut's U.S. Attorney, Mr. Robinson is \nrenewing his connection to public service. But this may have never been \npossible were it not for a conversation between Steve and his mother in \n1996. During the Thanksgiving holidays, his mother encouraged him to \nreturn to public service and give more back to his community. Mr. \nRobinson has frequently stated that this conversation prompted him to \nreevaluate what he wanted to do with his life. Upon reflection, he \ndecided to take his mother's advice, and he decided that he should \nreturn to public service. On behalf of the people of Connecticut, I \nwould like to thank Steve's mother. Steve Robinson is a man of \noutstanding character and intelligence, and we are fortunate to have \nhim serve as our next U.S. Attorney.\n  I offer my sincere congratulations to Steve, his wife Kathleen \nSullivan, his daughter Victoria, and all of his family and friends on \nhis well-deserved confirmation. I have every confidence that he will \nflourish in this position.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3658-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n                 THE 5TH ANNUAL HEARTS FOR LIFE BENEFIT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, my wife and I have lived our lives \nin Vermont. One of the great advantages of that is the wonderful \nVermonters we have gotten to know over the years.\n  One of our valued Vermonters is Katherine Paterson, who has just won \nthe 1998 Hans Christian Anderson Award for her authorship of children's \nbooks.\n  Mrs. Paterson has written 27 children's books, and she and her \nhusband, the Reverend John Paterson, live on Cobble Hill in Barre Town, \nnot far from our tree farm in Middlesex, Vermont.\n  While I was home for Easter Break, I read a wonderful article about \nher in the Saturday, April 11th, Times Argus, and I ask that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From the Times Argus, Apr. 11, 1998]\n\n Barre Author Wins Writing Award--For Katherine Paterson ``The Closest \n                    I'll Ever Get To A Nobel Prize''\n\n                          (By David W. Smith)\n\n       Barre Town--Author Katherine Paterson has just won what may \n     be the most prestigious award in her field, the Hans \n     Christian Ansersen Award, but that doesn't make finding a \n     last-minute seat on a plane to New Delhi any easier.\n       ``It's hard to get a ticket to India,'' she said with a \n     sigh, as yet another phone call interrupted her train of \n     thought.\n       Paterson, the well-known Barre author of 27 children's \n     books, needs to find her way to the other side of the world \n     by April 20 to receive the award, bestowed every two years by \n     the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY). An \n     international jury of children's literature specialists \n     selects a recipient who has created a body of work important \n     to the genre. Paterson's work has been translated into 22 \n     languages.\n       ``An award for a body of work is the best kind,'' said \n     Paterson. ``None of your children get neglected.''\n       Sitting in the parlor of her house on Cobble Hill Road, \n     Paterson joked about the award and the prestige that \n     children's authors accept in lieu of money, but also \n     reflected with a sense of wonder on the amount of attention \n     she's received in her 34-year writing career.\n       ``It's thrilling. I'm surprised at how thrilled I was,'' \n     she said. ``It's the closest I'll ever get to a Nobel \n     Prize.''\n       Paterson's first attempt at serious writing was a book for \n     the Presbyterian Church explaining questions of religious \n     faith to children. ``Who Am I?'' was published in 1964, but \n     from there it would be a long seven years until another of \n     her works went to press.\n       ``I feel I've paid my dues,'' she said.\n       Working in a small corner room of her house with a single \n     skylight which she described as ``the room that has books all \n     over the floor,'' Paterson tries to rise each day and write \n     for a few hours before breakfast.\n       ``(It's when) your critical mind is lazier than your \n     creative mind,'' she said. ``I'm glad I have a critical mind, \n     it just gets in the way when you're trying to get through the \n     first draft.'' Paterson writes for children of all ages, but \n     is best known by her novels for 10-14 year-olds, like \n     ``Lyddie,'' The Great Gilly Hopkins,'' ``Bridge to \n     Terabithia,'' and ``Jip, His Story.''\n       ``I really am a writer for children and very happy to be a \n     writer for children,'' she said. ``They're your best \n     audience. They want your book to be the best book they ever \n     read.''\n       The recipient of many awards, Paterson has also been \n     subject to critical scrutiny. Her books have been singled out \n     as containing everything from obscenity and profanity to \n     religious blasphemy and have even been banished from \n     libraries.\n       Never one to shy away from difficult subject matter, \n     ``Lyddie,'' deals with the sexual harassment and exploitation \n     of mid-19th century factory girls, while ``Terabithia'' \n     focuses on a child's grief at the death of a special friend. \n     Paterson said that usually it is the adults, not the young \n     readers, who are upset by her work.\n       ``(Adults) don't want to believe that children feel things \n     as deeply as they do,'' she said. ``They want them to stay \n     innocent.''\n       Paterson said she felt her more controversial work was \n     often released at the same time as other children's books \n     which dealt with similar topics.\n       ``We all breaths the same air,'' she said, ``and we all \n     sort of breathe in themes at the same time.''\n       A play based on her novel, ``The Great Gilly Hopkins,'' \n     which was adapted by her son David, will be presented by the \n     Center Stage Theater Group on May 8 and 9 at the Barre Opera \n     House. The same play is being performed on Broadway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3659-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DEDICATION OF THE BETHEL CHURCH OF GOD IN CHRIST\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Not only will this two \nyear old ministry install a new pastor, Elder George Shepherd \nChristopher, but also, the congregation will dedicate its new church in \nPittsburgh. The theme for the installation service comes from Psalm \n118:23, ``This is the Lord's doing, it is marvelous in our eyes.''\n  The Bethel Church of God in Christ is a community based, Bible \nbelieving, Christ centered, Spirit directed fellowship. For the past \ntwo years, this church has selflessly dedicated itself to community \nservice. The congregation believes it is necessary to minister to the \nwhole person for the glory of God. Having pledged to provide ``Ministry \nto the heart of East Liberty and beyond,'' the church looks forward to \nthe challenges and promises of the future.\n  Mr. President, the parishioners and clergy have worked and prayed \ntirelessly for both the new building and their new pastor. In closing, \nI ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes to \nthe Bethel Church of God in Christ. With God's help, this church will \nbe a light for lost souls in East Liberty and throughout \nPittsburgh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3659-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3659-S3660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE ARMENIAN VICTIMS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory \nof the ethnic Armenians who died at the hands of the Ottoman Empire \nfrom 1915-1923. Last week, we marked the 83rd anniversary of the \nbeginning of a systematic, officially-sanctioned genocide that would \neventually claim 1.5 million lives and force more than 250,000 to flee \ntheir homeland. As a result, there are fewer than 80,000 Armenians \nremaining in present-day Turkey.\n  I have spoken about these events every year of my term, on or near \nthis date, in order to remind the Senate--and to remind the American \npeople--of the sacrifice of these 1.5 million people who were murdered \nsimply because of their ethnicity. In a country where we cherish the \nethnic diversity of our citizens and welcome legal immigrants from \naround the globe, we sometimes forget about the ethnic strife that \nexisted--and continues to exist--all over the world.\n  Unfortunately, ethnic conflict has led to genocide all too often, as \nwe have seen during this decade in Bosnia, Rwanda, and elsewhere. More \nrecently, there has been a resurgence of ethnic fighting in Kosovo, \nwhere the minority Serb population seeks to control the majority \nAlbanian population.\n  Mr. President, human rights violations have become all too \ncommonplace in the modern world. Beatings, rapes, murders, and \n``disappearances'' have become routine weapons of war in battles where \nthe perpetrators are rarely brought to justice. It is my strong view \nthat the United States must continue to lead the fight for global human \nrights.\n  The recent death of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot--who died before he \ncould be tried for the murders of millions of Cambodians--reinforces \nthe urgency of bringing those responsible for genocide to justice. I \napplaud the efforts of the United Nations International Criminal \nTribunal which is currently working to prosecute those responsible for \nthe atrocities committed in Rwanda and the Former Yugoslavia.\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\n  As we honor the memory of the 1.5 million Armenians whose \nannihilation began 83 years ago, we must also remember the countless \nother victims of ``ethnic cleansing'' around the globe, and recommit \nourselves to the effort to punish those responsible for these \nunspeakable crimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3659-4", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF SRI LANKA\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n50th Anniversary of independence of Sri Lanka. I believe it is \nappropriate that we so mark this occasion by offering our \ncongratulations to her excellency, President Kumaratunga and the people \nof Sri Lanka.\n  In the five decades since Sri Lanka gained its independence from \nBritish colonial rule, Sri Lanka has held regular national elections as \nwell as provincial and local government elections. The most recent \nparliamentary elections were held in August 1994, and the third \npresidential election was held in November 1994.\n  Sri Lanka has prospered economically since 1977, when it introduced \neconomic liberalization policies which shifted the economy away from \nstate controls, subsidies and public sector involvement to a market-\noriented system in which private entrepreneurship flourishes. The U.S. \nis Sri Lanka's largest trading partner, accounting for 30% of the \nlatter's exports, and over 90 U.S. companies have invested in Sri \nLanka, with a heavy concentration in mining and textiles.\n  U.S. official relations with Sri Lanka date back to 1850 when John \nBlack, an American merchant residing in Colombo was appointed the first \nAmerican commercial agent in Galle. Fifty years later the agency moved \nto Colombo and became a consulate. It subsequently became an embassy in \n1948 after Sri Lanka became independent.\n  The exchange of bilateral visits has played an important role in \nstrengthening the cordial relations between our two nations. Then \nSecretary of State John Foster Dulles visited Sri Lanka soon after its \nindependence, and since that time members of this body as well as our \ncolleagues in the House have regularly visited this lovely country.\n  Despite its prosperity and commitment to democratic principles, Sri \nLanka has been plagued for many years by two domestic insurgencies, one \nmainly Tamil in the North, and the other mainly Sinhalese, in the \nSouth. The result has been the loss of many lives and heavy damage to \nproperty. The government has reiterated its commitment to addressing \ngrievances articulated by these groups through dialog and the process \nof negotiation. Four rounds of unconditional talks with the Tamil Tiger \nseparatists were held following the President's election in November \n1994, and a cease fire was subsequently reached. This however, was \nbreached by the separatists after 3\\1/2\\ months when they resumed their \nterrorist activity.\n  As a result of these terrorist actions at home, Sri Lanka has placed \ncounter terrorism at the forefront of its foreign policy. Sri Lanka was \nthe Vice Chair of the United Nations Ad hoc Committee on Terrorism and \nplayed an important role in the drafting of the Convention for the \nSuppression of Terrorist Bombing, being the first to sign the \nConvention at United Nations Headquarters on January 12, 1998.\n  I am therefore, Mr. President, pleased to acknowledge this occasion \nby expressing best wishes to the Government and people of Sri Lanka as \nthey celebrate 50 years of independence. I know that we all look \nforward to continued cooperation and friendship with the Government and \npeople of Sri Lanka in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3660-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING ARIZONA'S TOP TWO 1998 YOUTH VOLUNTEERS\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and \nhonor two young Arizona students who have achieved national recognition \nfor exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Eliza Robinson of \nScottsdale and Jason Kelley of Prescott have just been named State \nhonorees in the 1998 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an \nannual honor conferred on only one high school student and one middle \nschool student in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n  Ms. Eliza Robinson is being recognized for her many years of \ndedication and service to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, culminating \nwith a term as spokesman for that wonderful organization.\n  Mr. Kelley is being recognized for his efforts to start a Youth \nChamber of Commerce. Jason's organization will give other young people \nin his community the opportunity to participate in Chamber events \nsimilar to those sponsored by their local Chamber of Commerce, as well \nas interact with business leaders from the area.\n  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are \nless involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that \nwe encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young \npeople have made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, \nas individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure \nthe health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young \nvolunteers like Mr. Kelley and Ms. Robinson are inspiring examples to \nall of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  The program that brought these young role models to our attention--\nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by the \nPrudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the \nNational Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress \nupon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critically \nimportant and highly valued and to inspire other young people to follow \ntheir example. In only three years, the program has become the nation's \nlargest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, \nwith more than 30,000 youngsters participating.\n  Ms. Robinson and Mr. Kelley should be extremely proud to have been \nsingled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of \ntheir recognition, they will come to Washington in early May, along \nwith other 1998 honorees from across the country, for several days of \nspecial events, including a Congressional breakfast reception on \nCapitol Hill. While in Washington, ten will be named America's top \nyouth volunteers of the year by a distinguished national selection \ncommittee co-chaired by our colleagues, Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska \nand Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas.\n  I heartily applaud Mr. Kelley and Ms. Robinson for their initiative \nin seeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the \npositive impact they have had on the lives of others. I also would like \nto salute four other young people in my state who were named \nDistinguished Finalists by the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards \nfor their outstanding volunteer service. They are: Chrissy Weiers of \nMaricopa, who has demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to make her \npeers aware of the dangers of drugs; Christina Barela of Glendale, who \nhelped organize a day camp for elementary school girls; Purvi Patel of \nYuma, who designed and built a park adjacent to her school with five \npeers from the Gifted and Talented Education Program; and Tirzah Orcutt \nof Phoenix, who created a volunteer project to paint a mural on the \nVeterans Administration Medical Nursing Home Care unit in Phoenix.\n  All these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and \ndeserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that \nyoung Americans can--and do--play important roles in their communities, \nand that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous \npromise for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3660-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3660-S3661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GORTON AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2646\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to explain my support of \nSenator Gorton's amendment to the Coverdell A+ Accounts legislation. I \nwas pleased to support the Gorton amendment because it returns the \ndecision making authority over our children's education to parents, \nteachers, and locally elected school boards. After more than 30 years \nof top down control, it is clear that the hundreds of federal education \nprograms and one size fits all policies from Washington, D.C. are not \nworking.\n\n[[Page S3661]]\n\n  The Gorton Amendment allows each state to choose from one of three \noptions: to have federal funds sent directly to local school districts \nminus federal regulations; to have funds sent to the state education \nauthority without federal regulations; or to continue to receive \nfederal funds under the current system of categorical programs. Any \nchanges to the current system are not mandated by the federal \ngovernment--but are left to the discretion of the states.\n  I believe this is a wonderful opportunity to send money directly to \nlocal school districts free from the excessive mandates and regulations \nimposed on our schools from the Department of Education. I want it \nclearly understood, though, that this does not affect my support for \nthe National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. I support the \nNational Board and support further funding for its initiatives.\n  The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) seeks \nto establish high and rigorous standards for teachers. It is leading \nthe way in making teaching a profession dedicated to student learning \nand to upholding high standards for professional performance. Teachers \nare role models for our students and our communities. Interestingly \nenough, they are the ones leading the way in establishing and \nimplementing the National Board certification.\n  I fully support the National Board for Professional Teaching \nStandards and hope that this body will support it for the sake of our \nyoung people. It is children in their care that are the beneficiaries \nof teacher improvement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3660-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VERMONT ELECTRICAL COOPERATIVE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to \ncommemorate the 60th birthday of the Vermont Electric Cooperative. \nBeginning on that April day in 1939 when the co-op first brought \nelectricity to a family farm in Eden, they have provided an \nindispensable service to generations of Vermonters who were missing out \non the conveniences of electricity.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a short retrospective about the co-op which \nrecently appeared in their newsletter be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                Happy Birthday Co-op!!--a Retrospective\n\n       Studying by lantern light, milking cows by hand, cutting \n     blocks of river ice for refrigeration--life in Colonial \n     America, perhaps?\n       In rural Vermont, this way of life was not so long ago and \n     there are plenty of Co-op members who remember all too well \n     those days before Vermont's Governor George Aiken pioneered \n     the federal legislation that spawned the birth of Vermont \n     Electric Cooperative.\n       This year, the Co-op celebrates the sixtieth anniversary of \n     its creation which brought to rural residents of Vermont the \n     conveniences of electricity which many Americans had been \n     enjoying for years.\n       More than anyone, Vermont's farmers looked forward to the \n     day when the power poles would march down the road to their \n     own barns and houses. Harold Putnam, of Cambridge, was one of \n     them.\n       ``Some of our neighbors closer to town were already on CVPS \n     and we were very anxious to get electricity to the barn and \n     the house. The gas lanterns we were using in the barn were \n     kind of dangerous, the gas-powered milking system didn't \n     always work and it was hard to keep things clean without a \n     constant supply of hot water.''\n       The Putnam farmhouse had running water from a spring by the \n     kitchen door to keep food cool. Harold's mother, Maybelle, \n     was especially looking forward to the day when the barn would \n     have its own hot water tank and the endless parade of milking \n     equipment through the kitchen to her sink would finally end, \n     recalled Harold's wife, Lois.\n       The Putnams relied on a gravity-fed system to bring cold \n     spring water into a tank in the barn which held milk cans. \n     Until the late 1930's, the Putnams, like many farmers in \n     Vermont, sold their cream to a local creamery. The Putnams \n     worked with the Cloverdale Creamery in Westford on Route 15, \n     where the Burlington and Lamoille Railroad had been stopping \n     since 1887. The cream was then shipped to Hartford, \n     Connecticut. The skimmed milk was fed to pigs and the family \n     sold pork. Just before the advent of VEC, the Putnams began \n     shipping fluid milk, which required not just the cool spring \n     water, but also a steady supply of ice.\n       ``We bought our ice from a neighbor who cut ice under the \n     Cambridge covered bridge (the long bridge now at the \n     Shelburne, Museum) or at Halfmoon Pond in Fletcher,'' Mr. \n     Putnam explained.\n       For the Putnams, switching to electricity was a fairly \n     simple matter: their barn was already equipped with a milk \n     pump that had been powered by the unreliable gas-powered \n     system. They wired just half the house at first to save \n     money.\n       Mr. Putnam took on the task of helping to secure easements \n     for the new Co-op line from the CVPS substation, then at the \n     junction of routes 15 and 104 in Cambridge, out to Poker Hill \n     Road in Underhill.\n       Twenty-five miles away from Cambridge, Evelyn and Ernest \n     Earle were milking 20 cows by hand in Eden where the entire \n     town was without electricity.\n       The Earles moved to their current home, just off route 118 \n     between Eden and Belvidere, a year or so after they were \n     married in 1940. It had been the first house in Eden on the \n     Co-op's very first power line, and Mr. Earle was part of the \n     crew that dug the holes for the poles to carry that first \n     line in 1939.\n       The line that supplied power to what is now the Earle's \n     home originated at the first substation built specifically to \n     serve the Co-op. The house still has the wall brackets which \n     held the gas lamps. Most houses had a large table lamp as \n     well with several mantles that maximized the output of the \n     lamp, easily brightening up an entire room, Mrs. Earle said.\n       Richard Parker and his brother Henry, who grew up in \n     Lowell, wired many of the buildings served by the Co-op, \n     including those owned by both the Putnams and the Earles, and \n     were later long-time Co-op employees.\n       Richard Parker, then 21, remembers the day Governor Aiken \n     came to Eden and turned on the lights for the first VEC line. \n     The inaugural line ran from the new Eden substation through \n     the villages of Eden and Eden Mills, where the first Co-op \n     office was located, to Lowell.\n       ``It was quite a gathering--40 or 50 people. The Co-op had \n     tested the lines before-hand to make sure the lights were all \n     working. Governor Aiken threw the switch and the Co-op was in \n     business.''\n       It was a warm, sunny day in April 1939. It had taken less \n     than a year from the creation of the Co-op to the \n     construction of the first substation and transmission \n     line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3661-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ``FRIENDS COMMUNITY SERVICE AWARD'' RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor two very \nspecial people, Dr. Haifa Fakhouri and Ms. Florine Mark. Both will be \nreceiving the ``Friends Community Service Award'' on Sunday, May 17, \n1998 from the American Arab and Jewish Friends, a program of The \nInterfaith Round Table of the National Conference. American Arab and \nJewish Friends was established in 1981 to promote a greater \nunderstanding between the Arab and Jewish Communities of Southeastern \nMichigan.\n  Dr. Fakhouri is the President and CEO of the Arab-American and \nChaldean Council, the nation's largest community based, human service \norganization serving the Arab-American and Chaldean population. The ACC \nhas grown tremendously under Dr. Fakhouri's leadership. In addition to \nher work with the ACC, she has served as special advisor to the United \nNations on women's issues in the Arab world and as a delegate to the \nInternational Women's Conference in Mexico. She also serves on the \nboards of several national, state and local organizations. In all of \nher capacities, Dr. Fakhouri works to strengthen relations between the \nArab-American and Jewish communities. She is well-deserving of the \naward being presented to her.\n  Ms. Florine Mark has been the President and CEO of the WW Group, \nInc., the nation's largest franchise of Weight Watchers International \nfor the last 30 years. In addition to this, Ms. Mark also finds time to \nserve on the boards of numerous community organizations including the \nAmerican Red Cross, the Detroit Institute for Children and the United \nJewish Appeal National Campaign. Ms. Mark's contributions to society, \nespecially promoting Arab-American, Jewish relations are commendable.\n  Both of these women deserve special recognition for their \ncontributions to the Arab-American and Jewish communities. I want to \ncongratulate them on their awards. At this time, I would also like to \ncommend the Interfaith Round Table on all of their efforts to improve \nunderstanding and friendship between the Arab and Jewish communities. I \nextend my best wishes for a successful 12th Annual Awards and \nScholarship dinner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3661-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3661-S3662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO UNIVERSITY OF UTAH ROTC CLASS OF 1944\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nUniversity of Utah ROTC Class of 1944 which responded to the call for \nactive military\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\nduty during World War II. On May 2, 1998, at the University of Utah \nmembers of the ROTC Class of 1944 will hold a reunion commemorating the \n55th anniversary of their activation into our national armed services. \nI believe it is fitting that we honor them today in the United States \nSenate.\n  The University of Utah Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) was an \nunique organization. It was one of the few military units which were \ncalled into service during World War II from a specific community and \nwhich can return to that home area for a reunion. Most military units \ninclude individuals whose residences are scattered throughout the \ncountry. Through an Act of Congress in 1916, ROTC programs were \nestablished in higher education institutions across the country. Since \nthat time, they have been an important part of this nation's civil \ndefense--in times of war and peace--training generations of students \nfor service to their country.\n  In the early 1940s, this class trained at the University of Utah with \nhorse-drawn artillery working with an old French 77 millimeter cannon \nand with a 105 millimeter howitzer, new at the time. As a unit, this \nROTC class was first assigned to Camp Roberts in California, for basic \ntraining in truck drawn artillery. Later they were assigned to Fort \nSill, Oklahoma, for further training and ultimately received further \nschooling at the Infantry Officers School at Fort Benning, Georgia. \nAfter graduation from Fort Benning, these young men, whose average age \nat the time was slightly over 20, served as officers in various combat \nunits in Italy, France and the South Pacific.\n  These were brave and honorable men, each one of them. Of the 99 who \nwere called to active duty in 1943, two were killed in action while \nserving in the 10th Mountain Division in Italy. One was later killed in \nthe Korean Conflict. Of the group's original 99 members, 71 are still \nalive. Today, I speak for all Utahns and all Americans when I say, we \nhonor these brave men and pay tribute to them for their service and \nsacrifice for this great country. The Class of 1944's great tradition \nof discipline and leadership continues today as many of its members are \nrespected professionals in the public and private sector as well as \ntheir own communities.\n  I ask that the text of the unit's Activation Orders for March 16, \n1943 be printed in the Record as part of this tribute.\n  And finally, Mr. President, before I close, I want to thank Chris S. \nMetos of Salt Lake City, Utah, for the outstanding job he has done to \nhelp organize this upcoming reunion and for the many years of service \nhe has provided to this country and to the people of the state of Utah.\n  The material follows:\n\n Activation Orders: Headquarters Ninth Service Command, Fort Douglas, \n                          Utah, March 16, 1943\n\n       1.

LOUISE CHASE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mrs. \nLouise Chase, a very special constituent from Horsham, Pennsylvania. A \nNavy veteran during WWII, Mrs. Chase continues to serve her country and \nher community as commander of the American Legion, Pennsylvania \nDepartment.\n  Last summer, Mrs. Chase became the first woman to serve as commander \nof the Pennsylvania Department of the American Legion. She was elected \nat the conclusion of the 79th convention. Such an honor came as no \nsurprise to those who have followed her involvement in the American \nLegion. In 1979, Louise was elected as the Department of Pennsylvania's \nfirst female vice commander. She has twice served as District \nCommander. Her Legion service also includes terms as adjutant of \nPhiladelphia County and the Eastern Judicial Section, two terms as post \ncommander, and 12 years as adjutant of Tioga Post 319. Other positions \nshe has held within the organization include state legislative \nchairman, and chairman of the Select Committee on Economics and \nBenefits. Moreover, she is one of only two Pennsylvania Legionnaires \nwho served on committees of the two National Conventions held in \nPennsylvania.\n  In the business world, Louise proved to be an equally hard-working \nand dedicated employee. She was the controller and office manager of \nPhiladelphia's prestigious Germantown Cricket Club for 13 years. She \nmanaged two high rise apartment buildings. Mrs. Chase was also a \nmanufacturers' representative for paper container companies. Recently, \nshe retired as an international marketing representative of a major \ncomputer manufacturer.\n  Mr. President, Louise Chase has continued her family's tradition of \nservice to the nation, which literally spans from the Civil War to the \nSpace Age. I ask the Senate to join me in extending the Senate's best \nwishes for continued success to Mrs. Chase and her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/27/senate-section/article/S3662-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3662-S3663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1186\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil case \npending in the Superior Court for the State of Arizona. Prior to the \nlitigation, some of the defendants sought assistance from Senator \nMcCain's and Senator Kyl's offices in connection with a child custody \ndispute. The plaintiffs in the ensuing litigation have alleged, among \nother things, that the defendants defamed them in connection with the \ncustody dispute. The plaintiffs have now subpoenaed correspondence from \nthe files of the offices of Senator McCain and Senator Kyl.\n  Senators McCain and Kyl are willing to provide the requested \ncorrespondence to the parties in this case. Accordingly, this \nresolution would authorize Senator McCain's and Senator Kyl's offices \nto produce and authenticate documents in this case, except where a \nprivilege or objection should be asserted. The resolution also would \nauthorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator McCain's and \nSenator Kyl's offices, to protect the Senate's privileges in connection \nwith this matter.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
