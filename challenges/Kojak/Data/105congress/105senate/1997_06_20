Madam President, I was on the floor yesterday speaking \nabout the reconciliation bill. I decided to not go forward with an \namendment today. The amendment that I was considering offering, and the \namendment I offered yesterday to the intelligence bill, speak to the \nissue of tax fairness. But the reconciliation bill will be on the floor \nnext week, and the DOD reauthorization is not going to come up in any \ncase until after the reconciliation bill. So I will wait until next \nweek and then offer amendments directly to the reconciliation bill.\n  Madam President, let me just start out with a piece from the National \nJournal of June 21. The caption is ``Fighting Over Taxes.''\n  I quote:\n\n       In the coming weeks Wall Street will be lobbying in support \n     of all the new tax measures it likes, notably capital gains \n     tax cuts, expansion of IRA's, and trying especially in the \n     Senate to keep unwanted provisions out of the final bill. \n     ``We have to make sure that they are not offered on the floor \n     to pay for some other provisions,'' said Bruce E. Thompson, \n     Jr., the head lobbyist of the Washington office of Merrill \n     Lynch & Co.\n\n  Madam President, I think this is the real question about this tax \nbill that is before us. The question is, who really has say in this \nprocess.\n  Let me just go back to some charts--again, the Department of Treasury \nanalysis.\n  Looking at the House bill, the tax cuts disproportionately help those \nwho need help the least. If you look at the share of tax cuts by family \nincome, the top fifth get almost 70 percent of the benefit of the tax \ncuts, the top fifth. Then the fourth fifth gets 19 percent of the cuts; \nthe third fifth, 9.2 percent; the second fifth, 2.4 percent; the bottom \nfifth, less than 1 percent. In other words, the bottom 40 percent of \nthe population get a total of about 3 percent of the benefits of these \ntax breaks; the third fifth, the middle class, gets about 9.2 percent. \nThen you get to the top fifth, the top 20 percent, they get almost 70 \npercent of the breaks. So you have about 80 percent of the benefits \ngoing to the top 40 percent, and almost\n\n[[Page S6018]]\n\n70 percent of the benefits going to the top fifth. This is just \nunbelievable.\n  Just look at the next chart. This shows the dollar amount that \nfamilies get.\n  Again, the source here is the Department of the Treasury, Office of \nTax Analysis: If you have an income of $400,000 a year, or over, you \nwill get about $7,000 a year in benefits under these tax proposals. \nCongratulations. If you earn $200,000 and up, you are going to get \nabout $3,706. But on the other hand, if you are down here in the \n$30,000 to $40,000 range, you get $152. If you are $15,000 to $30,000, \nyou get about $52. A buck a week.\n  If you look at the tax cuts on the House side, and the way in which \nthey are back loaded because of the capital gains cuts and the IRA's, \nyou are talking about an erosion of revenue to the tune of about $950 \nbillion by the time we get to the year 2017. It is not just the first \n10 years that matters. It is what happens in the second 10 years that \nis tragic. This is not my analysis. It is the Joint Tax Committee and \nthe Center on Budget & Policy Priorities.\n  By the way, Bob Greenstein, who is the director of that Center--\npeople can agree or disagree with some of Bob's views on different \nissues--but his data analysis is impeccable. Bob received the MacArthur \naward, the genius award, for the work he does. And you add to his \nreputation Congress' own Joint Tax Committee.\n  On the one hand, Members of Congress say they are for deficit \nreduction, and then they go forward with this erosion of the revenue \nbase via back-loaded tax cuts. That is bad enough. The second thing \nthat is bad enough, or even worse, is what is going to be the tradeoff. \nWe are going to have more and more people that are going to be 65 years \nof age and over, and more and more people that are 85 years of age and \nover. We will have the pressure of supporting them financially and \ncovering their medical costs, and we will end up either running the \ndeficits back up again, or we will be cutting into what little is left \nby the way of investment and education programs for our children and \nfor our grandchildren.\n  But what makes this really unconscionable is basically we are talking \nabout tax cuts that go to people on the top.\n  Let me quote a Washington Times headline from today: from Speaker \nGingrich--``Gingrich Derides Democrats' Tax Cut Proposal As Welfare.''\n  This is unbelievable. What the Speaker is worried about is that \nDemocrats--I hope--are going to be on the floor of the Senate next \nweek, and in the House, focusing on the welfare of working families.\n  Let's not have a play on words here. This is not a debate about \nwelfare policy. This is a debate about the welfare of working families \nand their children. That is not rhetoric. That is what this is all \nabout.\n  So, Madam President, I will suggest to you--and we will see what \nhappens next week--that people in the country are going to be sorely \ndisappointed and people in the country are just going to shake their \nheads in disbelief. And people in cafes in Minnesota and Maine, when \nthey finally get a look at who is really going to get the benefits, are \ngoing to say, ``Wait a minute. We thought you were talking about tax \ncuts for our hard-pressed families.'' And they are going to find out \nthat is not the case at all.\n  Apparently, we made some progress in the Finance Committee last \nnight, at least for some of the people who are in the $20,000 to \n$25,000 range who weren't going to be getting any child care credit \nbecause they received earned income tax credit. These are working poor \npeople. At least now they're not going to be a 100-percent offset, and \nsome of these families are going to be able to get some child care \ncredits.\n  But, Madam President, this still begs the question as to why in the \nworld giving these families a benefit is even controversial. Don't we \nwant to make sure that working families' children also get benefits? \nDon't we want to make sure that these tax cuts are not tilted and \nskewed toward the very top--the top fifth--of the population that gets \nthe lion's share of all the benefits? Don't we want to target precious \ndollars toward middle-income people and toward working families?\n  That is not what this legislation is all about. That is not what \nthese tax cuts are all about. That is not what is going to be reported \nout on the floor of the Senate.\n  Madam President, I just want to mention one other area that I know is \nnear and dear to the Presiding Officer's heart. That is higher \neducation. I want to be critical of Democrats and Republicans on this. \nI still say that we are making a mistake here by underreaching. If we \nare going to say that we are concerned about higher education not being \naffordable, and we are going to claim to focus on getting support for \nthe people who need it most, how can we talk about tax credits that are \nnot refundable? Nonrefundable HOPE tax credits mean that many of these \nfamilies with incomes of $20,000 to $25,000 a year are not going to get \nanything because they don't have any tax liability. That is why the \nPell grant is a far better way of getting help to the people who need \nit. The IRA's are great if you can afford to put the money in savings. \nWe already have the tax incentives for working families to do that. \nThey can't do any more.\n\n  The problem for many people is they still struggle very hard to earn \na decent living and to raise their children successfully. To raise your \nchildren successfully means to try to be able to send your kids to \ncollege or to a university. But so many struggling families just don't \nhave any money to put into savings.\n  So let's just not fool anybody here. We don't have, really, anything \nthat I see in this tax cut, in this reconciliation bill, that as a \nmatter of fact is going to make higher education affordable for those \nfamilies that have had the most difficult time. We have had a flat 8 \npercent graduation rate for families with incomes under $20,000 a year \nsince about 1979. That is scandalous. We ought to be making sure that \nthose families are part of the American dream as well, and we ought to \nreach well into the $20,000 and $30,000 range of hard-pressed, middle-\nincome working families. We are not doing that. The President's \nproposal does not do that and certainly the alternatives we have here \ndo not represent a step forward. They represent a great leap backwards.\n  Madam President, let me just finish up with a kind of appeal --I will \nhave amendments next week which will be very specific, and we will have \nup or down votes on them--but right now, I want to make just a broad \nappeal. I am grateful for whatever improvements have been made in the \nFinance Committee. I thank all my colleagues for their work. They have \nmade some improvements. However, like my good friend Jim Hightower \nlikes to say, you can put an earring on a hog, but you still can't hide \nthe ugliness. A couple of earrings don't make a hog beautiful. You can \nput a couple of earrings on this tax cut, this reconciliation bill, but \nyou can't make it beautiful; you cannot hide the ugliness.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I have 3 more minutes to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. When you have a tax cut bill, a reconciliation bill \nthat gives the vast majority of the benefits to those people at the \nvery top and gives middle-income and working families the shaft, you \ndon't have justice. You don't have a bill that represents expanding \nopportunities. And, as I said, fix it up, do your best, but, again, you \ncan put an earring on a hog, but that won't hide the ugliness. You are \nnot going to be able to hide it from people in the country.\n  Next week we are going to have one heck of a debate. My appeal is \nthat we work together here in this body. But my appeal also is to the \nPresident: I hope you will hold the line. During the last campaign the \nPresident talked about economic fairness. Boy, if there ever was a \nplace to draw the line and have a debate, it is here. To Democrats, my \ncolleagues, I hope you will come out here with an alternative. I hope \nwe will be united behind it, and I hope we will stay strong. Because \nthis piece of legislation is the exact opposite of what most folks mean \nby fairness. It is no wonder that most people in the country think \nthere has been a hostile takeover of the government process. They know \nwho has been in there lobbying, they know who is going to get the vast \nmajority of the benefits, and they can see that it does not have a \nwhole lot to do with them. That\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\nis the disconnect in American politics today. This reconciliation bill, \nthis tax cut, represents a huge disconnect to middle-income and working \nfamilies. It is an outrage.\n  Let me just conclude by asking unanimous consent that a Wednesday, \nJune 18, piece, ``Rising College Costs Imperil the Nation, Blunt Report \nSays,'' from the New York Times and a Washington Post piece, June 18, \n``Colleges' Failure to Resolve Funding May Bar Millions from Attending, \nStudy Finds,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 18, 1997]\n\n       Rising College Costs Imperil the Nation, Blunt Report Says\n\n                          (By Peter Applebome)\n\n       The nation's colleges and universities need to cut costs \n     dramatically or face a shortfall of funds that will \n     increasingly shut out the poor from higher education and from \n     economic opportunity as well, according to a blunt and far-\n     ranging assessment of American higher education that was made \n     public yesterday.\n       The report, by a panel of public and private university \n     officials and corporate executives, says that rising costs, \n     falling public spending and a coming surge in demand are \n     making the economics of American higher education \n     increasingly unsupportable.\n       If current enrollment, spending and financing trends \n     continue, the report said, higher education will fall $38 \n     billion short of what it needs to serve the expected student \n     population in 2015. To sustain current spending, it said, \n     tuition would have to double by 2015, effectively shutting \n     off higher education to half of those who would want to \n     pursue it.\n       The report focuses on one of the great unspoken dilemmas in \n     President Clinton's push to make at least two years of \n     college as common as a high school diploma: higher education \n     is expensive, students pay only a small share of their costs \n     and, while bringing increasing numbers of low-income students \n     into higher education will have long-term economic benefits, \n     it will also have enormous short-term economic costs.\n       On the other hand, the report said, with education \n     increasingly crucial to economic advancement, cutting off \n     access to education--particularly to the poor and to \n     immigrant groups who increasingly dominate the student \n     population of states like California, Florida, New York and \n     Texas--would have enormous consequences for the nation's \n     social fabric.\n       The report, ``Breaking the Social Contract: The Fiscal \n     Crisis in Higher Education,'' calls for a radical \n     restructuring of universities, including an effort to \n     overhaul university governance to limit the power of \n     individual departments, redefining and often reducing the \n     ambitions of different institutions and a sharing of \n     resources between institutions.\n       The report also calls for more public financing, but it \n     stresses that changes in the system should be prerequisites \n     to any increases.\n       ``The facts are irrefutable,'' said Thomas Kean, the former \n     New Jersey Governor who is now president of Drew University \n     and is a co-chairman of the panel that wrote the report. ``We \n     are heading for a crisis at the very time we can least afford \n     one.''\n       The panel, the Commission on National Investment in Higher \n     Education, is made up of academic and business leaders \n     convened by the Council for Aid to Education, an independent \n     subsidiary of the Rand Corporation.\n       Experts say that higher education is already being reshaped \n     by such forces as technology or competition from for-profit \n     institutions, so that a straight-line extrapolation from \n     current economic figures is difficult. And higher education \n     is such a varied enterprise in the United States that a \n     crisis for a public college in California does not \n     necessarily mean a crisis for Harvard or Princeton.\n       Still, Roger Benjamin, president of the Council for Aid to \n     Education, notes that even rich universities like Yale and \n     Stanford have faced deficits and retrenchment in recent \n     years.\n       And officials in state systems, which educate the majority \n     of Americans, say the gap between resources and costs in \n     higher education is becoming ever more daunting.\n       Charles Reed, chancellor of the State University System of \n     Florida, said that over the next 10 years Florida would face \n     a 50 percent increase in students at its public four-year \n     institutions, to 300,000 from 210,000.\n       Barry Munitz, chancellor of the California State University \n     System, said California was midway through a half-century of \n     population growth and demographic change that would see the \n     number of children in kindergarten through the 12th grade \n     almost double, to about eight million, and go from about 75 \n     percent white in 1970 to about 75 percent minority in 2020.\n       Population growth will only accelerate the financial \n     problems facing higher education, the report said. It noted \n     that the index measuring the increases in the price paid by \n     colleges and universities for goods and services, like \n     faculty salaries, rose more than sixfold from 1961 to 1995. \n     The annual rate of growth in the cost of providing higher \n     education exceeded the Consumer price Index by more than a \n     percentage point from 1980 to 1995, the report said.\n       And, while costs have gone up, public support has not. \n     Since 1976, public support per student has just kept up with \n     inflation, while real costs per student have grown by about \n     40 percent, the report said.\n       To make up the difference, tuition has risen dramatically, \n     with tuition and fees doubling from 1976 to 1994. But the \n     report said that a similar doubling between now and \n     2015 would have a catastrophic effect on access, pricing \n     as many as 6.7 million students out of higher education.\n       ``If you were to announce that, given fiscal pressures, the \n     door to social mobility that was good enough for the old \n     generation is really no longer needed by the new one, you \n     might as well stick a ticking bomb inside the social fabric \n     of this country,'' Chancellor Munitz said.\n       While calling for more public support, the report said that \n     a solution with colleges and universities themselves.\n       ``Given the magnitude of the deficit facing American \n     colleges and universities, it is surprising that these \n     institutions have not taken more serious steps to increase \n     productivity without sacrificing quality,'' the report said.\n       The report's recommendations for restructuring--from \n     sharing a library with other institutions to eliminating weak \n     programs--are not new, but there are enormous political and \n     institutional barriers in the way of a major economic \n     overhaul of higher education. Still, some experts say \n     institutions have no option but to find ways to operate more \n     efficiently.\n       ``The ability to maximize revenue, given the competitive \n     pressures for state dollars on the one hand and the \n     resistance to future increases in tuition on the other, has \n     about run its course,'' said Stanley Ikenberry, president of \n     the American Council on Education, a leading advocacy group, \n     which was not involved in the report. ``All of that's putting \n     more and more pressure on the operating side of the budget.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 18, 1997]\n\n Colleges' Failure To Resolve Funding May Bar Millions From Attending \n                              Study Finds\n\n                           (By Rene Sanchez)\n\n       A new report on the nation's universities warns that the \n     pressures of growing enrollment, rising tuition, and \n     declining funding have put campuses on a dangerous financial \n     course and threaten to exclude many students from higher \n     education.\n       The report, by the Rand Corp., draws a bleak portrait of \n     the financial problems facing universities and suggests that \n     many of them are ``floundering'' in their attempts to solve \n     those problems.\n       Thomas Kean, a former governor of New Jersey who helped \n     lead the study, said that if current campus trends in funding \n     and enrollment continue into the next century ``millions of \n     Americans will be denied the opportunity to go to college.''\n       The report concludes that neither public nor private \n     support of colleges is keeping pace with campus costs or \n     student enrollment. The report projects that by 2015, the \n     number of full-time college students will swell to 13 \n     million, about 3 million more than now.\n       That growth, spurred largely by the increasing necessity of \n     a college degree in the nation's labor market, is occurring \n     as college tuition costs are continuing to outpace inflation. \n     Nationally, average college tuition per student, adjusted for \n     inflation, has nearly doubled in the past 20 years, the \n     report concludes.\n       If that pattern were to continue for another 20 years, the \n     report asserts, more than 6 million students ``will be priced \n     out of the system.''\n       Higher education officials said yesterday that the long-\n     term analysis of colleges presented in the report appears to \n     be sound.\n       ``It defines the problems well, and speaks candidly about \n     what states and institutions have to do to try to solve \n     them,'' said Stanley Ikenberry, president of the American \n     Council on Education, a Washington group that represents more \n     than 1,300 colleges and universities.\n       Leaders of the study faulted both the federal government \n     and, in particular, states for not making stronger financial \n     commitments to higher education. But they also stressed that \n     the management habits of colleges are a substantial part of \n     the problem.\n       The report sharply criticizes the way many colleges manage \n     their money, arguing that the financial decisions they make \n     are often ``cumbersome and even dysfunctional in an \n     environment of scarce resources.''

Madam President, the Republic of Egypt has been an \noutstanding leader in the Arab world in bringing an historic \nreconciliation between the state of Israel and its neighbors, including \nthe Palestinians. Egyptian leaders, including President Sadat as well \nas the present leader, President Mubarak, have dedicated substantial \nenergy toward such a reconciliation. There has been constant, difficult \nopposition to this process in the region. President Sadat's tireless \nand courageous dedication to peace in the Middle East cost him his \nlife. He paid the supreme sacrifice at the hands of an assassin. And he \nleft a lasting legacy in fashioning the Camp David Accords together \nwith Prime Minister Begin of Israel, through the good offices of \nPresident Jimmy Carter.\n  In the Middle East it has always taken three to tango. Advancing the \nprocess of making peace has required the dedication of the leaders of \nall three countries, Israel, Egypt and the United States. What is so \ndangerous about the current period is the apparent flagging of this \ndedication on the part of the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu, \nwhich has promoted the construction of new, and entirely unnecessary \nJewish settlements in Arab portions of Jerusalem, a development sure to \nengender violence and the disruption of the peace process. Indeed, as I \nhave said before on this floor, it was just when there appeared to be \nhopeful momentum toward resolving the outstanding issues between Israel \nand her neighbors that the right wing in Israeli politics initiated \nsettlement construction activities and pulled the rug out from under \nthis momentum. Unfortunately, attempts by President Clinton to revive \nthis process were less than successful, in part, because of deep \ninconsistencies in the approach of the United States which appeared \nonly half-heartedly--only halfheartedly--to protest the settlement \nconstruction activity on the part of the Netanyahu government. \nUnfortunately, the United States vetoed United Nations Security Council \nResolutions protesting the settlement construction, which has, in \neffect, taken the United States out of the strong intermediary role \nthat it needs to play for lasting progress to be made.\n  It was precisely at this point--with the Israeli right acting to put \nthe brakes on the peace process, and only a perfunctory attempt, only a \nhalf-hearted attempt by the United States Administration to revive the \npeace process--that Egypt has stepped in again to use its influence to \ninfuse new energy into the complicated dance steps of the Middle East \npeace process. President Mubarak arranged for meetings last month at \nSharm el-Shiek between Palestinian and Israeli leaders and has shown \nhimself to be in the Egyptian tradition in exercising courage and \ncreativity to bring the parties together again. Indeed, President \nMubarak has assigned a key aide to act as a troubleshooter and \nintermediary between the Israelis and Palestinians, and has sponsored \nan ongoing dialogue which has been praised by U.S. and Israeli \nofficials alike. This Egyptian initiative, in fact, appears to be the \nonly game in town at this time.\n  So I think it is very unfortunate that just at the time when Egypt is \nplaying this central and responsible role, the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee has chosen to take the \nextraordinarily unfair and puzzling step of removing the earmark of \nfunds in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for Egypt, while at \nthe same time preserving the earmark for Israel. As my colleagues are \naware, those earmarks have been the practice ever since the Camp David \nAccords, the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, were signed in \n1979.\n  I was at the signing, and I had had the pleasure and the privilege of \ntalking with President Sadat, the President of Egypt, in 1978, in \nEgypt. A courageous man, President Sadat, was leader in breaking the \nice, and thus giving peace a chance, a chance in the Middle East.\n  So, the subcommittee action, now, sends precisely the wrong signal to \nthe Egyptians, whose assassinated leader was the pioneer in this peace \nprocess, who gave his life that there might be peace in the Middle \nEast.\n  Egypt should be commended for its diplomatic actions vis-a-vis the \nPalestinians and Israelis, not seemingly punished for her courage. Is \nIsrael to be symbolically rewarded for the unnecessary and provocative \naction it has taken in building entirely unnecessary housing \nsettlements in sensitive Arab lands? To add insult to this injury, the \nsubcommittee has also taken the controversial step of approving $250 \nmillion for Jordan out of what is understood to be Egypt's account in \nthe bill. While I certainly do not take issue with rewarding Jordan and \nKing Hussein for signing the 1994 peace treaty with Israel and for \nhelping on the matter of Israeli partial withdrawal from the West Bank \ncity of Hebron earlier this year, it is far preferable and much more \nfair that the money for Jordan come equally from both Egypt's and \nIsraeli's earmarks.\n  Madam President, I do not agree with the concept of earmarks of the \nvery large magnitude that we have been making for both Israel and \nEgypt.\n  In my view, too much money goes to both nations--too much money. For \nyears, this has been considered as something that was due them.\n  I think such a foreign entitlement program should eventually be \nphased out and eliminated. But if we are going to give such earmarks as \na tool of American diplomacy and foreign policy, at the very least they \nmust fairly reflect this Nation's goals.\n  These earmarks have been looked upon virtually as entitlements by \nboth nations, Egypt and Israel. And while we in this Chamber struggle \nannually over the budget deficits in attempts to get them under \ncontrol, while we cut discretionary spending for America, for the \nAmerican people, while both the administration and the Republican \nregime on Capitol Hill continue to reduce discretionary spending, \ndiscretionary caps, and to ratchet down the spending for programs and \nprojects beneficial to the American people, the taxpayers of this \ncountry, and help to build infrastructure in this country, all kinds of \nquestions are asked and the game of one-upmanship is played as to who \ncan cut the most.\n  I am an admirer and supporter of Israel. But are there any questions \nasked when it comes to funding programs in Israel? Are there any \nquestions asked when it comes to this being looked upon as an \nentitlement figure for Israel and Egypt? No questions asked.\n  Are the American taxpayers fully aware that Congress and the \nAdministration, every year, without any questions asked--no questions \nasked--provide $3 billion to Israel and $2 billion to Egypt, no \nquestions asked, while we cut funding for water projects, sewage \nprojects, highways, harbors, bridges, education, health, law \nenforcement, and Indian programs? We cut those programs. But no \nquestions are asked when it comes to this entitlement of $3 billion \nannually for Israel and $2 billion annually for Egypt.\n  I am against those earmarks, but if we are going to have them, at \nleast they must fairly reflect the Nation's goals.\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\n  What has been done as of yesterday on this matter by the subcommittee \nis flagrantly unfair and does a disservice to Egypt, to the United \nStates, as well, and to our national interests in the basic process of \nmaking peace in the Middle East. I strongly oppose this action, and I \nhope that it can be corrected when the bill gets to the full \nAppropriations Committee next week, and if it isn't corrected there, \nthen the attempt will be made at least to correct it on this floor. The \naction has not gone unnoticed.\n  The Ambassador from Egypt and I have discussed this matter. He came \nto my office a couple of days ago, and then we have been in discussions \nsince on the telephone. I received a thoughtful letter from him which I \nmay wish to share with my colleagues. The Ambassador is disappointed \nand perplexed by the subcommittee action, as am I, and as true friends \nshould be, true friends of Israel and Egypt should be. I hope it can be \ncorrected before even more damage is done.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me, this \ndate, from the Honorable Ahmed Maher El Sayed, the Egyptian Ambassador, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    Embassy of the\n\n\n                                       Arab Republic of Egypt,\n\n                                                    June 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: It was, as usual, an intellectual \n     delight to talk to you last Wednesday to share with you the \n     lessons of wisdom from the Bible and ancient Greece, and \n     their meaning in the present circumstances. I particularly \n     appreciate your giving me so much time, in a very busy \n     schedule, so that I may appreciate again your sense of \n     objectivity and fairness, as well as your deep insight of \n     things.\n       Unfortunately, action was taken by the Foreign Operations \n     Subcommittee to strike the earmark for assistance to Egypt, \n     while keeping it for Israel.\n       While I know your general position regarding the aid \n     program to Egypt and Israel, I also know that your sense of \n     fairness would not support treating Egypt in such a \n     discriminatory manner.\n       I would also like to set the record straight concerning \n     Egypt's position in response to certain allegations which \n     were made:\n       1. The non-attendance by President Mubarak, of the summit \n     held in Washington last September was based on his assessment \n     that Prime Minister Netanyahu was not ready, at this meeting, \n     to take steps conducive to the advancement of the cause of \n     peace. President Clinton clearly understood the motives of \n     President Mubarak, and King Hussein of Jordan was quoted, \n     after the meeting, as saying that in, hindsight, President \n     Mubarak was justified in not attending.\n       2. The role of Egypt in reaching an agreement on Hebron was \n     crucial. It was an Egyptian proposal which constituted the \n     basis of the agreement. The Jordanian officials have \n     recognized publicly that their proposal which led to the \n     agreement is built on an Egyptian suggestion of a \n     compromise. The American Peace Team recognized the \n     Egyptian vital contribution to the solution.\n       3. Egypt did not lead an effort to reimpose the boycott on \n     Israel. What happened is that at a regular meeting of the \n     Arab League at its seat in Cairo, a unanimous decision was \n     taken to revise steps taken toward normalization with Israel \n     if it persisted in policies clearly contradicting its \n     obligations. The resolution did not include countries bound \n     by Treaties with Israel, i.e. Egypt and Jordan.\n       4. Relations between Egypt and Israel are normal, which \n     does require neither subscribing by one party to the policies \n     of the other, nor mandatory trade and travel. There exists on \n     our part no restriction on trade and travel to Isreal, and \n     far from stagnating, the two fields have seen in the last \n     years, significant progress. A warm relation is one that is \n     built through the years given the right circumstances; what \n     is required, and in existence, are normal relations. It is \n     not an unusual state of affairs that relations between \n     countries fluctuate with the acuity of political problems. \n     Egypt and Israel are bound by 16 agreements and protocols \n     which have been implemented or being normally implemented.\n       5. I would like to remind you that Egypt out of its deep \n     commitment to peace in the region, has embarked on a major \n     effort to create conditions to bring the Palestinians and the \n     Israelis back to the negotiating table. President Mubarak is \n     personally involved in this effort. He has met with Prime \n     Minister Netanyahu in Sharm El Sheikh, and since then \n     contacts have been maintained both with the Israelis and \n     Palestinians.\n       6. Our ties with Libya are normal relations between \n     neighbors in the context of the respect of UN Resolutions. \n     Our influence has been a moderating one.\n       All these points have been clearly explained by President \n     Mubarak to distinguished members of Congress he met on \n     various occasions, and thereofre, I do not believe that there \n     is any justification in raising from the dead arguments and \n     misrepresentations that had been laid to rest by the reality \n     as recognized by most Egypt has been and continues to be a \n     pioneer of peace, an anchor of stability in the Middle East, \n     and a fierce defendant of the rule of law and legitimacy for \n     which we fought side by side. Without its contribution and \n     its courageous stands, as well as its cooperation with the \n     US, it would not be envisageable to move towards achieving \n     our common goals of peace and prosperity, and overcome the \n     hurdles which Egypt is working very hard to overcome.\n       Best and warm regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Ahmed Maher El Saved.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 420\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I inquire of the business now before the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on the Cochran \namendment No. 420.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise this morning to strongly oppose \nthe amendment by my colleague and friend from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, \nfirst for jurisdictional reasons, and most importantly because it is a \nseriously, I believe, flawed policy.\n  As chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of the Senate \nBanking Committee, I object to the consideration of this matter, since \nit is within the jurisdiction of my subcommittee and the Committee on \nBanking. This is a very controversial issue and it should be heard and \ndebated in the normal congressional process, by the proper committee of \njurisdiction, not by a floor amendment with little opportunity for \nopponents to be heard. Many Members of this body may have already \nreturned to their States and will not even have the opportunity to \nlisten to the debate today.\n  The Senate has not had an opportunity to have a full debate on export \ncontrols in the last few years. Members need the benefit of time to \nfully analyze changes in an area that can have such a negative impact \non U.S. companies and on U.S. jobs.\n  What really concerns me, Madam President, is that this amendment \nturns back the clock on technology. This amendment indicates it is \ndirected at supercomputers, but computers at the 2,000-7,000 MTOPS \nlevel are not supercomputers, a point I will discuss later. The \namendment reverses 2 years of effort to decontrol computers that are \ngenerally available. You will hear all sorts of talk today about how \nthis amendment improves national security. But it does not. If the goal \nis to stop the sale of high performance computers to questionable end \nusers in Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and Israel, it will stop the \nsale of United States computers to those end users--but it will not \nstop our allies from making those sales.\n  It is true that there are two companies currently under investigation \nfor alleged sale without license to a questionable end user. Those \ninvestigations are still pending and should be pursued, so it seems \npremature to, in effect, have the Congress find them guilty. Let us let \nthe process work. If they are guilty, they will be penalized. The U.S. \ncompanies selling computers abroad at this level are few; they are \nreputable and they do care about selling to questionable end users. The \ninvestigations have also had a positive effect in that they have \nencouraged companies to seek more validated licenses for uncertain end \nusers. I disagree with my colleagues who believe businesses care only \nabout the almighty dollar, and not national security.\n  This amendment will bring us back to the cold war days when export \ncontrols were required for computers sold in drug stores. A computer at \n2,000 MTOPS, which is the level we would control, is a low-end work \nstation which is widely available all over the world. We would \nestablish unilateral controls on any computer over this capability. Our \ncompanies would have to\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\nobtain a validated license. Their competitors in other nations would \nnot have that requirement. Therefore, European and Japanese companies \nwould have a competitive edge in many, many computer sales in countries \nwhere it is important to establish a foothold as a reliable supplier to \nfacilitate future sales. Licenses would be required for every sale \nabove this limit, not just those to questionable end users. We want to \nexpand markets in those countries, while protecting our national \nsecurity interests, rather than handing them on a silver platter to our \ntrading partners who will then be seen as reliable suppliers in the \nfuture.\n  I know the argument will be that it is not hard to get an export \nlicense and that there are statutory deadlines on agency review of \nlicense applications. I can give you quite a list of companies--many of \nthem smaller companies--which have come close to shutting down due to \nexport license delays, even in recent years. We cannot return to this \nuncertainty and bureaucratic maze. Even the larger companies will see \ntheir expenses increase as they will have to hire more high-priced \nattorneys to facilitate many of the licenses through the process. \nExport licenses to these countries do not get approved in a couple of \nmonths. Many of them take many months and earn the U.S. the designation \nas an unreliable supplier. While we are pursuing regulatory reform in \nmany areas, what we are doing here is reimposing regulations we \neliminated 2 years ago.\n  What is curious to me is an independent study commissioned in 1995 \nfor the Departments of Commerce and Defense which determined that \ncomputers could be decontrolled to the 7,000 MTOPS level without a \nnegative impact on national security. The Departments of State, \nDefense, Commerce, the intelligence agencies, and ACDA all signed off \non this report, and the decontrol was made at that time to 7,000 MTOPS. \nThe determination was made because the 2,000-7,000 range, again, Madam \nPresident, was widely available throughout the world.\n  But you have also heard that we are stopping the sale of \nsupercomputers to tier 3 countries without a license. Again. Madam \nPresident, a 7,000 MTOPS computer is not a supercomputer. \nSupercomputers still need export licenses. I am told that the MTOPS for \na supercomputer is in the 20,000 range and can go up to one million \nMTOPS--a far cry from 7,000.\n  Let's look at the level the amendment seeks to control--2,000 MTOPS. \nThis is a low-level work station computer. By 1998, personal computers \nwill reach this level. Also, the alpha chip available next year will be \n1,000 MTOPS itself. So just two of those in a computer would qualify \nthe computer for an export license. It is very difficult for me to \njustify that companies will have to jump through so many hoops just to \nsell fairly low-level computers. We are truly turning back the clock on \ntechnology.\n  I have previously made the point that we are stabbing ourselves in \nthe foot, since computer companies in other countries do not have these \ncontrols, and therefore our efforts are futile to say the least. There \nare four European companies which sell computers in the 2,000-7,000 \nrange as well as Japanese companies. We all know that they will be \neager to make these sales.\n  What is really ironic is that the Chinese themselves have now \nproduced a computer at the 13,000 MTOPS level. They have surpassed the \n7,000 current limit the sponsor of this amendment is trying to roll \nback.\n  One argument I have heard is that Japan also requires validated \nlicenses for its sales. Yes, that is true, but Japan's validated \nlicense system has always been a rubber stamp operation. The entire \nprocess takes 24 hours, if that. Ours can take months. And I can show \nyou some unhappy constituents who can verify that.\n  Another question I have is whether it is good policy to codify export \ncontrols at certain levels rather than leaving them to regulation. Do \nwe really want to be in a position to have to change the law each time \nwe need to decontrol? Is the Congress really able to act as quickly and \nas often as needed to adjust to rapidly changing technology? I think \nnot.\n  Madam President, I plan to send a second degree amendment to the \namendment by my colleague from Mississippi and in a moment will ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  But I again want to mention that this amendment would request the GAO \nto perform a study of the national security risks that would be \ninvolved with sales of computers in the 2,000-7,000 MTOPS range to \nmilitary or nuclear end users in tier 3 countries. It would also \nanalyze the foreign availability issue to determine whether controls at \n2,000 MTOPS and above would make any sense.\n  Further, the amendment would require the Department of Commerce to \npublish in the Federal Register a list of end users which would require \nthe filing of a validated license application, except when there is an \nadministration finding that such publication would jeopardize sources \nand methods.\n  Madam President, this is a sincere compromise in my position as \nsubcommittee chairman of the committee of jurisdiction over this issue, \nwhich will help us decide whether there is a need to recontrol at the \n2,000 level. It is far too controversial to decide this question today, \nor by next Tuesday when we will vote.\n  I believe Commerce should be asked to publish this list and to \nfurther seek ways to work with computer companies to determine whether \nother end users are questionable in order to alleviate some of the \nuncertainty that is out there.\n  Madam President, let us not turn back the clock on technology. Let us \nmake a rational national security decision that also take into account \nthe best interests of our exporters--and the jobs that they represent.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 422 To Amendment No. 420\n\n (Purpose: To require the Comptroller General of the United States to \nconduct a study on the availability and potential risks relating to the \n                       sale of certain computers)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. So, Madam President, I send my second-degree amendment to \nthe desk, and ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 422 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . GAO STUDY ON CERTAIN COMPUTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall conduct a study of the national security risks \n     relating to the sale of computers with composite theoretical \n     performance of between 2,000 and 7,000 million theoretical \n     operations per second to end-users in Tier 3 countries. The \n     study shall also analyze any foreign availability of \n     computers described in the preceding sentence and the impact \n     of such sales on United States exporters.\n       (b) Publication of End-User List.--The Secretary of \n     Commerce shall publish in the Federal Register a list of \n     military and nuclear end-users of the computers described in \n     subsection (a), except any end-user with respect to whom \n     there is an administrative finding that such publication \n     would jeopardize the user's sources and methods.\n       (c) End-User Assistance to Exporters.--The Secretary of \n     Commerce shall establish a procedure by which exporters may \n     seek information on questionable end-users.\n       (d) Definition of Tier 3 Country.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``Tier 3 country'' has the meaning given \n     such term in section 740.7 of title 15, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second for the Senator's \nrequest for a rollcall vote?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the comments \nof my good friend from Minnesota in support of his second-degree \namendment. I must say that the language of the amendment is appealing \nin some respects, particularly the suggestion that the General \nAccounting Office ought to be asked to conduct a review of this \nsituation and the apparent risk to our national security caused by the \nexport policies of this administration with respect to the sale of \nsupercomputers and its technology to foreign purchasers.\n  There is some question in my mind about the efficacy of the last part \nof\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\nthe amendment particularly, because in our hearings in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee the administration officials talked about the fact \nthat the reason they did not publish and make available a list of end \nusers or potential purchasers of these computers at this time was \nbecause of diplomatic considerations and the questions about whether it \nputs in jeopardy our intelligence-gathering capabilities and a number \nof other issues that concerned them enough so that they do not now make \navailable this list even privately to exporters of supercomputers.\n  So to require them to publish it in the Federal Register and to make \nit available to the general public is probably something that ought to \nbe reconsidered and not approved by the Senate. They should not be \ncompelled to do that. It seems to me that the reasons they gave in our \nhearing for not doing it even privately was enough and sufficient in my \nmind to raise questions about whether we should compel them to do it \npublicly.\n  But looking back at the earlier complaints and the comments from my \nfriend about the Cochran-Durbin amendment, let me say that this is not \nan effort on our part to roll back regulatory policy with respect to \nmilitary end users. It is an effort to change the procedures and to put \nthe onus and the responsibility for determining whether a sale is \npermissible or consistent with national security concerns on the \nadministration rather than on the sellers of the computers.\n\n  Computer companies do not have the capacity to make determinations on \ntheir own about the use to which the computers they are selling in the \ninternational market will be put, or the relationships between \nprospective purchasers and governments, particularly in the case of \nChina or Russia. The U.S. Government, though, has the capacity, through \nits contacts worldwide, to do a much more reliable and accurate job of \nassessing whether or not someone would be a purchaser who would use \nthese computers to enhance the lethalness of nuclear weapons or missile \ntechnology to put our own citizens at risk, the lives of Americans at \nrisk, in a way that they would not otherwise be, but for the sale of \nour computer technology.\n  So it is for that reason and that reason alone not to prevent the \nsale to legitimate purchasers who will use it for civilian or other \nappropriate purposes. It is in those situations where there is very \nreal concern based on knowledge that we have about the potential \nharmful use--harmful to our own interests--that we ought to have the \npower, we ought to have the process reserved to the Federal Government \nto prohibit that sale in those selected situations.\n  Right now the policy of our Government is to prohibit the sale of \nthis category of computers if it is for the purpose of being used for a \nmilitary use or sold to a military organization. It is prohibited under \ncurrent law, under current regulations. So the suggestion that the \nSenator makes that we are imposing new restraint on trade in this \namendment is not true insofar as it concerns the sales for military \npurposes.\n  Current policy simply says to the exporters, if you know it is going \nto be used by a military organization, you cannot sell it--2,000 to \n7,000 MTOPS speed computers cannot be sold under current U.S. law and \nunder current regulations. So this amendment that we are offering does \nnot impose a new definition that restrains the sale of computers. It \nsimply says that the Commerce Department is going to give you the OK. \nOnce you tell us who you will sell it to, they will tell you whether it \nis permissible or not. That is all we are saying.\n  The current policy is it is up to the exporter to decide whether this \nis a military end use or an end user. If they sell it to someone they \nknew was a military end user, they violate the law right now. The \nproblem is a lot of exporters, the people in the business of \nmanufacturing and marketing supercomputers, do not have the capacity to \nmake this determination.\n  Also, there are motivations that are different. They are in the \nbusiness of making money. They are in the business of selling as many \nas they can. The stockholders of these companies want to see sales go \nup, and so when there is a close question--we are not questioning \nanybody's motives here today--but where there is a close question and \nyou really do not know for sure, the temptation is to go on and make \nthe sale, particularly if there is really no hard evidence there.\n  Now, there have already been those cases where there is enough \nevidence that people have sold computers to end users who are military \norganizations or who are involved in nuclear weapons programs, that \nthey are now under investigations by a Federal grand jury. This is \nserious business. That could have been prohibited, maybe, if you had \nthe Commerce Department saying, ``OK, it is fine, go ahead and make \nthis sale. Here is your license.'' Then the civilian marketer is off \nthe hook. The Commerce Department makes the decision. That is the \nissue.\n  Do we leave it up to the honor system that has been developed by the \nClinton administration, which is not working--46, we thought it was 46, \nbut it turned out to be 47 as a result of the hearing we held of new \ninformation of these computers that are in the hands of Chinese \nentities and we do not know what they are being used for. Or if our \nGovernment knows, they cannot tell us in a public hearing session. We \nhave to go behind closed doors to find out what they really know.\n  From what we can talk about right now, we know that this policy ought \nto be changed, and for the business of ``this is not the right place, \nthis is not the right time,'' and the jurisdictional question--well, \nthe Commerce Department has jurisdiction over commerce issues, the \nBanking Committee has some jurisdiction, our Governmental Affairs \nCommittee has jurisdiction over compliance with nonproliferation treaty \nprovisions. We are constantly monitoring the question of proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction in our committee, and we came upon this \ninformation through the exercise of our oversight responsibilities.\n  It is a matter of some urgency, in our view, that this matter be \naddressed, and we think the U.S. Senate will agree with that. I think \nwe have suggested a very modest but a very necessary first step in the \nprocess of reform of our policies over exporting computers. This \nadministration came into office having made a promise to the computer \nindustry that they were going to make some dramatic changes in the \nrules so that they could sell more computers in the international \nmarketplace. That is fine. That is fine. But they have adopted a policy \nthat is not working. It is not working to protect our national security \ninterests, which is important. It is working in that it has helped sell \na lot more computers and a lot of people have gotten rich under this \nnew policy. I do not have a problem with that. No complaints are being \nmade about that. But it was supposed to be a policy that both enhanced \nour ability to compete in the international computer market but at the \nsame time protected our national security interests. It worked on the \none hand, but it has failed on the other.\n\n  We now see the Atomic Energy Minister in Russia, whose name is \nMikhailov, bragging in a public forum about the new supercomputer \ntechnology they have bought from the United States that is 10 times \nmore powerful and sophisticated than anything they have had before. \nThis agency is in the business of modernizing the nuclear weapons that \nthe Russians have.\n  We have this Nunn-Lugar builddown program supposedly trying to \ndismantle these weapons of mass destruction, and we are very actively \ninvolved with the Russians in that regard. But at the same time, to be \nselling them the technology to make the weapons, they are more \naccurate, more lethal, capable of destroying potential adversaries like \nthe United States, it seems we are working at cross-purposes with \nourselves. We are trying to work to keep down the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, and here we are, in this instance, \ncontributing to the proliferation of more lethal nuclear weapon \nsystems. Certainly that is true in the case of Russia and China. We \nknow that. We know that.\n  So what do we do about it? Nothing? Have some hearings? Have the GAO \nspend another year looking at things? We agree GAO ought to look at \nthis. We are asking them to do that, too. They have already begun some \nwork at our request. I agree with the Senator\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\nthat we need to do more, but to just say the Senate should not act on \nthis suggestion, this is a modest first step. It is not a suggestion \nfor comprehensive reform at this time. We need more information. We \nneed to do more work to decide on the details of a comprehensive, \nworkable policy than is on the books now and administered by our \nCommerce Department.\n  So, but for the provisions of the amendment offered by the Senator \nthat I have suggested caused me some concern, I would like to be able \nto support the amendment so that we could then go on and vote to \napprove the amendment as amended, but I cannot do that at this point. I \nhope the Senate will not agree to the amendment.\n  I know under the announcement that was made earlier today on behalf \nof the majority leader, there will be no votes on amendments today. \nThey will be set aside and we will come to them later. So there will \nnot be a vote today. Knowing that there will not be, I will not push \nthe issue any further, except to suggest to the Senate that this is an \nissue that ought to be debated, considered carefully, and we ought to \nvote for this amendment that I have offered with the cosponsorship of \nSenator Durbin.\n  Incidentally, I asked the other day, after we had described the \namendment, that Senator Abraham be added as a cosponsor. I have now \nbeen asked to seek unanimous consent that Senator Lugar be added as a \ncosponsor. I make that request at this time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Janice \nNielsen, a legislative fellow with Senator Craig's office, be granted \nfloor privileges during debate on S. 936, the Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to say I appreciate the remarks of \nmy colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. We hope to be able to \nwork with him over the weekend and hope to come to an agreement and \ncompromise with him by next week. Like he said, hopefully we can vote \non this at that time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we may move \nfrom this quorum call into morning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to calling off the quorum?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The bill clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, making two separate requests, I ask \nunanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I can proceed \nfor 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator add to \nthat, that following morning business that we go back into an automatic \nquorum call?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nspeech, if it ever begins, that we go back into the quorum call, and I \nalso ask unanimous consent that, without losing the floor, I might \nyield to Senator Inhofe so that he might get a staff member on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a \nvery difficult subject that for the next couple years is going to be \nvery unpopular. In the long history of the country it is one of the \nmost important subjects that we have ever debated--and that is trying \nto save Medicare.\n  I want to talk about what we did in the Finance Committee. We \nreported a bill that will be on the floor by the middle of next week. I \nwant to explain to people exactly what we did and exactly why we did \nit. I want to talk about why it is important to the future of the \ncountry and why it is critically important to 38 million people who \ndepend on Medicare. It is something that we have to do, and it was a \ncourageous action taken by the committee. However, it will be a great \nblot on the courage and leadership of this Congress if we let this \neffort, started in the Finance Committee this week, die on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate or in the Congress.\n  First of all, Mr. President, let me remind people that we have a \nterrible problem in Medicare. Medicare will be insolvent in 3 years. \nThere are a lot things I may do in my political career that I do not \nwant to do, but there is one thing I am never going to do. I am never \ngoing to call up my 83-year-old mother and say, ``Well, mama, Medicare \nwent broke today. It went broke today because nobody had the courage to \ndo something about it. I knew it was going broke, but I didn't want to \ntell anybody because I thought somebody might criticize me for trying \nto do something about it. So I just stood by thinking, `Well, when it \ngoes broke in 3 years, maybe something magical will happen, and maybe \nnobody will blame me.' '' I am never going to make that telephone call.\n  I am proud to say that we took two steps in the Finance Committee \nthis week that will go a long way. If we continue to show the courage \nthat we showed in committee on the floor of the Senate, then I will \nnever have to call my mother and tell her Medicare went broke, and she \nwill never be without the benefits that she has become accustomed to \nand that she needs.\n\n  And let me outline the two things we did.\n  First of all, as my colleagues will remember, we had a crisis in \nSocial Security in 1983. We set up a commission which was almost unable \nto agree on what to do about putting Social Security back in the black. \nWe were on the verge halting Social Security checks. However, one of \nthe reforms which arose from the process resulted from a recognition \nthat Americans are healthier, and are living longer.\n  So as part of that Social Security solvency package, those of us who \nwere in Congress at the time swallowed hard and voted to raise the \nretirement age from 65 to 67 over a 24-year period.\n  I remind my colleagues that when Social Security started, the average \nAmerican lifespan was less than the eligibility age for Social \nSecurity. So the Social Security system protected people who lived \nlonger than the average.\n  Obviously, thank goodness, the average lifespan of Americans has \ngrown dramatically since 1935. So we now have in law where beginning in \nthe year 2003 through the year 2027, we are going to very gradually \nraise the retirement age from 65 to 67. That was part of a program to \nkeep Social Security solvent.\n  It was heavy lifting at the time. Medicare was still in the black, \nand nobody wanted to make the lifting any heavier.\n  Now we are reaching a point where this phase-in for Social Security \nis going to start in the year 2003. So the Finance Committee, in what I \nbelieve was a courageous vote, voted to begin phasing up the \neligibility age for Medicare in the same way as Social Security. That \nis the first significant change we made. I think there is something \nhistoric about that change which goes beyond it being the most dramatic \nchange we have ever made in Medicare's history to keep the program \nsolvent.\n  The second dramatic thing about this reform is that we did not do it \nto save\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\nmoney. We did not do it to fund tax cuts. We did not do it to balance \nthe budget. We do not even count the savings that come from it in our \nbudget. Every penny we save goes into the hospital insurance trust fund \nto protect benefits.\n  Let me say to our colleagues who might be listening to this speech, \nwith Medicare within 3 years of going broke, with Medicare within 7 \nyears of having a $100 billion deficit per year, with a projected \ndeficit in Medicare over the next 10 years of $1.6 trillion--counting \nboth part A spending and part B spending--it is an absolute certainty \nthat we will ultimately conform the eligibility age for Medicare with \nthe retirement age under Social Security. That is a certainty. That is \ngoing to happen.\n  But if we wait 2 or 3 more years before doing so, we are not going to \nhave time for people to plan for the future. One of the cruelest things \nwe could do is to wait and delay and let a crisis occur so that we find \nourselves forced to change the eligibility age for those who had \nplanned to retire in a year or 2 or 3.\n  If we make this change now, people will have several years to adjust \nto an increase in the retirement age. The changes that will occur will \noccur very slowly over the next 24 years.\n  The impact of this provision on the solvency of the Medicare hospital \ninsurance trust fund is dramatic. It will reduce the projected deficit \nin the Medicare trust fund by about 10 percent in and of itself, by the \nyear 2025.\n  The second change that we made is an equally dramatic change and \nrecognizes that there are two parts to Medicare. We all pay 2.9 percent \nof our wages in payroll taxes during our working lives in order to \nqualify for coverage under the Medicare Hospital Insurance Program.\n  There is a voluntary part of Medicare that nobody pays for in payroll \ntaxes, but that is funded by a payment that people make in a part B \npremium.\n  Mr. President, there are two types of Medicare benefits. One type is \nthe trust fund that we pay for during our working lives. We pay 2.9 \npercent of wages into that trust fund. That pays primarily for hospital \ncare. Coverage for physician services is a separate system for which \nyou do not start paying until you retire. When it was set up in 1965, \nthe idea was for retirees to pay 50 percent of program costs in \npremiums, while taxpayers would pay the other 50 percent. Over the \nyears that retiree payment has fallen to 25 percent of Medicare.\n  Currently, there is a deductible of $100 which people have to pay \nbefore Medicare part B, the voluntary part of Medicare, kicks in. Under \nthe second reform adopted by the Finance Committee, as income rises \nfrom $50,000 to $100,000 for an individual--or from 75,000 to $125,000 \nas a couple--very high-income retirees--that deductible would phase up \nfrom $100 to an amount equal to the full taxpayer subsidy of this \nvoluntary health insurance program. That would make the deductible \nabout $1,700 a year for very high-income retirees.\n  Now, those are the two changes we have made. As was true with the \nretirement age phasein, none of the savings that come from having a \nhigher deductible for very high-income retirees goes to the deficit. \nNone of it goes to fund tax cuts. None of it is even counted in the \nbudget. Every penny of the savings goes to protect the trust fund.\n  Now, why do we need to do this? I read in the newspaper this morning \nwhere one of our colleagues said it is hogwash to say we have to make \nthese kind of changes to save Medicare. Well, let me explain why we are \ngoing to have to make some dramatic changes and we are going to have to \nmake them quickly if we are going to save Medicare. The two changes \nthat we made in the Finance Committee will not save Medicare by \nthemselves. They are major steps forward. They are the only real \nreforms we have made since 1965.\n  I am sure when we debate this next week people will say, but we have \nsavings in the budget. Well, we assume we are cutting payments to \nhospitals and providers. We have done that about a dozen times. It has \nnever saved any money because they find a way to get around it. Then \nour biggest savings is that we take the fastest growing part of \nMedicare, home health care, out of the trust fund and put it in general \nrevenue. Then we say, well, we have helped save the trust fund. So the \nonly two real permanent reforms that have a long-term impact are the \ntwo reforms which we are not counting as part of the budget. We do have \nanother major long-term change in Medicare by giving our seniors more \nchoices.\n  Let me, very briefly, go through the problems in Medicare. First, \nMedicare expenses are exploding. They are growing at over twice the \ncost of medicine in the private sector. We have a program that by and \nlarge was designed in 1965 based on an old Blue Cross-Blue Shield \npolicy that is no longer available. Medicare is a system that has \ntremendous inefficiencies and has grown faster than any other major \nprogram in the Federal budget. We started off paying for Medicare with \na 0.7-percent payroll tax on the first $6,600 of income earned. We are \nnow paying 2.9 percent of every $1 they earn, and still Medicare will \nbe broke in 3 years. So our first problem is exploding costs.\n  The second problem is a time bomb we know as the baby boomer \ngeneration. I want to ask people to look at this chart because this \nexplains what is going to happen and why there is nothing conjectural \nabout it. It is not somebody merely claiming that the sky is going to \nfall; the sky is already falling.\n  Currently, in 1997, we are at the point where all the babies born in \n1932 are retiring. 1932 was not a banner year for having children in \nAmerica. We were in the middle of a depression. The birth rate was very \nlow--one of the lowest birth rates in American history. So for the next \nfew years, as depression era babies retire, we are going to have \nrelatively few people who are retiring. These should be great years in \nterms of solvency for Medicare. However, these are the years where \nMedicare is going broke.\n  But notice what happens, beginning during the war and then \nimmediately after the war we had an explosion in the birth rate in \nAmerica. Fourteen million men came home from the war. They had defeated \nNazism. America was the dominant power on Earth. People had new \nconfidence in the future, and they made the greatest investment you can \nhave in the future--they had babies, millions of them. Most Members of \nCongress were either in the sort of pre-baby-boomer generation during \nthe war or they were in the generation right after the war. There was a \nhuge explosion in the birth rate.\n  When we created Medicare in 1965, we were looking at this huge \navalanche of young people coming into the labor market. In 1965 we had \nabout four times as many people turn 19 as we had had 2 years before. \nIt looked as if this tidal wave of people would never end. Actually, \nhad Congress gone down to the Census Bureau in 1965 and asked if this \nbaby boom would ever end, they would have discovered that it already \nhad. But when we wrote Medicare with this huge number of people coming \nto the labor market, they made a decision not to fund it. They opted \nfor a pay-as-you-go system where young workers would pay into the \nsystem without building up trust funds to pay for the benefits. This \nbaby boomer generation turned out to be a godsend for programs like \nMedicare.\n  But now we come to the problem. This chart shows the projected \nincreases in the population 65 and over. If you look at this chart, we \nare down here now where only 200,000 people are going to turn 65 this \nyear, but within 14 years 1.6 million people will turn 65 and that \nnumber will not change for 20 years. We are going to go from 5.9 \nworkers per retiree on the day Medicare started--we are down now to 3.9 \nand we are headed to 2.2--2.2 workers for every retiree in America.\n  The financial impact of that is absolutely cataclysmic. If we do not \nact, the young people who are sitting down here as pages are going to \nhave to pay a payroll tax three times the current level. We are going \nto have an average tax rate in America--average tax rate in America--of \nabout 50 cents out of every dollar. America is not going to be America \nwhen you have that kind of tax burden.\n  Now, this is a problem we must address. We know it is coming. We can \nfix it. We can preserve benefits. We can make the system better. But we \nare going to have to be courageous in order to do it, and we are going \nto have to make some tough decisions.\n  Here is what the financial status of Medicare looks like. As you can \nsee, we are in the last years of its solvency. We\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\nare looking at an explosion in the cumulative deficit of Medicare \nbecause we guaranteed two generations of Americans medical coverage \nduring retirement, and nobody ever set aside any money to pay for it. \nNow the baby boomer generation is headed into retirement, they want \nthese benefits, and there is no money to pay for them. That is the \ncrisis.\n  Let me give an idea of how big this is. If we reform Medicare right \nnow, and change the system by improving efficiency, thereby bringing \nthe cost of Medicare down to the general inflation rates, even under \nthe best of circumstances, to pay off this debt to baby boomers, we \nwould have to borrow $2.6 trillion. If we wait 10 years, it goes up to \n$3.9 trillion. If we wait 20 years, it goes up to $6.1 trillion. Now, \nthe whole debt of the country today is less than $6.1 trillion. So this \nis a crisis. This is a crisis that is happening right now.\n  We have made two changes in the Finance Committee which produce \nsavings that are dedicated, every penny, to strengthening the hospital \ninsurance trust fund. One is raising the eligibility age for Medicare \nas we have done for the retirement age under Social Security. I can \nguarantee you that is going to have to happen sooner or later. Within \n10 years we are going to vote to do it. If we wait 10 years, we will \nhave Americans who literally are on the verge of retiring who are going \nto find out they cannot retire. That is not fair, and it is not right. \nIf we do it today, we will catch the political heat today but people \nwill have 30 years to adjust to working 2 years longer. So it will be \nunpopular in the short run, we will be criticized for it in the short \nrun, but within 10 years when people fully understand this, they are \ngoing to be very grateful that we did it, and it will be the right \nthing to do.\n  Second, asking very high-income people in a voluntary program to pay \nmore of the cost of providing that benefit is not unreasonable. Nobody \nis required to participate in part B Medicare. No one pays a penny in \nthe part B Medicare during their working life. It is a voluntary \nprogram. I have been stunned when listening to the criticism of this \nthat somehow there is something wrong with asking people who have \nincome of $100,000 a year in retirement to pay a $1,700 deductible for \nthe best medical care policy that money can buy. I do not think that is \nunreasonable.\n  Let me tell you something. We are going to have to do it. But do we \nhave to wait until our seniors are scared to death because they are not \nsure Medicare is going to be in place next month? Do we have to wait \nuntil the wolf is at the door, until the house is on fire, to make a \ntough decision? Can't we make the decision while there is time to \nadjust to it so that we can prevent the system from going broke? Does \nit have to go broke for us to have the courage to do something that we \nknow has to be done?\n  So, we are going to be debating these things next week, and we will \nhave Members of the Senate standing up and saying we are breaching an \nagreement by asking people with $100,000 a year income to pay $1,700 \nfor a voluntary health insurance program.\n  We are going to have a lot of people say the world is going to come \nto an end because we are asking people to pay more if they can to save \na system that is critical. I am ready to debate it. I don't know if we \ncan save these reforms. But we are going to be awfully embarrassed some \nday if we don't.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6024-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6026-S6027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 422\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Grams substitute \nfor the Cochran amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I consider this a matter of national \nsecurity and, therefore, I support the efforts of the Senator from \nMississippi to require export licenses for computers --in short, \nsupercomputers to tier 3 countries, such as Russia, China, India, and \nPakistan.\n  For several years, both the Strategic Subcommittee and the \nAcquisition and Technology Subcommittee, chaired by the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Smith, have conducted hearings on the \nadministration's export policies on dual-use technologies with military \napplications. The concerns expressed by Senators Cochran and Durbin is \none of the issues which Senator Smith was concerned about, and which he \nexplored during his hearings.\n  The export of the high-performance computers to countries of concern \ncould have a significant and potentially detrimental impact on United \nStates and allied security interests.\n  The alleged export of the high-performance computers to Russia and \nChina recently causes me great concern.

The \nexport of these computers was accomplished without export licenses. \nEvidently, the Russian Government told the companies that sold the \ncomputers that they would be used for modeling of Earth water \npollution. However, subsequent to the sale, officials from the Russian \nMinistry of Atomic Energy stated that the computers would be used to \nmaintain its nuclear weapons stockpile, to confirm the reliability of \nits nuclear arsenal, and to ensure the proper working order of the \nnuclear stockpile under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. President, according to U.S. export policy, the sale of high-\npowered computers that would directly or indirectly support nuclear \nweapons activities is prohibited.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senator's amendment to require a license \nto export high-powered supercomputers with a 2,000 million theoretical \noperation range is appropriate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as an original cosponsor of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when we start debating tax legislation on \nthe floor, I hope our debate will be governed by a few basic \nprinciples. Let me state those questions which are most important to me \npersonally. Each of these questions needs a satisfactory answer.\n  Are the tax benefits spread evenly across all income levels?\n  Is the tax legislation consistent with the budget agreement?\n  Does the tax package undermine a balanced budget after 10 years?\n  We need answers which meet basic standards of fairness and sound \npublic policy. These are the standards I think we should use to judge \nany tax bill that comes to this floor.\n  Today, I would like to talk a little more about the first concern I \nhave mentioned how evenly the benefits of the proposed tax bills will \nfall across income levels.\n  A distribution table put out by the Senate Finance Committee claims \nthat 74 percent of the tax benefits in the proposal pending before that \nCommittee go to those making under $75,000; 74 percent. That sounds \npretty good.\n  On the other hand, our analysis shows that 43 percent of the benefits \ngo to the wealthiest 10 percent, and two-thirds of the benefits go to \nthe top 20 percent.\n  How can the two analysis be so different? Well, let's look at some of \nthe differences.\n  First, the Republican claims about who gets the tax cuts are based \nonly on 5-year projections--before many of the backloaded tax breaks \nare fully implemented. Our analysis looks at the tax cuts when fully \nimplemented. Let me repeat that. They cut their analysis off after 5 \nyears, before many of the tax breaks are fully implemented. You can \nplay a lot of games by cutting off the analysis after 5 years. What \nhappens after 10 years? Under the Republican income distribution, they \nwill never tell you. But why not?\n  Our income distribution looks at these new tax breaks when they are \nfully implemented. What a difference it makes. Apparently the most \nbackloaded tax breaks provide very little benefit for low and middle \nincome workers.\n  Second, because the Republican claims are only based on 5 years, they \ntreat capital gains cut as hardly any tax cuts at all. In fact, the \nRepublican analysis of the House tax package claims that the capital \ngains tax cut is actually a tax increase for upper income taxpayers \nduring the first 5 years. Imagine that--a capital gains cut that counts \nas a tax increase.\n  Third, the Republican claims about who gets the tax cuts ignore the \nimpact that estate tax cuts will have in individual taxpayers. It \nsimply ignores them. They don't count estate tax benefits at all.\n  The Republican claims about who gets the tax cuts ignore the fact \nthat many of the proposed tax cuts are backloaded--meaning that the \nfull impact is not felt until well after the first 5 years, and in some \ncases not until well after 10 years. This means they have essentially \nignored not only the impact of capital gains cuts, but also the \nbackloaded IRA's, and the phase-in of estates taxes.\n  Mr. President, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has \nproduced a more detailed analysis of the distribution tables prepared \nby the Joint Committee on Taxation on the House tax bill. That analysis \ncontains essentially the same flaws as the Senate analysis. I ask \nunanimous consent that this document, entitled ``Joint Tax Committee \nDistribution Tables Produce Misleading Results,'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Center on Budget and Policy Priorities--Joint Tax Committee \n             Distribution Tables Produce Misleading Results\n\n\ntables fail to account for any of the benefits from the tax cuts worth \n                   the most to high-income taxpayers\n\n       According to distribution tables the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation has prepared the tax cuts proposed by Rep. Bill \n     Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, would \n     concentrate their benefits among middle-class Americans. This \n     finding is sharply at odds with the content of the \n     legislation. Four of the largest tax cuts--the capital gains, \n     Individual Retirement Account, estate, and corporate \n     alternative minimum tax provisions--provide the large \n     majority of their benefits to households with high incomes.\n       The Joint Committee's handling of these four provisions is \n     fundamentally flawed. In effect, its distribution tables do \n     not reflect any of the benefits that taxpayers would receive \n     from the four provisions.\n       The Joint Tax Committee distribution tables ignore the \n     effects of reductions in estate and corporate taxes. The \n     Joint Committee did not examine the distributional effects of \n     these tax changes.\n       The Joint Tax Committee distribution tables do consider the \n     effects of the changes in the capital gains tax and the IRA \n     provisions. The distribution tables, however, go only through \n     2002. Because the capital gains tax cuts and the IRA \n     provisions are heavily backloaded, they do not result in net \n     reductions in revenue collections during the time period the \n     Joint Tax Committee examined. (For example, taxpayers would \n     not begin to receive tax cuts from capital gains indexing \n     until 2004). And because they do not result in net revenue \n     reductions, the Joint Tax Committee assumes these provisions \n     produce no net tax cut benefits in these years.\n       In fact, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that during the \n     period through 2002, net capital gains tax payments would \n     rise $1 billion due to the Archer capital gains tax \n     provisions. In its distributions tables, the Joint Tax \n     Committee treats this $1 billion as a tax increase, primarily \n     on taxpayers at high income levels. As a result, under the \n     Joint Tax Committee tables, high-income taxpayers appear to \n     be the victims of a tax increase imposed by the Archer \n     capital gains tax cuts.\n       By considering a time period in which the capital gains \n     provisions cause a short-term increase in revenue collections \n     and the IRA provisions result in no significant net change in \n     revenue collections (the IRA provisions lose only $33 million \n     cumulatively in the years through 2002), the Joint Tax \n     Committee's distribution tables dramatically understate the \n     benefits of the tax package to high-income taxpayers.\n       While the capital gains and IRA proposals produce no net \n     revenue loss in the years through 2002, the combined revenue \n     loss from these provisions is $51 billion from 2003 through \n     2007, years the Joint Tax Committee distribution tables do \n     not examine. The large cost of these provisions during this \n     second five-year period stands in sharp contrast to the $1 \n     billion net gain in revenue from the capital gains and IRA \n     provisions from 1998 to 2002, years the Committee's \n     distribution tables do examine.\n       By 2007, the combined cost of the capital gains and IRA \n     provisions exceeds $15 billion a year and is growing at a \n     rate of nearly $3 billion a year.\n       If the Joint Tax Committee had examined the capital gains \n     and estate tax provisions when they were fully in effect--and \n     if it also had distributed the effects of the reductions in \n     the estate and corporate alternative minimum taxes--the \n     degree to which the tax benefits of the Archer plan accrue to \n     high-income taxpayers would be shown to be vastly larger than \n     the Joint Committee on Taxation tables indicate.\n       Like the capital gains and IRA tax cuts, the estate tax \n     provisions of the Archer plan are heavily backloaded. (The \n     corporate alternative minimum tax provisions are the only \n     provisions principally benefitting high-income taxpayers that \n     are not heavily backloaded.)\n       As a consequence of the backloading, the four upper-income \n     tax cut provisions account for a growing proportion of the \n     tax package over time. Specifically, in 2003, the capital \n     gains, IRA, estate and corporate alternative minimum tax \n     provisions account for 30 percent of the gross cost of the \n     tax package. By 2005, they account for 35 percent of the \n     gross tax cuts in the tax package. By 2007, the figure is 42 \n     percent. By about 2010, the upper-income provisions, which \n     concentrate the bulk of their benefits among a small fraction \n     of the population, would account for a majority of the gross \n     tax cuts in the package.\n       Furthermore, these percentage figures do not reflect \n     several other major tax cuts in the package that would confer \n     a sizable share of their tax cut benefits on high-income \n     taxpayers--such as the provision weakening the individual \n     alternative minimum tax and the $10,000-a-year education \n     tax deduction, which includes no income limit on the \n     taxpayers who can claim it. Eventually, the Archer plan \n     becomes a piece of legislation whose predominant effect is \n     to provide upper-income tax relief and enlarge the after-\n     tax incomes of those in the wealthiest strata of society.\n\n\nchanges in joint tax committee methodology skew the distribution tables\n\n       Also of significance, the methodology the Joint Tax \n     Committee has used in preparing the distribution tables on \n     the Archer plan differs in important ways from the \n     methodology the Joint Committee employed until late 1994.\n       Tax bills have been introduced on numerous previous \n     occasions that phase in the tax cuts they contain. \n     Accordingly, the Joint Tax Committee had to address on many \n     prior occasions the question of how to estimate the \n     distributional effects of tax provisions whose full effects \n     would not be felt for more\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\n     than five years. Until the end of the 103rd Congress, the \n     Joint Tax Committee traditionally addressed this issue by \n     examining the distributional effects of the proposed tax \n     changes when the changes were fully in effect. This also is \n     the approach most tax analysts endorse and the approach the \n     Treasury Department continues to use. But the Joint Tax \n     Committee did not use this approach in analyzing the \n     distributional effects of the Archer tax package. It thereby \n     has significantly understated the effects of the backloaded \n     tax cuts in the Archer plan that primarily benefit high-\n     income taxpayers.\n       The Joint Tax Committee also has changed its methodology in \n     another key respect. The capital gains and IRA provisions of \n     the Archer tax package are designed so they increase tax \n     collections in the period from 1998 to 2002. This increase in \n     collections does not reflect an increase in tax rates or a \n     change in tax law under which previously exempt income is \n     made subject to taxation. Rather, the increased collections \n     reflect voluntary changes in behavior by taxpayers who choose \n     to make tax payments in the next five years that they would \n     have made in later years in return for very generous tax cuts \n     for years to come.\n       For example, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that the \n     Archer capital gains provisions would produce a net increase \n     in revenues in the years through 2002. In the first two \n     years, these provisions would raise revenues because some \n     investors would decide to take advantage of the new, lower \n     capital gains tax rate to sell more assets than they \n     otherwise would have sold in those years. The increased tax \n     collections that result from the sale of an increased volume \n     of assets in these two years do not represent a tax \n     increase the government has required investors to pay. To \n     the contrary, the increase in tax collections would occur \n     because some investors would elect to sell in the next two \n     years some assets they otherwise would have sold at a \n     later date. The investors would sell these assets because \n     they concluded it was in their interest to do so.\n       Similarly, the capital gains indexing proposal offers \n     investors the option of paying capital gains tax in 2001 and \n     2002 on the increase in the value of various assets they hold \n     between the time the assets were purchased and January 1, \n     2001, in return for large capital gains tax cuts when they \n     sell these assets in later years. Because this offers such a \n     sweet deal to investors, many would use it. They would pay \n     capital gains taxes in 2001 and 2002 that they would \n     otherwise have paid in future years when the assets are \n     actually sold, and they would reap large tax cut benefits as \n     a result. Here, too, the additional revenue collections in \n     2001 and 2002 do not represent tax increases the government \n     has imposed on these individuals. To the contrary, these \n     investors are securing large tax cuts for themselves.\n       The Archer IRA proposals also have this characteristic. \n     They are engineered so taxpayers can opt to pay taxes during \n     1999 through 2002 that they otherwise would pay in future \n     years in return for very generous tax breaks for years to \n     come. Here, also, taxpayers would choose to accelerate some \n     tax payments into the next several years because it would be \n     in their interest to do so.\n       Under the traditional methodology the Joint Tax Committee \n     used in the past, these accelerated tax payments that \n     individuals would elect to make in the next few years, in \n     return for large future tax breaks, would not be treated as \n     tax increases imposed upon these individuals. Under the new \n     methodology it adopted in late 1994, however, the Joint Tax \n     Committee treats these additional revenue collections as tax \n     increases. As a result, the Joint Tax Committee's \n     distribution tables reflect the incongruous assumption that \n     the net effect of the Archer capital gains and IRA proposals \n     on wealthy individuals is to saddle them with a tax increase.\n\n\n leading analysts reject new joint tax methodology on the distribution \n                     of capital gains tax benefits\n\n       Many of the leading analysts in the field reject the new \n     Joint Tax Committee method as producing severe distortions in \n     the distribution of the benefits that a capital gains tax cut \n     produces. Among those rejecting the new Joint Tax Committee \n     approach are: Robert Reischauer, former director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office; Henry Aaron, senior fellow at \n     the Brookings Institution; and Jane Gravelle, the \n     Congressional Research Service's leading tax expert and \n     analyst. In addition, several years ago Gravelle co-authored \n     an article on this matter with Lawrence Lindsey, a noted \n     conservative economist who served until recently on the \n     Federal Reserve Board and who supports a capital gains tax \n     cut. In their article, Lindsey and Gravelle explicitly \n     rejected the methodology the Joint Tax Committee has now \n     adopted.\n       As Aaron has observed, investors who respond to a capital \n     gains tax cut by selling more assets are people who face one \n     set of opportunities under the current capital gains tax \n     rates--and find it financially advantageous not to make \n     additional asset sales--but face a more generous set of \n     opportunities when capital gains tax rates are reduced and \n     choose to follow a different course. ``Since they have the \n     option of doing what they did before (i.e., not selling \n     additional assets), but the new, more favorable tax rates \n     induce them to do something else, they must be better off,'' \n     Aaron explains. ``It is logically absurd to count them as \n     worse off in any way whatsoever.''\n       Aaron's view is supported by an article Gravelle and \n     Lindsey co-authored in 1988 before Lindsey joined the Fed. In \n     the article they stated:\n       ``* * * suppose a reduction in the capital gains tax rate \n     led to substantially more capital gains realizations [i.e., \n     more sales of assets] and actually increased the tax revenue \n     paid by upper-income groups. * * * it would be totally \n     inappropriate to say that their tax burden had increased. \n     After all, with a lower tax rate, these upper-income \n     taxpayers are less burdened than they were before, even \n     though they pay more taxes.'' \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ This quote is from Jane G. Gravelle and Lawrence B. \n     Lindsey, ``Capital Gains,'' Tax Notes, January 25, 1988, p. \n     399. Gravelle included this quote in Jane G. Gravelle, \n     ``Distributional Effects of Tax Provisions in the Contract \n     with America as reported by the Ways and Means Committee,'' \n     CRS Report for Congress, April 3, 1995.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In addition, in a more recent analysis examining the new \n     Joint Tax Committee methodology, Gravelle notes that the \n     standard methodology, if anything, understates the benefits \n     that investors would secure from a capital gains tax cut \n     because it does not reflect the tax benefits they would \n     receive when they voluntarily sell more assets to take \n     advantage of a lower capital gains tax rate. She also \n     observes that economists generally would reject the new \n     methodology.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let's not cook the books. Let's have a \nstraightforward debate about who is getting the tax breaks that have \nbeen proposed, and whether we can do better. We hear a lot about income \ntax, but what about payroll tax?\n  Let's not ignore payroll taxes when we talk about who is carrying the \ntax burden today. Workers in this country pay a 7.65-percent payroll \ntax to finance the Social Security Program. They pay an additional 1.45 \npercent payroll tax to finance the Medicare Program. Social Security \ntaxes are collected on the first dollar earned--up to $62,700. Medicare \ntaxes are collected on all earned income.\n  The majority of workers in this country pay more in payroll taxes \nthan they do in income taxes. So it is insulting for many of these \nworkers to hear some around here talk about low income workers as if \nthey pay no taxes. You will actually hear some Members come to this \nfloor and argue that lower income workers do not get much of a tax \nbreak because they do not pay many taxes. They will say lower income \nworkers do not get a full $500 per child tax credit because they do not \npay enough in taxes.\n  This is just not true. A tax is a tax for most folks--whether they \nare income taxes or payroll taxes or estate taxes or something else. \nBut by counting only income taxes and ignoring payroll taxes, it means \nthat upper income taxpayers get more of the tax breaks, while lower and \nmiddle income workers get less.\n  So we have to do better.\n  Now, we will also hear that the top 10 or 20 percent get most of the \ntax benefit because they generate most of the income. Well, let's put \nthat in perspective as well. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, in 1994 the wealthiest 20 percent of families made about 48.1 \npercent of family income in this country. Yet under the Senate Finance \nCommittee bill, they get 67 percent of the tax breaks.\n  Or let me put it another way--from a middle class perspective. Again \naccording to CBO, in 1994 the bottom 60 percent of families made 27.3 \npercent of the income. Yet under the Senate Finance Committee bill, \nthey get only 12 percent of the tax benefit. So I think we are a little \nout of balance. When the bill reaches the floor, I hope we can do \nbetter. I hope we can make it a little more fair. It is the least we \ncan do.\n  Last, Mr. President, when we talk about the fairness of this package, \nwe need to talk about how the revenue raisers in the Senate Finance \nCommittee tax package affect different income groups.\n  Last night, the Finance Committee voted to increase excise taxes on \ncigarettes by 20 cents per pack. I understand that it's politically \ncorrect to attack the tobacco industry. And we're going to see plenty \nof piling on over the next few months regarding tobacco.\n  But let's talk for a minute about how this cigarette tax affects \nvarious income groups. It's well documented that cigarette excise taxes \nare the most regressive of all taxes--meaning they hit poor folks a lot \nharder than they hit upper income folks. According to a 1997 KPMG Peat \nMarwick study, U.S. families earning about $30,000 or less earned\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\nabout 16 percent of all income generated, but paid 47 percent of all \ntobacco taxes. Let me say it again. Families earning less than $30,000 \npay 47 percent of all cigarette excise taxes.\n  The changes in the tax bill made last night will make the disparity \namong poor families even greater.\n  On average, low income persons pay 15 times more in tobacco taxes \nthan upper income individuals.\n  And what was this tax increase on low income people going to be used \nfor? To accelerate the increase in estate tax relief, which goes \nprimarily to upper income individuals. This is a reverse-Robin Hood \namendment. We are taxing the poor to help the wealthy.\n  The amendment will also reportedly be used to provide $8 billion in \nadditional spending for health insurance. Just a couple of weeks ago we \nheard how this would violate the budget agreement. We voted 55 to 45 \nagainst an amendment that would raise taxes in order to raise spending \non health insurance. Phone calls were made to the President of the \nUnited States to tell him how this would violate the budget agreement \nand how he better announce he was opposed to the amendment. Yet last \nnight, some of the very same Senators who made those arguments on the \nfloor a few weeks ago apparently voted in favor of a very similar \namendment. How could it violate the budget agreement a few weeks ago \nand not now?\n  Last, Mr. President, the timing of this tax increase is most \ninteresting. Later today we may hear an announcement of a ``global \nsettlement'' of tobacco litigation. The agreement will require \ncongressional action. As I understand it, this agreement completely \nfails to address the interests of tobacco farmers and factory workers, \nnearly all of whom are low to moderate income workers. But we will have \nthat debate on another day.\n  What is interesting today, however, is the impact of that agreement \non all these proposed cigarette tax increases. The tobacco settlement, \nif implemented, will have an immediate impact on prices, raising the \nprice of a pack of cigarettes by somewhere in the neighborhood of a \ndollar. This, of course, will depress consumption--which in turn will \nreduce revenues by about 20 to 25 percent, or maybe even higher. So any \nproposals in the reconciliation bill to raise revenues by raising \ncigarette taxes will prove to be overly optimistic as soon as any \nglobal settlement is implemented. This means less revenue will actually \nbe raised, and our deficit problems will be worse--particularly in the \nout years. So there is a great ripple effect as work here if these tax \nincrease proposals succeed.\n  But last, Mr. President, let me return to my initial point. The tax \npackage considered by the Finance Committee benefits upper income \nindividuals too heavily. The cigarette tax adopted last night makes \nmatters even worse, because it is primarily a tax on low income \nindividuals. So not only do low income folks get virtually none of the \ntax breaks--but they will now get a tax increase.\n  I hope my colleagues who claim great concern for low income people \nwill keep this in mind as they prepare to vote on the tax \nreconciliation bill. As for this Senator, I think a bad bill was made \nworse by the Finance Committee last night, and it is simply not a \npackage I can support in its current form.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ndiscuss programs proposed by the Americans Disabled for Attendant \nPrograms Today, a group known as ADAPT, that is working to help people \nwho are disabled live normal lives.\n  There is a curious provision in the Medicaid laws, one of many \ncurious provisions in the Medicaid laws, which does not permit people \nto live at home in community-based settings as opposed to being in \nnursing homes. I have sought to persuade the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to change that program with a letter which I wrote to \nher on February 28, 1997, pointing out that ``it has been brought to my \nattention that considerable savings to the Medicaid Program could be \nachieved by redirecting long-term care funding toward community-based \nattendant services, and by requiring States to develop attendant \nservice programs meeting national standards to assure that all people \nwith disabilities have full access to such services and can live at \nhome.''\n  When the Secretary came for a hearing, the question was propounded \nand the response has been that ``HHS is currently considering such \nprograms as a policy option but has not yet put them into effect. The \nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation is funding a demonstration program that \nwill be operational next year, and the Department is looking toward the \nresults of that program before acting.''\n  It is my thought, Mr. President, that there is a clear-cut need for \nthis kind of a program to be put into effect forthwith, and if the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services does not do so, then it may be \nnecessary to enact legislation which would require the Department to \nact in that way. In the meantime, the appropriations subcommittee, \nwhich I chair, has increased the funding for the independent living \nprogram by some $2.1 million for a $74.6 million allocation this year.\n  I had occasion earlier this year to visit a group of people who are \nliving at home and told them that I would display on the Senate floor \ntheir sweat shirts and send to them a video cassette. Sweat shirts are \nvery popular these days. This one says, for those who might not be able \nto read it on C-SPAN2: ``Our Homes, Not Nursing Homes.'' Underneath the \nlogo is ``ADAPT,'' which is Americans Disabled Attendant Programs \nToday.\n  They are a very courageous group. They are principally in \nwheelchairs, with very, very substantial disabilities, struggling to \nlive independent lives and doing a great job at it. What they want is \nthe flexibility to be able to live at home and to have home services.\n  I think this is another area where Medicaid ought to have a little \nflexibility, understanding the needs of people. One way or another, Mr. \nPresident, we intend to get there and reasonably soon.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 943 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 34 are located in today's Record under \n``Submissions of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, we are in the midst of a great deal of \nhistory in the 105th Congress. As most people now realize early out, \nthe Congress, the leadership of the Congress and the President of the \nUnited States and his administration reached an agreement that they \nwould work together to produce, finally, after well over a decade, tax \nrelief, and that we would produce by the year 2002 a balanced budget \nwhich would, of course, by definition, produce constrained spending, \nand that we would take steps to protect the solvency of Medicare at \nleast for upward to a decade, and begin to reduce spending in order to \nreach these balanced budget goals.\n  By and large, I believe the American people are pleased with the \nconcept of\n\n[[Page S6031]]\n\nthis agreement. I suspect that not all of them realize that was only \none step in a 1,000-mile journey, and that once those basic parameters \nhad been established then you had to begin the business of having the \ncommittees of jurisdiction produce the actual legislation that would \nproduce this effect.\n  Mr. President, this has been a long goal of the Republican majority \nof this Congress that came here in 1994, to produce balanced budgets \nand to produce tax relief for America's families and workers that we \nbelieve are under the most severe economic pressure in contemporary \nhistory. They are paying more taxes. An average family is paying higher \ntaxes today than at any time in contemporary history.\n  This agreement comes in the context of a longstanding battle between \nthis Congress and the President. I am going to take just a moment or \ntwo to remind us of the general milestones in that battle. In 1992, 5 \nyears ago, when the President was first seeking election, he promised \nthe American people, particularly the middle class, that he would lower \ntheir taxes, that if he were elected President, he was going to reduce \nthe economic tax pressure on middle-class America. In August of 1993, \nin his first year of the Presidency, that promise to lower taxes \nbecame, in reality, the largest tax increase in American history. I \nrepeat, the promise to lower taxes was fulfilled by raising taxes to \nthe highest level in American history.\n  Then came the elections of 1994 and the American public said, ``Now, \nwait a minute here. We were told we were going to have tax relief, and \nour tax bill has gone up. We were told that American Government would \nshrink, and we just witnessed the single largest proposal to enlarge \nthe Federal Government in American history.''\n  So we had the largest tax increase, which passed by one vote--that of \nthe Vice President, seated in the very chair that the Presiding Officer \noccupies right now, and that was followed by a suggestion that we \nshould expand the Federal Government to take over every aspect of \nhealth care, which was narrowly defeated.\n  So in 1994, the American public sent new leadership to the Congress, \nand they turned the Congress over after three decades of dominance by \nthe other party, and they elected a new majority.\n  The new Congress, Mr. President, designed a balanced budget, reduced \nthe size of the Federal Government, reduced Federal spending, and \noffered to lower taxes by the equivalent amount of money that the \nPresident had raised taxes. He raised taxes in 1993 by about $250 \nbillion, and the new Congress came in and lowered taxes by $245 \nbillion. So what it in effect was was a refund of that galloping tax \nincrease that hit the American public in 1993.\n  That went to the President and the President took his pen and struck \nit down. He vetoed the tax relief, he vetoed the balanced budget, and \nhe vetoed all the constraints that were represented in the balanced \nbudget. Now, even though it was vetoed, it was a historic achievement \nbecause it was the first time in over 30 years that a Congress proved \nthat it could, indeed, muster the courage and the muscle to pass a \nbalanced budget and at the same time lower working families' taxes. But \nit was vetoed.\n  Now we have two major events that have occurred here--in 1993, taxes \nwere raised to historical levels; in 1995, the Congress tries to refund \nthat and the President vetoes it.\n  We have another election. The President is reelected and he is \nreelected under the theme: The era of big Government is over; the era \nof big Government is over. The Congress is reelected in the House and \nthe Senate, the Congress that was committed to balanced budgets and tax \nrelief. The leadership of this Congress and the newly elected \nPresident, for his second term, decided to sit down, and they had \nhistorical meetings, both in the Capitol and at the White House, and \nthey announced a historical agreement that both will work for a \nbalanced budget, for tax relief and constrained spending.\n\n  Last night, the Senate Finance Committee passed to the full floor of \nthe Senate a proposal that honors the agreement for tax relief in the \nrange of $135 billion. That tax relief is not enough, but keep in mind \nit is an agreement between an institution--the White House is not all \nthat enamored with tax relief per the discussion we just had--and a \nCongress that would like it to be substantially more. At the end of the \nday, the proposal that will be coming to the Senate floor will be about \na refund equivalent of about 40 percent of that tax increase that was \nput in place by the President in 1993. So it is very meaningful and \nvery significant.\n  Just to remind the American public--no one can see this chart, but it \ngoes from 1950 to 1997, and you can see the trend. The percentage of \nthe Nation's wealth consumed by taxes has gone from 23.4 to almost 32 \npercent--up, up, up, and up.\n  This proposal that we will have coming before us is the first in well \nover a decade that would significantly lower that burden. A little \nlater on in my remarks I will talk further about the condition of the \naverage family, but we will take a moment and talk about some of the \ndetails of this tax relief. First of all, Mr. President, it is for \nkids. This is tax relief for children. The $500 per child tax credit \nwill help parents--that is per child--will help parents meet the needs \nof children and teenagers. We figure teenagers probably have the \nhighest economic impact on the family than even the real little ones, \nand that is the difference between us and the President. The \nPresident's proposal does not include tax relief for teenagers, but we \ndo and this proposal does. So it is a $500 per child tax credit to help \nparents meet the needs of children and teenagers because parents can \ndecide their children's needs better than Washington bureaucrats.\n  We are leaving the money in their checking account, not dragging it \nup here and then micromanaging it as to what is important in that \nfamily. Obviously, it is for the parents of these children. We make it \neasier in this tax relief for parents to afford their children's higher \neducation by building on the President's Hope education proposal and \nimproving it. We make it easier for parents to save and to invest for \ntheir own future by expanding IRA's and including a homemaker IRA that \nwill help either mothers at home or working mothers.\n  This is a plan for the grandparents in their retirement years. Those \nwho have worked hard and played by the rules and saved for retirement \nshould be rewarded, not punished, as is the current law. Some say, on \nthe other side of the aisle, you are rich--which is often characterized \nin an uncomplimentary fashion. I am also often amused by what is \nconsidered wealthy, and you do not have to have much to be targeted as \nbeing a wealthy person in America around this Washington establishment. \nOn the other side of the aisle they say you are rich if you put money \ninto mutual funds or contributed to a company retirement plan or built \na small business with your own sweat and labor, or run your own farm. \nAn average farmer would be categorized as rich, according to the other \nside of the aisle.\n\n  More than half of all taxpayers claiming capital gains have incomes \nunder $50,000. I want to repeat that. More than half of all taxpayers \nwho claim capital gains have incomes of less than $50,000, and most, or \nmany, are seniors who live a better life by converting their lifelong \ninvestments. Over the years, as we have heard argument after argument \nagainst lowering the tax on capital gains, we have heard time and time \nagain that that is just something for wealthy people; that is just \nsomething for rich people.\n  I repeat: More than half of all who claim capital gains earn less \nthan $50,000 a year.\n  Mr. President, I have noted the arrival of the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Budget Committee, who has played just a massive role in \nthese agreements and has been following the details of their \nfulfillment in great detail. I yield up to 15 minutes of our time--\nunless he needs more--to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I compliment Senator Coverdell, so soon after \ncompletion of the tax package and deficit reduction package, for him \nbeing on the floor encouraging Senators to evaluate it and to speak \nout. I think it is fair to say that no one has had an opportunity to \nreview, in detail, the tax bill that was written last night. Sometimes \npeople confuse the Budget Committee with the Finance Committee.\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\nThe Finance Committee is the tax-writing committee. It has a lot of \nadditional jurisdiction, including Medicare and Medicaid in the Senate. \nThe Budget Committee does not write the laws. It writes the budget \nresolution. But we try our best to keep abreast of what is going on.\n  The reconciliation bills will be up next week, and there are some \nvery technical rules about these bills. We will be careful to advise \neveryone on how to apply those technical rules and the way that is best \nto get the issues framed in the Senate and get the votes proceeding.\n  Today, I want to indicate that the package of tax cuts that the \nFinance Committee passed last night, from this Senator's standpoint, is \na very exciting package. In the Finance Committee package, \napproximately 82 percent of the tax relief is made up of a family tax \ncut that we Republicans have been promoting for almost 5 years, and \neducation assistance priorities, which we all share. Let me repeat that \nwe are going to hear a lot about some of the other tax proposals in \nthis bill. But our American citizens ought to understand that out of \nevery dollar in tax reductions in this bill, no matter what is said \nabout the remainder of the package, 82 percent of the tax relief is \nmade up of the $500 child credit and education assistance in this bill.\n  It represents the biggest tax cut in 16 years.\n  Now, some complain that it is not big enough. The American people \nshould know that, in our efforts to get a balanced budget put together, \nthis is not a huge tax cut. In the first 5 years, it is around $85 \nbillion. To put that into perspective, we spend about $1.6 billion \nevery year. Our gross domestic product, the sum of all input into the \neconomy, is well over $5 trillion, moving toward $6 trillion. So this \nis a tax cut that permits us to do some good things for the American \ntaxpayers, and I repeat that approximately 82 percent of the package \ngoes to families that are raising children; they get a tax cut of $500. \nWe call it this fancy name, ``tax credit.'' But, essentially, a tax \ncredit means that if you owed $5,000 in income taxes, you can take $500 \noff of that $5,000. There is no other way to say it than it is a tax \ncut. Most of it is for working men and women in America who are not \nparticularly wealthy.\n  We are never going to be able to produce a tax cut package that some \nSenators--particularly on the other side of the aisle--are not going to \nmoan about. They are going to moan that it goes to the wrong people. \nWell, some of them don't want a tax cut at all. Some just have to find \nsomething to make sure that the poor in the country believe that the \nother party is serving the poor better than we are. That is just too \nbad, because it is obvious in this American society, to most people \nthat look at our economic situation, that we ought to be doing more on \nthe capital formation side of this equation.\n\n  So while this bill is finally and firmly tax relief for middle-class \nfamilies, it does include some relief from capital gains taxes, and for \npeople with a home. It gives them a very generous $500,000 exclusion \nfrom capital gains tax for people who sell their house. But it also \nprovides some capital gains relief for many millions of Americans who \nsell an asset, be it a few shares of stock, a piece of real estate, a \nfamily lot that they inherited from their parents, or stock on the \nstock market. And we have not gone wild with reference to this capital \ngains tax. It is a pretty reasonable one, considering that we don't \nhave an awful lot of money to spend.\n  Obviously, no matter what is done with reference to death taxes, \nthere will be some who complain that you ought not change death taxes, \neven though we haven't changed the basic exemption for many, many \nyears. While inflation has built up, we have left it just like it was, \nand now millions of Americans--not a few hundred thousand--are looking \nout there saying that 50 to 55 percent of what they have accumulated on \ndeath is going to go to the Federal Government. We don't think that is \nexactly right--most of us--on our side. We think there ought to be much \nmore concern about the energizing of society and this economy that \ncomes with people who work hard because they want to accumulate wealth. \nWe don't want to take that away by making the death tax so onerous. We \nhaven't been able to change it very much in this bill, but there is \nsome improvement. It will take 10 years to be fully implemented. \nFrankly, we will hear some more about that, too. It is obvious that it \nis easy to talk about that as if it were something bad for us to try to \ngive some relief to these kinds of Americans who worked hard to build a \nbusiness up, who have been smart and accurate on how they have done \nthings. We are going to give them some tax relief. It is a small \nportion of this package. It is something we want to do. I am sure there \nare many Democrats that want to do this also, and I am quite sure \nsomething like the death tax relief in this bill is going to become \nlaw.\n  Now, let me repeat, this bill provides a $500 tax credit per child, \nbeginning the day the child is born. By making changes in the order \nthat the earned-income tax credit and new child credit are taken, the \nFinance package adds about 900,000 more children who will be eligible \nfor this tax relief than the House version of this bill. I believe that \nthis change that we now have a bill that we will not be accused of \nbeing unfair to a very large part of the working people in the country.\n  The earned-income tax credit--although it has been dramatically \nincreased--was a Republican idea, incidentally, for those who wonder. \nRonald Reagan was a staunch supporter of saying to those who want to \nwork for a living that we want to encourage you to work, even though \nyou are not making a lot of money. We want to discourage you from going \non welfare by giving you this earned-income tax credit. So it is for \nworking adults who are not earning enough in the eyes of Congress and \npast Presidents, and so we give them that earned-income tax credit.\n  When you look at the rest of this bill--at least the major \ncomponents--the cost of a college education has increased 234 percent \nsince 1980. The bill helps families save for college, helps students \npay for college and pay back certain loans, helps employers pay for \ntheir employee's education, which many of us have thought for a long \ntime is a very prudent thing to do. If you need more education in this \nsociety for better jobs and for the transition required in today's job \nmarket, if an employer wants to pay for it, we don't understand why the \nemployer should not be able to deduct that and why the employer should \nbe paying for that as if they earned money. So we are fixing that, to \nsome extent. It includes tax relief for education assistance provided \nby the employer side, which I have just alluded to, and it helps \nemployees maintain what many think is a new characteristic of American \nsociety, which is maintaining a lifelong learning opportunity.\n\n  It provides capital gains to help people generate more incentive to \ninvest in U.S. companies that provide jobs and help grow this economy. \nOne of the interesting things is that people can be in favor of jobs, \nbut oftentimes it is very difficult to make the case that there are a \nlot of ways to create jobs, and they are not singularly--in fact, the \nworst way in terms of cost effectiveness is for the Government to \nprovide programs that create jobs. We do that sometimes. In fact, in \nthe bill before us, we are going to have a $3 billion, 5-year program \non welfare jobs. Frankly, we agreed to it. I have very slim hope this \ninitiative will succeed. But we agreed on some things that I did not \nbelieve in and this was one of them.\n  When you invest in capital formation and help American companies \ngrow, they can build new modern plants, install efficient technology, \nyou, as an investor and a citizen, are deserving of an accolade that \nyou are helping create jobs. And so a capital gains tax cut should \nrecognize that jobs were created and the country benefited from the \ninvesting and risk taking that the investor was willing to take.\n  Actually, the capital gains provisions are pretty good. Last night \nthe committee partially corrected the discrimination against real \nestate--real estate that is depreciable, whether it is a building, \nwhether it is an office storage, or an office building, we came very \nclose to mistreating those investments. Thanks to some amendments last \nnight, it is getting closer to at least a reasonable treatment of the \ngain that comes when you sell that kind of an asset. It won't be the \nsame as the other\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\nasset sales, be it stock equity or your home, or other things, but we \nare moving in the right direction.\n  So I am pleased that the Senate bill treats capital gains investment \non real estate better than the House bill. I hope we keep that. It \nlowers the recapture rate to 24 percent. I actually believe that, in \ndue course, it ought to be the same as the overall capital gains rate. \nI know my friend from Georgia agrees with that. You only have so much \nmoney to go around and you can't do everything.\n  Now, I understand that one of the things we have problems with in our \ncountry--and I don't stand here saying that the IRA's in this bill are \ngoing to solve it. But America is now becoming known, worldwide, as the \ncountry that doesn't save. We love to spend, but we don't like to save. \nWe are very fortunate that, for the last 15 or 20 years, or so, our \ncredit has been so great, and our economy so stable, and the country so \nstable, that a lot of foreign money flows into America to pay our \ndebts.\n  But essentially, so long as we run big deficits--and hopefully we are \nputting a stop to that--and so long as the American people do not save \notherwise, we are still going to be the world's largest borrower and \nthe world's worst saver; that is, as a people and as business and as \nGovernment goes.\n  On the other hand, we are moving in the right direction. I for one \nthink that we ought to have universally IRA's. But we are not going to \nget there until we totally reform the Tax Code. But there are some \npowerful IRA provisions in this package. I am not sure that all of them \nwill stay through conference, and I am not sure that some won't be \nattacked here on the floor. But, nonetheless, the idea of doing \nsomething to encourage savings by middle-income Americans instead of \njust those who are at the top of the ladder is very exciting to me. \nCountries with the highest saving rates are moving in the direction of \ngreatest economic growth. Greater economic growth translates into \nbetter jobs, bigger paychecks and higher standards of living. For the \nhigher the savings rate--Japan has a high savings rate--some people \nsay, ``Well, they don't do it voluntarily.'' It is almost mandated by \ntheir government. But at least they do, and the government almost tells \nthem how much of their paycheck has to go into savings.\n  Some of the other countries in the Pacific rim have great savings \nprospects for their people. We have to do better. And we will be doing \nbetter, if this bill becomes law.\n  I alluded earlier to the death tax, and I am not going to say much \nmore about that.\n  But I do want to comment that I wish today I could tell people of New \nMexico--and I wish everybody could know in their States--the exact \nimpact of this tax bill on their States and their constituents. I \nunderstand, however, that the Tax Foundation has done that for the \nHouse bill.\n  So, if you want to know what the House bill has done in terms of the \ncitizens of your sovereign States, you can get that. It looks to me \nfrom what I can discern in terms of my State of New Mexico that the tax \nrelief numbers attributable to the people of my State from the Ways and \nMeans bill are worthy of stating because I think the final package will \nresult in bigger tax cuts for New Mexicans. I think the Senate Finance \npackage will result in bigger tax cuts than the Ways and Means package. \nSo I will be able to say to New Mexicans that we are going to do at \nleast this and probably better.\n  Let me just recite to show how important it is to a small State like \nmine. New Mexicans will save $388 million over 5 years because of the \nchild credit in the House bill. New Mexicans will have $388 million of \ntheir own money to spend on their families as a result of this tax \npackage. We are doing a little better under the Senate version.\n  It is common knowledge that, if you look at New Mexico you discover \nthat we have a lot of children in the families of the working poor. So \nI would assume for the working people who pay taxes that my State will \nget a higher benefit as a result of the ways the Finance Committee \n``stacked'' the earned income and new child credit. That is a pretty \ngood chunk of money that will stay in New Mexico rather than coming to \nWashington because of the $500 credit. That makes it kind of \nunderstandable. Mr. President, $338 million-plus will never leave our \ntaxpayers' pockets in New Mexico and come to Washington. It will stay \nthere.\n  Mr. President, New Mexicans will also save $229 million in additional \ndollars of their own money to spend on education for their children.\n  There are a couple of glitches in the bill. There will be a big \ndebate about should there be an IRA for education after the 13th year \nor 14th year. But when it is all taken into account the House bill has \n$229 million that will stay with New Mexico families to use on \neducation that they would otherwise send to Washington for us to \ndetermine how to spend it. And, obviously, we are very convinced on \nthis side of the aisle that both the child credit, the education-type \ndeductibles, and the like are better determined there in my home \nState--and the Senator's State of Georgia by his people, and our \npeople. So as much of that as we can leave there the better we feel and \nthe better we think the lives of our people will be.\n\n  So while this bill has a road ahead of it that may be thorny and may \nbe contentious--I am not speaking only of the tax bill--I believe it is \nnot too soon to come here and say, ``Well, this is what I am going to \ntry.'' There will be some additional spending money on child health \ncare. And I know that. I have an open mind. I want to hear the \ncommittee talk about it and report on it. I am of the opinion--and I \nknow it doesn't set well with some States--but I think the cigarette \ntax portion of it was inevitable. We could see that coming. And I think \nthe committee took 20 cents instead of 43 cents, which was proposed by \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Hatch, or Senator Hatch and Senator \nKennedy. And then it used that money for very good purposes, I think, \nof the bill. It spent some. And that is why many would like it all to \nhave gone for tax cuts.\n  But, you know, the bill came out with total bipartisan support. And I \nam not sure we need total bipartisan support on every major measure as \nit goes through the Senate. But I believe we started this budget \nexercise with a strong suggestion that we might get the package \nadopted. Frankly, that was because we recognized that the President was \nnot of our party and that we had to work with Democrats here in an \neffort to get something that the President would sign. There is no use \ngoing through another process as in 1993 where Democrats just passed a \nhuge tax increase or 1995 where just Republicans voted for an enormous \ntax reduction plan with reforms in every area only to find that it \nwould get vetoed.\n  The reality of it is--and Republicans are beginning to understand--\nthat we have a President who is not of our party. He is the President. \nIf we want to make a point, we can make a point. When we want to get \nsomething done, it is pretty obvious that we have to have him as a part \nin getting it done as a team.\n  So I am hopeful. We are moving in that direction.\n  I thank the Senator for arranging the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor, as usual, his eloquent description of this proposal.\n  I would make one comment. And then I am going to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah.\n  When you talk about savings, in my judgment, the force that has more \nto do with destroying savings is Uncle Sam. When something marches \nthrough an average person's checking account and takes over half, as \nthey do today--a 45-percent tax is the cost of Government, and higher \ninterest rates because of the deficit--there isn't anything left to \nsave in an average family. You can look at every data and see exactly \nwhat has happened as we ratchet up the amount that the Government takes \nout of that checking account. We closed savings accounts all over the \ncountry. Until we start moving resources, as the Senator described, for \nNew Mexico back into their savings accounts, we are never going to have \nthem open savings accounts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator should also add that as the deficit turns \ninto\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\ndebt--that is the accumulation of the deficit, the debt--you have to go \nout and borrow that money. And essentially that is not saving. To the \nextent that you have to go borrow the money, you have to get it from \nsomewhere. And our biggest activity for not saving has been the \ndeficit. It gobbles it up, and it isn't available. It is used for that, \nif nothing else, plus the fact that high taxes prevent you from being \nable to have any left over, which is your premise here today. We are \nnot in the greatest shape in just that one area. The economy looks \npretty good. It looks like we are moving in the right direction in how \nwe treat our American business. It seems like they have a little more \nfreedom than European companies. We find that they do better for us and \nbetter for workers that way. That is better than most countries. But \nsaving is still something that we are working very hard on. If we can \nget the deficit down to zero, we are surely moving in the direction of \nputting more savings into the total pot of savings for growth, \nprosperity, and other uses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I yield up to 10 or 12 minutes to the Senator from Utah, or, if he \nneeds 15, I will yield that as well.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have come here because I have seen a \nseries of articles that have appeared in the newspapers. I am not a \nbeliever in a conspiracy theory. But I think there is a movement afoot \nto give us a steady drumbeat of repetition of a particular theme coming \nout of those who are opposed to any kind of tax relief. And I picked \ntwo examples to show what this drumbeat is.\n\n  The first one appeared in the Washington Post, written by Alan \nBlinder. Alan Blinder, Mr. President, used to be the Vice Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board. He is now a professor of economics at \nPrinceton.\n  He starts his presentation this way:\n\n       I have always opposed cutting the capital gains tax, and \n     still do. The case is simple and compelling. No one has yet \n     produced evidence that lower capital gains taxes will lead to \n     higher savings and investment; claims that they are just \n     hunches. But we do know that a lower capital gains tax will \n     shift some of the tax burden from the haves to the have-nots \n     just when income disparities are at postwar highs.\n\n  Then he goes on to say how terrible the capital gains tax rate is and \nlaments the fact that he and others like him have lost the debate.\n  A few days later Robert Kuttner wrote the following, again in the \nWashington Post. I would tell you who Robert Kuttner is, if I knew. But \nI am not as familiar with him as I am Alan Blinder.\n  He says, referring to capital gains tax:\n\n       . . . with the stock market setting new records, the timing \n     is a bit off.\n       It's hard to argue with a straight face that the prospect \n     of paying capital gains tax is deterring much productive \n     investment.\n\n  Again, another drumbeat along the idea that cutting the capital gains \ntax is really nothing more than a way of putting more money into the \npockets of the rich--that it will not increase investment, that it will \nnot increase savings. Those who say that it will are ignoring the \neconomic evidence. And these economists make this case over and over \nagain. I submit to you, Mr. President, that they are shooting at a \nstraw man. Either they do not understand the impact of capital gains \ntaxes in the economy, or they don't want us to know what capital gains \ntaxes really do to the economy because I am not going to stand here and \nargue with Professor Blinder on his turf. I want to take him to my \nturf, which is the marketplace. I want to take him to the marketplace \nwhere real people make real economic decisions in real life, and not \nthe classroom where people argue about it.\n  Let's start out with a little bit of classroom conversation, however, \nto set the context for this. I submit to you this truth, Mr. President: \nAll wealth comes from accumulated capital.\n  If someone somewhere does not stop spending everything he creates in \nthe way of product and saves some of it, accumulates some of it, there \nwill never be any wealth. Out of accumulated capital comes factories. \nOut of accumulated capital comes machine tools. Out of accumulated \ncapital comes the infrastructure that then produces more wealth.\n  The argument in society in the last century or so has not been over \nthat truth. It has been over the question of who should own the \naccumulated wealth.\n  Karl Marx, and others, said that society as a whole should accumulate \nwealth but that individuals should not. We have already seen one \nsociety give us an example of what happens when society holds all of \nthe accumulated wealth and does not allow individual property \naccumulation. That example was called the Soviet Union, and it is the \npremier economic basket case of this century. It has wreaked absolute \nhavoc in the lives of all of its people.\n  Still the notion that society should own accumulated wealth has some \ncurrency in the world, and there are those who call themselves \nSocialists based on their notion that society should own everything and \nthat the wealth should be accumulated by society. We have a different \nnotion in this country. We go back to the writings of Adam Smith, who \ncoincidentally wrote his book, ``The Wealth Of Nations'' in 1776, which \nwas a good year for this country: The wealth should be held in private \nhands, that when private people accumulate wealth, they do better \nthings with it than when society as a whole accumulates wealth.\n\n  Why is this important? Because the capital gains tax is a tax on \nmovement of accumulated wealth. It is not a tax on the wealth itself, \nit is only a tax that is levied when there is a movement of that wealth \nfrom one entity to another; or, in our circumstance, from one \nindividual to another, one private corporation to another private \ncorporation.\n  I now give you the second great truth that applies in the \nmarketplace. All wealth comes from risk-taking. If someone is not \nwilling to take a risk and invest his or her accumulated wealth in that \nfactory or that machine tool or that plow, with no guarantees that the \ninvestment is going to pay off, the wealth that comes from the factory \nor the machine tool or the plow will never be there. So these two \nprinciples guide what we are doing: All wealth comes from accumulated \ncapital and all wealth comes from risk-taking.\n  So, what happens when a private individual or corporation accumulates \nsome wealth, accumulates some capital, takes some risk and creates some \nwealth, and then decides to move that from one investment to another? \nThe Government steps in and says we will tax that movement. That is \nwhat the capital gains tax is all about. We will tax the movement of \naccumulated capital from one investment to another.\n  This is what happens--real example, real world, not classroom stuff \nnow. I will give you an example of a friend of mine who invested at \ngreat risk in a new venture. He is that kind of fellow. He is an \nentrepreneur. He takes risks. I'll keep the numbers very simple. \nObviously there are more accounting details to this, but the \nillustration is accurate. He made, let us say, $100,000, and to keep it \nsimple let's rule out the tax base. Let's say he has a cost of zero. In \nfact it was not that, but a gain of $100,000.\n  So now he has $100,000 of accumulated wealth, but what has happened \nto his investment? Over the years that it has grown from zero to \n$100,000, it has become what we call a mature investment. That is, it \nis now earning 10 percent a year and that's about the prospect for this \ninvestment from now on. And this guy, because he is an entrepreneur, is \nrestless with a 10 percent return. He wants to take some bigger risks \nand do some other things with his money. He sees an opportunity over \nhere that will produce him a 20 percent return. Yes, it has a risk. He \nis willing to take the risk. He is willing to move his accumulated \ncapital from company A to company B. And the Feds step in and say, ``We \nwant 28 percent of that, or $28,000.'' And the States, of course, \nfollow right along. He is going to end up, moving his capital from \ncompany A to company B, with $65,000 worth of accumulated capital \ninstead of $100,000.\n  Now, if he earns a 20 percent return on $65,000, for 3 years he will \nnot even break even, back up to his $100,000 where he was. And the \n$100,000, if he had left it alone, would have earned an\n\n[[Page S6035]]\n\nadditional $30,000. He has to earn a 20 percent return on his $65,000 \ninvestment for 5 years just to get even with where he would be if he \nhad left his capital alone.\n  Well, you say, so what? This is a rich man, he has $100,000; why are \nyou concerned about him? I am concerned--not about him. He can take \ncare of himself just fine. I am concerned about the people in company B \nwho will not get jobs because they cannot attract investors. Why can't \nthey attract investors? Because the entrepreneurs have their money \nlocked up in the investment that only earns 10 percent.\n  He can find somebody who can buy investment A very easily. There are \nlots of people to say we would be satisfied with a 10 percent return in \na mature company, absolutely. We will buy your stake and let you go out \nand run the risk to do something else. But, no, the capital, by virtue \nof the capital gains tax, is locked into investment A, because the \nentrepreneur says I can't afford the tax hit to move my investment \ncapital from investment A to investment B. Therefore, I will not be \nbacking the new rising company that needs funds.\n  These people whom I quoted at the beginning say the stock market is \ngoing through the roof, and what do they offer as proof of that? The \nDow Jones averages. How many people understand the Dow Jones averages \nare derived from 30 stocks? The Dow Jones Corp. picks 30 companies, \nbaskets them together into a single average, and what happens to the \nprices of those 30 stocks is described as what is happening to the \nmarket as a whole. Yes, they are probably doing a pretty good job of \npicking some representative stocks, but understand they have only \npicked 30 companies. The Standard & Poor's index has 500 companies in \nit, and you know what? It's not going up quite as much as the Dow. Then \nthere is the little known, little followed stock index called the \nRussell 2000, and as the name indicates, it has 2,000 stocks. But none \nof the Russell 2,000 stocks are in the Standard & Poor's 500 or even in \nthe Dow 30. These are the new entrepreneurial companies where the jobs \nfor the next decade are going to be created. Do you know what is the \nstory in the Russell index? It is down. It is not up the way the Dow \nis. It is not up the way the Standard & Poor's is. It is down.\n\n  These little companies, struggling along, entrepreneurial efforts, \nneed money. Where are they going to get the investment? Are they going \nto get it from the big venture capitalists who like to back them? \nMaybe, if they can make their presentation. But they will find, time \nand again, that the venture capitalists who would otherwise be taken \nwith their presentation and give them backing will say to them, ``I'm \nsorry, I am locked in by the capital gains tax. I am locked in with an \ninvestment that would cost me so much in tax, if I were to sell and \nback you, that I will not make that money available to you.'' I have \npersonally seen this phenomenon take place. I have been present when \ndiscussions of this have gone on, and I know, very differently from the \nway it may appear in a classroom, that in the real market the capital \ngains tax at its present level is stopping entrepreneurs from moving \ntheir capital from one investment to the other and making capital \navailable to the entrepreneurial companies that would create the jobs \nof the future.\n  I said on this floor before and I repeat here again, I challenge \nevery Member of this body to go home to his or her home State, gather \nthe venture capitalists in the home State together, gather the real \nestate investors, if you will, in the home State together, and ask this \none question: Are there deals that should be done not being done \nbecause of the capital gains tax? I have asked that question in my home \nState and I am told, almost with a laugh: All over, Senator. Everywhere \nyou look there are deals that should be done, certainly could be done, \nbut are not being done because of the capital gains tax.\n  Now, ask this question: Are the deals that should be done the deals \nthat have the greatest potential for job creation in the future? And \nthe answer is, once again: Yes. So then I ask the question: What is \ngoing on? And I am told, look, Senator, there are so many cockamamie \ntrade-outs being done, ways to avoid a realization of any kind of a \ngain that are being put together by lawyers and accountants because \nthey want to back this in one way or another but they cannot take the \nhit that will come if they move their capital from investment A to \ninvestment B, so they are jerry-rigging all kinds of deals that will \nultimately rise up and bite them in ways that will be detrimental.\n  I started off by quoting Alan Blinder, with whom I disagree, and \nidentifying him as a former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. \nI close by quoting the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan \nGreenspan. Alan Greenspan has a reputation of his own. He has a \nreputation that has brought him praise from Members of this body on \nboth sides of the aisle. I have sat in the Banking Committee and on the \nJoint Economic Committee and heard my Democratic colleagues \ncongratulate Mr. Greenspan for the deft and intelligent way he has \nhandled monetary policy in this country.\n  Mr. Greenspan tells us what the capital gains tax rate ought to be \nfor the greatest benefit of the economy. He recommends a capital gains \ntax rate, not of 18 percent, as proposed out of the Finance Committee, \nnot of 14 percent, as proposed by the Dole campaign, but zero. Because \nhe understands the basic principles that I outlined in the beginning: \nAll wealth comes from the process of investing accumulated capital and \nall wealth comes from risk-taking with that capital. The capital gains \ntax is a tax on that process. The capital gains tax by definition is a \ntax that will hold down the creation of wealth.\n  Alan Greenspan understands that the greatest boon that can come for \nthis country is the creation of more and more wealth and that is why he \ncalls for a capital gains tax rate of zero. I think we are being very \nmodest when we call for a capital gains tax rate of 18 percent. I hope \nthose responsible for these articles and these comments in the \nWashington Post would go back to school at the feet of Professor \nGreenspan and learn again where wealth comes from and what we need to \ndo in the Government to foster its creation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Will the Senator from Utah \nwithhold?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, on behalf of the present occupant of the \nchair, I will yield myself 10 minutes and also ask unanimous consent \nthe order be extended by the same amount.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate you and thank you for \nproviding this opportunity for us to talk a little bit today about \ntaxes to our colleagues and to the American people. I do rise in \nsupport of the tax reform proposals that have been offered by the \nRepublican Congress. Yesterday I presided over the Senate for an hour \nand listened to an hour of Republican bashing on taxes. I am here today \nto proudly say that if it were not for Republicans in this body, we \nwould not be debating tax cuts for the American people at all. We would \nonly be talking about increased spending--not increased spending that \nthe American people helps to decide on, just increased spending. And \nincreased spending leads to increased taxes.\n\n  So, I am proud to be working on a tax cut proposal for this Congress. \nThe American people have not received serious tax relief for 16 years. \nEarlier this year I had the pleasure of chairing a committee hearing in \nWyoming on small business. One of the groups that appeared there was \nthe Society of CPA's. They asked for tax simplification and tax cuts \nfor the American people.\n  You might say that's kind of a strange bunch to want tax \nsimplification, but I have to tell you it is so complicated that their \nliability is hanging out. It is difficult for them to meet the needs of \nthe people. If you call the Internal Revenue Service on successive days \nwith a tax question, you will most likely get different answers on that \ntax question. But they were reluctant to ask for the simplification \nbecause\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\nevery time they have worked on simplification in this country, we have \nwound up with tax increases. That is one of the things we are here to \nguard against, is tax increases. And we are proposing a tax package \nthat provides for nearly $85 billion in net tax cuts over the next 5 \nyears. It is the first step in providing the American people with the \ntax relief they so richly deserve.\n  This tax package provides broad-based tax relief for America's \nfamilies. This is just the first step toward peeling back the \nmonumental tax hike passed by the Democratic Congress and President \nClinton in 1993.\n  It should come as no surprise that the administration and many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle began bashing the \nRepublican's tax proposal almost as soon as it was unveiled.\n  A brief review of the last 5 years illustrates that this \nadministration believes that a bloated Federal Government knows better \nhow to spend your money than you do. President Clinton's tax hike in \n1993 punished the American people by burdening them with more than $240 \nbillion--billion--in new taxes. The President's tax increase was the \nlargest in American history and it came after--after--the President had \npromised that he would offer middle-class tax relief. The Republican \ntax package would give Americans back some of the hard-earned money \nthat was taken from them 4 years ago.\n  We in Washington must never forget that we are talking about the \npeople's money. As an accountant--and I am the only accountant in the \nU.S. Senate, which I like to humorously say probably accounts for the \ndifficulty in getting tax cuts and balanced budgets--I hear people talk \nabout how happy they are that the Government gave them a tax refund \nthis year. I have to remind some of them that that wasn't the \nGovernment giving them a tax refund, that was them overpaying their \ntaxes, the already overexorbitant taxes overpaid, and they were getting \nback their own money. We get confused, particularly in Washington, and \nwe have to remember that we are talking about the people's money.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to have \nforgotten this. They apparently believe it is the job of the Federal \nGovernment to take as much money away from the private citizens as they \npossibly can and then set themselves up as a ``committee of \nGovernment'' who divides that money up to take care of everyone as they \nsee fit.\n  Mr. President, this is wrong. We should allow citizens to keep more \nof their own money and make their own decisions on how it should be \nspent. Government often purports to know more about our own needs than \nwe do. But you know best how to spend your own money. History has \ndemonstrated that the American people will use their money more wisely \nand more efficiently than we in Congress will. While they are doing \nthat, they will be very compassionate, as well as constructive.\n  The Republican tax package is aimed at providing broad-based tax \nrelief for the majority of the American people. The $500-per-child tax \ncredit would provide $81 billion in tax relief for America's families \nover the next 5 years. This idea has been championed by the Republican \nParty as a means of helping America's families. The President thought \nit was such a good idea that he has even campaigned on it.\n  Many families today have two parents working: one of them works to \npay the bills, the other one works to pay the taxes. We should be \nworking to strengthen our American families in any way that we can. \nTaxes are our tax policy, and we should be disappointed and embarrassed \nby what our tax policy says. We should not be strangling American \nfamilies with a punitive Tax Code that penalizes marriages. It provides \nvery little tax relief for families with children. It punishes people \nwith a further tax on interest income when they try to save for their \nkids' college educations or for their own retirement. To add insult to \ninjury, we even tax people when they die.\n  We kind of have this tax policy in the United States that if it \nmoves, you tax it, and if it won't move, you tax it; when you buy it, \nyou tax it; when you sell it, you tax it; and if you happen to die \nowning something, we're going to tax half of that, too.\n  I listened to much of the debate yesterday by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who claim this is a tax cut for the wealthy. \nThis claim has absolutely no basis in fact unless you play with \nstatistics. I watched the charts yesterday. We should have truth in \nadvertising on the Senate floor. We saw charts that indicated that \npeople earning $30,000 a year would only get a $50-a-year tax credit. \nThat is playing with the truth. They said that people who earned \n$400,000 would get $7,000 in tax relief. That is also lying with \nstatistics.\n  Take the $500 tax credit all by itself. If you earn $30,000 and you \nhave kids, you would get a tax credit of $500 per child, and as I heard \nso eloquently explained earlier by my colleague from New Mexico, that \nis a tax credit. That means you don't take it off the income part of \nyour tax statement, you take it off the taxes that you owe. You get to \nfill it out clear down to the balance first, and that is where you get \nthe biggest tax cut. You figure your tax bill, and then you get to \nsubtract from your tax bill this $500-per-child tax credit.\n  I assure you that people who are earning $30,000, as most of you \nknow, pay taxes, and if you pay taxes and you have kids, you get the \ntax credit, you get a $500-a-year credit for that child. That is quite \na bit bigger than the $50 that was claimed here yesterday.\n  If you take and lump everybody together, there are a whole bunch of \npeople who are earning money who are not even married yet and don't \nhave kids. They are looking forward to that tax credit, but they are \nnot earning it. If you combine all of those, maybe you can get it down \nto an average of $50 per person who pays taxes in the $30,000 tax \nbracket. I would like to see a lot more detail on the kind of charts \nthat we saw.\n\n  We did pass welfare reform. That was the American people saying that \nwe do expect people in this country to work and pay taxes. The credit \nwould not go to people who do not pay taxes. We are not going to pay \npeople not to work. What we are talking about here is the ability of \nthe people in the United States to still enjoy the American dream. The \nAmerican dream of owning their own home, their own car, to be able to \nbe an entrepreneur; have an idea, go out and start a business and have \nthat business grow into one of the biggest in the country. When they \nstart that business, they are hoping that they can be doing it for \ntheir kids as well; that there will be money that can go to their kids.\n  They are hoping to be able to pass some money on to the next \ngeneration. They are worried about their kids. I know a lot of people \nwho have homesteaded in the West and spent every dime that they have \nearned off their farm or ranch to buy more land so that they would have \nland to pass on to their kids. Something interesting is happening out \nin the West, and that is, a whole bunch of people are moving into \nWyoming from other States, and they are willing to pay a lot more for \nland than what the cows will produce on the land. The price of land has \nbeen increasing greatly. That is what they have to pay an inheritance \non. They are taking away their ability to pass it on to their kids, a \nway of life, a way their kids anticipated earning money.\n  I saw a program the other night about the new millionaires. \nMillionaires, we consider them to be rich. I can tell you--not from \npersonal experience I can't--but from looking at people's returns, \ntoday's millionaires are not nearly as rich as years-ago millionaires. \nIt is happening today, and the way it is happening is people who are \nworking on assembly lines or in small business are taking a little bit \nof money out of their check--I know it is difficult to do--but they are \ntaking that money and investing it, and when they get to retirement \nage, some are now finding because of these investments they have been \ndoing for years and years, the business has been successful enough, \nthey worked hard enough at their job to make that business successful, \nthat the stock they bought is worth over $1 million. And then they die \njust at the time they get to their retirement, and the Federal \nGovernment says your kids aren't entitled to that, even though you \nworked for it for yourself and your kids all of that time. We, the \nFederal Government, are entitled to almost half of that money. We \ndidn't do anything to help it, but we get it.\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\n  The fact is that the overwhelming majority of the tax cut contained \nin the Senate's tax package go to middle-income families. According to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, which is Congress' official tax \nestimator, 74 percent of the benefits of the tax relief bill will go to \nindividuals and families making $75,000 or less. Moreover, 82 percent \nof the benefits would go to families with educational needs, these \nmiddle-income families who were hardest hit by the Democrats' radical \ntax hike in 1993, and this is the group that is in most need of serious \ntax relief.\n  What many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really want \nto return to is welfare. They want to raise the taxes on people who are \nnow paying taxes to give more money to those who aren't paying any \ntaxes at all. That is not tax relief, it is welfare. Moreover, the \nbudget proposal already provides for $1\\2/10\\ trillion in spending for \nthe next 5 years. The tax proposal would be a good first step in \nallowing families and small businesses and those who save to keep more \nof their own.\n  We need to get beyond the misstatements and distortions and give the \nAmerican people meaningful tax relief. As we prepare for the debate on \nthe tax package next week, I ask my colleagues to join me in this \nendeavor.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and wish the Chair a good afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6030-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6037-S6038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRANS-ALASKA PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues that 20 years \nago today, a truly historic event occurred in my State of Alaska that \nhad much to do with the shaping of the character of our State probably \nas much as the majestic and unique parts of our State, whether it be in \nthe mountains or glaciers.\n  On June 20, 1977, at 10:06 a.m. at Prudhoe Bay, AK, the crude oil \ndiscovered on the North Slope 9 years earlier began to flow. It began \nits journey south some 800 miles to the ice-free port of Valdez through \nthe Trans-Alaska pipeline. That first trip, which now takes about 5 \ndays for the oil to move, took over 1 month to complete and marked the \nculmination of the largest private construction project ever undertaken \nin the history of North America.\n  Since that time, every citizen has benefited from this marvel of \nAmerican engineering, but few really understand how significant this \nfeat was and how much it has contributed to our Nation. The pipeline \ntook 3 years of construction.\n  The total cost was about $8 billion. The initial estimate was just \nunder $1 billion. However, in today's dollars, that would equate to \nabout $22 to $25 billion. It was truly a marvel, one of the engineering \nwonders of the world. It took 2,215 State and Federal permits to \nproceed. Today, it is estimated to take over 5,000. Approximately \n70,000 people were used as a work force; over 3 million tons of \nmaterials were shipped to Alaska for construction; 73 million cubic \nyards of gravel were used; 13 bridges, ranging from 177 feet to 2,295 \nfeet had to be constructed going across the Yukon River; 834 rivers \nwere crossed; three mountain ranges as well.\n  Since that time, Mr. President, that pipeline has been subject to \nearthquakes, it has been subject to bombing, dynamite has been wrapped \naround it, it has been shot at so many times too numerous to count--but \nit has withstood those rigors of Mother Nature as well as mankind.\n  While there was a terrible accident associated with the grounding of \nthe Exxon Valdez, which was of course due to negligence on behalf of \nthose who were operating that vessel, the Prince William Sound is \ncleaned up today, and it is continuing its contributions as one of the \nmost productive bodies of water on Earth. From the standpoint of the \nrenewability of the fisheries and marine resources of the area--I do \nnot mean to belittle the significance of that tragedy--but Mother \nNature has a way of cleansing, and it was helped by a good deal of \nfunding, commitment and expertise from Alaskans and those outside. But \nthe fact remains, this pipeline continues to contribute a great deal to \nthe economy of this country.\n  Certainly much of the permitting process, and to a large degree the \ncontinuity of maintaining quality and environmental concerns, are a \nresponsibility of the Federal Government as well as the State \ngovernment which watched over the construction and the operation and \nmade sure it was done responsibly. But those groups did not stand in \nthe way of construction.\n  Since the pipeline first flowed on June 20, 1977, the pipeline has \nproduced and provided the United States with over 25 percent of the \ndomestic crude oil produced in the United States and about 10 percent \nof total U.S. daily consumption of crude oil, to give you some idea of \nthe significance of this particular and unique all-American pipeline.\n  So, as a consequence, as we look at our situation today, this \npipeline has contributed significantly to U.S. energy independence and, \nI might add, energy independence that is in serious jeopardy.\n  Consider this for just a moment, Mr. President. In 1994, domestic \nflow production dropped to 6.6 million barrels a day, the lowest since \n1954. National demand has increased to more than 17.7 million barrels \nper day, the highest level since the mid-1970's. The United States \nimported 51 percent of its oil in 1994. Today, we are importing a \nlittle over 52 percent, but according to the Department of Energy, U.S. \ndependence on foreign oil is expected to rise to nearly 70 percent by \nthe year 2000.\n  If not for the trans-Alaska pipeline, we might have already reached \n70 percent imported oil. How much higher would our gasoline prices be \nwithout that pipeline? How much more likely would we be putting our \nchildren and grandchildren in harm's way on foreign soil to protect our \ndomestic interests if we were importing more than 70 percent of our \noil? Because, make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the Persian Gulf \nconflict was about keeping the flow of oil for the benefit of the \nworld.\n  We have always had an environmental concern over the pipeline. It was \npredicted that this pipeline, going through permafrost, which is frozen \nground, and being a hot pipeline carrying warm oil, would cause heat \ngeneration and melt the permafrost, and, therefore, the pipeline would \ncontinually go further and further down, to fulfill perhaps a self-\npropelling prophecy that was suggested it would end up in China some \nday. Didn't we always know as kids, if you went down far enough, you \nwould end up in China? Well, clearly that has not happened, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The pipeline operates in permafrost. The hot oil flows through the \npipeline, but the pipeline was clearly engineered to withstand that. It \nwas suggested that this pipeline across 800 miles of Alaska would cause \nthe animals, the wildlife associated with it, be it the polar bear, the \ngrizzly bear, the brown bear, the black bear, the caribou, or the \nmoose, to somehow have a fence they could not cross. The facts are, at \nthe pipeline and the buried sections, the animals browse on it in the \nearly spring because the small amount of heat generated causes the \ngrasses to come up first, and it has become a sight and attraction. We \nsee the caribou in their migration standing on top of the buried \npipeline because there is more wind there and there are less \nopportunities for mosquitoes. So to suggest that it has somehow \nrestricted the natural flow of wildlife certainly has not occurred.\n  One can bottom line it and simply say the predictions of the \nenvironmental groups who said this was going to be some kind of \nenvironmental disaster have not occurred. It has been successful. It \nhas done its job, and continues.\n  To suggest it has not had its share of problems or there have not \nbeen mechanical failures and there have not been human failures--of \ncourse there have. I have always supported stringent oversight of the \npipeline. We have been working with the Joint Pipeline Office and the \nDepartment of Transportation, and the effort has been successful.\n  But every now and then we find opponents of development in Alaska who \nare looking for a cause, the cause of membership or cause of dollars or \nperhaps they bring up some of the young attorneys from Harvard or Brown \nto do\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\nmissionary work in Alaska by representing one or another of the \nenvironmental groups. I think we have some 62 in Anchorage now.\n\n  They need a cause. And one of their favorite topics, when things are \nslow, is to come out with a report that somehow the pipeline is in \nperil, somehow the pipeline is not being operated in the most efficient \nmanner from the standpoint of the public interest.\n  First of all, Mr. President, those who own the pipeline, the major \nowners--ARCO, Exxon--produce petroleum. Their interest is moving oil, \nmoving oil safely, moving oil economically. To do anything less than \nthat would be detrimental to their own interest.\n  The State of Alaska maintains an oversight, the Federal Government \nmaintains an oversight. But nevertheless, we continually see reports \nthat purposely mislead the public about the Trans-Alaska pipeline.\n  Those of us in the Senate know that if you do not have your electric \ncode book up to date--and there are 25,000 or 30,000 separate entries--\nyou can be classified by an agency as having 25,000 or 30,000 \nviolations. It does not mean that your code book has not been updated \nduring the last year for any number of reasons.\n  So we have had critics of the pipeline from time to time issuing \nreports intended to portray some of these problems as standard \noperating procedure for pipeline management rather than an exception. \nOf course, it generates for those particular organizations \ncontributions and in some cases generates membership. But these claims \nare in stark contrast to recent oversight reports by responsible State \nand Federal agencies tasked with the oversight responsibility.\n  In 1995, the U.S. Department of Transportation audited the Office of \nPipeline Safety to determine its effectiveness in ensuring the Trans-\nAlaska pipeline operations minimize risk to life and property. The \naudit concluded the operation ``is effectively monitoring and \ninspecting [the pipeline]. Also, when violations were identified, OPS \ntook enforcement actions against Alyeska'' and made corrections.\n  In August of 1995, at the request of Congress, the GAO completed an \naudit of the pipeline operators and their response to identified \ndeficiencies. The report concluded that ``Alyeska has taken substantive \nactions that, if carried through to completion, appear to be adequate \nto correct the problems.''\n  Last year, the Joint Pipeline Office concluded that Alyeska has \nimplemented its revised quality control for the pipeline sufficiently \nto allow its full approval.\n  So, Mr. President, these are the responsible agencies and current \nreports we have on hand. We have no reason to doubt their accuracy.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Alaska truly is a great State, a great big \npiece of real estate. We have many great assets, including our people \nand the resources that we have. On this date, I would like to \nespecially recognize the role the Trans-Alaska pipeline has had in \nshaping our State and the benefits it has provided to this Nation's \nenergy and natural security interests.\n  Finally, Mr. President, on July 18-20, I am going to be leading a \nnumber of our colleagues to Alaska to look at the issues related to \nresource development of Alaska's Arctic, specifically the Trans-Alaska \npipeline and other areas where truly the wealth of North America is \ncoming from the Arctic.\n  I remind the Presiding Officer that Alaska just happens to be the \nonly State with any Arctic in it. So as part of that trip, we will take \na close look at the marvels of the Trans-Alaska pipeline, what it has \nmeant to this Nation. I look forward to leading this group, and I \nencourage my colleagues to join with me on this important trip.\n  Finally, in conclusion, on the 20th anniversary of the Trans-Alaska \npipeline, I would like to congratulate those workers who operate and \nhave operated this pipeline for the last 20 years against tremendous \nodds, extraordinary climactic conditions, and have done it in a manner \nof recognizing that American technology and ingenuity and can-do spirit \ncan just about overcome any adversity and any particular challenge of \nthe time.\n  The successful operation of the Trans-Alaska pipeline for the last 20 \nyears, I think, has proven that indeed the men and women who are \nassociated with the pipeline and the Alyeska crew are certainly up to \nthe task.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6037-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6038-S6039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              134TH BIRTHDAY OF THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, today is the 134th birthday of the State \nwhich I have been so pleased and so proud and so privileged and so \nhonored to represent in Congress since January 1953. Born of the \nturmoil of the Civil War, West Virginia has never had an easy time of \nit. Although blessed with great beauty and rich in natural resources, \nmy State's rugged terrain and isolated geography have worked to make \nher people a breed apart.\n  Their independent views--they are a mountain people; mountain people \ntraditionally have independent views, whether they live in Switzerland \nor Afghanistan or in Scotland or in West Virginia--their independent \nviews, their impoverishment, their fierce loyalty to their communities, \nto their State and to their country have made them fodder for bad \njokes, degrading sitcoms and derogatory nicknames.\n  Well, I am here to tell those who would perpetuate such hackneyed \nstereotypes that it is they--it is they--who are backward, because in \nWest Virginia's hollows and on her mountains live some of the finest \npeople in all of God's great creation.\n  For the most part, West Virginians are religious. They don't have, as \nsome would like to portray, rattlesnakes in their church services. They \nare traditional in their outlook, they are reverent about their tried-\nand-true customs and patriotic about their Nation.\n  In World War II, West Virginia ranked fifth among the States in the \npercentage of its eligible male population participating; first among \nthe States in eligible male population participating in the Korean war; \nsecond among the States in the percentage of its eligible male \npopulation participating in the Vietnam war. Also, West Virginia ranked \nfirst among the States in the percentage of deaths its eligible male \npopulation suffered during both the Korean and Vietnam wars.\n  West Virginians are generally quiet. They are not loud talkers. I \ndon't like loud talkers. They are not loud talkers. You would not hear \nthem from one end of the Capitol to the other talking with loud voices \nin the corridors. They don't do that. They are generally quiet, \ncourteous, sincere, and accommodating.\n  There is a presence of basic values among her residents that is \nscarce in much of the Nation in many places. West Virginians value hard \nwork. They are not afraid of it. They love their families. They have a \nrespect for authority. We don't burn flags in Weirton, WV, where there \nare at least 30 ethnic groups from the old world. They have respect for \ntheir communities and a love for their country and reverence for a \nCreator.\n  They don't go around wearing their religion on their sleeves. They \ndon't make a big whoop-de-doo of it, and, as far as I am concerned, \nmost are not the religious right or the religious left. They are simply \nrespectful of a Creator and quietly religious.\n  More and more people are discovering our State. The crime is low in \nWest Virginia, life is slower there and stress seems to float away, to \nbe replaced by the serenity of beauty, charm and uncomplicated \ncourtesy. Our unique mountain crafts attract attention nationwide, as \ndo our scenic parks and our recreational activities.\n  West Virginia really is a world apart. My State has come a long way \nfrom the days when she was plundered by industrial barons who lived \noutside her borders, plundered for her rich natural resources, and many \nof her citizens were used as little more than indentured servants in \nthose days in the dangerous dirty work of mining coal, for example. \nToday, she is experiencing new economic growth and prosperity as a \nresult of new roads.\n  When I was a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, the \nlower house of the West Virginia Legislature in 1947, West Virginia had \n4 miles--West Virginia had 4 miles--of divided four-lane highways--4 \nmiles. That was when I was starting out in politics, now 51 years ago. \nFour miles, and then one need not wonder why West Virginians become \nindignant when a few dollars are appropriated by the Federal Government \nto build safe, modern four-\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\nlane divided highways in West Virginia; a few dollars compared with the \nbillions of dollars that go for airports, go for mass transit and other \nmodes of transportation elsewhere.\n  So she is experiencing new economic growth. Travel our highways now, \nview the scenery now, experience the hospitality now, see the historic \nplaces, stand on the tops of those mountains and view the creative \nworks of an omnipotent God. Look at her sunrises, pause at her tranquil \nsunsets and view the land where the early pioneers crossed the \nAlleghenies with a Bible in one hand and a rifle in the other, carrying \na bag of seeds.\n  They used the forests, dredged the rivers, and built a great State--a \ngreat State--a State that was born during the struggle between the \nStates, the war between the States, the war among the States.\n  So she is experiencing new economic growth and prosperity as a result \nof new roads, technology, and forward-looking leadership. In fact, West \nVirginia boasts four cities in the top 200 of Money magazine's 1997 \nlist of the best places in America to live. And there are many more \nthan four cities there and towns and rural communities that I would \ncategorize as the best places in America to live.\n  So today I say to all of those who have never tasted our glorious \ncountry cooking or danced at our traditional mountain festivals to \ntunes that are played by mountain musicians, never skied our shimmering \nslopes or paddled our wild white water, never heard the rich notes of \nour mountain music or gazed at our phenomenal sunsets, come to West \nVirginia. We will show you the way.\n  Happy birthday. Happy birthday, West Virginia. May you grow, and may \nyour people never, never change.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I want to commend the able Senator from West Virginia \non his devotion and dedication to his State. He has just paid a \nwonderful eulogy to that State and the people of that State. I am sure \nthe people of the United States are very proud of West Virginia and the \npeople of West Virginia and the able Senator who represents them here \nin the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank my friend, my senior colleague, \nfor his gracious and kind remarks concerning my State and my people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6038-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHEMICAL WARFARE DEFENSE DOCTRINE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, one year ago tomorrow, on June 21, 1996, in \na hastily called press conference, the Department of Defense revealed \nthat United States troops may have been exposed to Iraqi chemical nerve \nand mustard agents as a result of the post-war demolition of an Iraqi \nammunition storage depot at Kamisiyah, Iraq. By September 1996, the DOD \nestimate of the number of soldiers who may have been exposed had \nclimbed to just over 20,000, and the DOD announced that studies were \nstill under way that could push that number even higher. This \nannouncement raised new fears that Iraqi chemical warfare agents may \nhave played a role in causing the illness among United States and \ncoalition veterans of the Persian gulf war that has come to be called \ngulf war syndrome, and it exposed flaws in the manner in which the \nDepartment of Defense tracked the locations and medical histories of \nunits and individual troops. The Department of Defense and the \nPresidential Advisory Committee on gulf war illnesses have subsequently \nattempted to address this and many other possible causes of gulf war \nsyndrome, as have a number of congressional committees. There is still \nconsiderable uncertainty and controversy surrounding this issue.\n  As a result of that announcement, I offered an amendment to the \nFiscal Year 1997 Department of Defense authorization bill to provide \n$10 million for independent scientific research into the possible \nrelationship between chemical agent exposure, particularly to low \nlevels of chemical agent exposure, and gulf war syndrome. My amendment \nwas adopted without debate by the Senate and supported through the \nconference with the House, and I thank my colleagues for sharing in my \nconcern that our veterans be provided with the independent medical \nresearch on this subject that had not previously existed. I am eager, \nas I know our sick veterans and their families are also, to learn the \nresults of these studies.\n  But, Mr. President, although efforts to improve medical records \nmanagement techniques in order to better understand and treat future \npost-war illnesses among United States troops--efforts already \nundertaken by the Department of Defense--are a step in the right \ndirection, I believe that the most effective course of action is to \nprevent the exposures from occurring. We must not settle for just \nclosing the barn door after the horse has bolted. We must find out why \nthe door failed to contain the horse, and fix it. In that regard, the \neffectiveness of current doctrine and technology is questionable. It is \nnot certain that our chemical detectors will provide a sufficient \nwarning for low levels of chemical agent, and it is not certain that \nour military doctrine and procedures are adequate to fully protect our \ntroops in a scenario that is not immediately life-threatening. Nor is \nit certain that the military anticipates the synergistic effects of \ndifferent factors, such as the administration of vaccines and anti-\nchemical warfare agent drugs, in combination with the use of pesticides \nor exposure to other battlefield effluents, including chemical and \nbiological agents.\n  I am concerned that United States military doctrine has not changed \nto reflect these lessons learned from the gulf war experience and its \naftermath. My concern is, I know, shared by many of my colleagues, who \nover the years have pursued these issues in hearings. Indeed, even the \nSpecial Assistant for gulf war illnesses at the Department of Defense \nhas admitted in testimony before Congress that ``We [DOD] need to learn \nfrom our Gulf experience and make the necessary changes in policies, \ndoctrine, and technology.''\n  I am pleased, therefore, that two of my colleagues on the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Levin and Senator Glenn, have joined me in \nrequesting that the General Accounting Office [GAO] initiate an \nevaluation of this very issue. Both of these very able Senators have, \nover the last several years, questioned the ability of our military to \nfight and win on a chemical battlefield. We have asked the GAO to \naddress the adequacy of current policies, procedures, and technologies \nto first adequately defend United States military forces against \nsingle, repeated, or sustained exposure to low levels of chemical \nwarfare agent, and to second identify, prepare for, and defend against \nthe possible adverse effects of chemical warfare agent exposure in \ncombination with other compounds commonly found in the battlefield, \nincluding pesticides, oil and diesel exhaust, biological warfare \nagents, low level radiation, medically administered vaccines, and other \noccupational hazards.\n  It is my hope that this study will lay the foundation upon which we \nmight make effective and targeted adjustments in next year's Department \nof Defense authorization bill that will give our soldiers the ability \nand confidence to fight and win on a chemically contaminated \nbattlefield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6039-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6039-S6040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF BILLY N. STEPHENS\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on Sunday, May 18, a soldier was laid to \nrest in a small Kentucky community along the banks of the Ohio River. \nBut this wasn't to be any small affair. Billy Stephens had served his \ncountry and community with distinction and he would be honored for \nthose contributions by a 17-man team from Ft. Knox.\n  Once the rifles were fired, the bugle sounded taps, and the flag from \nthe casket was presented to his widow, those present couldn't help but \nfeel the enormity of his life. A son of Hawesville in Hancock County, \nif you met Billy Stephens on the street, you might not suspect him of \ngreatness.\n  But it is because of him and others like him, that you and I enjoy \nfreedom today.\n  In 1940, he joined the Army and served for the duration of the war. \nBefore the war ended, he would participate in seven campaigns and earn \nseven battle stars. In addition to the EAME theater with seven Bronze \nStars, his military decorations included the\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nAmerican Defense Service Medal and the Good Conduct Ribbon.\n  When he left the Army his commitment to service continued, not only \nas the Hancock County Sheriff, but also in his dedication to seeing the \ncommunity grow, while preserving its solid rural values. It was that \nunyielding devotion that earned him the Citizen of the Year award in \n1992 by the Hancock County Chamber of Commerce.\n  Perhaps his commitment to country should come as no surprise. His \nfather served in the Army during World War One, and both of his \nbrothers served in World War II, where one narrowly escaped death at \nPearl Harbor. Both of his sons served in Viet Nam, as did his \ndaughter's husband. His grandson continues the tradition as an Air \nForce Academy graduate.\n  Mr. President, Billy Stephen's contributions will be felt for \ngenerations, both as soldier and community leader. He was a good \nfather, husband, friend, and fighter for America, and his presence will \nbe sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6039-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to clarify the \napplication of the act popularly known as the ``Death on the High Seas \nAct'' to aviation accidents; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                   DEATH ON THE HIGH SEAS REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation which will provide equitable treatment for \nfamilies of passengers involved in international aviation disasters. I \nam very pleased that my colleague, Senator Santorum, is joining me as \nan original cosponsor of this bill. Companion legislation is being \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Joe McDade \nand 10 other members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation.\n  As my colleagues know, the devastating crash of Trans World Airlines \nflight 800 on July 17, 1996 took the lives of 230 individuals. Perhaps \nthe community hardest hit by this tragedy was Montoursville, PA, which \nlost 16 students and 5 adult chaperones from Montoursville High School \nwho were participating in a long-awaited French Club trip to France.\n  It has been brought to my attention by constituents who include \nparents of the Montoursville children lost on TWA 800 that their \nability to seek redress in court is hampered by a 1920 shipping law \nknown as the Death on the High Seas Act, which was originally intended \nto cover the widows of seafarers, not the relatives of jumbo-jet \npassengers embarking on international air travel.\n  Under the Warsaw Convention of 1929, airlines do not have to pay more \nthan $75,000 to families of passengers who died on an international \nflight. However, domestic air crashes are covered by U.S. law, which \nallow for greater damages if negligent conduct is proven in court.\n  The Warsaw Convention limit on liability can be waived if the \npassengers' families show that there was intentional misconduct which \nled to the crash. This is where the Death on the High Seas Act comes \ninto play. This law states that where the death of a person is caused \nby wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas more \nthan 1 marine league which is 3 miles from U.S. shores, a personal \nrepresentative of a decedent can sue for pecuniary loss sustained by \nthe decedent's wife, child, husband, parent, or dependent relative. The \nact, however, does not allow families of the victims of TWA 800 or \nother aviation incidents to obtain other types of damages, such as \nrecovery for loss of society or punitive damages, no matter how great \nthe wrongful act or neglect by an airline or airplane manufacturer.\n\n  My legislation would amend Federal law to provide that the Death on \nthe High Seas Act shall not affect any remedy existing at common law or \nunder State law with respect to any injury or death arising out of an \naviation incident occurring after January 1, 1995. In effect, it would \nclarify that Federal aviation law does not limit remedies in the same \nmanner as maritime law, and permits international flights to be \ngoverned by the same laws as domestic flights.\n  My legislation is not about blaming an airline or airplane \nmanufacturer. It is not about multimillion dollar damage awards. It is \nabout ensuring access to justice and clarifying the rights of families \nof victims of plane crashes such as TWA 800. I am open to exploring \nwith my colleagues the possibility of expanding the retroactive relief \nprovided in this legislation, bearing in mind that many of the \nplaintiffs in cases arising out of previous airplane disasters, such as \nthe Korean Air Lines 007 incident in 1983, have agreed to out-of-court \nsettlements.\n  The need for this legislation is suggested by the most recent Supreme \nCourt decision on this issue, Zicherman v. Korean Airlines, 116 S. Ct. \n629 (1996), in which a unanimous Court held that the Death on the High \nSeas Act of 1920 applies to determine damages in airline accidents that \noccur more than 3 miles from shore. By contrast, the Court has ruled \nthat State tort law applies to determine damages in accidents that \noccur in waters 3 miles or less from our shores. Yamaha v. Calhoun, \n(1996 WL 5518)\n  I believe it is inequitable to make such a distinction at the 3 mile \nlimit in civil aviation cases where the underlying statute predates \ninternational air travel. I would note that the Gore Commission on \nAviation Safety and Security noted in its final report this February \nthat ``certain statutes and international treaties, established over 50 \nyears ago, historically have not provided equitable treatment for \nfamilies of passengers involved in international aviation disasters. \nSpecifically, the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 and the Warsaw \nConvention of 1929, although designed to aid families of victims of \nmaritime and aviation disasters, have inhibited the ability of family \nmembers of international aviation disasters from obtaining fair \ncompensation.''\n\n  I would further note that in an October 1996 brief filed at the \nDepartment of Transportation by the Air Transport Association, the \ntrade association of U.S. airlines, there is an acknowledgment that the \nSupreme Court in Zicherman did not apparently consider 49 U.S.C. 40120 \n(a) and (c), which preserve the application of State and common law \nremedies in tort cases and also prohibit the application of Federal \nshipping laws to aviation. My legislation amends 49 U.S.C. 40120(c) to \nclarify that nothing in the Death on the High Seas Act restricts the \navailability of remedies in suits arising out of aviation disasters.\n  At a time when so many Americans live, work, and travel abroad, \ntaking part in the global economy or seeing the cultural riches of \nforeign lands, they and their families should know that the American \ncivil justice system will be accessible to the fullest extent if the \nunthinkable occurs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to \nworking with them to ensure its ultimate enactment during the 105th \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 943\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEATH ON THE HIGH SEAS ACT.\n\n       Section 40120(c) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(c) Additional Remedies.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Nothing in this part or the Act entitled \n     `An Act relating to the maintenance of actions for death on \n     the high seas and other navigable waters' approved March 30, \n     1920 (46 U.S.C. App. 761 et seq.), popularly known as the \n     `Death on the High Seas Act', shall, with respect to any \n     injury or death arising out of any covered aviation incident, \n     affect any remedy--\n       ``(A) under common law; or\n       ``(B) under State law.\n       ``(2) Additional remedies.--Any remedy provided for under \n     this part or the Act referred to in paragraph (1) for an \n     injury or death arising out of any covered aviation incident \n     shall be in addition to any of the remedies described in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1).\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\n       ``(3) Covered aviation incident defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term `covered aviation incident' means an \n     aviation disaster occurring on or after January 1, 1995.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 944. A bill to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to establish procedures for requesting waivers on behalf of \nqualified international medical graduates of the 2-year foreign \nresidency requirement; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE ACCESS ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce the Community Health \nCare Access Act of 1997. This act will help ensure that the residents \nof our inner-city and rural areas, in New York and across the Nation, \nwill have increased access to affordable health care. This legislation \nwill establish a procedure within the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment [HUD] for foreign medical students, who are granted \ntemporary residency status in order to complete their medical \neducation, to retain their legal status in exchange for practicing in \nareas with serious physician shortages.\n  Mr. President, throughout my home State of New York, there are \nnumerous inner-city and rural communities which face a real crisis in \nthe availability of qualified physicians. Too often, these communities \nface enormous difficulty attracting physicians to help serve the needs \nof their residents. Physicians are desperately needed to help cope with \nthe growing incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, HIV, and other \ninfectious diseases, as well as other critical health care needs such \nas pre-natal and neo-natal care.\n  The act I am introducing today will help address this crisis by \nrequiring the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to request a J-1 visa waiver for any qualified medical \nprofessional who agrees to practice in an underserved area. This bill \nwill allow hundreds of qualified doctors who are willing and able to \nserve in these communities to partner with existing health care \nfacilities in order to serve needy populations who lack access to \naffordable health care.\n  This legislation will help hospitals which are located in areas which \nare designated by the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] as \n``Health Professional Shortage Areas'' to draw upon a pool of doctors \nwho are among the best and the brightest in the world. Currently, there \nis a severe shortage of U.S. medical residents who are willing to serve \nin these areas. These urban and rural areas often have large uninsured \npopulations with a variety of critical unmet health needs.\n  In a nation with the greatest health care system in the world, there \nexist communities which are unfairly denied access to affordable \nquality health care. This disparity can be seen both in isolated rural \nareas and in the high-impact urban cores of some of our largest cities. \nToo often, the members of these communities have been left out of the \nAmerican dream. It is intolerable that certain parts of many American \ncities are experiencing higher infant mortality rates than many third-\nworld countries.\n  The costs of providing health care increase as hospitals struggle to \nattract qualified physicians. As costs rise, the unmet health care \nneeds of local residents are exacerbated. Thus, the supply shortage of \nqualified physicians creates a vicious cycle in which local residents \nare trapped.\n  My legislation will help break this cycle by increasing the \navailability of doctors in underserved areas while reducing health care \ncosts.\n\n  Let me briefly provide some background information. Under the J-1 \nvisa program, foreign medical students are temporarily admitted to the \nUnited States in order to complete their medical education and clinical \ntraining. Upon completion of their education, these students are \nrequired to leave the United States for a minimum of 2 years before \nthey can become eligible for an extension of their legal residency \nstatus. However, current law provides an exception to this 2-year \nforeign residency requirement if the medical graduate agrees to \npractice in a designated ``Health Professional Shortage Area.''\n  Congress reaffirmed its commitment to the J-1 program, as well as to \nthe waiver of the 2-year foreign residency requirement for \ninternational medical graduates who agree to practice in underserved \nareas, when it passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996--Public Law 104-208. This Act was signed \ninto law on September 30, 1996.\n  Mr. President, in December 1996, the General Accounting Office [GAO] \nreleased a report assessing the J-1 visa waiver program. This report, \nentitled ``Foreign Physicians: Exchange Visitor Program Becoming Major \nRoute to Practicing in U.S. Underserved Areas'' noted the growing use \nof the visa waiver process and made several recommendations for \nimprovement.\n  In conjunction with the reforms enacted last year as part of the \nImmigration Reform Act, the legislation I introduce today will \neffectively implement several of the recommendations made by the GAO. \nAs noted in the report, last year's Immigration Reform Act required \nFederal agencies to utilize the same criteria for approval that \npreviously applied to State health departments seeking such waivers. \nThese new safeguards required physicians to: First, agree to work for \nat least 3 years for the health facility named in the application; \nsecond, work in an area designated by the Secretary of HHS as having a \nshortage of health care professionals; third, commence work within 90 \ndays of receipt of the waiver; and fourth, maintain a nonimmigrant \nstatus until the completion of the 3-year commitment term. In addition, \nphysicians who fail to comply with the terms of their agreements would \nface a termination of their residency status and a loss of eligibility \nto apply for legal immigrant status in the future.\n  This legislation would further improve compliance with the waiver \nrequirements. This act will address the GAO report's finding that \nFederal agencies need to improve coordination in granting waivers. The \nact requires HUD to report to HHS on the number and location of \nphysicians requesting waivers. I fully expect the Department of Health \nand Human Services to utilize this information in its annual \ndesignations of physician underserved areas. In addition, the \nlegislation would require the sponsoring hospitals to provide HUD with \nperiodic notices as to the compliance of physicians with the terms of \nthe waiver agreements. Hospitals will also be required to provide HUD \nwith immediate notice of the termination or cessation of compliance \nwith these terms.\n  The addition of these reforms will ensure the effective continuation \nof this vital program. The GAO noted that, as of January 1, 1996, there \nwere approximately 1,374 physicians admitted to practice in underserved \nareas through the J-1 visa waiver program. These physicians served in \n49 States and the District of Columbia. According to a survey conducted \nby the General Accounting Office, approximately 40 percent of these \nphysicians served in nonprofit community or migrant health care \ncenters. Almost all of these physicians were practicing in primary care \nspecialties. More than half were practicing in internal medicine. The \nother major specialties were pediatrics and family practice.\n\n  Mr. President, it is important to note the outstanding caliber and \nthe unique qualifications of the doctors participating in this program. \nIn order to receive a J-1 visa, many of the participants were accepted \ninto medical universities and world-renowned teaching hospitals with \nrigorous acceptance standards. In some cases, the admitted physicians \nare often specifically recruited by particular health facilities on the \nbasis of their superior foreign language skills and cultural \nfamiliarity. For instance, the GAO cited a migrant health center in \neastern Washington which actively recruited native-Spanish speakers for \nits program.\n  HUD plays a critical role in the reduction of health care costs. The \nagency operates a number of programs which benefit hospitals, nursing \nhomes, and other health care organizations. The role played by HUD's \nhospital insurance program, for instance, is absolutely essential for \nmany health care institutions in obtaining private market financing for \nhospital construction, renovation, and modernization. The credit \nenhancement provided by this program results in a tangible reduction in \nhealth care costs at little or no cost to the taxpayer.\n  I believe it is essential for Congress to continue to act \nexpeditiously to address the valid concerns raised by the\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\nGAO. At the same time, we must remain cognizant of the basic soundness \nof the waiver program and strive to improve and reform it. The waiver \nprocess has made basic health care available to many communities with \ndesperate needs.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion I would emphasize the hardships which \nface many of our Nation's urban and rural residents as a result of the \ncrisis in health care availability. The J-1 visa waiver program is an \nimportant tool to address these needs. The reforms to the current \nwaiver process are also critical to ensuring that any noncompliance \nwithin the program is eradicated. I urge my colleagues to support the \nCommunity Health Care Access Act of 1997 in order to ensure that the \nwaiver program remains a viable option in addressing our country's \nlocal health care needs for years to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to improve \nthe provisions relating to pension rights demonstration projects; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           The Pension Assistance and Counseling Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nachieve one of my primary objectives as chairman of the Special \nCommittee on Aging: to help workers and retirees achieve a secure \nretirement.\n  As with any discussion about retirement planning, it is the norm to \npoint to the ``three-legged stool'' of retirement--Social Security, \npersonal savings, and a pension. Unfortunately, the legs of the stool \nmay be getting warped.\n  Just this week, the Aging Committee confronted an issue that is \naffecting hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees--miscalculation \nof their hard-earned pensions. This hearing was intended to raise \nconsumer awareness about the need to be proactive about policing your \npension. As one of our witnesses said, ``never assume your pension is \nerror-free.''\n  While it is impossible to know how many pension payments and lump sum \ndistributions may be miscalculated, we know the number is on the rise. \nAn audit conducted by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation--focused \non plans that were voluntarily terminated--showed that the number of \npeople underpaid has increased from 2.8 to 8.2 percent. Anecdotal \nevidence suggests that the number of people receiving lump sum \ndistributions who end up getting shortchanged could be 15 to 20 \npercent. Those numbers are very disturbing. The practical impact is \nthat retirees, and young and old workers alike, are losing dollars that \nthey have earned.\n  Workers and retirees need to be aware that they are at risk. They can \nhelp themselves by knowing how their benefits are calculated, that they \nshould keep all the documents their employer gives them, and to start \nasking questions at a young age--don't wait until the eve of \nretirement.\n  Unfortunately, policing your pension is not easy. Employers are \ntrying to do a good job but they are confronted with one of the most \ncomplex regulatory schemes in the Federal Government. Pensions operate \nin a complex universe of laws, rules, and regulations. Over the last 20 \nyears, 16 laws have been enacted that require employers to amend their \npension plans and then notify their workers of changes. It is not a \nsimple task. If employers have problems trying to comply with Federal \nrequirements, it is understandable that workers and retirees are having \ntrouble getting a grasp on how their pension works.\n\n  Trying to educate yourself about pensions implies that someone is out \nthere providing information to those who need it. That is where the \nlegislation that I am introducing today comes in. People who are \nconcerned about their pensions--whether it's an unintentional mistake \nor outright fraud--often don't have anywhere to go for expert advice.\n  Fortunately, there is an answer. Already authorized by the Older \nAmericans Act, seven pension counseling projects have assisted \nthousands of people around this country with their pension problems. \nThese projects provide information and counseling to retirees, and \nyoung and old workers in a very cost-effective manner.\n  Each project received $75,000 of Federal assistance over a 17-month \nperiod. As is normal for other programs under the Older Americans Act, \nthese dollars were supplemented by money raised from private sources. \nDuring their operation, the projects recovered nearly $2 million in \npension benefits and payments. That is a return of $4 for every $1 \nspent.\n  My legislation contains two key provisions: First, it updates the \nOlder Americans Act to encourage the creation of more pension \ncounseling projects. Seven projects are not enough to reach the 80 \nmillion people who are covered by pensions in this country. Hopefully, \nmore counseling projects can be established to provide more regionally \ncomprehensive assistance.\n  Second, the legislation would create an 800 number that people could \ncall for one-stop advice on where to get assistance. Jurisdiction over \npension issues is spread across three government agencies--none of \nwhich are focused on helping individuals with individual problems--\nespecially if the problem does not seem to be a clear fiduciary breach \nor indicate that there may be criminal wrongdoing. An 800 number \nlinking people to assistance will help close that gap.\n  I look forward to working with the Labor Subcommittee on Aging, the \nentity with jurisdiction over the Older Americans Act--to get these \nchanges enacted as part of the reauthorization this year.\n  It is also crucial to emphasize the need for pension counseling \nprojects with congressional appropriators. The projects have not \nreceived earmarked funding since the end of fiscal year 1996 and we \nsimply cannot afford to lose the expertise that has been developed over \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ years--especially in light of the growing concern over \npension security.\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\n  My committee has been focusing on preparing for the retirement of the \nbaby boom generation--it can be anticipated that the need for \nassistance with pensions will increase as that generation begins to \nretire. Social Security, by itself, was never intended to be the \nprimary source of income for a retiree. A pension from an employer can \nprove to be a determining factor in whether retirees are able to \nmaintain a decent standard of living. If there is no one to go for \nassistance to get all of the pension they have earned, their chances at \na secure retirement are gloomy indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6041-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 22\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the names of the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings], the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], \nand the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 22, a bill to establish a bipartisan national \ncommission to address the year 2000 computer problem.\n\n\n                                 S. 537\n\n  At the request of Ms. Mikulski, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Johnson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 537, a bill to \namend title III of the Public Health Service Act to revise and extend \nthe mammography quality standards program.\n\n\n                                 S. 570\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar] was added as a cosponsor of S. 570, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt certain small businesses from \nthe mandatory electronic fund transfer system.\n\n\n                                 S. 738\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from Ohio \n[Mr. DeWine] was added as a cosponsor of S. 738, a bill to reform the \nstatutes relating to Amtrak, to authorize appropriations for Amtrak, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 770\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 770, a bill to \nencourage production of oil and gas within the United States by \nproviding tax incentives, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 832\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kohl, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Hutchinson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 832, a bill to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the deductibility of \nbusiness meal expenses for individuals who are subject to Federal \nlimitations on hours of service.\n\n\n                                 S. 861\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inhofe, the name of the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nKempthorne] was added as a cosponsor of S. 861, a bill to amend the \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to authorize \ndonation of Federal law enforcement canines that are no longer needed \nfor official purposes to individuals with experience handling canines \nin the performance of law enforcement duties.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 85\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the names of the Senator from Oregon \n[Mr. Smith] and the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Resolution 85, a resolution expressing the sense \nof the Senate that individuals affected by breast cancer should not be \nalone in their fight against the disease.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 420\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cochran the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar] was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 420 proposed to \nS. 936, an original bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n1998 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes.\n  At the request of Mr. Thurmond his name was added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 420 proposed to S. 936, supra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6044-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6044-S6045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 34--RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF AFRICAN-\n                             AMERICAN MUSIC\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Santorum, and Ms. Moseley-Braun) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 34\n\n       Whereas artists, songwriters, producers, engineers, \n     educators, executives, and other professionals in the music \n     industry provide inspiration and leadership through their \n     creation of music, dissemination of educational information, \n     and financial contributions to charitable and community-based \n     organizations;\n       Whereas African-American music is indigenous to the United \n     States and originates from African genres of music;\n       Whereas African-American genres of music such as gospel, \n     blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, rap, and hip-hop have their \n     roots in the African-American experience;\n       Whereas African-American music has a pervasive influence on \n     dance, fashion, language, art, literature, cinema, media, \n     advertisements, and other aspects of culture;\n       Whereas the prominence of African-American music in the \n     20th century has reawakened interest in the legacy and \n     heritage of the art form of African-American music;\n       Whereas African-American music embodies the strong presence \n     of, and significant contributions made by, African-Americans \n     in the music industry and society as a whole;\n       Whereas the multibillion dollar Africa-American music \n     industry contributes greatly to the domestic and worldwide \n     economy; and\n       Whereas African-American music has a positive impact on and \n     broad appeal to diverse groups, both nationally and \n     internationally: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of the contributions of \n     African-American music to global culture and the positive \n     impact of African-American music on global commerce; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to take the \n     opportunity to study, reflect on, and celebrate the majesty, \n     vitality, and importance of African-American music.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this resolution, being cosponsored by my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, and our \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, is a \nresolution to recognize the importance of African-American music to \nglobal culture and to our Nation.\n  This is especially important because this month of June is celebrated \nas Black Music Month, and the designation is particularly important to \nthe city of Philadelphia, which is the home of the International \nAssociation of African-American Music.\n  At the conclusion of the Civil War, military band instruments were \nabundant and could be purchased for petty cash or labor. It was during \nthis time that the first age of African-American music, Ragtime, was \nborn, and when Eubie Blake composed his famous ``Charleston Rag.'' Jazz \nartists flourished later, including W.C. Handy, Duke Ellington, and \nCount Basie. Dozens of African-American female singers contributed \ntheir talents as well--among them Bessie Smith, followed by Ella \nFitzgerald.\n  Today, African-American music's universal popularity and appeal is \nevidenced through the appreciation of other cultures. Non-African-\nAmerican musical artists, such as Elvis Presley, the Beatles, and \nBonnie Raitt, have cited African-American artists as inspiration for \ntheir own music. Globally, African-American music is appreciated for \nits impact on language, dance, art, and media, as well as social and \ncultural values.\n  Its impact on our Nation's economy is just as great. The African-\nAmerican music industry supports and creates countless jobs worldwide, \nfrom publishing companies to concert and club venues to advertisers. \nThe Recording Industry Association of America reports that, in 1995, \ncombined sales of what it terms ``urban music''--including soul, dance, \nfunk, and reggae--amounted to $1.4 billion. Furthermore, if jazz, \ngospel, and rap are combined--all genres in which there are significant \nAfrican-American contributions--the total rises to nearly $3 billion.\n  The work of Philadelphia's International Association of African-\nAmerican Music helps to share the virtues of African-American music \nwith people around the world. This resolution recognizes the work of \nthose who help foster understanding of African-American culture through \nmusic, including the generations of African-American musicians whose \ntalents have enriched America.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will adopt this resolution. A companion \nresolution has been introduced in the\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\nHouse by Congressman Chaka Fattah and it has bipartisan support from 58 \nHouse Members.

SELECTION PROCESS FOR DONATION OF THE USS \n                   MISSOURI.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The USS Missouri is a ship of historical significance \n     that commands considerable public interest.\n       (2) The Navy has undertaken to donate the USS Missouri to a \n     recipient that would memorialize the ship's historical \n     significance appropriately and has selected a recipient \n     pursuant to that undertaking.\n       (3) More than one year after the applicants for selection \n     began working on their proposals in accordance with \n     requirements previously specified by the Navy, the Navy \n     imposed two additional requirements and afforded the \n     applicants only two weeks to respond to the new requirements, \n     requirement never previously used in any previous donations \n     process.\n       (4) Despite the inadequacy of the opportunity afforded \n     applicants to comply with the two new requirement, and \n     without informing the applicants of the intention to do so, \n     the Navy officials gave three times as much weight to the new \n     requirements than they did to their own original requirements \n     in evaluating the applicants.\n       (5) Moreover, Navy officials revised the evaluation \n     subcriteria for the ``public benefits'' requirements after \n     all applications had been submitted and reviewed, thereby \n     never giving applicants an opportunity to address their \n     applications to the revised subcriteria.\n       (6) The General Accounting Office criticized the revised \n     process for inadequate notice and causing all applications to \n     include inadequate information.\n       (7) In spite of the GAO criteria, the Navy has refused to \n     reopen its donation process for the Missouri.\n       (b) New Donee Selection Process.--(1) The Secretary of the \n     Navy shall--\n       (A) set aside the selection of a recipient for donation of \n     the USS Missouri;\n       (B) initiate a new opportunity for application and \n     selection of a recipient for donation of the USS Missouri \n     that opens not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (C) in the new application and selection effort--\n       (i) disregard all applications received, and evaluations \n     made of those applications, before the new opportunity is \n     opened;\n       (ii) permit any interested party to apply for selection as \n     the donee of the USS Missouri; and\n       (iii) ensure that all requirements, criteria, and \n     evaluation methods, including the relative importance of each \n     requirement and criterion, are clearly communicated to each \n     applicant.\n       (2) After the date on which the new opportunity for \n     application and selection for donation of the USS Missouri is \n     opened, the Navy may not add to or revise the requirements \n     and evaluation criteria that are applicable in the selection \n     process on that date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6045-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                      committee on small business\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, it was my pleasure last week to \nwelcome back to Washington, His Excellency, Desaix Anderson, who has \nreturned from Vietnam where he served for almost 2 years as our \nGovernment's Charge d'affaires in Hanoi.\n  He worked very effectively to help establish a new relationship \nbetween our two countries and in the process created a bond of \nfriendship and mutual trust that will serve us well as we build on that \nwell-laid foundation.\n  He is now writing a book on the United States-Vietnam relationship \nand because of his experience and intelligence, I'm sure it will be an \nimportant contribution to our understanding of this unique subject.\n  Before he left he discussed his impressions of the current situation \nand recent events at a meeting of the United States-Vietnam Trade \nCouncil on April 7. It gives such an encouraging assessment of the \npossibilities for the future in that country Senators should take note \nof it.\n  I ask that a copy of Mr. Anderson's remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n  America's Relations With Vietnam--Accomplishments, Challenges, and \n                               Potential\n\n                      (Remarks of Desaix Anderson)\n\n       In the year and half since normalization, Vietnamese and \n     Americans, working together, have laid the foundations for a \n     totally different relationship between our two countries. \n     While cognizant of our tortuous history of the past fifty \n     years, our leaders agreed in 1995 to look to the future, to \n     build on common goals seeking peace, stability, and \n     prosperity in our nations and in the East Asia Pacific \n     region. We realized that building trust and mutual confidence \n     was the most important requirement to construct this new \n     relationship.\n       On that basis we began to pick up the links of personal and \n     non-governmental contacts which emerged and survived over the \n     years, despite the estrangement between our governments, and \n     to call on the goodwill which we have found to be widely \n     flourishing in both countries, and to begin to construct the \n     foundation for a friendly, contemporary relationship. To \n     enjoy a normal relationship, that foundation has to be \n     composed of hundreds of thousands of expanding networks not \n     just between governments but between our peoples, as well.\n       So, I salute the US-Vietnam Trade Council, Virginia Foote, \n     the NGO's, the Vietnam vets, the Vietnam Veterans \n     Association, hundreds of American businessmen and women, the \n     media, itinerant English teachers, universities, tour groups, \n     the Vietnam-America Friendship Association, individual \n     Americans, as well as the Government officials and leaders \n     who have played their roles in initiating this new \n     relationship.\n\n\n                            accomplishments\n\n       All we have sought to do and accomplished fits nicely under \n     the rubric former National Security Advisor Anthony Lake \n     brought to Vietnam last July, in saying, ``America's vision \n     of Vietnam is of a strong and prosperous country, well \n     integrated into regional and global institutions.''\n       Hear the breadth of what has been going on.\n       We are cooperating diligently with the Vietnamese to \n     account for missing Americans--our top priority--even as we \n     work to find ways to strengthen further bilateral and \n     unilateral efforts to reach successful conclusions.\n       We adopted for cooperation two important Vietnamese goals--\n     strengthening health and education. The Centers for Disease \n     Control, the National Institutes of Health, with strong \n     support from HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, are spearheading \n     efforts contributing to Vietnam's health system. A CDC doctor \n     will soon join the embassy staff to work full time on public \n     and private health cooperation between our countries. The \n     embassy, through some 30 Fulbright scholarships and 25 \n     international visitor grants annually and the contribution of \n     an American studies collection to Hanoi University, is \n     strengthening bilateral educational ties. In addition, thirty \n     or so American universities are working with Vietnamese \n     counterparts to upgrade Vietnam's education system.\n       Our Agriculture ministries are cooperating closely to \n     exchange information, develop policy alternatives, and \n     promote exchanges such as the 18 upcoming Cochran fellowships \n     for young Vietnamese to study in professional fields in the \n     US.\n       FAA is working with the CAAV to upgrade security and safety \n     at Vietnam's airports, looking to the day, soon we hope, to \n     have daily flights between American and Vietnamese cities. A \n     creative Vietnamese approach can facilitate this important \n     goal.\n       Representatives from the Departments of State and Commerce, \n     the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Trade\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\n     Representative have initiated exchanges with DGPT/VVPT on the \n     Telecom regulatory environment.\n       DEA, Customs, and State are all at work with Vietnamese \n     counterparts in common purpose to stem illicit narcotics use \n     and flow. The Secret Service is cooperating with Vietnamese \n     authorities to stem crimes such as counterfeiting and credit \n     card fraud.\n       USAID is helping to supply prosthetic devices and assist \n     displaced children.\n       We have burgeoning cooperation in science, technology, \n     energy, and the environment, involving some nine US \n     Government agencies.\n       Military-to-military relations now consist of discussions \n     of regional security perceptions and the exchange of visits.\n       Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese have resettled in the \n     US under the Orderly Departure Program or ``ODP'', and in \n     January, we reached agreement on an arrangement called ROVR, \n     under which certain Vietnamese returnees from SE Asian camps \n     can be interviewed under ODP for possible resettlement in the \n     US.\n       We are working at common purposes in multilateral fora--\n     such as in the ASEAN regional forum to build confidence and \n     promote peaceful resolution of disputes in the region. We \n     also manage to discuss candidly and quietly some of the most \n     sensitive issues of concern on each side.\n       Over 400 American companies last year promoted over one \n     billion dollars in US-Vietnam trade in goods and services. US \n     investment topped US 1.2 billion. By their association and \n     employment by US companies, thousands of eager young \n     Vietnamese are learning the way we think and do business in a \n     market economy.\n       Finally, a Secretary Rubin and Finance Minister Hung this \n     morning signed a significant debt agreement, overcoming this \n     major obstacle to advancing our economic relations.\n\n\n                             the challenges\n\n       These developments should not be seen as fragile, but \n     challenges to developing the kind of friendly, constructive \n     relationship we envisage between Vietnam and the United \n     States remain clear and formidable. We must overcome residual \n     wariness, animosities and distrust in both countries. \n     Vietnamese must trust that we have come with good will, have \n     no ulterior motives or conspiracies to subvert or overthrow \n     their system, and recognize that American economic activities \n     support their own ``DOI MOI'' or renovation policy. Americans \n     must recognize the extraordinary efforts Vietnam is making to \n     help us in accounting for the missing from the war; \n     continuing suspicion is misplaced. We must all put the past \n     to rest and concentrate on the challenges and opportunities \n     of the present and future.\n       I have noticed and welcomed the greater openness and \n     diversity of Vietnam's society today than when I arrived. \n     There is a commitment to developing the rule of law. The \n     National Assembly and locally elected Peoples' Councils \n     gradually are gaining stature as deliberative, representative \n     bodies. I have observed more candid public and private debate \n     on the burning issues of the day, and expansion of the amount \n     and kinds of information available domestically and from \n     abroad. There is a vibrant artistic scene, and the government \n     has arrived at a formula for access to internet, albeit \n     controlled. Private citizens are allowed to worship in their \n     faith, have more latitude to make their own choices, and are \n     travelling abroad for business and pleasure in increasing \n     numbers. The result is a society taking on increasing \n     complexity and verve.\n       Continuing and expanding these trends will help Vietnam's \n     long term stability, economic health and growth, and its \n     ability to take full advantage of the genius of its people.\n       We can contribute positively to that process. Vietnam's \n     dramatic change from a centrally controlled economy to rule \n     of law and a market economy is still a work in progress. \n     Vietnam's society will ultimately be shaped by economic \n     growth, education, access to information including through a \n     free press, extended interaction with the rest of the world, \n     and, most importantly, its own culture and history.\n       To this end, we must get to know each other and be candid \n     about our perceptions one of the other, always in a spirit of \n     mutual respect and tolerance. Honest words may not always be \n     so welcome, but it is important for each to understand what \n     the other is about, what its values are, what its principles \n     are, what it stands for; while tolerating valid differences \n     in approach.\n       Finally, we are challenged to work in partnership to \n     conclude economic normalization (a comprehensive trade \n     agreement; MFN, EXIM, OPIC, and TDA) and a civil aviation \n     agreement so that our societies can enjoy the kind of \n     extensive links of which two such culturally rich societies \n     are capable.\n       For us to realize the full potential of our relationship, \n     Vietnam is challenged to move briskly to fulfill its self-\n     announced policy goal of establishing a market economy; to \n     this end, I would suggest the following:\n       (1) Rapid reform of the State-owned enterprise system, \n     which currently sustains inefficient, uncompetitive \n     enterprises, often oriented to import-substitution, and which \n     diverts both domestic and foreign investment from potentially \n     more productive uses. Effective equitization of State-owned \n     enterprises would create the basis for a stock market, the \n     necessary mechanism for realizing Vietnam's potential to \n     mobilize its own domestic savings and absorb the considerable \n     amount of portfolio investment available from abroad.\n       (2) Create a genuinely level domestic playing field for \n     Vietnam's multisector economy, including equal encouragement \n     of the private sector in which most new employment and growth \n     has occurred.\n       (3) Open the trading and investment systems to require \n     Vietnam's economy to learn competitiveness, perhaps the hard \n     way, but looking to the long term, to avoid falling further \n     behind its neighbors and putting at risk continued foreign \n     investment.\n       (4) Accelerate opening of the agricultural sector to \n     foreign investment, and liberalize the rice export market. \n     Eliminating the state sector middlemen and their rents would \n     raise income to the farmers from rice perhaps by 20 percent, \n     and help curb the huge 30 percent losses to pests, rodents, \n     spoilage and poor transportation which occur now because of \n     the current export system. In one stroke such changes would \n     raise rural incomes for the eighty percent of all Vietnamese \n     who live in rural areas, reduce the rural-urban gap, and curb \n     the dislocations resulting from urban migration.\n       (5) Accelerate reform of the financial system--including \n     making available equity credit and credit for export \n     financing.\n       (6) Finally, make the environment for foreign business more \n     hospitable, transparent, and objective with clear avenues for \n     dispute resolution.\n\n\n                             THE POTENTIAL\n\n       Marking clearly Vietnam's intentions in these directions \n     would accelerate conclusion of the US-Vietnam Trade Agreement \n     and, through, MFN, provide Vietnam access to the huge US \n     market for Vietnamese goods and trade--a prerequisite for \n     getting on the fast track to ``tiger status''--and pave the \n     way for another of Vietnam's avowed policy goals, accelerated \n     entry into WTO. The complementarity of the US and Vietnamese \n     Economies would ensure rapid growth of bilateral trade and \n     investment, benefitting both sides; the US would certainly \n     become one of the major investors in Vietnam's economic and \n     human resource development.\n       We can anticipate increasing consonnance in our strategic \n     views of Vietnam integrates into ASEAN. There are generally \n     no major disagreements in our respective national interests. \n     The basis for cooperative efforts to seek peaceful solutions \n     to transnational and other problems in the region already \n     exists.\n       1.5 million Vietnamese-Americans ensure growing human \n     contacts between our two countries. The opportunities for \n     rich cultural, educational, scientific and technological \n     exchange between our dynamic societies will inexorably be \n     enhanced.\n       Finally, the spirits of our two countries can overcome the \n     anguish of the past and we can enjoy the friendly, \n     constructive relationship which our two peoples deserve.\n       I invite you all to share in such a vision. With the good \n     will and commitment by people such as yourselves, a strong \n     partnership between Vietnam and the United States is not just \n     possible. It becomes probable.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6046-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6047-S6048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BUDGET RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today the Budget Committee is \nscheduled to report out the budget reconciliation spending bill. \nUnfortunately, I was unable to be present for the final vote, but had I \nbeen here I would have voted ``aye.''\n  Several months ago I made a commitment to the graduating class at \nNorth Seattle Community College that I would be honored to be their \n1997 commencement speaker. This commitment was extremely important to \nme and the graduating class, I simply could not back out at the last \nminute. Today's Budget Committee mark up was not finalized until last \nnight.\n  I am extremely troubled by some of the provisions within the \nreconciliation package as I believe that they violate the bipartisan \nbalanced budget agreement that was recently adopted. I am also \ndisappointed that the committee will not have final legislative \nlanguage and final CBO numbers on parts of the Finance Committee \nsections. It is difficult to understand why the leadership is in such a \nrush to complete action on major changes to Medicare and Medicaid. This \nrush to bring this bill to the floor does jeopardize our efforts to \nenact a balanced budget.\n  As we all know the Budget Committee cannot amend the reconciliation \nlegislation. This will be done on the floor next week. At that time I \nwill be supporting amendments that ensure this package is in compliance \nwith the agreement and that it does not violate our commitment to our \nNation's senior citizens and our children. We must seize on this unique \nopportunity to balance the budget, reform Medicare and expand health \nbenefits for children. Unfortunately, as it stands now it does not \nappear that the current reconciliation language will achieve these \ngoals.\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\n  Today's action by the Budget Committee is an important step in the \nprocess which is why I would have voted to report the measure to the \nfull Senate. This does not mean that the package is one I will support \nwhen it reaches the floor. I am simply acting to move us closer to \nachieving a balanced budget.\n  I am disappointed that this legislation does violate the agreement \nthat we worked so hard to achieve. But, I am hopeful that significant \nimprovements will be made on the floor and that we can sent to the \nPresident a bill that he can sign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6047-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COPYRIGHT TERM EXTENSION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I rise to express my \nsupport for the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997. This legislation \nenjoyed unanimous support from members of the Judiciary Committee and I \nam hopeful the full Senate will share our views.\n  In the area of copyrights, patents, and other sources of intellectual \nproperty, our Nation is now at a tremendous competitive disadvantage in \nthe global marketplace. Despite the fact the United States is the \nworldwide leader in intellectual property production, American authors, \nmusicians, filmmakers, and other creative artists will not get their \nfair share of royalties due to them. Simply stated, U.S. copyright law \nprotects the life of the author plus 50 years. In the European Union \n[EU], however, copyright terms cover life plus 70 years. Here lies the \nproblem.\n  Four years ago the European Union issued a directive mandating member \ncountries to implement a copyright term of protection equal to the life \nof the author plus 70 years by July 1, 1995. Currently eight countries \nin the EU have complied with this policy and many others are following \nsuit.\n  With the advent of the Internet, digital communications, increased \nsatellite technology, and other communications devices, the longevity \nof creative works has dramatically increased. Now anyone in the world \ncan access and use an American work with merely a click of a finger. \nBecause of these high-technology machines, the United States continues \nto see dramatic rises in illegal duplication cases and millions of \ndollars lost.\n  The Copyright Term Extension Act will reverse this disturbing trend \nby putting Americans at an equal footing with the rest of the world. \nThis important legislation gives U.S. copyright owners parity with the \nEuropean Union by adopting a life plus 70 year term. I strongly feel \nthis act will help balance the inadequacies that currently exist \nbetween the United States and the European Union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/20/senate-section/article/S6048-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AMENDING SECTION 2118 OF THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 1992\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
