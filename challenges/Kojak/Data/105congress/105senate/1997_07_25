Help us to \nremember that You are the instigator of prayer. It begins with You, \nmoves into our hearts, gives us the clarity of knowing how to pray, and \nthen returns to You in petitions You have refined and guided us to ask. \nWe are astonished that You have chosen to do Your work through us and \nuse prayer to reorient our minds around Your guidance for the issues we \nwill face today. We say with the psalmist, ``You are my rock and my \nfortress; therefore, for Your name's sake, lead me and guide me.''--\nPsalm 31:3.\n  Suddenly, we see prayer in a whole new perspective. It's the method \nby which You brief us on Your plans and bless us with Your power. May \nthis whole day be filled with magnificent moments of turning to You so \nthat Your purposes, Your glory and honor in America, may be done \nthrough us. Give us vision to be dynamic leaders. In the all-powerful \nname of our Lord and Saviour.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution gave the \nexecutive branch of our Government authority to negotiate treaties.

I yield myself whatever time is necessary, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the pending resolution, Senate Resolution \n98, with its 65 cosponsors, is intended to change the course of \nnegotiations on the new global climate treaty now under discussion.\n  The need for this treaty is questionable, but the harm that it would \ncause is certain. Two articles in this Monday's Wall Street Journal, \nwritten by\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\nJack Kemp and Dr. Fred Singer, are excellent summaries against the \ndirection the administration is taking in negotiating this treaty. I \nask unanimous consent that these articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 25, 1997]\n\n                    A Treaty Built on Hot Air . . .\n\n                             (By Jack Kemp)\n\n       In December, representatives of 150 nations will gather in \n     Kyoto, Japan, to sign a successor treaty to the United \n     Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change. Today, in \n     anticipation of this momentous event, the Senate is scheduled \n     to debate the Byrd-Hagel resolution, a non-binding measure \n     sponsored by 65 senators that will put that body on record \n     against any treaty that would cause serious economic harm to \n     the U.S. For more than a year the Clinton administration has \n     been promising to provide its economic model of the treaty's \n     effects, but last week it announced that it will not provide \n     any formal estimate--a signal that the treaty won't meet the \n     Byrd-Hagel criteria.\n\n\n                        no reliable conclusions\n\n       Everyone agrees that we need to keep our planet clean. \n     Healthy plants and animals are valuable, but at the same time \n     the U.S. has a solemn obligation to defend the rights of the \n     people who inhabit our planet. It seems that the officials \n     representing the U.S. in the treaty negotiations have lost \n     sight of that duty.\n       The international negotiations focus on global warming, the \n     theory that greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are \n     steadily and dangerously warming the planet. Some of our \n     leaders, most notably Vice President Al Gore, have bought \n     into the theory even though scientists have reached no \n     reliable conclusions about global warming (see story below). \n     Yet the 150 nations involved in these talks are rapidly \n     moving toward signing a treaty that would wreak havoc on the \n     U.S. economy and, ironically, on our environment. U.S. \n     negotiators appear to be asking American workers and families \n     to foot the bill for massive reductions in greenhouse gases.\n       This treaty would require a drastic and sudden cut in \n     energy use that would be legally binding only on developed \n     nations, not on major international trade competitors--\n     including three of the 10 biggest carbon-dioxide producers, \n     India, South Korea, and China. By excluding developing \n     nations, not only will we be missing an opportunity to make \n     further environmental gains, but we'll also be working \n     against the very purpose of the treaty.\n       Studies show that the high-growth developing nations \n     excluded from the proposed treaty's requirements are more \n     likely to increase their greenhouse-gas emissions in order to \n     pick up the demand left unmet by developed nations, where \n     production would be restricted. The AFL-CIO's Executive \n     Council has declared that an agreement that fails to bind \n     developing nations to the same commitments made by the U.S. \n     cannot possibly work.\n       The treaty's impact on America's workers and economy, \n     meanwhile, could be severe. First, U.S. industry would face \n     increased production costs for virtually all goods. The net \n     cost just to stabilize U.S. emissions at 1990 levels could \n     reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually, and many \n     nations are pushing to reduce emissions below 1990 levels, at \n     an even more oppressive cost. The resulting higher prices \n     would make American products less competitive on the world \n     market and less affordable at home.\n       Second, the treaty would send high-paying jobs in mining, \n     manufacturing, transport and other important sectors abroad. \n     Charles River Associates, an econometric modeling firm, has \n     estimated that the administration's plans would increase U.S. \n     unemployment by 0.25% and reduce the gross domestic product \n     by 3.3%. The likely result: 250,000 American jobs lost.\n       Third, the treaty would saddle Americans with higher energy \n     bills as we are forced to tax energy use. Some have estimated \n     that such a ``carbon tax'' could increase the cost of \n     gasoline by as much as 60 cents a gallon, and of home heating \n     oil by 50%. What's more, as the AFL-CIO has recognized: \n     ``These taxes are highly regressive and will be most harmful \n     to citizens who live on fixed incomes and work at poverty-\n     level wages.''\n       This burden of drastically increased heating, cooling and \n     transportation costs could hardly come at a worse time for \n     lower-income families. The working poor, and people just \n     getting off welfare and beginning to pay their own way, are \n     already challenged to make ends meet in today's economy. But \n     our diplomatic negotiators have spared little attention for \n     the potentially devastating consequences that their proposals \n     would have for millions of lower-income Americans.\n\n\n                             far past time\n\n       It is time for the American public to be told exactly what \n     their government is proposing to give away in the global \n     climate change treaty. It is far past time for the Clinton \n     administration to give Congress a detailed economic analysis \n     of the mandatory cutbacks in energy usage that our \n     negotiators are offering on the altar of environmentalist \n     politics. Until the public and the Congress are given the \n     facts, the talk at the global conferences on greenhouse gas \n     emissions will remain as little more than hot air.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     . . . Not Scientific Consensus\n\n                          (By S. Fred Singer)\n\n       Yesterday, in opening a White House conference on global \n     warming, President Clinton announced, ``The overwhelming \n     balance of evidence and scientific opinion is that it is no \n     longer a theory but now a fact that global warming is real.'' \n     In support of this contention, the president and other \n     politicians have been busy citing the ``2,500 scientists'' \n     who supposedly endorse the U.N.'s 1996 Intergovernmental \n     Panel on Climate Change report, and thus a forecast of \n     catastrophic global warming.\n       Actual climate observations, however, show that global \n     warming is mostly a phantom problem. Perhaps that's why Mr. \n     Clinton and Vice President Al Gore harp so much on a \n     ``scientific consensus''--which sounds so impressive to \n     nonscientists. Yet science doesn't operate by vote.\n       How did the IPCC come up with 2,500 scientists? If one were \n     to add up all contributors and reviewers listed in the three \n     IPCC reports published in 1996, one would count about 2,100. \n     The great majority of these are not conversant with the \n     intricacies of atmospheric physics, although some may know a \n     lot about forestry, fisheries or agriculture. Most are social \n     scientists--or just policy experts and government \n     functionaries. Every country in the world seems to be \n     represented--from Albania to Zimbabwe--though many are not \n     exactly at the forefront of research. The list even includes \n     known skeptics of global warming--much to their personal and \n     professional chagrin.\n       The IPCC report has some 80 authors for its 11 chapters, \n     but only a handful actually wrote the Policymakers' Summary; \n     most of the several hundred listed ``contributors'' are \n     simply specialists who allowed their work to be cited, \n     without necessarily endorsing the other chapters or the \n     summary. Contrast these numbers with the nearly 100 climate \n     scientists who signed the Leipzig Declaration in 1996, \n     expressing their doubts about the validity of computer-driven \n     global warming forecasts. It takes a certain amount of \n     courage to do this--given that it could jeopardize research \n     grants from U.S. government agencies that have adopted \n     climate catastrophe as an article of faith, and managed to \n     convince Congress to ante up about $2 billion a year.\n       Even some IPCC climate scientists, in the report itself or \n     in a May 16 Science article headlined ``Greenhouse \n     Forecasting Still Cloudy,'' have expressed doubts about the \n     validity of computer models and about the main IPCC \n     conclusion, that ``the balance of evidence suggests a \n     discernible human influence on global climate''--whatever \n     that ambiguous phrase may mean. A Dec. 20, 1995, Reuters \n     report quoted British scientist Keith Shine, one of IPCC's \n     lead authors, discussing the IPCC Policymakers' Summary: ``We \n     produce a draft, and then the policymakers go through it line \n     by line and change the way it is presented. . . . It's \n     peculiar that they have the final say in what goes into a \n     scientists' report.'' The Science and Environmental Policy \n     Project conducted a survey of IPCC scientific contributors \n     and reviewers; we found that about half did not support the \n     Policymakers' Summary. Parallel surveys by the Gallup \n     organization and even by Greenpeace International produced \n     similar results.\n       Of course, scientists do accept the existence of a natural \n     greenhouse effect in the atmosphere, which has been known \n     since the 19th century and is not to be confused with any \n     influence from human activity. Another accepted fact is that \n     greenhouse gases have been increasing as a consequence of an \n     expanding world population: carbon dioxide from burning \n     fossil fuels, for instance, and methane from raising cattle. \n     But the climate warming of the past 100 years, which occurred \n     mainly before 1940, in no way supports the results of \n     computer models that predict a drastic future warming. Even \n     IPCC Chairman Bert Bolin has admitted that the pre-1940 \n     warming is likely a natural recovery from a previous, natural \n     cooling. Most important, though, is the fact--not mentioned \n     in the IPCC summary--that weather satellite observations, \n     independently backed by data from balloon-borne sensors, have \n     shown no global warming trend whatsoever in the past 20 \n     years.\n       The discrepancy between calculated predictions of warming \n     and the actual observations of no warming has produced a \n     crisis for many scientists. Those who believe in global \n     warming keep hoping that proof is just around the corner. \n     Consider this passage from the May 16 Science article: \n     ``[M]any scientists say it will be a decade before computer \n     models can confidently link the warming to human \n     activities.''\n       It is ironic that an environmental lobbying group, the \n     Environmental Defense Fund, would admit in a brochure on \n     global warming: ``Scientists need to do considerably more \n     work to sort out which [hypotheses] are most likely to be \n     true.'' The EDF complains, however, that the ``skepticism and \n     constant questioning that lie at the heart of science'' \n     sometimes ``cloud the debate.'' Perhaps so; but more often \n     they advance the science.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nmembers of my staff be granted the privilege of the floor during debate \non\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\nSenate Resolution 98: Derek Schmidt, Ken Peel, Kent Bonham, David \nKracman, and Tom McCarthy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, we have more than a dozen Senators on this \nside who want to speak on this issue. Under the time agreement, \nhowever, we have only 1 hour for proponents to debate. I, therefore, \nencourage Senators to insert their statements in the Record so they \nwill be fully available to our negotiators before next week's meeting \nof the ad hoc group on the Berlin mandate in Bonn, Germany. I also hope \nto discuss this issue further on the Senate floor at a later date.\n  Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the minority leader \nfor their leadership in bringing this resolution before the Senate. I \nalso thank the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee for their leadership as well. I particularly thank \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. It has been a \nprivilege for me to work on this important issue along side one of the \nSenate's giants.\n  We are here today to debate a very important issue, one which will \nhave a major impact on the future of this country. How our Nation \naddresses the global climate issue may prove to be one of the most \nimportant economic and environmental decisions of the next century.\n  Let me say from the outset, this is not a debate about who is for or \nagainst the environment. We all agree on the need for a clean \nenvironment. We all want to leave our children a better, cleaner, more \nprosperous world. Nor is this debate about motives, personalities or \npolitics. It is about finding the truth. What are the problems? If \nthere are problems, what is the best solution? What are the costs? What \nare the consequences? And what do we need to do now?\n  The debate on the Senate floor today is about the path the \nadministration is taking on this issue. I believe they are on the wrong \npath in their negotiations for any treaty to be signed in Kyoto, Japan, \nthis December.\n  That is why my distinguished colleague from West Virginia and I have \noffered the Byrd-Hagel resolution. Senate Resolution 98, with its 65 \ncosponsors, puts the administration on notice that an overwhelming and \nbipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate rejects its current negotiating \nposition on a proposed new global climate treaty. It is so important, \nas my friend, Senator Byrd, has repeatedly pointed out, that we in the \nU.S. Senate forcefully practice our constitutional role of advice and \nconsent over these important negotiations. The credibility of the \nUnited States is not enhanced when the administration negotiates a \ntreaty that has no hope of ratification in the U.S. Senate.\n  The Byrd-Hagel resolution is a strong bipartisan wake-up call to the \nadministration. This resolution rejects the United Nations' current \nnegotiating strategy of binding United States and other developed \nnations to legally binding reductions without requiring any new or \nbinding commitments from 130 developing nations, such as China, Mexico, \nand South Korea. In addition, this resolution rejects any treaty or \nother agreement that would cause serious economic harm to the United \nStates.\n  A simple reality of the current situation is that a core group of \nnegotiators in the State Department has brought us near a point of no \nreturn. What this broad bipartisan coalition of 65 Senators is saying \nis ``we need a new direction in these negotiations.''\n  I approach this issue, Mr. President, believing that any action this \nserious that is undertaken by the United States must be based on sound \nscience and common sense. This proposed treaty is based on neither.\n  If anything has become clear during congressional hearings on this \nissue, it is that the science is unclear, that the scientific community \nhas not even come close to definitively concluding that we have a \nproblem.\n  I mentioned earlier this morning, in the Wall Street Journal today, \nthe very interesting article by Dr. Fred Singer about the science on \nthis issue. Dr. Singer is professor emeritus of environmental sciences \nat the University of Virginia. I have already requested this be printed \nin the Record.\n  The science is inconclusive and contradictory, and predictions for \nthe future range from no significant problem to global catastrophe. The \nsubcommittee I chair, International Economic Policy Export and Trade \nPromotion, has held two hearings on this issue. In the first hearing, \nwe heard testimony from Dr. Patrick Michaels, a very distinguished \nclimatologist and professor of environmental sciences at the University \nof Virginia, who noted conditions in the real world simply have not \nmatched changes projected by some computer models. Most of the warming \nof this century occurred in the first half of this century, before \nsignificant emissions of greenhouse gases began. And 18 years of \nsatellite data actually shows a slight cooling trend in the world.\n\n  Before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Dr. Richard \nLindzen, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, testified that ``a decade of focus on global warming and \nbillions of dollars of research funds have still failed to establish \nthat global warming is a significant problem.''\n  At the same hearing, Dr. John Christy, an associate professor in the \nDepartment of Atmospheric Science at the University of Alabama, stated: \n``The satellite and balloon data show that catastrophic warming is not \nnow occurring. The detection of human effects on climate has not been \nconvincingly proven because the variations we now have observed are not \noutside of the natural variations of the climate system.''\n  It is clear that the global climate is incredibly complex. It is \ninfluenced by far more factors than originally thought when some early \ncrude computer models first raised alarms about the possible threat of \nimminent catastrophic global warming. The scientific community has \nsimply not yet resolved the question of whether we have a problem with \nglobal warming.\n  I suggest, again, that common sense dictates you don't come up with a \nsolution to a problem until you are certain that you have a problem. \nHowever, the Clinton administration has proceeded to negotiate a \nsolution before we have a confirmation that there is a problem.\n  They have proposed that the United States and other developed nations \nsubmit to legally binding controls of greenhouse gas emissions. But \nthey will not be asking for legally binding commitments from more than \n130 ``developing nations,'' including, as I mentioned before, China, \nMexico, South Korea, India, Singapore, and others.\n  Mr. President, this makes no sense, no sense at all, given that these \nnations include some of the most rapidly developing economies in the \nworld and are quickly increasing their use of fossil fuels. By the year \n2015, China will surpass the United States as the largest producer of \ngreenhouse gases in the world.\n  It is the United States and other developed nations who are currently \ndoing the most to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is the developing \nnations that will be the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases during \nthe next 25 years. It is complete folly to exclude them from legally \nbinding emissions mandates. How could any treaty aimed at reducing \nglobal emissions of greenhouse gases be at all effective when it \nexcludes these 130 nations? It won't. If these nations are excluded, \ngreenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise, and we would see no net \nreductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. The exclusion of these \nnations is a fatal flaw in this treaty.\n  Some analysts have even cautioned that the unequal treaty being \nnegotiated at the United Nations could increase the emission of \ngreenhouse gases. As industries flee the United States and other \nindustrialized countries, they would reestablish themselves in \ndeveloping countries that have much weaker environmental standards, \nlike our neighbor to the south, Mexico.\n  A draft economic report commissioned by this administration, this \nadministration's Department of Energy, concluded that:\n\n       Policy constraints placed on six large industries in the \n     United States--petroleum refining, chemicals, paper products, \n     iron and steel, aluminum and cement--would result in \n     significant adverse impacts on the affected industries. \n     Furthermore, they conclude:\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\n     emissions would not be reduced significantly. The main effect \n     of the assumed policy would be to redistribute output, \n     employment, and emissions from participating to \n     nonparticipating countries.\n\n  Therefore, the U.N. Global Climate Treaty as being negotiated now by \nthe Clinton administration cannot pass the first test of Byrd-Hagel. It \nwill not include legally binding commitments from the developing \nnations.\n  What about the second test of Byrd-Hagel, serious economic harm, \nserious economic harm to this country and our future generations? One \nof the notable aspects of this issue is that it has united American \nbusiness, labor, and agriculture support. In my hearings, we heard \ntestimony from the AFL-CIO, American Farm Bureau, National Association \nof Manufacturers, and many noted economists. They all agree on one very \ndefinite thing--the draft U.N. treaty now under consideration would \nhave a devastating effect on American consumers, workers, farmers and \nbusinesses. Estimates of the proposed treaty's damage to our economy \nvary, mainly because the administration continually refused to offer \nits own economic assumptions. This, after the administration promised \nfor more than a year to provide an economic model. However, last week \nthe Clinton administration threw in the towel and gave up on even \nattempting to provide an economic model.\n  At a hearing before the House Commerce Committee, Janet Yellen, chair \nof the Council of Economic Advisers for the President, admitted that \nthe administration's long-awaited economic study had failed and claimed \nthat it would be futile to attempt to assess the economic impacts of \nlegally-binding emissions controls on our developed nations. So now the \nClinton administration is proceeding to negotiate a treaty without any \nassessment of what it would do to the U.S. economy. That is incredible; \nabsolutely stunning. But the bottom line is very clear. Even using \nconservative assumptions, Charles River Associates, a leading economic \nmodeling firm, for example, has estimated that holding emissions at \n1990 levels would reduce economic growth by 1 percent a year, rising to \n3 percent in the later years, and that does not even consider Under \nSecretary of State Tim Wirth's long-term goal, which he stated during \nour hearings, of achieving a 70 percent reduction from current \nemissions levels.\n  What this means to everyday Americans is very clear. The AFL-CIO has \nestimated the treaty would mean the loss of 1.25 to 1.5 million jobs. \nEnergy prices will rise dramatically. Individual Americans will pay for \nthis treaty either in their electric bills, at the gas pump, or by \nlosing their jobs. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, testified that the proposed treaty:\n\n       . . . would hurt America's manufacturers, workers and \n     families with little or no environmental benefit since new \n     restrictive policies in the U.S. simply would force the \n     flight of U.S. investment to developing countries. Millions \n     of Americans would lose their jobs and American manufacturers \n     would take a severe hit in the marketplace.\n\n  What about the effects on American agriculture? It is little known \nthat American agriculture produces 25 percent of our Nation's \ngreenhouse gas emissions, which would make this critical sector of our \neconomy vulnerable to the kind of major reductions envisioned by the \nU.N. global climate treaty. The American Farm Bureau has called the \ntreaty a back-door Btu tax that would drive up fuel and overall energy \ncosts as much as 50 percent. Again, this is outrageous. This would \nbankrupt many of our American farmers. Therefore the U.N. global \nclimate treaty has no hope of satisfying the second test of Byrd-Hagel. \nIt would clearly cause very serious economic harm to the United States.\n  Mr. President, beyond the fairness and economic harm issues that are \naddressed in Senate Resolution 98, I am also very concerned about any \ntreaty that would bind our Nation's economy to control by some U.N. \nmultilateral entity. Who will administer a global climate treaty? Who \nwill police it? Will we have an international police force, an agency \ncapable of inspecting, finding, possibly shutting down American \ncompanies? No one has addressed these questions. The implications are \nmost serious for our national security interests, national sovereignty \ninterests. One of the biggest users of fossil fuels is the U.S. \nmilitary. How would this treaty affect our military operations and our \nnational defense capabilities? There are serious national sovereignty \nissues and other issues that we have not even begun to touch.\n  I said at the outset that I believe any action taken by this Nation \nshould be based on sound science and common sense. The current track of \nnegotiations for the U.N. global treaty does neither. Why is this \nadministration rushing headlong into signing a treaty in Kyoto this \nDecember? The scientific data is inconclusive, even contradictory. The \neconomic costs are clear and devastating. This treaty would be a lead \nweight on our Nation's future economic growth, killing jobs and \nopportunities for generations of Americans to come.\n  We need to take global climate issues seriously. Obviously we agree \nwith that. We in the United States have made tremendous strides in \ncleaning up our environment. We will continue to make progress in the \nfuture. We are all concerned about the state of the environment and \nwhat we leave to our children and our grandchildren. But when we take \nactions that will reduce our children's and our grandchildren's \neconomic opportunities, we must ensure that the benefits are real and \nthat they would justify this very real economic hardship that we would \nbe passing on to these future generations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senate Resolution 98, the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution. I am grateful for the time that my colleagues have given \nthis effort.\n  At this time, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Mr. \nHagel, for his excellent statement. I thank him for joining with me in \nthe preparation, development and promotion of this resolution. And I \nthank him for the time that he has yielded to me.\n  Mr. Hagel and I, along with 63 other cosponsors, developed S. Res. \n98, which was reported favorably from the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and is pending before the Senate today. The resolution seeks \nto provide the Senate's views as to the global climate change \nnegotiations now underway. These negotiations have, as a goal, a \nrevision of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, known as the Rio Pact.\n  Mr. President, my years of recollection go back farther than that of \nmost Senators. I am not a scientist, but I have lived long enough to \nsee what I believe are some very definite changes in the climate \npattern affecting our country. Droughts, floods, storms appear to me to \nbe more erratic, more unpredictable, and more severe in these later \nyears of my life than in my earlier years. I can remember when there \nwere no air conditioning units in Washington or anywhere else where I \nlived. We have recently seen heat waves--severe. We have seen \ndroughts--severe. They seem to be happening more frequently. So I \nbelieve in my own mind and heart that something is happening out there. \nSomething is happening. Something is happening to our climate. As I \nsay, I am not a scientist, but the majority of scientists who study \nclimate patterns tell us that there apparently are changes going on in \nthe climate pattern and that anthropogenic interference is probably the \ncause of some of this change.\n  All the data are not in, but I, for one, believe that there is \nsufficient evidence of, first, a probable trend toward increased \nwarming of the Earth's surface resulting from human interference in \nnatural climate patterns. I believe that a steady increase in \naccumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere is taking place. I believe that there is some relationship \nbetween the warming trend and such accumulations, enough to justify our \ntaking some action and taking it now. The scientific foundation of this \ncase is plausible enough, in my personal judgment, to put into motion a \nsound global program, because the trends and the effects are long term. \nCertainly the Senate, under the Constitution, is obligated to \ncommunicate its views and advice on the treaty negotiations. The \nConstitution, in outlining the powers of the President, says he--\nmeaning the President--shall have power ``by and with the Advice and\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\nConsent of the Senate, to make Treaties''; ``by and with the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate, to make Treaties. . . .'' It doesn't just use \nthe word ``consent'' of the Senate. It also uses the word of \n``advice.'' All too often we let ourselves to be limited to consenting \nto or rejecting treaties. But we have an obligation to advise the \nadministration as to the Senate's views concerning a treaty, especially \nthis treaty which can have such far-reaching ramifications.\n  I do not think the Senate should support a treaty that requires only \nhalf the world--in other words, the developed countries--to endure the \neconomic costs of reducing emissions while developing countries are \nleft free to pollute the atmosphere and, in so doing, siphon off \nAmerican industries. There are those who say that the United States is \nresponsible for the situation that has developed. They claim that the \nUnited States should bear the brunt of the burden. But the time for \npointing fingers is over. In this particular environmental game there \nare no winners; the world loses. And any effort to avoid the effects of \nglobal climate change will be doomed to failure from the start without \nthe participation of the developing world, particularly those nations \nthat are rapidly developing and will rapidly increase their carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Count me as a global \nenvironmentalist, who insists that all nations that spew forth major \nconcentrations of carbon dioxide, or that will be spewing forth major \nconcentrations of carbon dioxide, must step up to the plate in these \nnegotiations and make good-faith, specific, binding commitments to \ncontrol and reduce these emissions right from the start.\n  Industry is fueled, in large part, by fossil fuels, which are the \nprimary--primary--cause of greenhouse gas emissions. Let us examine the \nrole of China in that regard. As a percentage of total world \nconsumption in the year 2015, China alone will account for 42 percent \nof all the coal burned worldwide while the United States will account \nfor only 16 percent. The increase in China's use of coal should alarm \nevery environmentalist who is concerned about global warming.\n  So, if you are a true environmentalist--I am not talking about \nfanatics--if you are a true environmentalist, as I am, then you should \nbe alarmed about the situation that I have just mentioned with respect \nto China. And there are other countries, such as India, Mexico, \nIndonesia, Brazil, that are classified as developing countries. I say \nthey need to step up to the plate, just as we do, just as the annex 1 \ncountries do, just as the developed countries do, when the negotiations \nare taking place and make binding, specific commitments to reductions \nof greenhouse gases and to make those commitments to start now, not \nsomewhere in the future.\n  From 1995 to 2015, China will increase its coal consumption by a huge \n111 percent, compared to only 22 percent for the United States. Yet, \ndespite its future role as the world's leading contributor to the \nproblem of carbon emissions, China has indicated steadfast refusal to \napply any type of binding obligations upon its own economy and \nindustry. I believe that, if the treaty does not commit the developing \nnations like China to binding commitments, there will be no incentive \nfor China and the other nations of the developing world to make \nresponsible and environmentally sound choices as they develop.\n  The committee report that is before the Senate contains a brief but \naccurate summary of the history of the global change negotiations. Most \nof the nations of the world signed up at the Earth summit in Rio in \n1992 to a Treaty that set voluntary goals for nations to start limiting \ntheir carbon dioxide emissions. Unfortunately, most nations of the \nworld, ourselves included, failed to take the actions needed to meet \nthose voluntary goals.\n  As a result of this failure, the parties met again in Berlin in 1995 \nand sought to impose a timetable whereby legally binding limits on \nnational carbon dioxide reductions would be put into place. \nUnfortunately--unfortunately--a fundamental error--I would use the word \n``blunder''--a fundamental blunder was made in Berlin in that only the \nso-called developed nations, or Annex I nations, were to impose such a \nlegally binding regime on themselves. Developing nations got a free \npass.\n  The concept which is embodied in the Byrd-Hagel resolution is that \ndeveloping country parties should join the developed world in making \nnew specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions within the same compliance period.\n  Now, does this mean that the Senate is insisting on commitments to \nidentical levels of emissions among all the parties? Certainly not. The \nemissions limitations goals, to be fair, should be based on a country's \nlevel of development. The purpose is not to choke off Mexico's \ndevelopment or China's development. The purpose is to start addressing \nthe greenhouse gas problem in the only meaningful way we can, that is, \nthrough globally and through binding commitments up front. The \ntimeframe could be 5 years, 7 years, 10 years or whatever. The initial \ncommitment to action, starting upon signature in Kyoto, could be \nrelatively modest, pacing upwards depending upon various factors, with \na specific goal to be achieved within a fixed time period. There are \nplenty of tools to encourage the developing world to make meaningful \ncommitments.\n  The message to U.S. negotiators is that all nations--that is the \nmessage of this resolution--particularly those that are making and will \nin the future make a significant contribution to greenhouse gas \nemissions need to make commitments at Kyoto that unequivocally \ndemonstrate a tangible action program--action, not just words--to \ntackle the problem of climate change; and the need to start with their \nbest efforts to act on those commitments immediately, not 5 years down \nthe road, not 10 years down the road but immediately, and not settle \nfor vague promises to return to a future negotiation to get serious.\n  American industry has expressed concern that a treaty without \ndeveloping country commitments would encourage capital flight and a \nloss of jobs in the United States. We do not as yet have available the \nadministration's current best assessment of the economic impacts of \nvarious levels of emissions targets in the United States. However, \npreliminary work done by the Argonne Laboratory on this matter is \nworrisome in that its worst case scenario shows a very negative \neconomic impact on American industry.\n  Mr. President, as I have said, we do not yet have a clearly \narticulated economic assessment by the administration, and so it is \nimpossible to make specific judgments as to the economic impacts on \nparticular industries and how they can be mitigated by other tools that \ncould be included in the treaty. Dr. Janet Yellen, Chairman of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, stated in a hearing before the \nEnvironment Committee on July 17, the administration has not settled on \na particular set of policies to reduce emissions and intends to engage \nall interested parties in a White House conference on climate change \nthis fall.\n  The American people need to understand the situation and the actions \nto be taken. The President is committed to this major public education \ncampaign, and I note that he yesterday convened a meeting of scientists \nat the White House to discuss the evidence regarding global warming and \nto begin that educational process.\n\n  There surely will be costs if the United States is to make the \nchanges to our existing industrial base and to our lifestyle necessary \nto meet the goals of the treaty. Our smokestacks must be cleaner and \nour automobiles more efficient. There are many ways to achieve these \ngoals, but we must be able to tell the American people what will be \nrequired to meet any proposed commitment.\n  The Senate is doing the right thing in addressing the negotiations in \na principled way without attempting to micromanage those negotiations. \nIt is possible that the Senate will have a binding revision to the Rio \nPact presented to it within a year. Given the tremendous implications \nfor this agreement, the Byrd-Hagel resolution also suggests that the \nleadership create a bipartisan group of Senators to monitor the \nnegotiations and report periodically to the full Senate on the nature \nof the agreement as it is being shaped by our negotiators. The nations \nof the world are all in this global boat together. It is not a boat of \nwhich only half will sink while the other half stays\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\nafloat. Unless we all pull our oars in the same direction and plug the \nlarge leaks as well as the small leaks, our ship will flounder and \nsurely sink. This resolution will give the Senate and the American \npeople a seat at the negotiating table and add strength to our U.S. \nnegotiating team.\n  I thank all Senators for their attention, and I hope the resolution \nwill be adopted by a substantial majority.\n  Now, some of the Senators who have signed on to the resolution may \nhave differing views about the treaty, but there is one thing that we \nare in agreement on--one or two things. These are set forth in the \nresolution beginning and concluding with the resolving clause. One, \nthat all nations, all nations must take steps now, at the time of the \nsigning of the treaty, to begin limiting their emissions of greenhouse \ngases. Mere promises will not be sufficient. Mere promises will not get \nby this Senate. A treaty will have to have the approval of a two-thirds \nsupermajority in this Senate, and that is what we are telling the \nadministration. We are letting the Administration know that this Senate \nis not just going to consent or not consent on a treaty. This Senate is \ngoing to fulfill its constitutional obligations not only to consent but \nalso to ``advise'' and consent. And the resolution also provides that \nsuch a treaty must not result in serious harm to the economy of the \nUnited States.\n  So I suggest that all Senators read the resolution's resolving \nclause. That is where we come together. That is where Mr. Hagel's \nviews, my views, the views of others who are signatories of the \nresolution blend and constitute a consensus.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd very, very much.\n  I yield up to 5 minutes to my friend and distinguished colleague from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is always good to work with my longtime \nfriend, Senator Byrd, on a project that we both believe very strongly \nin, and it is good to work with a newfound friend. I have had an \naffection for people from Nebraska for a long time, and Jim Exon and I \nworked together as Governors and then here. I appreciate the Senator's \nfriendship and getting to know each other. And so I thank him for his \ncooperation and help here this morning.\n\n  Mr. President, there is an old saying that when you run out of luck, \nyou better get a new pair of dice. As far as I am concerned, we have \nlost every roll of the dice during the climate change negotiations, and \nwe better get ourselves a new pair. Otherwise, American workers will be \nout of luck. That is why I rise today to support Senate Resolution 98 \nwhich Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel now have before the Senate.\n  If you take a good look at the global climate change treaty currently \nbeing negotiated, you will discover that developing nations are the \nhigh rollers while the developed nations keep coming up with snake eyes \nand the big loser is the global environment. That is because only \ndeveloped nations would be legally bound by the treaty hammered out by \nnegotiators, the so-called ``Berlin Mandate'' produced back in 1995. \nDeveloping nations are off the hook.\n  That decision contained two glaring errors. First, negotiators agreed \nto complete negotiations for the post-2000 period by the artificial \ndeadline of 1997 before they began implementation of the 1992 \nconvention and before there was an understanding of the complexity of \nthose negotiations.\n  Second, negotiators succumbed to the demands of China and other \ndeveloping countries that any agreement reached in Kyoto in 1997 for \npost-2000 commitments must exempt Asian economies such as China and \nIndia and the rest of the developing world. Right now, developed \nnations and developing nations have about equal levels of carbon \nemissions, but within 5 years of the deadline developing nations will \nhave more than 1\\1/2\\ times the 1990 level of the developing world.\n  So because of those bad rolls of the dice, the treaty is heavily \nweighted against America and especially against American workers. That \nis because the U.S. will have to make the steepest reductions and \nsuffer the costliest and most damaging consequences. Preliminary \nestimates put the loss as high as 600,000 American jobs each year. And \n600,000 jobs is probably a low estimate because the treaty creates an \nenormous incentive for American businesses to shift more and more jobs \noverseas to avoid the expensive emission reductions that U.S. \nbusinesses will have to meet.\n  The impact in Kentucky would be especially bad. Not only miners \nworking in the coal fields of eastern and western Kentucky suffer job \nlosses but many of the businesses and factories that have created a \n``golden triangle,'' as we refer to it, between northern Kentucky, \nLouisville and Lexington would be forced to close, and every single \nKentuckian will experience and face higher electric bills and higher \ngas prices. The sad thing is we will not even get a cleaner \nenvironment. That is the sad thing. We will not stop global warming. We \nwill not even reduce carbon emissions. That is because every ton of \nreduced emissions in the United States and other developed nations will \nbe made up and then some in the developing world.\n  The way I see it we have been stuck in a game with loaded dice. You \nhave a treaty with devastating consequences for the American economy. \nYou end up with virtually no environmental benefit. It looks like \nnothing more than a massive foreign aid package paid for with American \njobs.\n  It is clear that many American interests are being neglected by our \nnegotiators and that we must come up with a better solution for the \nproblem of global emissions. But time is limited for the Senate to send \na message that the treaty as currently reported is not acceptable.\n  The answer is clearly not, as proposed by the State Department, a \nKyoto protocol and then a second agreement of some kind after Kyoto in \n2005 or even later. That scenario ignores the fact that we have no \nassurances China and other developing countries will become parties to \nany agreement with a commitment to simply start discussions for a third \nagreement.\n  I believe Senator Byrd's and Senator Hagel's resolution is the right \nmethod. It sets commonsense parameters for our negotiators to work from \nand assures that any treaty meets the goal of reduced emissions without \npenalizing one country over another.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in sending this important message, \nnot only to our negotiators, but to the American people that both the \nglobal environment and our national interests must be protected.\n  I thank my friends and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Scott Bunton \nand Gregg Rothschild, of my staff, be permitted access to the floor \nduring the resolution deliberation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Nebraska and the \nSenator from West Virginia for raising an issue of common sense and a \nvery legitimate issue regarding the U.S. negotiating position with \nrespect to global climate change.\n  I have not been a cosponsor up until this point of the resolution \nbecause I shared with Senator Lieberman and Senator Chafee concerns \nabout some of the phrasing and the meaning of some of the resolution \nwith respect to the negotiating process. We thought it was important to \nseek clarification with respect to those points before having a vote.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I raised those \nconcerns during the markup. I voted to send this resolution to the \nfloor for consideration today. Pending the ultimate discussion that we \nhave on the floor here today, it is my intention to vote for this \nresolution because I think it embraces common sense.\n  That common sense is the notion that if you are really going to do \nsomething to effect global climate change\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\nand you are going to do it in a fair-minded way that will permit you to \nbuild consensus in the country, which is important, and to build the \nnecessary support to ratify a treaty, we are going to have to do this \nin a way that calls on everybody to share the burden of responding to \nthis problem. That means that we need to have an agreement that does \nnot leave enormous components of the world's contributors and future \ncontributors of this problem out of the solution.\n  It is simply wrong to assume that facing the difficulties we have had \nsince the Rio treaty, the agreement in Rio, which 155 nations signed, \nthat we are going to be able to now face up to those greater \nresponsibilities without bringing everybody into the solution. The \nnotion that China or India or other enormously rapidly developing \ncountries, who will before too long also be adding very significantly \nto this problem, and already are to some degree, are going to somehow \nlater negotiate their participation I think is contrary to common \nsense. So I have joined in the notion that it is appropriate to \nreconsider the Berlin Mandate and to discuss how the U.S. Senate \nproperly thinks we should approach these negotiations.\n  But let me also make it clear that, in this strange hybrid of \nSenators who have signed on as cosponsors to this resolution, there are \nsome who do not want any treaty. There are some who do not think it is \na problem. There are some who do not accept the science. There are some \nfor whom the effort is one to really have nothing happen. I am pleased \nthat Senator Byrd is not one of those and that many of those who will \nvote for this resolution, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, join me \nand others in believing that this is a serious problem with science \nthat supports it.\n  It is not my purpose to debate the science very deeply here this \nmorning because the science is not at issue in this resolution. This \nresolution is a question of negotiating tactics. This resolution is \nabout how we will approach the question of reducing greenhouse gases, \nnot whether. It is a question not entirely based on science.\n  But nevertheless, the Record ought to reflect as we approach these \nissues that the science overwhelmingly documents the notion that a \nphenomenon known as global warming is already occurring, it is \noccurring. There is no debate among scientists as to whether or not it \nis happening. There is some debate as to what the impacts will be. \nThere is debate about the models and how much those models show with \ncertitude it is going to happen in what part of the country.\n  Can we predict what will happen to Nebraska? The answer is no. Can we \npredict what will happen to my State of Massachusetts and the coastal \nzones? Well, to some degree some scientists are suggesting you can, but \nsome people remain questioning that.\n\n  Let me make it very clear--someone raised the question about how the \nPanel on Climate Change now predicts the global warming of only 1 \ndegree to 3.5 degrees Celsius over the coming century. People say that \nis not really that bad and it is hardly a cause for concern. Let me \npoint out to my colleagues that the global average temperature has \nchanged by less than a degree Celsius up or down for 10,000 years. We \nknow that. So the projected warming is expected to exceed any climate \nchange that has occurred during the history of civilization.\n  In addition, even apparently small global average temperature changes \nwill be accompanied by much larger regional climate shifts. For \nexample, a warming which is twice as large as the global average is \nprojected to occur at high northern latitudes. Apparently, small global \naverage changes have also led to very large climate shifts in the past.\n  Moreover, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, representing \nthe consensus of climate scientists worldwide, has concluded:\n\n       . . . the balance of evidence suggests that there is a \n     discernible human influence on global climate. And the year \n     1995 matched 1990 as the hottest year on record.\n\n  What we know to a certainty also is that from the 1980's on we have \nbeen recording these increasingly heated periods. We then saw Mount \nPinatubo's cooling effect. We saw that cooling effect begin to diminish \nas the impact of that volcanic disruption between the Sun's rays and \nthe Earth dissipated. So we have begun to return to the high readings \nthat we saw characteristic of the late 1980's. March through December \nof 1994 were the warmest periods on record according to the National \nWeather Service climate analysis.\n  I could go on. The National Academy of Sciences has reported that \ndespite uncertainties, greenhouse warming poses a potential threat, \n``sufficient to merit prompt responses * * * Investment in mitigation \nmeasures acts as insurance protection against the great uncertainties \nand the possibility of dramatic surprises.''\n  In addition, the panel suggested that substantial mitigation could be \naccomplished at very modest costs; in other words, insurance is cheap, \nthey said.\n  Let me point out one other fact that was set forth at the hearings we \nhad in the committee.\n  We know that we are the world's greatest emitter of greenhouse gases. \nWe know that carbon dioxide is the most significant of those. We know \nthat the oceans mitigate the increase of carbon dioxide that we put \ninto the atmosphere. The oceans consume the carbon dioxide.\n  But what we have also learned as a matter of science is that there is \nsome level at which there is this potential of saturation of the \noceans. We do not know where that is. The oceans recirculate it. And \nthe question remains whether or not you might have an extraordinary, \ndramatic impact because of the reaching of this saturation point.\n  Some people may want to tempt that. Some people may not feel any kind \nof generational responsibility or any kind of global responsibility and \nsuggest that, well, all of these thousands of scientists, all of the \nconsensus reached by 155 nations--they may want to choose to ignore it.\n  But when scientists tell me that the oceans are already rising and \nthey are already rising at a discernible and measurable rate and that \nwe are continuing a process of warming and that between now and the \nmiddle of the next century oceans will rise 1 to 3 feet and that the \nimpact of that will be devastation on the coast of Florida, the loss of \nisland nations, and the remarkable impact on wetlands all around the \nplanet, I think we have a responsibility to say, well, we ought to try \nto think about that. And that is exactly what this effort to deal with \nglobal climate change is trying to do.\n  Now, I am not going to debate all of the science and the models and \nwhat can or cannot be done here. But it is clear that one of the chief \nsponsors of this resolution, Senator Byrd--and you have heard him \nspeak--agrees, and Senator Lieberman and Chafee and others do, that the \nprospect of human-induced global warming as an accepted thesis with \nadverse consequences for all is here, and it is real.\n  There are some Senators, as I have said, who want to debate that \nscience; and so be it. That is not what this resolution is about. This \nresolution is a question of how our negotiators will negotiate. What we \nought to be seeking in Kyoto, as we pursue what most people have \ndecided, is a legitimate concern.\n  Senator Byrd's resolution makes a first step toward tackling the \nissue of changing the balance of how we approach this. As I have said, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Chafee, and I would have worded some things \ndifferently. But we are convinced in our discussions with Senator Byrd \nthat the intent here is similar, which is to guarantee that our \nnegotiators have a changed position, a tougher position, but a \nreasonable position in negotiating how we will come to agreement in \nKyoto.\n\n  Let me point out a couple of those areas where we had some concerns. \nThere is language in the resolution about the developing nations \naccomplishing their reductions within exactly the same compliance \nperiod as the developed nations. I have come to the conclusion that \nthese words are not a treaty killer that some suggested it might have \nbeen.\n  I am encouraged to learn that Senator Byrd's objective is to support \nentering into a binding international agreement to address climate \nchange, and he also agrees that all nations, developed and less \ndeveloped, ought to participate in this significant effort.\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\n We both recognize that, as a matter of global and national \nenvironmental protection, the global warming issue is not going to be \nable to be addressed effectively if any major emitting nation or group \nof nations stays outside the agreement. So, ultimately, all major \nemitting nations will need to reduce greenhouse emissions if we are \ngoing to make significant progress on global warming.\n  I heard one of my colleagues talk earlier about who is going to \npolice this, and how do you enter into this international agreement. \nWell, the fact is we enter into international agreements all the time. \nWe have trade agreements. We have arms control agreements. We have \nenvironmental agreements. We police them by arriving at mutually \nagreeable means of being able to raise the issues with each of those \nnations that might be offending, and we have done so without ever \ngiving up our sovereignty. So, that is just a red herring in this \nissue. We know that we can do that, and we will do that.\n  We also know that we are trying to seek an equilibrium with other \nnations so we are not losing jobs while other people are gaining some \nfoothold in the marketplace. We understand that. We are not seeking to \nconsciously enter into an arrangement that will disadvantage the United \nStates of America and our economy.\n  On the other hand, every environmental agreement and every agreement \nwe have reached so far requires some change in the way we do business. \nThat change has generally produced more jobs, not less jobs. One of the \nfastest growing industries in Massachusetts has been environmental \ntechnology, as we develop new means of producing clean coal or \nscrubbers or as we create other kinds of mitigation for toxins or \nchemicals. I think that the same thing can happen here. If the United \nStates is smart, we will be the provider of these technologies to the \nworld.\n  There still appears to be a little bit of uncertainty as to what this \nphrase within the same compliance period actually means. But after a \nnumber of discussions with Senator Chafee's and Senator Byrd's staffs, \nI believe that we have reached an understanding that it means \nessentially that we want countries to begin to reduce while we are \nreducing, we want them to engage in a reasonable schedule while we are \nengaged in a reasonable schedule, but that if a developing nation needs \nmore time to get a plan in place or needs to have more time to raise \nthe funds and be able to purchase the technology and do the things \nnecessary, that as long as there is a good-faith track on which they \nare proceeding, that if it took them a number of years, 2 years, 3 \nyears, 5, or longer to be able to reach a particular goal, that \ncertainly means within the same compliance period they are operating \nsimilarly to try to meet the standards that we want to set out. We \nbelieve that, given that less-developed countries are not currently \nprojected to emit more emissions than industrial countries until at \nleast the year 2015, it is reasonable to permit some flexibility in the \ntargets and the timing of compliance while at the same time requiring \nall countries to agree to make a legally binding commitment by a date \ncertain. That is reasonable. But I think most of my colleagues would \nagree that if some country simply doesn't have the capacity, the plan, \nthe money, or the technology, it may be they have to take a little more \ntime and we should want to be reasonable in helping them to do that \nbecause the goal here is to get everybody to participate, not to create \na divisiveness that winds up with doing nothing.\n\n  There is a second issue here, and that is the issue of emissions \ntrading. While this resolution includes provisions that address \ndeveloping countries' participation, a number of us are critical of the \nfact that it is silent on the question of flexibility, a question of \nwhat market tools or what market access tools ought to be permissible \nfor use by all countries. I believe that the record is clear that \nemissions trading is a vital market mechanism that will benefit the \nUnited States.\n  Emissions trading not only advantages the U.S. business, but it would \nprovide developing countries with incentives to sign up to binding \nlegal commitments that most people believe are important in this \ntreaty. I would like to point out to my colleagues that, currently in \nthe negotiations, Europe is trying to create a bubble over Europe \nitself, trying to create a separate agreement where Europe will be able \nto have emissions trading among European countries, but we and others \nwould not be able to engage in that trading. The result would be that \nyou might have Belgium required to do a 10-percent reduction in 2010 \nfor CO2 and CH4 and NOX. But at the \nsame time, Greece would be able to increase by 30 percent. Spain would \nincrease by 17 percent. Ireland would increase by 15 percent. Portugal \nwould be able to increase by 40 percent. This is because they are \ntrying to set up a structure where they can trade amongst each other \nfor emissions without us having that same capacity.\n  Now, if anything disadvantages American industry, it would be to have \nEurope create a bubble for itself to the exclusion of the United States \nto be able to emissions trade. I am against that. I think that is \nanticompetitive and it is anti-United States. This is silent on that. I \nhope my colleagues will agree with me that we want the United States to \nbe able to trade with one of these countries. We want the United States \nto be able to trade with one of the less developed nations so that we \ncan do what we have done in the United States.\n  Let me point out, here is the impact. Referring to this chart, these \nare what we have done in the United States. This black line represents \nthe actual SO2 emissions in the United States, and this was \nthe projected rate of reduction if we were to engage, under the Clean \nAir Act, in emissions trading, and this pink line was what we \nprojected. But because emissions trading has been such an effective \nmarket tool, this yellow line represents the actual rate of reductions \nin SO2 emissions. So we have had a phenomenal success \nthrough emissions trading in reducing emissions in our country. And it \nwould be simply against common sense to have a negotiation which \nprecluded the capacity of the United States to engage in this emissions \ntrading.\n  This chart shows the growth indicators and emissions. The black line \nrepresents the gross domestic product increase of the United States of \nAmerica from 1985 to 1995. The electricity demand in the United States \nis the pink line, and the electricity demand went up almost \nconcomitantly with the gross domestic product. At the same time, \nbecause we engaged in these tradings within our States, here is what \nhappened with the emissions trading effect. The SO2 \nemissions dramatically went down, even as electricity demands went up.\n  So it is a proven tool, it is a market force tool, and it is one that \nwill enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States. I am \npleased that, in my discussions with Senator Byrd, he has indicated \nthat there is nothing in this resolution that precludes the capacity of \nour negotiators to pursue this as a tool in our negotiations and, \nconceivably, as one of the ingredients of a Kyoto treaty.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. For what purpose?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I would like to respond, if I could.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will finish up, and then I want to reserve some time for \nSenator Chafee, and others. If I can complete, then and the Senator, on \nhis time, can certainly ask any question that he wants to.\n  Let me just say that we believe very strongly that we need to put a \nstructure in place that will provide incentives for nations and \nindustries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. And we \nbelieve, obviously, the developing world is poised to undertake a \nmassive infrastructure investment in energy, transportation, and other \npotentially high-emitting sectors. These investments are going to have \nlong-term capital stock lifetimes, and if we were to exclude that \ndiscussion of them being part of this, it would be an enormous error of \njudgment, I think, for the longrun of this effort.\n  One final comment I will make on the science. Even if we were to \nreduce our greenhouse gas emissions today to 1990 levels, you will \nstill continue to have the greenhouse gas warming effect, because the \nlife of these gases in the atmosphere will go on for 75 years, or \nlonger, into the future and because of the cumulative effect and the \nlack of\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\nknowledge about where you may have a saturation point or a devastating \nimpact, caution and common sense predicate that we should do everything \npossible in order to avoid the potential of that kind of catastrophe.\n\n  I reserve the balance of our time.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I need. I just \nwould like to make a quick response to my colleague. I noted that my \ncolleague from Massachusetts keeps employing the name of Senator Byrd. \nI assume that Senator Byrd is going to have an opportunity to speak for \nhimself on this.\n  First, let's be very clear. This is all interesting, but it does not \nat all have anything to do with the Byrd-Hagel resolution. That is No. \n1. Two, I am saying--and I think much of what we are talking about on \nthe resolution that legally binding commitments are pretty tough, and \nwe want to understand about those legally binding commitments before \nanybody gets legally bound, regarding if we are talking about a \nEuropean bubble, or whatever.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me answer the Senator by saying we don't disagree with \nthat at all.\n  Mr. HAGEL. This is interesting, I say to the Senator, but again it \ndoes not reflect on what the Byrd-Hagel resolution reflects.\n  Mr. KERRY. How doesn't it reflect on it?\n  Mr. HAGEL. We don't talk about the European bubble. More important, \nwe don't talk about European trading and joint implementation. If \nSenator Byrd wants to say that, he can. This Senator wants to make it \nclear that I am not in favor of any sort or form of emissions trading \nor joint implementation.\n  Furthermore, any kind of implied United Nations bureaucracy with the \npower to come in and inspect and penalize and fine and shut down \nAmerican companies, which obviously is the legitimate logical \nconclusion of this, I want to be on record right now in saying I oppose \nthat. Obviously, Senator Byrd can speak for himself.\n  Mr. KERRY. To answer the Senator, since he wanted to engage in this \ndiscussion, no one has suggested any such thing, and I would be against \nthat, also.\n  Second, the Senator would have to agree with me that this resolution \nis silent on the issue of emissions trading. That is what I said; I \nsaid it is silent.\n  Mr. HAGEL. That is what I have said. I said I could not support that, \nwill not support that, and I want to make sure my colleagues understand \nthat, and that we stay focused on this.\n  Mr. KERRY. We will let the Senator from West Virginia speak for \nhimself. But it is my understanding that the Senator from West Virginia \nhas a different view.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Kerry, is it your intent \nto enter into a colloquy with the Senator from West Virginia on this \nissue?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, not necessarily. I am going to wait until I \nhave had a moment to discuss this with Senator Chafee. But we can \nproceed with the debate. There are people on his side that would like \nto speak. I will reserve the balance of our time.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Senator. I would like to yield to my friend \nfrom Kansas 2 minutes for his comments on this issue as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, might I inquire of my distinguished \ncolleague from Nebraska, was that 4 minutes or 2 minutes?\n  Mr. HAGEL. It is 2 minutes. It was 4 minutes 2 minutes ago, and I am \nsorry about that. I might add that we intend to continue this dialog \nand colloquy, hopefully, next week because as a result of the fact that \nwe were given less time late last night than what was originally agreed \nto, even though I happen to be standing in this position, there is not \nmuch I can do with that. I live by the law. So that is why you have 2 \nminutes, and probably less.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, might I inquire whether that dialog came \nout of my time? I assume I have an additional 2 minutes. I was merely \nquestioning the distinguished Senator from Nebraska on the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair. I am upset. Talking about global \nwarming, I have a little global warming underneath the collar. Two \nminutes and one hour of debate for such a terribly, terribly serious \nquestion.\n  I rise in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 98, and that is a \nfancy word that puts the Senate on record against any U.N.-sponsored, \nlegally binding greenhouse treaty. I come to this issue as the former \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee, where we spent years \ntrying to address our emission policies with sound science, reasonable \ncost-benefit considerations, and I want to wake up farm country because \nthat is not what is going to happen.\n  A U.N. scientific panel now blames agriculture, under the auspices of \nthis plan, for 20 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. \nThey propose the following things, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer, so get your \npencil out, get your yellow tablet out. We don't have time to really \ndiscuss this--Senators want to leap on their airplanes at 12 o'clock--\nin terms of an issue that will affect every life and every pocketbook \nin America. But we are here talking about it, and I probably have 30 \nseconds.\n  Wake up. Mandatory increased fuel economy requirements. Phaseout of \ndiesel fuel. How are our tractors going to run? I don't know. \nLimitations on production. Been there, done that. We passed a new farm \nbill. Mandate for no-till; no-till farming, forcing farmers to buy all \nsorts of new equipment. Here's a good one: Restrictions on livestock \nproduction to reduce methane emission for the United Nations. We are \ngoing to control what goes into the cow and now, evidently, we are \ngoing to have a U.N. observer trying to control what comes out of the \ncow. And restrictions on processing and transportation of food \nproducts.\n  This is uncalled for. Many of my colleagues joined to send a letter \nto the administration to say, how on Earth are we going to do this and \nstill feed America in a troubled and hungry world? That answer has not \nbeen forthcoming. We recommended five considerations, and then we \nfollow with the letter that was sent to the President last November by \nevery major agriculture group.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 8, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Last summer, participants in the second \n     Conference of Parties of the United Nations' Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed to negotiations \n     for legally binding numeric limits on greenhouse gas \n     emissions. This dramatic shift from voluntary to enforceable \n     caps on greenhouse gases was led by the U.S. According to \n     your spokespeople, there is now a consensus in the world \n     scientific community which demands urgent action to reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n       There is less than agreement outside the United Nation's \n     scientific body. Furthermore, there is still a lively debate \n     among respected scientists about the human versus natural \n     sources of greenhouse gases and their effect on climate. \n     Controversy notwithstanding, the climate change treaty is \n     moving full-speed ahead with the Administration's \n     enthusiastic support. A final agreement is scheduled to be \n     completed in December of 1997, with ratification by \n     individual countries beginning in 1998. If ratified by the \n     U.S. Senate, the treaty will be binding on the U.S. and other \n     developed countries and may be incorporated into U.S. law. \n     However, developing countries will not have to comply.\n       Of great concern to agriculture are reports under \n     consideration by the U.N. scientific panel which blame \n     agriculture for more than 20 percent of human-caused \n     greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, we are concerned \n     about proposals for the following: fuel economy requirements, \n     reduction or phaseout of the use of diesel fuel, limitations \n     on production per acre for some crops, requirements for \n     ``plowless'' soil preparation, mandatory fallowing of crop \n     land, limits and restrictions on livestock production to \n     reduce methane emissions, restrictions on use of fertilizer, \n     restrictions on timber harvesting, restrictions on \n     processing, manufacturing and transportation of food \n     products.\n       Unfortunately, these proposals ignore agriculture's \n     positive role in reducing greenhouse gases by removing carbon \n     dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Most \n     importantly, they cavalierly disregard the most valuable \n     function of modern agriculture--feeding a hungry world. \n     Ironically,\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\n     rice production has been singled out as the number one \n     culprit in human-caused methane emissions.\n       We are very concerned that these recommendations or similar \n     ones will be incorporated in the final climate change \n     agreement, ratified and imposed on U.S. farmers and ranchers \n     through U.S. laws. Binding and enforceable controls would \n     apply only to developed countries and would severely \n     disadvantage U.S. farmers and ranchers in today's global \n     markets.\n       Moreover, we are deeply concerned and surprised that the \n     Administration has not actively consulted with agriculture as \n     the agreement has been developed. We respectfully request \n     that the Administration take the following actions:\n       (1) The Administration must fully and actively consult with \n     agriculture. Agricultural interests have not been considered \n     by the Department of State and other U.S. agencies which are \n     closely involved with the development of the climate change \n     agreement. The agreement must include an open and extensive \n     public debate which involves agricultural producers and \n     members of Congress, USDA and other agencies.\n       (2) The Administration should withdraw its support for \n     legally binding and enforceable caps on emissions until here \n     is a stronger consensus from the scientific community that \n     they are justified. If it is determined that controls are \n     justified, they should be accomplished voluntarily or in ways \n     which minimize disruption of U.S. agricultural producers.\n       (3) The final climate change agreement, scheduled for \n     completion in December of 1997, must be delayed to provide \n     sufficient time for consultation with agriculture and for \n     adequate risk, cost and benefit assessment.\n       Without proper scientific and economic analyses and \n     assessment, U.S. farmers and ranchers may be placed at a \n     serious disadvantage with agricultural producers in countries \n     which do not plan to reduce greenhouse gases.\n       If the Administration does not adequately address the above \n     concerns, we may raise them with Congress during the \n     ratification process.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Farm Bureau Federation, American Crop Protection \n           Association, American Sheep Industries Association, \n           American Soybean Association, CENEX, National \n           Association of Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen's Beef \n           Association, National Corn Growers Association, \n           National Cotton Council, National Food Processors \n           Association, National Grange, National Milk Producers \n           Federation, National Pork Producers Council, The \n           Fertilizer Institute, United Agribusiness League, \n           United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, USA Rice, \n           Western Growers Association.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join a bipartisan \nmajority of my colleagues today in support of Senate Resolution 98 that \nputs the Senate on record against any United Nations-sponsored global \nclimate change treaty that would be binding on only developed nations.\n  It had been U.S. policy until last year that the United States would \npursue voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 \nlevels. This made sense, the science is not clear on global warming and \nno nation should risk their economic well being because of \nenvironmental extremism that ignores the call for sound science.\n  However, Deputy Secretary of State Tim Wirth last year at the Berlin \nmeeting of the Conference of Parties of the U.N. Framework Convention \non Climate Change suddenly changed the voluntary course of action. \nUnder the White House's supervision, Deputy Secretary Wirth proposed \nglobal warming treaty language that would force the United States and \nsmaller developed nations like Great Britain and Germany, to control \ntheir greenhouse gas emissions, but purposefully exempts so-called \ndeveloping nations such as China, India, South Korea, Mexico, and \nBrazil, from the binding treaty language.\n  It is fact that China and India will exceed United States greenhouse \ngas emissions early next century, but they will be exempt from this \nU.N.-designed treaty. These developing nations will have no \ninternational authority regulating their industries or way of life. As \na result, the White House is meekly declining to be forceful in its \nnegotiations and would rather unilaterally disarm our economy that is \nbased on power. If Deputy Secretary Wirth and others supporting this \ntreaty are so concerned, perhaps they can tell me how stopping United \nStates carbon dioxide emissions while letting China and India pollute \nwill help their environmental cause. What is the benefit? There is none \nunder this treaty if these nations are not brought into the same global \nscheme as the United States.\n  Mr. President we are really talking about a legally binding \ngreenhouse gas treaty. Sounds like Washingtonese to Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica, but what it really means is the White House is telling the \nworld that developed nations feel guilty about their strong and vibrant \nindustrial base, therefore they must be causing global warming. Deputy \nSecretary of State Tim Wirth in his June 19 testimony before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee admitted that because the United States \nproduces 20 percent of the world's carbon emissions and has only 4 \npercent of the world's population that Congress, without sound science \non global warming, mandate that business and consumers stop using their \ncars, trucks, combines, trains, and boats, not to mention shutting down \nfactories to ease the pain of others about our quality of life.\n  In 1990, the United States produced more than 26 percent of the \nworld's goods and services, while producing only 20 percent of its \ncarbon emissions. Deputy Secretary Wirth also failed to show that \nAmerica's air is getting cleaner because in the Environmental \nProtection Agency's report National Air Quality and Emissions Trends \nReport, 1995 documented improvement in air quality over the past 9 \nyears. This improvement in air quality seems to baffle the EPA and \nsupporters of the binding treaty because our air quality keeps \nimproving despite the growth of the U.S. population, more automobile \nuse, not to mention the growth in our gross domestic product.\n  And, what are the particulars of this globally binding treaty? \nPerhaps they are reluctant to tell the folks in Dodge City, America, \nthis treaty will establish a global greenhouse trading emissions \nsystem. This means some international body, probably the United \nNations, will be responsible for tracking our use of fossil fuels in \nthe United States. The United Nations will be required to know how much \njet fuel and diesel the Marines, Air Force, Army, and Navy use. The \nWhite House has not even discussed the national security implications \nof this treaty with the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Wake up, farm country, the U.N. scientific panel blames agriculture \nfor more than 20 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and \nhas proposed the following proposals for agriculture:\n  Increased fuel economy requirements, meaning that pickups will be \nlighter and cannot carry as much feed and seed;\n  Phaseout of diesel fuel. What does the President propose we burn in \ntractors?\n  Limitations on production per acre; been there done that.\n  Mandate for no-till, forcing farmers to use planters that may not be \nright for their crops or soil;\n  Restrictions on livestock production to reduce methane emission. \nEvidently the United Nations does not like cow flatulence;\n  Restrictions on fertilizer; and\n  Restrictions on processing and transportation of food products.\n  This is uncalled for and I joined with my Senate colleagues on the \nAgriculture Committee in a letter to the Vice President on March 14 \nexpressing our deep concern that the White House greenhouse proposal \nwas ignorant of the likely mandatory restrictions on the world's food \nand fiber supplier. Our agriculture policies are the responsibility of \nthe U.S. Congress in consultation with the President. The United \nNations should have no say whatsoever in planting, tilling, or \nharvesting. In our letter we asked the administration to analyze and \nbrief us on the following points regarding agriculture.\n  First, the potential effect of climate change on U.S. agriculture and \nlivestock production.\n  Second, the estimated greenhouse gas emission resulting from the \nproduction of crops and livestock in the United States.\n  Third, the net contribution of U.S. forests and crops soaking up \ngreenhouse gases.\n  Fourth, actions and controls necessary to reduce agricultural \ngreenhouse gas emissions to comply with obligations that may arise \nunder the treaty and an economic analysis of their impact on U.S. \nfarmers and ranchers.\n\n  Fifth, whether and to what extent greenhouse gas emission controls \nwould disadvantage agriculture producers in this country compared to \nproducers in other countries with fewer\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\nstringent emission controls or no controls at all.\n  The silence from the White House about our concern is evident that \nthey are waiting until December when Congress is safely at home that \nthey will reveal the treaty includes a carbon fuel tax. Fortunately, my \nastute colleagues in the Senate have been able to extract pieces of \nthis plan through congressional hearings. The White House will impose a \nBtu tax on energy sources like gasoline, diesel, and electricity. \nAccording to congressional testimony by Dr. Janet Yellen, chairman of \nthe President's Council of Economic Advisors, that a $100 tax for every \nton of carbon produced from fossil fuels will be needed to reduce U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels. I know that some of my \nseasoned colleagues recall that this is the same administration that in \n1993 proposed a complicated Btu tax on fossil fuels.\n  Mr. President, a Btu tax is unneeded and goes against everything the \nCongress and White House has been struggling for over the past 2 \nmonths, a balanced budget with income-tax breaks. What would this Btu \ntax cost the family, the small businessman, or farmer? Well, some \neconomists believe that to reach the 1990 level of U.S. carbon dioxide \nemissions that the Btu tax would be comparable to an increase of at \nleast a quarter, if not two, in the Federal gas tax. That's a lot of \nmoney for the pizza man or the single mother shuttling kids between \nschool and soccer practice. The same thing happens on these folks' \npower bills every month because coal or natural gas is used to generate \nelectricity that provides them a warm home in the winter and a cool \nhouse in the summer.\n  Coming from an energy-intensive State where we have to drive long \nways to reach home or work, this tax is senseless. Specifically, it \nwill hurt our farmers, who EPA Administrator Browner called earlier \nthis week the ``backbone of America.'' A Btu tax will dramatically \naffect the bottom line of farmers and ranchers. An analysis of the 1993 \nBtu tax proposal by the Kansas State University Department of \nAgriculture Economics determined that would have cost Kansas farmers \nfrom $1,311 to $4,531 depending on their location in the Sunflower \nState. That is a lot of money, and if the crops are bad, it hurts \nproducers' bottom line even more.\n  Here are some specifics from the report that need to be closely \nexamined because they will mirror what the White House will be \nproposing. A Rice County, KS, farmer planting continuous cropped wheat \nunder the 1993 proposed Btu tax cost per acre would have increased by \n$1.45. For a northeast Kansas dryland milo farmer in Brown County, his \ncost per acre would have risen by $2.90. The same Brown County farmer \ngrowing corn, which Kansas is increasing its acreage under freedom to \nfarm, would have paid $3.58 per acre for corn under a Btu tax. A Miami \nCounty farmer raising hay and alfalfa costs per acre would have gone up \n$2.91. why can't the White House give us this information about their \ntreaty proposal?\n  What concerns me is that the administration is paying attention to \nthe questionable science on global warming and is blindly putting the \nU.S. agriculture industry in an uneconomical production straitjacket \nthat will do more harm on a global scale. The Kansas State University \nstudy determined that the majority of a Btu tax will be passed on in \nthe price of fertilizer, ag chemicals, fuels, and grain drying costs. I \nwould like to quote directly from the study: ``[I]n return, the manager \nwill not be able to pass these costs on in terms of higher commodity \nprices. Farm managers may reduce the use of energy-intensive inputs to \nsome degree, resulting in smaller production and increased commodity \nprices.'' While I am never one to question higher wheat prices, I would \nif it meant forcing farmers from using diesel or fallowing fields \nbecause the United Nations suggested it to meet the treaty's \nrequirement.\n  The study summary goes on. ``An increase in the costs of production \nwill reduce the supply of farm crops.'' We, the United States, who \nproudly supplies the rest of the world with wheat, corn and almost \nevery imaginable natural product, probably cannot provide food to these \ndeveloping nations clamoring for international food aid if our \nproduction costs increase. If our production goes down, our domestic \nmarket will become paramount and the United States may have to ignore \nthe poor and hungry of other nations that we have been feeding for tens \nof years.\n  My colleagues, the administration was in the process of trying to \ndevelop a specific economic model to predict what the costs of this \nbinding treaty would be on America, not only farms, but all industries. \nBut, the administration told the Congress they specifically wanted the \nmodel to be peer reviewed to ensure there would be no questions about \nits results. However, when they presented it for peer review, the \nreviewers told the White House that their model did not work and, if \nthey did find one, it would clearly show the treaty would substantially \nhurt the economy. The White House refuses now to speculate what the \nimpacts would be. Could it be they are afraid of spooking Wall Street \nand its meteoric rise above 8,000? Why should companies invest in \nplants and people only to be taxed more here in the United States? As \nyou can see, this treaty will cost jobs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose any weakening \namendments to the resolution. This strongly worded sense of the Senate \nneeds to be shared not only with the appropriate administration \nofficials but world leaders in developed and developing nations. I know \nthat there will be a meeting in Bonn, Germany, in several weeks and I \nhope the administration will reveal to the world that if they propose \nsuch a misguided treaty to the U.S. Senate, it will fail.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I support Senate Resolution 98, the sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution on the Global Climate Change Treaty submitted \nby Senators Byrd and Hagel and supported by nearly two-thirds of the \nSenate. Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have \nmany serious concerns about the economic impact that this treaty would \nhave on our Nation.\n  By adopting this amendment, the Senate will be exercising its \nconstitutional role of advising the executive branch as part of a \ntreaty process. The President should take this resolution as a serious \nand constructive step in the treaty process.\n  Before we take another step toward ratification, I believe that the \nSenate must insure that the economic impact and inequity of this \ninternational agreement be fully aired for the American people.\n  As written, this legally binding treaty would require the United \nStates and other developed countries to reduce their carbon dioxide and \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2010. In order to \nmeet these targets, the United States would either have to issue new \nregulations or levy huge taxes on all fossil fuels in proportion to \ntheir carbon contents. Economists have suggested that stabilizing \nemissions at 1990 levels with a tax could cut America's gross domestic \nproduct by $350 billion. Further regulations would likely take even \nbillions more from our economy.\n  And what would the developing nations contribute?\n  What would our neighbors in Mexico have to do to help stop global \nwarming? Nothing.\n  What about other so-called developing nations like Korea, China, \nIndia, and Brazil?\n  The treaty lets them off the hook.\n  Mr. President, this is not an equitable international policy.\n  This is not a level playing field for the United States.\n  Simply put, I believe the United States should not ratify this treaty \nas it stands.\n  I do not believe that this Nation has been a bad actor when it comes \nto characterizing our environmental public policy. In fact, I believe \nAmerica has already set the example. An example which all Americans \nhave through their taxes and prices on many commodities has already \npaid for. Unless all the citizens of the globe are involved, there is a \nclear inequity.\n  Mr. President, this does not mean I do not want to address the issue \nof curtailing carbon emissions.\n  It means that we should only participate in a fair, balanced \nequitable agreement where all nations must participate.\n  Is there such a thing as global warming?\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\n  We must admit that there is no consensus among scientists about the \nvalidity of this theory. While some cry that the polar ice caps are \nmelting as we speak, others point out that the lower atmosphere has \nshown no statistically significant warming in the past 19 years.\n  I do not believe this is the place to launch a debate on the quality \nof the scientific data. I simply point out that the science is not \nsettled or certain. So why rush into signing a legally binding and \neconomically damaging international agreement?\n  This much is certain--in order for America to reach the treaty's goal \nof reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, the United \nStates will have to reduce their fossil fuel use by at least 25 \npercent.\n  How do those who advocate this treaty think this will impact our \ncountry?\n  Mr. President, let me give my colleagues some illustrations of what \nour Nation could face: First, energy taxes on energy use which would \nreduce economic growth by nearly 3 percent annually, increasing \nconsumer costs by $110 billion; second, the loss of under 2 million \nAmerican jobs, most of which will actually move overseas; and third, \nharm to the steel, basic chemicals, petroleum refining, aluminum, paper \nand cement industries, which would be targeted for severe restrictions \nby the treaty.\n\n  The Byrd-Hagel resolution states that the United States should not be \na signatory to any agreement that ``would result in serious harm to the \neconomy of the United States.'' I believe this is a reasonable and \nresponsible action.\n  Mr. President, this treaty imposes very serious burdens on our \neconomy with little environmental gain. This is just not a sound public \npolicy.\n  I have but one question for those who want to sign the treaty: How \ncan America help the global environment by wreaking havoc and permanent \nharm on our own economy?\n  This administration says that the United States--all alone--should \ndecrease its energy use for 40 years before the developing nations are \nrequired to participate. There is no guarantee that these developing \nnations will be any more interested in curtailing their energy use then \nthan they are now. Today, China is accelerating its use of fossil \nfuels, and by 2015, will likely pass the United States in total carbon \nemissions. Is it fair to let them off the hook now while we are subject \nto such stringent regulation?\n  The Byrd-Hagel resolution would require developing nations to comply \nwith the same regulations at the same time in the same treaty as the \nUnited States. This is not only equitable, it is the only way that \nthere can be any real benefit to the global environment.\n  Mr. President, the debate over global warming is tremendously \nimportant to the future of all Americans. The threat of losing 2.5 \npercent of our GDP will impose enormous hardships on the average \nconsumer. The treaty is essentially an attack on America's life style.\n  The United States has already spent more than a trillion dollars to \nclean the environment. American taxpayers must be assured that any new \nenvironmental programs actually provide benefits that outweigh their \ncosts and that are grounded in sound science. At the same time, we must \nnot enter into any international agreement that puts the United States \nat a significant disadvantage in the global arena.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Global Climate Change Treaty is \nunacceptable as it stands at the very least it needs the Byrd-Hagel \ncorrection.\n  I would like to thank and commend Senators Byrd and Hagel for their \ndedicated efforts to educate our colleagues on this issue. I appreciate \ntheir leadership and thoughtful consideration of this important \ninternational environmental issue. Thank you, Senator Byrd and Senator \nHagel.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in supporting the Byrd-Hagel resolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd resolution.\n  I will vote for this resolution, first, because the concerns of \nAmerican workers and industry must be considered in any treaty into \nwhich this country enters. This resolution unequivocally sends that \nmessage.\n  Second, it should be without dispute that developing nations must \ncontrol their emissions if we are to reduce greenhouse gas. This \nresolution strengthens our bargaining position to ensure real, \nattainable standards are established for developing countries, too.\n  I want to make it clear, however, that I support a negotiated global \nwarming treaty. I believe science and common sense mandate that we work \nto reduce emissions and increase forest conservation to offset \nemissions.\n  Regarding the developed-developing nation debate, I believe it is \nalso clear that we developed nations have historically emitted more \ngreenhouse gases per capita than have developing countries. In \naddition, we are economically more able to absorb whatever increased \ncosts occur based on the need to reduce emissions. Therefore, we should \nassist our neighbors through technology transfer, economic assistance, \nand joint ventures in meeting whatever emissions goals are established.\n  I offer my strong support to the administration as it continues \nnegotiations to reduce greenhouse gases worldwide. I thank Senator Byrd \nfor strengthening the American bargaining position with this \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd/Hagel \nresolution. This legislation expresses the sense of the Senate \nregarding the conditions for the United States to become a signatory to \nany international agreement on global climate change. Consideration of \nthis legislation is critical to shaping the upcoming debate on global \nclimate issues and amending the Framework Convention on Global Climate \nChange. An upcoming meeting in Kyoto, Japan, has the potential to \ncripple our economic potential, while allowing the emissions from less \ndeveloped nations to grow unchecked.\n  The Rio Treaty signed by President Bush called for industrialized \nnations to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels \nor lower by the year 2000. All but two countries will miss the goals, \nincluding the United States which missed the mark by 10 percent. The \nadministration blamed this on low fuel prices and a strong economy. Mr. \nPresident, this is not a liability or something the United States \nshould apologize for.\n  Nonetheless, in an effort to reverse this success, the Clinton \nadministration signed on to the Berlin mandate in 1995. This is an \nagreement of industrialized nations to further reduce emissions after \n2000. Unfortunately, this agreement exempts 130 developing countries \nfrom reductions or commitments in greenhouse gases. This enormous \nloophole will guarantee the failure of this agreement. In 1996, the \nadministration decided that it would use the Berlin mandate to create a \nnew treaty with legally binding mandates on emission levels.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned with the administration's \nintention to sign an agreement that commits the United States to \nlegally-binding emissions levels that will not achieve significant \nenvironmental gains. The fatal flaw of this agreement is that it \nexempts developing nations, including China which is estimated to \nexceed the United States in greenhouse gas emissions by 2015. By 2010, \nthe share of U.S. global emissions will fall from 20 percent to just 10 \npercent as developing nations continue to grow in population and \nindustrial capability. By the year 2100, developing nations are \nestimated to produce three-quarters of the total greenhouse gases.\n  In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July \n21, Under Secretary Tim Wirth argued this agreement was like a row boat \nand the United States should ``pull a heavier oar at the beginning; \nover time, we must all pull together.''\n  Mr. President, anybody who has ever operated a rowboat knows that \nwhen you pull harder on one oar you end up going in circles. And that \nis precisely what this agreement will do. It won't achieve any net \nenvironmental gains and worse, will succeed in sending our economy into \na tailspin.\n  Left unchanged, this agreement will provide a significant advantage \nto our competitors. In order to achieve lower emission levels, new \nenergy costs and other costly regulatory burdens required to reduce \nenergy use reduce our competitive advantage in all industries. It is \nlikely to force our most energy-intensive industries like steel,\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\naluminum, chemicals, refining, and paper production to move overseas. \nMr. President, this is unacceptable.\n  Study after study has demonstrated that this agreement would cripple \nour economy. A DRI/McGraw Hill study shows our Nation's GDP would be \nreduced annually by 2 to 3 percent. According to the AFL-CIO, between \n1.25 million and 1.5 million U.S. jobs would be lost. These jobs would \nreemerge in other countries where, as a result of the flawed agreement, \nemission levels and high energy taxes are not a concern. On top of this \nconsumer costs would rise by $50 to $100 billion annually. Higher \nenergy prices would mean increased costs on all goods including \ngroceries, electricity, and gasoline.\n  Mr. President, I represent a State that this treaty puts right in the \ncross hairs. There are 25,000 people whose jobs are tied directly to \nthe coal industry. Higher energy taxes, like the Btu tax proposed by \nthis administration, hits coal harder than any other energy source. \nThousands of well-paying jobs would be lost in my State as this \nadministration seeks to eliminate coal as our primary energy source, \nwhile giving developing nations an unfair advantage.\n  It is important to keep in mind that coal provides over 50 percent of \nour power needs nationwide. This is the low cost fuel source that helps \nmaintain this Nation's competitive edge and reduces increased \ndependency on foreign oil.\n  Not only would the Kentucky mining industry be devastated, but \nindustries across my State would feel the impact of higher energy \nprices. As I noted earlier, industries like chemical, steel, paper, and \naluminum would be greatly impacted. Three of our leading manufacturers \nGeneral Electric, Ford and Toyota use significant amounts of energy. \nThe 30,000 jobs at these facilities would all be threatened by our \nforeign competitors.\n  The Byrd/Hagel resolution addresses the unfairness in the agreement \nbeing considered by the administration. This resolution mandates \nspecific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas \nemission for developing nations, with the same compliance period.\n  If every nation doesn't agree to the same emission levels and \ntimetables, what incentive will they have to negotiate in the future \nwhen they have an overwhelming competitive advantage? It is important \nthat we not bargain away the economic advantages we have worked so hard \nto achieve.\n  Passage of this resolution will send a clear message to the \nadministration when they begin negotiations in Kyoto. I am hopeful this \nwill prevent the administration from signing an unacceptable agreement \nthat puts the burden of cleaning up the environment on American workers \njust to have these gains wiped out by developing nations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in sending a strong \nmessage to the administration by voting for the Byrd/Hagel resolution. \nThis is a vote for jobs and a vote for the environment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, later this year the 166 countries that \nsigned the 1992 climate change treaty will meet in Kyoto, Japan. They \nwill be seeking stronger measures to control a potential threat to the \nfuture of our planet and to the lives of everyone living today and \nchildren yet to be born.\n  The threat is easy to understand, even if the science is complicated \nand a bit uncertain. In hearings before the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee earlier this month, a panel of respected scientists \ngave us their assessment of the problem.\n  They told us that man-made emissions of greenhouse gasses, such as \ncarbon dioxide, have led to a distinct warming of the Earth over the \npast 100 years. More troubling, however was their prediction.\n  If left unchecked, the continued growth in these emissions, which \ntrap the sun's heat, will have potentially serious effects. These \nconsequences include shifting climate patterns and more frequent \nviolent weather events, such as floods and droughts.\n  Now most areas of the country experience extreme weather conditions \nfrom time to time. But permanent shifts in climate patterns can \nseriously alter our lives and our economy.\n  For instance, in an agricultural State, such as Montana, the prospect \nof more flooding and longer dry spells is a threat to the livelihood of \nour farming and ranching families and their communities. And, if \nweather patterns change, crop yields can be seriously decreased.\n  These kinds of threats to our future are serious enough that we must \ntake action to avoid them. We can begin by controlling our greenhouse \ngas emissions. And if we start with modest steps now, instead of \nwaiting, we will likely avoid any serious economic disruptions.\n  In 1992, the Rio summit asked developed countries to lead the way. \nThe climate change treaty committed these countries to voluntarily \nreduce their emissions of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by 2000.\n  Unfortunately, the voluntary actions didn't work. The good intentions \nof most countries never translated into concrete results. So if we are \nto control these emissions, the new treaty must contain binding limits \non emissions.\n  However, we also need to make another change in the 1992 treaty.\n  We certainly need binding controls on developed countries, which \ncurrently emit about 60 percent of global greenhouse gases. But we also \nneed them on developing countries, which are responsible for the \nremaining 40 percent.\n  We simply can't reach a solution by addressing only 60 percent of the \nproblem. Furthermore, unless all countries participate, we run the risk \nof giving our economic competitors an unfair advantage.\n  Yet developing countries are resisting such efforts. So how can we \nchange their thinking? Perhaps by broadening our own.\n  Let me take one country, China, as an example. Why China? For one, \nbecause over the next 20 years, China will be responsible for one-third \nof the increase in greenhouse gas emissions.\n  For another because the United States has a lot of issues to deal \nwith China on. Trade, human rights, regional security, and \nenvironmental protection, to name a few.\n  So despite fundamental disagreements on some issues, we share many \nmutual interests, including climate change.\n  China has more people potentially at risk from rising sea levels and \nviolent weather than any other nation. It also has an urgent need to \nincrease its domestic energy supplies. If we consider the broad array \nof interests we share, I suspect we will find ways to gain their \nsupport on climate change issues.\n  After all, China is a growing part of the problem, it must be part of \nthe solution.\n  Another aspect of encouraging developing nations to participate in \nnew emission controls is to include in the treaty flexible, market-\nbased strategies, such as joint implementation and emissions trading.\n  Market-based strategies have been very successful here at home. For \ninstance, the acid rain program in the 1990 Clean Air Act included \ntrading of sulfur dioxide emissions credits.\n  This program stimulated technological innovation. It also reduced \nsulfur dioxide emissions at a cost that was less than one-tenth that \npredicted by industry.\n  By including similar programs in a climate change treaty, we can \nachieve greenhouse gas reductions at the lowest possible cost. It gives \nU.S firms the flexibility to comply with emission targets in a way that \nmakes the most sense for them. And it will protect our worldwide \neconomic competitiveness.\n  For developing countries, emission trading can give them access to \nnew technology and financial support that will make it easier for them \nto comply with their new obligations.\n  The language contained in Senate Resolution 98 will help achieve the \ngoal of including all countries in the new treaty.\n  It requires that the treaty mandate new specific scheduled \ncommitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for developing \ncountry parties within the same compliance period as developed \ncountries.\n  But since developing and developed nations are starting from \ndifferent places, it makes sense to require different targets. Here \nagain, the language crafted by Senator Byrd helps. It does not specify \nthat developed and developing countries meet the same targets and \ntimetables.\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\n  When Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth recently appeared before the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, he spoke in support of Senator \nByrd's resolution. I believe he said it was ``largely on the button.'' \nHe added that the administration ``very much agrees with the thrust of \nwhat [Senator Byrd] is saying related to developing country \ncommitments.''\n  So although the language of the resolution requires new commitments \nfrom developing countries, the administration should seek emission \ntargets that are more consistent with their level of industrialization.\n  I plan to follow the treaty negotiations carefully to be sure that \ndeveloping countries have agreed to commit to controlling their \ngreenhouse gases.\n  And while the resolution unfortunately omits any mention of the need \nfor market-based strategies to achieve the emissions targets, I believe \nthe treaty must include them. They simply make much more sense for all \ncountries than the command-and-control approach being advocated by \nsome.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me say that the toughest issues for \ndemocracies to handle are those in which the threat to society builds \ngradually, but inexorably, over time, such as with global climate \nchange. We deal well with immediate crises.\n  My hope is that by debating this issue today, by passing this \nresolution, we will elevate the public discussion about climate change \nand avoid the need for a future crisis to spur us into action.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to comment on the \nresolution now before the Senate. It is clear from the number of \nMembers who are signatories to this resolution that the majority of \nthis Chamber has significant reservations, as it should, about the \nratification of any international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions \nunder the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. I intend to vote \nfor the resolution, but I must say I believe it does not go far enough \nin bringing to light the faults of the convention. I'd like to amplify \nsome points that are touched upon only briefly in the resolution.\n  I am very concerned about the call to move away from voluntary goals, \nas framed in the original convention, toward legally binding emissions-\nlimitation targets and timetables for the United States, as well as the \nother developed, or annex I, countries that are party to the \nconvention. The 1992 treaty, ratified by the Senate, called for the \neconomically developed countries to undertake voluntary actions to aim \nto reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, the only major \ndeveloped nations that will meet this voluntary target of 1990 levels \nby 2000 are Britain--because it switched its fuel for electricity \nproduction from heavily subsidized coal to North Sea natural gas--and \nGermany--because it is able to count efficiency gains from replacing \nits ancient East German powerplants. Despite the fact that the United \nStates is expected to miss its own target by about 10 percent, the \nadministration, by signing the Berlin mandate in March of 1995, now \nbelieves it is a good idea to pursue additional emissions reduction \ntargets after the year 2000. The Berlin mandate, which was not \npresented to the Senate for approval, sets up a process to negotiate a \nnew treaty that will: First, commit the United States, and other \ndeveloped countries to a legally binding agreement--contrary to the \nearlier approved agreement; and second, specifically exempt the 130 \ndeveloping countries, including the emerging economies of China, \nMexico, and Korea, from any additional commitments.\n  It does not make sense, either environmentally or economically, to \nfocus on the nations which are already spending billions on pollution \ncontrol and making substantial progress, while ignoring the so-called \ndeveloping countries. U.S. companies, using the best available \ntechnology, are able to eliminate a great deal of pollution from their \nemissions. To achieve an additional increment of pollution reduction \nrequires a much larger amount of money to be spent. Because of the law \nof diminishing returns, the costs will heavily outweigh any benefits. \nHowever, in developing countries, where the pollution control \ntechnology is not be as advanced or widespread as it is here in the \nUnited States, a dollar spent on pollution control will stretch much \nfurther and achieve far more significant reductions in overall \npollution. Thus, the cost/benefit ratio favors significant pollution \nreduction in developing, not developed, countries.\n  In addition to the simple cost/benefit analysis, many scientists \npredict the greatest increase of future greenhouse emissions will come \nfrom developing countries like China, Mexico, Brazil, and Korea. As \nmuch as 60 percent of global carbon emissions are expected to come from \nsuch countries in the next few decades, with China becoming the single-\nlargest emitter in the near future. Since these countries are expected \nto produce the bulk of future greenhouse emissions, exempting them will \nnot reduce net global emissions. Both cost-benefit analysis and common \nsense say that the most effective way to reduce net global pollution is \nto reduce emissions in the developing nations.\n\n  While I presume many supporters of this resolution agree that under \nno circumstances should the United States be subjected to legally \nbinding emissions limitations, I believe the resolution is somewhat \nunclear. As I read it, it says the United States will agree to legally \nbinding emissions if ``the protocol or other agreements also mandates \nnew specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions for developing country parties within the same compliance \nperiod.'' Unfortunately, I believe this condition is not sufficient. As \nmany of you know, it has been interpreted by different people in \ndifferent ways. Some read it to mean that the Senate will not approve a \ntreaty that does not include identical emissions level and target date \nrequirements. Others, however, have read the same language and \ndetermined that it means any treaty must have equal commitments when it \ncomes to setting time tables but not emissions levels. Unfortunately, \nit is easy to set developing countries on a time table and allow then \nto continue to pollute in any amount they desire. The emissions levels \ncan be easily set so that the developed countries have very stringent, \nand perhaps unattainable levels, while the developing countries have \nvery lax, easily reached goals--all the while, all countries are \noperating within the same time table. The time table alone does not \ndetermine the amount of pollution emitted; the emission level is more \nimportant. Setting the developing countries to the same timetables \nwithout meaningful emissions limitations will not preclude them from \nemitting larger amounts of greenhouse gases. This approach, I believe, \ndefeats the purpose of the treaty ratified by the Senate, which is to \nvoluntarily reduce greenhouse-gas emissions on a global scale. The \noriginal intent was not to legally bind the annex I countries to set \ntimetables and emissions levels while only requiring the developing \ncountries to comply with parallel timetables but not the same emissions \nstandards.\n  Also of concern is the fact that the administration is basing its \nclimate-change policy on questionable science. The science on climate \nchange is very much an open inquiry into an as-yet-unconfirmed \nphenomenon over which the scientific community remains sharply divided. \nDiscrepancies exist in the evidence now being considered. So, before \nthe administration binds the United States legally to costly, and \npossibly unnecessary, standards and goals, shouldn't we allow for the \nscience on this matter to first evolve and, in turn, allow for us to \nbase our decision on facts?\n  Finally, there is the question of why the United States would embark \non a course of action that many scientists say would do little \nenvironmental good. A report released in January of this year, January \n10, 1997, by the Congressional Research Service poses the question: \n``Given the scientific uncertainties regarding the magnitude, timing, \nrate, and regional consequences of the potential climatic change, what \nare the appropriate policy responses?'' I believe the appropriate \nresponse is to wait for the science to evolve; not to leap into legally \nbinding emission limits that, if developed, would not necessarily \nimprove the environment and would cost American citizens billions of \ndollars.\n  Confirming this approach, Dr. Robert C. Balling, Jr. of Arizona State \nUniversity issued a report entitled ``Global\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\nWarming: Messy Models, Decent Data, Pointless Policy.'' In it he \nstates, ``Global warming is presented as a crisis that can be stopped \nor minimized with appropriate policy actions. However, the evidence \nsuggests that realistic policies are likely to have minimal climatic \nimpact. Recent research also suggests that a delay in implementing \npolicy responses will have little effect on the efficacy of global \nwarming mitigation strategies.'' He continues: ``It is absolutely \nimperative that the policies developed for the global warming issue be \nbuilt on the best science.'' Mr. President, I could not agree more.\n  This December in Kyoto, Japan, the administration will further commit \nitself to the convention; it will be offering protocols to that \ninstrument that lack the necessary support of the scientific community. \nBecause we do not know enough to support these terms and allow for the \nadministration to exploit the ends to justify the means for climate-\nchange policy, the responsibility to ensure that the United States is \nnot legally committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions will be \nplaced in the hands of the U.S. Senate. We must preserve the right to \nquestion the validity of these protocols. Congressional oversight of \nthe negotiations is crucial and any agreement reached in Kyoto must be \nbrought before us for advice and consent. Once the science on this \nissue has evolved, we will then be able to base our laws on the science \nand avoid the costly mistake of basing the science on the laws.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Byrd \nresolution on global climate change and I urge my colleagues to support \nit. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution.\n  This resolution explains what the ground rules should be if the \nUnited States is to become a signer of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. This resolution would prohibit the \nratification of any treaty that would seriously threaten the economy of \nthe United States. It says that both industrialized nations and \ndeveloping countries must share the burden of any globally binding \ntreaty on climate change equally.\n  I support the Byrd resolution for one simple, but very compelling \nreason--jobs. For those of you who thought you'd hear a vacuum sound \npulling jobs overseas following NAFTA implementation--you ain't heard \nnothin' yet. The only thing this treaty will do, the way it is written \nnow, is destroy American industry as we know it. I will not be a party \nto any treaty or agreement that sends American jobs overseas. Business \nwon't have any incentive to maintain or build new factories in the \nUnited States.\n  Let me be clear: I support international efforts to improve the \nenvironment. But the effort must truly be international if we are to \nmake any progress. I do not believe efforts to control or reduce global \nwarming will be successful unless rapidly developing countries are \nforced to take the kind of tough steps that the United States will have \nto take.\n  We cannot be a part of a binding international agreement that lets \ncountries such as China, South Korea, and India off the hook. \nDeveloping nations do contribute to global warming. If we exempt them \nfrom the restrictions mandated for the industrialized nations, we will \nsimply see a shifting of pollution, not a reduction. This is not what \nanyone wants to see happen.\n  The objective of the treaty being negotiated is to curb global \nclimate change. The United States has already taken steps to achieve \nthis goal. At the beginning of President Clinton's first term, he \nreleased his administration's version of a domestic climate change \naction plan.\n  This plan relies on a comprehensive set of voluntary actions by \nindustry, utilities, and other large-scale energy users. It also \npromotes energy efficiency upgrades through new building codes in \nresidential and commercial sectors. Large-scale tree planting and \nforest reserves are encouraged, as well as increased use of \nhydroelectric power sources.\n  These are important steps which will have a positive impact on our \nglobal climate. We certainly must continue to research causes of global \nclimate change, and come up with scientifically sound solutions. Our \nviability as a nation and planet depends on it.\n  But we cannot throw away American jobs based on a plan that could \nhave only a marginal impact on climate change. Coming up with the right \nplan should have little effect on the American economy, because it will \nmean an overall sustainability of the global environment, and the \ncontinuation of the United States as a leader of technological and \nindustrial innovation.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I support this commonsense resolution, \nwhich will simply ensure that American jobs won't be lost as we address \nthe issue of global climate change. I am hopeful we can pass this \nresolution and move on to the next stage of protecting our global \nenvironment. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support and, as an \noriginal cosponsor, of Senate Resolution 98, the Byrd-Hagel global \nwarming resolution.\n  I want to thank the Senate leadership and Senators Byrd and Hagel, \nfor scheduling floor time for this important initiative before \nnegotiators begin talks in Bonn, Germany.\n  The administration's current go-at-it-alone plan regarding global \nclimate change is grossly unfair to the United States.\n  I am opposed to setting legally binding targets and timetables on the \nUnited States and other developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, while at the same time exempting China, Mexico, Brazil, \nSouth Korea, and India from those identical regulations.\n  This will only worsen the problem the administration claims it wants \nto fix.\n  Developing countries are projected to continue increasing their use \nof fossil fuels.\n  And by the year 2015, China alone is expected to surpass the United \nStates in total carbon emissions.\n  The Clinton administration's plan will also drive the economy down \nand send jobs overseas.\n  The AFL-CIO estimates that between 1.25 and 1.5 million American jobs \nwould go overseas.\n  And the plan would put the United States at a severe competitive \ndisadvantage and reduce our GDP by $200 billion.\n  Nevertheless, the administration--led by Under Secretary of State Tim \nWirth--is on a mad rush to sign a legally binding treaty in Kyoto, \nJapan, this December.\n  This is in spite of:\n  Uncertain global warming science;\n  The administration's unwillingness to reveal its final targets and \ntimetables for emissions reductions; and\n  The fact that they have now thrown out their economic analysis \nmodels, which were supposed to help guide policy makers.\n  The Byrd-Hagel resolution addresses these discrepancies.\n  It would direct the United States not to sign any agreement that \nwould:\n  ``Mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, unless it also mandates specific scheduled commitments to \nreduce gas emissions for developing countries within the same \ncompliance period''; and\n  ``Result in serious harm to the economy of the United States.''\n  Sixty-four of my colleagues have cosponsored this initiative and I \nurge their support of this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I strongly encourage the administration to listen to \nthe concerns being expressed by this Chamber.\n  Be honest with us and the American people, and realize that we will \nnot ratify any treaty which commits the United States to one set of \nstandards to reduce gas emissions, but will let China, India, Mexico, \nand other developing countries off the hook.\n  We ought to focus on bringing all of the countries of the world to \nthe table. Everyone ought to contribute to the cause.\n  Asking all nations to contribute--within the same compliance period--\nwill help the environment and help U.S. industries stay competitive.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \nSenate Resolution 98 regarding the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. Like my colleagues in the Senate, I too am concerned about the \neffects on the economy of any national or international agreements that \nthe United States enters into. I am particularly concerned with any \nagreement that may impact the well-being of the American public and the \necological balance of this Nation. The U.N.\n\n[[Page S8128]]\n\nFramework Convention on Climate Change has the potential to do both.\n  The United States is scheduled to join with leaders of 160 nations in \nKyoto, Japan in December of this year to conclude negotiations on a \nglobal climate change treaty. The Kyoto summit is the latest in a \nseries of meetings that have been held since this body ratified the \nU.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. At Kyoto, the \nUnited States and other countries hope to adopt a protocol or legal \ninstrument to deal with the threat of climate change in the post 2000 \nperiod.\n  It is my belief that the United States must take the leadership role \nin these negotiations, and steer the course to achieve an equitable, \nreasoned approach to global climate change mitigation, an approach that \nseeks inclusion of all countries and that offers a solution to the \nissue. While I believe the resolution before us will allow such an \napproach, I want to emphasize to the administration the essential \nnature of a negotiated framework to which all countries can accede.\n  Before I summarize my analysis of the need for global action, let me \nreview the facts. First, global climate change is real. If it were not, \n160 countries would not be meeting to address it. However, there are \nuncertainties about the effects of global climate change--uncertainties \nrelative to the timing, the magnitude, and regional patterns of climate \nchange. We must acknowledge these uncertainties, but acknowledge also \nthat they do not justify inaction.\n  As stated recently by Dr. William Nordhaus of Yale University: ``The \nresults (of studies) definitely reject inaction; uncertainty alone \ncannot justify waiting for the revealed truth to act, particularly when \nthe revealed truth, if it ever comes, is probably going to arrive at \nthe point where the effects are irreversible.''\n  Second, a leading indicator of climate change is increased emissions \nof global greenhouse gases. Concentrations of atmospheric carbon \ndioxide--the largest component of greenhouse gas emissions--are about \n26 percent higher now than they were 100 years ago. Also, globally \naveraged air temperatures at the Earth's surface have warmed by nearly \n1 degree Fahrenheit over the last 100 years.\n  Increased emissions of greenhouse gases are virtually entirely due to \nthe activities of man. As a general rule, a country's greenhouse gas \nemissions rise in concert with increased industrialization. It is no \nsurprise, then, that the United States is the greatest emitter of \ngreenhouse gases, both in terms of gross and per capita emissions. \nHowever, the emissions of some developing countries are rapidly \nescalating, and the emissions of some are expected to surpass that of \nthis country in the first quarter of the next century.\n  Which takes me back to my call for U.S. leadership. As the world's \nindustrial leader, the United States should take a clear lead in \nnegotiating a framework for all countries to participate in global \nclimate change abatement. A global approach, and global participation, \nis requisite to a successful outcome. This approach may require a new \nframework and a fresh look at timetables and current directions. My \nunderstanding of the data is that we have time to do this--we have time \nto assess where we are and how best to craft equitable policies. But \ninaction is not appropriate.\n  The resolution before us requires commitments of developing countries \nto mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the same timeframes as \ndeveloped countries. This may resonate as promoting a policy that \ndiscourages the participation of many developing countries. However, \nthe resolution will allow developing countries appropriate \nflexibilities in commitments to address global climate change \nabatement. The United States and other developed countries must accord \nnewly developed and developing countries flexibilities and incentives \nto participate, and these need not create economic disadvantages to the \nUnited States or any other developed country.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this point. Without all \ncountries on board, inaction becomes inevitable, because emission \nreductions achieved by one country will soon be offset by increased \nemissions from another.\n  An equitable approach that encourages commitments by all parties and \nthat offers incentives to developing countries is needed. Market-based \nsolutions to curb emissions will allow continued economic growth with \nminimal impacts. Developed countries are in a better position to \nimplement emissions-curbing activities and technologies at low cost and \nimpact, and to also transfer these abilities and technologies to \ndeveloping countries and to aid in their economic advancement in a way \nthat tempers emissions growth.\n  While measures to stabilize greenhouse gases at a certain level will \ninevitably lead to some energy price increases, an international \nemissions-trading scheme could substantially reduce the potential \ncosts. What is needed, however, is a policy to ensure that incremental \ncosts of reducing or stabilizing emissions are equalized across firms, \nacross sectors, and across countries. This can only occur if we take \ninto account the economies, emissions and abilities of countries to \nparticipate, and if we assign actions accordingly and in appropriate \ntimeframes.\n  Market mechanisms can reduce cost impacts of emissions reductions \nagreements. A preferable policy would be to set short- and long-term \ngoals to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions, and to set quantity limits \non emissions that are linked to prices. Targets and timetables for \nemission limitations cannot operate independently of market prices. An \ninternational tradeable emissions permits system, with price caps and \nfloors, would have revenue potential and would be cost-efficient.\n  Technology transfer and development is an important policy aspect for \nthe abatement of global climate change. The United States and other \ndeveloping countries have within our current capabilities technologies \nwhich can lead to dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. We \ncan increase the efficiencies of industry, of transportation, of many \nenergy-intensive activities, all with what we already know. By \nimplementing these capabilities and by transferring these technologies \nto developing countries we can curb emissions significantly. Continued \ntechnology development is also necessary.\n  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, we must continue to advance the \nscience related to these policies, and to allow policy changes as the \ndata warrant.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks by repeating that I, too, am \nconcerned about any agreements or policies that effect the well being \nof this country. However, I believe it is in our best interests and \nthat of the world community to approach global climate change in an \ninclusive, proactive manner that seeks continued economic growth. That \napproach demands action, and global coalition building, and it is \nincumbent upon the United States to steer that course.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Resolution 98. \nThe negotiations on limiting post-2000 emissions of greenhouse gas \nemissions, which are scheduled to conclude in December in Kyoto, Japan, \nwill have a significant impact on all Americans. This resolution \naddresses concerns that the administration has chosen to ignore while \npursuing an international agreement that will bind the United States \nfor decades to come.\n  Science should lead policy. Once again, the administration is \npursuing an environmental policy that is based on insufficient research \nand analysis. Many in the scientific community believe that we are \nstill years away from computer models that can confidently link global \nwarming to human activity. Yet without strong scientific data, the \nadministration is ready to commit the United States to binding actions \nthat will impose economic and social burdens on every American.\n  Recently, the Department of Energy released a report by the Argonne \nNational Laboratory containing several troubling findings on the \neffects of the proposed treaty on our economy. Among the conclusions, \nthe study found that without requiring developing countries to meet the \nsame emissions standards as the rest of the world, up to hundreds of \nthousands of U.S. jobs will move overseas to so-called developing \ncountries that have refused to participate in any new climate \nagreement. Higher energy prices will lead manufactures to produce less\n\n[[Page S8129]]\n\nat higher costs resulting in job loss, higher consumer prices and an \ninability to compete in a global marketplace. This will devastate our \nNation. Yet, the administration is pushing to commit the American \npeople to participate.\n  The developed countries should not shoulder the responsibility for \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions around the world. It seems obvious \nthat in the long-run increasing emissions in developing countries will \nfar outweigh any actions taken by the developed countries. Any binding \nactions by the United States must be accompanied by binding commitments \nfrom developing countries. I believe a majority of Americans would \nagree that devastating our Nation's economy by promoting industry \nflight overseas is not the answer to a global issue.\n  The public has a right to know how the administration's commitments \nrequiring them to reduce fossil fuel energy will be accomplished and \nhow their lives, jobs, and futures will be affected. I am greatly \ndisturbed that the administration has not sought, and therefore has not \nreceived, support from Congress or the American public on this matter.\n  Mr. President, the American people deserve an open, objective and \nhonest debate on the development of U.S. climate change policy. Without \nthat, I can not and I will not support committing the United States to \nlimiting post-2000 greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nResolution 98. I believe climate change is a serious problem that \nrequires credible action by the international community. Negotiations \non an international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions will \nconclude this December in Kyoto, Japan. This is an essential step in \nthe long-term, global efforts to deal with climate change. While I \nsupport Senate resolution's call for increased involvement of \ndeveloping countries in the Kyoto agreement, the resolution does not \ntake into account other key components of the treaty that are essential \nto its success, particularly for the United States' business community.\n  The scientific basis for moving forward with an international \nagreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions is compelling and \nsignificant. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange--a group of 2,500 expert scientists representing more than 50 \ncountries, the ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from human \nactivities are changing the global climate. Given the potential impacts \nof climate change predicted by the IPCC--more droughts, more floods, \nsea level rise, water scarcity, and increased incidence of infectious \ndiseases--it is not surprising that nations of the world agreed to find \nmore effective ways to understand and deal with the problem. If we \ndon't agree to long-term greenhouse gas limits soon, and instead wait \nto see how our climate changes, it may be too late. Greenhouse gases \nremain in the atmosphere for decades to centuries, and there is a long \nlag time between when gases are emitted and when the climate \nconsequences of those emissions appear. So we need to begin reductions \nsoon to have any long-term effect. And, a new generation of energy-\nefficient technologies requires a long lead time for development and \nimplementation. This won't happen without clear signals to the market \nthat an international agreement on climate change would provide.\n  Senate Resolution 98 focuses on the role of developing countries in \nthe Kyoto agreement. The principles expressed in the resolution \nregarding developing countries are on target. Climate change cannot be \nsolved by the developed countries alone--we are indeed all in the same \nboat.\n  New commitments by developing countries regarding their performance \nunder the Framework Convention on Climate Change, of course, need to be \nconsistent with their historic responsibility for the problem, as well \nas their current capabilities. The ground rules for the negotiations--\nthe Berlin mandate--recognize these common, but differentiated \nresponsibilities.\n  It is clear that the Berlin mandate can be carried out in a way that \nis consistent with Senate Resolution 98. The resolution says that \ndeveloping countries can start with a commitment that is lower relative \nto the industrialized countries at first. Over time, however, the \ncommitments of developing and developed countries must become \ncomparable to ensure that every country does its fair share to address \nthe problem.\n  Senate Resolution 98 states that developing countries have to start \nmaking quantified emissions reductions objectives within the same \ncompliance period as developed countries. This means that at a stage to \nbe negotiated over the compliance period of the Kyoto agreement, \ndeveloping countries must begin to make quantified emissions reductions \nobjectives. Senate Resolution 98 says that it is entirely appropriate \nfor industrialized countries to start making quantified emissions \nreductions first, as long as developing countries also commit to making \nquantified emissions reductions before the end of the time period \nworked out for the Kyoto agreement. I agree with this basic approach--\nthe sooner developing countries take on quantified emissions reductions \ntargets, the sooner we can achieve a global solution to the climate \nproblem.\n  At the same time, I am concerned that the resolution does not take \ninto account other key components of the treaty that are essential to \nprotect U.S. competitiveness. I am concerned that elevating one issue \nto a level of importance that will overshadow other key matters may \nharm the United States' efforts to ensure that the climate agreement is \nrealistic, achievable, and will not harm the U.S. economy. For example, \nthe need for flexibility in implementing a treaty is critical to \nprotect U.S. competitiveness. Some countries, such as members of the \nEuropean Union, would prefer highly prescriptive policies and measures \nto meet reduction targets. The United States' negotiating team has made \nflexibility an absolute prerequisite for any agreement, and I want to \ncommend them for this approach. I believe that, to be acceptable, our \nbusinesses must have the most flexibility possible to find the least-\ncost ways to reduce emissions. This means the agreement must contain \nprovisions that are so important to our business community: emissions \ntrading, joint implementation between nations, and appropriate credits \nfor those countries that have already made certain emissions \nreductions. Senate Resolution 98 is silent regarding these provisions.\n  As we grapple with the human judgments and values that inevitably \nwill determine how we handle climate change, we must base our actions \non the facts--the scientific evidence of climate change, the physical \neffects that are likely to result from it, and the ways we can credibly \naddress this problem on a global basis. While Senate Resolution 98 is \nonly part of a bigger picture that needs to be addressed, it is a step \ntoward adressing this global issue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Byrd-Hagel resolution regarding global climate change. I was an \noriginal cosponsor of this bipartisan resolution, and I believe it \nsends an important, commonsense message that we cannot enter into a \ntreaty that requires the United States to limit its emissions of \ngreenhouse gases without requiring developing countries to also agree \nto limitations on their emissions. Such a proposal would not make \nenvironmental sense and it certainly would not make sense for our \nNation's economy.\n  This resolution is very simple. It says that a treaty will not be \nratified by the U.S. Senate if it does not include both developed and \ndeveloping countries in binding timetables and emission limitations. It \nseems to me that the only way the world will be able to stabilize the \nconcentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is if every nation \nparticipates in a meaningful way in limiting its emissions. The \nresolution does not say that all countries must make identical emission \nreductions; only that they must be participants in limiting greenhouse \ngas emissions in the same timeframe as the developed world.\n  Mr. President, I fear that a treaty that requires us to place \nsignificant restrictions on our economy will only lead to a flight of \njobs and capital from this country to nations that do not face \ngreenhouse gas emissions limitations. That could be a potential \ndisaster for our Nation's economy, for its\n\n[[Page S8130]]\n\nworkers, and for our long-term economic stability and growth. So the \nByrd resolution also requires the administration to develop a detailed \nanalysis of the potential financial costs and other impacts on our \neconomy. That is not an unreasonable request. We would clearly need to \nknow the potential consequences of any treaty on our Nation's economy \nbefore the Senate could be asked to ratify such a treaty.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Senate has a constitutional duty to advise \nand consent on treaties negotiated by the administration with other \nnations. This is a responsibility I take very seriously, and I know \nevery other Member of this body considers it one of our most important \nduties. I hope the administration will listen carefully to the debate \non this resolution, and pay close attention to the guidance provided in \nthe Byrd-Hagel resolution as it negotiates with other nations in \npreparation for a final meeting in December in Kyoto, Japan.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, does Senator Kerry wish to go forward? Is \nhe prepared?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, might I inquire? How much time remains on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-five minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much for the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to ask if I might be \nable to enter into a colloquy with the Senator from West Virginia at \nthis time.\n  Mr. HAGEL. May I ask? Point of inquiry. Is this on the time of the \nSenator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is on my time.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to ask the views of the \nSenator from West Virginia on the proposal by the Europeans to erect \nthe so-called European bubble, and its effect on U.S. competitiveness.\n  It appears to me that this proposal is driven more by economic \nconsiderations than concern for limiting carbon dioxide emissions.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield to the Senator for his views on that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator has asked this \nquestion. Earlier he had indicated that we had agreed on certain \nthings. We agreed on one thing: that we would enter into a colloquy. \nAnd I always reserve the right to express my own views on matters, and \nnot necessarily agree to the expressions of others as to how they think \nand what they think I say.\n  May I say that I am only expressing a personal viewpoint here. The \nSenator said earlier that there were Senators in this body who signed \nonto the resolution who want to kill the treaty. That may be so. This \nSenator is not one of those. I am not out to kill the treaty.\n  But what I was out to say--and the reason I got behind this effort--\nwas to send a message to the administration that if the Senate is not \nincluded in the takeoff, if the Senate is not included at the \nbeginning, if the Senate is intended to be shut out of doing its \nconstitutional responsibility of advising as well as consenting in \nmaking a treaty, then count me out.\n  If you want to really kill this treaty, abide by the Berlin Mandate \nand let the developing countries off the hook until some future time. \nThat is what will surely kill the treaty, and I will join in stabbing \nit in the heart, if that is the case. If that treaty comes back here \nand the developing countries are left off the hook, count me in on the \nassassination of the treaty. It will be done in public view. It won't \nbe behind a bush.\n  Mr. President, the Senator raised an important point. The Europeans \nhave erected what they call a bubble, which is simply a mechanism for \nthem to trade off emissions levels from one country to another so long \nas they honor overall an average which conforms to the treaty-imposed \ncap on developed country emissions. This is viewed by some, including \nme, as a technique to maximize the economic competitiveness of European \ncountries by keeping emissions reductions to a minimum as a result of \nthe trades that would be available under the bubble from one country to \nanother within the European Union.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just also say to the Senator that I \nagree completely with his notion, as I said earlier, of the importance \nof our advising here about the importance of other countries being part \nof the solution.\n  But I ask if the Senator would agree that the United States is placed \nat a disadvantage by this concept of the European bubble, and that the \ninclusion of free-market mechanisms in a treaty--particularly emissions \ntrading schemes and so-called joint implementation--could be used to \ncounter that challenge.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe that if the United States is going to enter into \nbinding commitments to limit or reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we \nneed to remain competitive vis-a-vis the Europeans, and everybody else, \nfor that matter. Therefore, an emissions trading mechanism whereby we \ncan exchange our higher level emissions by buying emissions credits \nfrom, let us say, Russia or other nations with lower emissions, is an \nexample of one potential tool that the U.S. negotiators might explore \nin the climate change negotiations.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator agree further that an \nemissions trading scheme also has the beneficial effect of easing the \neconomic cost that might be incurred by U.S. industry as a result of a \nregime of binding commitments entered into at Kyoto?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I personally \nbelieve that it could have such an effect. There are a number of other \ntools that are under development, and these, in my judgment, should be \nfurther explored for inclusion in the proposed treaty in order that our \nown economic growth not be penalized by the treaty. These tools include \njoint implementation involving partnerships among industries in the \ndeveloped and developing countries. There are, as well, many areas \nwhere other U.S. programs and initiatives could be enhanced to further \nthe same objectives, such as cooperative technology ventures and \nenhanced research and development of both fossil fuel development \ntechnologies and alternate fuel technologies. These tools and programs \nmay also have an advantage in encouraging the developing world to make \nmeaningful binding commitments. So they should be explored as a natural \ncompanion to provisions establishing binding commitments.\n\n  The purpose would be to level the competitive playing field so that \nthe United States is not placed at a disadvantage and to help insure \nthat all the world's economies will share the responsibilities to \ntackle the global warming problem.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nhis explanation and his views.\n  I believe that the administration must pursue the development of \nthese tools and initiatives and their inclusion in any binding treaty \nthat is arrived at in order to reduce any negative impact of higher \nenergy prices on our economy. And I believe this would certainly \nenhance the prospects of Senate approval of any treaty that is arrived \nat.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will again \nyield, in general, I personally agree with this overall proposition, \nalthough I would note the administration has not yet settled on its \nspecific policies regarding the negotiations, and it leads to further \nwork on developing and explaining the workings of these market \nmechanisms so that they will be more fully understood.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nthose views and for entering into this colloquy with me.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the issue of the extent to which human-\ninduced global climate change is occurring, and the proper societal \nresponse\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\nto this change, is one of the most difficult public policy issues \nfacing us today.\n  We are emitting into the atmosphere an unprecedented amount of the \ngases that we know trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, and thus result \nin what is known as the greenhouse effect. At the same time, the \nconnection between this artificial elevation of greenhouse gas levels \nand changes to the world's climate is only slowly coming into view. The \nglobal climate system is extremely complex, and we are still making \nmajor scientific discoveries about the components of that system. The \nconsensus of the world's climate scientists on the human contribution \nto global climate change has recognized both these uncertainties and \nthe growing evidence that there is a human fingerprint on climate \nchange. The key conclusion of the most recent consensus report of the \nglobal change scientific community is as follows:\n\n       Our ability to quantify the human influence on global \n     climate is currently limited because the expected signal is \n     still emerging from the noise of natural [climate] \n     variability, and because there are uncertainties in key \n     factors. These include the magnitude and patterns of long \n     term natural variability and the time-evolving pattern of \n     forcing by, and response to, changes in concentrations of \n     greenhouse gases and aerosols, and land surface changes. \n     Nevertheless, the balance of evidence suggests that there is \n     a discernible human influence on global climate.\n\n  The current state of uncertainty should not be a cause for comfort. \nThere is a substantial lag in global climate response, so even if we \nwere to magically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to zero tomorrow, \nthe world's climate would still be responding, over the next few \ndecades, to past emissions. It is also clear that the global climate \nsystem is not a well-behaved linear system, like traveling on a \nstraight road over a gentle predictable hill. It is more like a wild \nmountainous road, full of unexpected curves and cliffs. In such a \nsituation, ignorance of what might lie ahead is not bliss, and it is \nprudent to slow down until you have a better appreciation of what you \nare dealing with.\n  For this reason, we are engaged in international negotiations to \ndiscuss how the world might arrive at a joint international plan for \nslowing down the emissions of the principal greenhouse gas, carbon \ndioxide, into the atmosphere. Because of the central role that burning \ncarbon plays in our energy, transportation, and economic systems, it is \nimportant that such discussions focus on sophisticated, as opposed to \nsimple-minded, approaches to the problem.\n  I believe that the Clinton administration deserves credit for having \nput forth, in the current negotiation, what is easily the most complete \nand sophisticated proposal of any that has been advanced to date.\n\n  The administration's proposal rejects the command-and-control \napproaches put forward by many of the other parties.\n  The administration's proposal, instead, relies on market-based \nmechanisms for controlling the rate of future emissions of greenhouse \ngases, extending our successful experience to date in this country with \nsuch mechanisms for controlling emissions of sulfur dioxide.\n  The administration's proposal allows for maximum flexibility on the \npart of each participating country in designing and implementing \ngreenhouses gas control measures that make economic sense for that \ncountry.\n  The administration's proposal encourages the development and use of \nadvanced technologies.\n  These approaches--market-based mechanisms, individual flexibility, \nand more reliance on advanced technologies in place of command and \ncontrol--are precisely the approaches that so many of my colleagues \nsaid should be at the basis of all regulatory policy, during \nconsideration of the Dole-Johnston regulatory reform bill in the last \nCongress. It is commendable that the administration has made these \napproaches the foundation for its negotiating position.\n  The central issue for us today is the role that the United States and \nother developed countries will play in any effort to control greenhouse \ngas emissions, compared to the role that developing countries will \nplay. Here, too, the administration has shown considerable \nsophistication, compared to other parties in the negotiations. All \ndeveloping countries are not alike--there is a world of difference \nbetween South Korea and Gambia, despite the fact that both are non-\nannex-I countries. The world should expect more from South Korea, which \naspires to join the OECD in the near future, than it should from \nGambia. But there should also be a minimum level of expectations \nmandated by the upcoming agreement, even for countries like Gambia.\n  I believe that a careful examination of the proposal put forward by \nthe administration shows that it is trying to make these principles \npart of the protocol. We should go on record, in this resolution, in \nsupport of such principles. But we need to do so in a careful and \nsophisticated way, befitting the complexities of the problem of human-\ninduced global climate change, and the international policy response to \nit.\n  I did not cosponsor the resolution that is now before us because of \nmy concerns about how it expressed the relationship between what the \nUnited States should do and what the developing countries should do. It \nused the words ``new commitments'' for both developed and developing \ncountries in a way that suggested to me, at least, that the intent of \nthe resolution was that the United States should not agree to any \ncommitment that was not also going to be agreed to and implemented \nsimultaneously by the world's poorest countries. That would seem to be \na rather simplistic approach. We shouldn't ignore legitimate \ndifferences between countries at vastly different stages of \ndevelopment.\n  I was greatly encouraged by the remarks on this issue made by the \nsponsor of this resolution, the senior Senator from West Virginia, when \nhe testified before the Committee on Foreign Relations. At that time, \nhe stated that countries at different levels of development should make \nunique and binding commitments of a pace and kind consistent with their \nindustrialization, and that the schedule for these commitments should \nbe aggressive and effective, but also consistent with a fair sharing of \nany burden. These are principles that I support, and the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia and I have entered into a colloquy that seeks to \nestablish that the explanation of the resolution on this point that he \nprovided in his testimony is, in fact, the normative one for the \nadministration to heed, once we pass the resolution. With this \nclarification, I believe that I can support the resolution now before \nus, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I would like to engage in a colloquy with the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia regarding the correct interpretation of the language of \nthe resolution on one particular point of importance. The resolution \nrefers to ``new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfor the Annex I Parties'' as well as to ``new specified scheduled \ncommitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing \nCountry Parties.'' Would it be correct to interpret the use of the \nwords ``new commitments'' in both phrases as suggesting that the United \nStates should not be a signatory to any protocol unless Annex I Parties \nand Developing Country Parties agree to identical commitments?\n  Mr. BYRD. That would not be a correct interpretation of the \nresolution. In my testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations \non June 19, I made the following statement and deliberately repeated it \nfor emphasis: ``Finally, while countries have different levels of \ndevelopment, each must make unique and binding commitments of a pace \nand kind consistent with their industrialization.'' I believe that the \ndeveloping world must agree in Kyoto to binding targets and commitments \nthat would begin at the same time as the developed world in as \naggressive and effective a schedule as possible given the gravity of \nthe problem and the need for a fair sharing of the burden. That is what \nthe resolution means. The resolution should not be interpreted as a \ncall for identical commitments between Annex I Parties and Developing \nCountry Parties.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator. I agree with him that a fair \nsharing of responsibility for actions to address global climate change \nis crucial to any agreement, and that such commitments should reflect \nthe pace and type of industrialization that those countries have \nachieved.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, earlier this week I met with Senator Byrd \nto discuss S. Res. 98, which, of course, deals with climate change. In \nthis measure, the Senator has identified one of the more important \nfeatures required to address this global problem, namely, global \nparticipation.\n  Gradually, many have come to the conclusion that man is indeed \ncontributing to changes in the global climate. Human activities--\nparticularly the burning of fossil fuels--have increased atmospheric \nconcentrations of carbon dioxide and other trace greenhouse gases. \nThese gases, combined with the natural levels of CO2 and \nwater vapor, act like panes of a greenhouse and retain the Sun's heat \naround the earth.\n  The burning of fossil fuels has continued to grow, at least in ever \ngreater amounts of CO2. Global carbon emissions from fossil \nfuels reached a record of just over 6 billion tons in 1995.\n  The Earth's climate has remained stable for the past 10,000 years. \nBut, as Ambassador Paul Nitze said in the Washington Post earlier this \nmonth, ``Global warming threatens the stability that fostered modern \ncivilization.''\n  What is being done about this threat? Of the 35 industrial countries \nthat committed themselves under the 1992 Framework Convention on \nClimate Change in Rio, they agreed there to hold their greenhouse gas \nemissions to 1990 levels in the year 2000. In other words, by the year \n2000 we would get the levels down to what they were in 1990.\n  But, regrettably, Mr. President, only a handful of the countries are \nexpected to meet that target. The United States will miss its target by \nan estimated 13 percent. In some developing countries, emissions are on \na course to nearly double between 1990 and 2000.\n  The failure by many industrialized countries to meet these voluntary \naims is what is leading us to this debate today. This debate is over \nthe imposition of legally binding greenhouse gas emissions reductions. \nIn other words, should we enter something that is binding?\n  Because of the link between greenhouse gases and activities \nfundamental to industrialized and developing economies, many \nanticipate, or at least fear, that the costs of limiting their \nemissions will be high.\n  Unlike most other ambient air and water pollution problems, there is \nno pollution control technology for CO2. In many of the \nemissions problems we have dealt with in the past, technology can \nreduce the amount of emissions. But we don't have that for \nCO2. You either make CO2 or you don't.\n  Some have argued that the United States and, indeed the entire world, \nshould wait to address the looming threat of climate change. In other \nwords, don't do anything. Let's wait awhile. The scientists are divided \non this. How much has the temperature gone up? Has it indeed risen in \nthe last 100 years by 1 degree Fahrenheit? There are arguments over \nthat. ``Time is on our side,'' some say, believing that if we simply \nwait long enough, new and inexpensive technologies will come along to \nmake this solution painless.\n  But the citizens of my State, for example, have concerns. We are a \nsea-bordering State. There are possibilities of rises in the sea level \nwhich would affect us dramatically. Indeed, they would affect all but \none major city in our country because all but one major city in our \ncountry occupies tidal shorelines. I know that if the Atlantic Ocean \nbegins to warm and expands as it warms, rising sea levels will be with \nus for centuries.\n  I am also concerned about the economic consequences of actions to \naddress global warming. Senator Byrd has addressed these, and I salute \nhim for that. He is concerned about the issue of U.S. competitiveness \nin relation to developing countries. And I join with him in urging our \nnegotiators to recognize that we are serious about the concerns Senator \nByrd is expressing.\n  The position taken by the European Union is a major concern. As \nrepresentatives of the Global Climate Coalition indicated to the \nForeign Relations Committee last month, the prospect of European Union \nbubble, which was just addressed here, with no ability for the United \nStates to address similar alliances with other nations, would permit \nthe European Union to steal a competitive march on the United States.\n  This concerns me. In trade terms, our bilateral trade with the \nEuropean Union, of course, is mammoth certainly when compared to the \ntrade that we have with China. Last year we had $128 billion in exports \nto the European Union, more than 10 times of that going to China.\n  I believe our negotiators in Kyoto would fail us if they did not \nbring home an agreement with developing country commitments as \ndescribed in the resolution and with the market-based tools of joint \nimplementation emissions trading and emissions banking.\n  I want to say that many countries in the U.S. are already taking \nsteps to address these problems. Farsighted companies like Tucson \nElectric are going ahead with a pilot joint implementation project in \ncooperation with the city of Sava in Honduras to display diesel-fired \npower generation with biomass fuels. Companies like American Electric \nPower, which is the largest electric utility in West Virginia, and \nBritish Petroleum are getting together with the Nature Conservancy and \nthe Government of Bolivia to offset some of American Electric Power's \ncoal-fired plant emissions by expanding parks and sustainable forests \nin Bolivia.\n\n  The Southern Co. has joined forces with State forestry commissions in \nplanting 20 million trees in Georgia, Alabama, and the Florida \nPanhandle. These projects boost environmental protection while lowering \ncosts. But on their own, the voluntary projects will not be sufficient \nto address the potential problem. We need legally binding measures to \nspur technological innovation that will be needed to solve the \ngreenhouse problem.\n  The resolution makes clear that an exemption for developing countries \nwould be inconsistent with the need for global action.\n  In light of the seriousness of the issue, Mr. President, I welcome \nthe concern that Senator Byrd and others have shown for the twin goals \nof environmental protection and economic competitiveness.\n  Mr. President, I had a brief colloquy I was going to enter into with \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia. It is as follows:\n  Senate Resolution 98 includes two important conditions for U.S. \nagreements to any future treaty to limit greenhouse gases.\n  Quoting directly from the text of the resolution--that is, Senator \nByrd's resolution:\n\n       The United States should not be a signatory to any protocol \n     to, or other agreement regarding, the U.N. Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change of 1992, at negotiations in \n     Kyoto in December 1997, or thereafter, which would--(A) \n     mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions from the Annex I Parties, unless the protocol or \n     other agreement also mandates new specific scheduled \n     commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for \n     Developing Country Parties within the same compliance period, \n     or (B) would result in serious harm to the economy of the \n     United States.\n\n  Without losing my right to the floor, I wish to ask the primary \nsponsor of the resolution a couple of questions.\n  I am curious as to whether the Senator from West Virginia intends for \nhis resolution to speak to the scientific understanding of global \nclimate change.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield with \nthe understanding that the time----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. On my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I use will not be charged against Mr. Hagel.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, again, may I say that this resolution has \nbeen introduced and developed every step along the way with concurrence \nbetween Mr. Hagel and myself. It just so happens that my name is at the \nbeginning of what is called the Byrd-Hagel resolution. I have no \nproblem if it is called the Hagel-Byrd resolution; we are both in this \nresolution. We both believe the words of the resolution, and we both \nbelieve that the resolution speaks for itself. And we also understand \nwe may have different views as to specific questions. I respect the \nviews of every Senator. So I will attempt to respond to the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island. I thank him for his statement \nwhich indicates that he is concerned, has studied the matter, and is a \nreasonable man.\n  I thank Mr. Chafee for this opportunity to discuss in greater detail \nthe\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\nresolution that Mr. Hagel and I and others of our colleagues have \nbrought to the Senate. In response to the Senator's question, I will \nrepeat a portion of the testimony I delivered on June 19 of this year \nbefore the Committee on Foreign Relations. There I stated that the \nresolution accepts the thesis, which is still the subject of some \ndispute, that the increasing release of carbon dioxide--\nCO2--and its accumulation in our atmosphere are causing a \nvery gradual heating of the globe which has many adverse consequences \nfor us all and I am, indeed, convinced that climate change is a looming \nthreat to the global environment. That is a statement I made at that \ntime.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I appreciate the Senator's fundamental candor on this \npoint and agree with his assessment.\n  With regard to specific provisions contained in the resolution, I am \ninterested in what the Senator intends--and I might say Senator Hagel \nhas been active in all of this. He is the chief cosponsor of the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Will the Senator suspend. The \ntime allotted, the 10 minutes allotted to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could I have 2 more minutes?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Senator Hagel has been active in all of this, and we have \ndealt with his folks, and wherever I refer to the Byrd resolution, I \nreally should have referred to the Byrd-Hagel resolution and will \nattempt to make that change in the transcript.\n  With regard to specific provisions contained in the resolution, I am \ninterested in what the Senators intend on page 4, lines 9 through 11 by \nthe phrase ``new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions for developing country parties.''\n  Is it the Senators' intentions that the developing country parties, \nirrespective of the national incomes and greenhouse gas emission rates, \nbe mandated to the very same commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions for the annex 1 parties?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, no, that is not \nmy intention. That is not what the resolution says. I have stated \npreviously that under this resolution the developing world must fully \nparticipate in the treaty negotiations and commitments and must play a \nmeaningful role in effectively addressing the problem of global climate \nchange. Such participation by the developing country parties could, in \nmy judgment, come in a number of forms. As I stated before the Foreign \nRelations Committee, while individual countries have different levels \nof development, the resolution holds that each country must make unique \nand binding contributions of a pace and kind consistent with their \nindustrialization. The developing world must agree in Kyoto to adopt \nsome manner of binding targets and commitments which would begin during \nthe same compliance period as the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe the 2 minutes allotted \nto the Senator from Rhode Island have expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield an additional minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. The developing world must agree in Kyoto to adopt some \nmanner of binding targets and commitments that would begin during the \nsame compliance period as the developed world in as aggressive and \neffective a schedule as possible, given the gravity of the problem and \nthe need for a fair sharing of the burden.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Because greenhouse gas emissions from the developing \nworld will, on a cumulative basis, exceed those of the developed world \nsometime during the first quarter of the next century, the Senator's \nposition appears quite sound on both environmental and economic \ngrounds, and I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator \nInhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. There is objection.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee, \nwe have had about 40 hours of hearings on this subject, on global \nwarming as well as ambient air quality standard changes that have been \nproposed by this administration. I think it is unrealistic to try to \ncondense that into 2 minutes. There is not any way it can be done.\n  I will just say, Mr. President, that as 1 of the 66 cosponsors of \nthis resolution, I support it, although I would say also it doesn't go \nfar enough. And I would also say that regardless of what happens--this \nis going to pass, but regardless of that, I am still going to oppose \nthe ratification of this treaty. I am going to do so for two reasons. \nFirst, is that the science is not there. This is analogous to the \nproposal by the administration to lower the ambient air standards in \nboth particulate matter and in ozone, unrealistically costing the \nAmerican people billions and billions of dollars a year without any \nscience to back it up.\n  Mr. President, I am going to read real quickly and enter the entire \nstatement in the Record, but before my committee, Dr. John Christy of \nthe Department of Atmospheric Science and Earth System Science \nLaboratory, University of Alabama, Huntsville, said--I don't think \nthere is anyone who is considered to be a greater authority than he \nis--\n\n       The satellite data show that catastrophic warming is not \n     now occurring. The detection of human effects on climate has \n     not been convincingly proven because the variations we have \n     observed are not outside of the natural variations of the \n     climate system.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Could I have 1 more minute?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield 1 minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The second reason is the administration has not been \nhonest on this, as well as the ambient air, when they come along and \nthey say, as Mary Nichols, Deputy Secretary, said yesterday, that the \ncost to the American people for the changes in the ambient air would be \n$9.1 billion when the President's own Council of Economic Advisers puts \nthe price tag at something over $60 billion and the Reason Foundation \nout in California has it somewhere between $90 and $150 billion.\n  So anyway, Mr. President, it is not realistic to do this. I would \nalso observe I can't imagine that anyone who would be opposed to the \nratification of this treaty wouldn't also be opposed to the changes in \nthe ambient air standards. We will be introducing legislation next \nweek. It will be bipartisan. Senator Breaux and I will be introducing \nlegislation to reject these changes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Wyoming, Senator \nEnzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution offered by \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia and the junior Senator from \nNebraska, of which I am a cosponsor, and which concerns the issue of \nglobal warming in general and the impending related treaty \nspecifically.\n  Mr. President, many of us are not surprised by the content of this \nproposed treaty. We saw the 1992 Framework Convention on Global Climate \nChange for what it was: The nose of the camel. And now, 5 years later \nand just as expected, we find ourselves face to face with the whole \ncritter. He's in the tent, he's huge, and he's very frightening.\n  The agreement signed in Brazil 5 years ago was voluntary. It called \nfor the economically developed nations to undertake voluntary actions \nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990\n\n[[Page S8134]]\n\nlevels by the year 2000. Now the administration wants a legally binding \nagreement that will require a handful of developed countries to reach \n1990 levels of fossil fuels emissions by the year 2010. But here is the \namazing part, Mr. President: Though the United States and several other \ndeveloped countries will be subject to the new enforcement regime, the \nrest of the world will not. Utterly amazing. Where in the world did \nthis administration learn to negotiate? I see a lot of give, but I am \nstill looking for the take.\n  So we really believe we can place shackles on our economy, leave the \neconomies of our trade competitors unaffected, and not lose countless \njobs and industries overseas? It has been all we can do to stop the \nloss of jobs overseas under the best conditions. Every developing \nnation has cheaper labor costs than we do. Every developing nation has \nfewer environmental regulations than we do. Every developing nation has \nfewer worker protection expenses than we do. These nations are \nunderstandably concerned, first and foremost, with elevating the living \nconditions of their own people. Their leaders would be derelict if they \nweren't. Does anyone seriously believe they will not take advantage of \nthe new regime at the expense of our workers? Is a little fairness too \nmuch to ask? Does the administration find the concept of simple equity \nso unreasonable?\n  The AFL-CIO is apoplectic at the prospect of this ill-advised treaty, \nand with good reason. They understand how many American jobs it will \nkill. As a representative from the largest coal producing State in the \nNation, I know only too well just what it means for the people of my \nState. This resolution simply calls for all nations to share the burden \nin the effort to avoid an environmental problem, which, I might add, is \nsupported by a scientific consensus that is generously referred to as \nunsettled.\n  This resolution, if adopted, would be a treaty enhancer, not a treaty \nkiller. For this reason, if no other, the administration should embrace \nit. In its current form the treaty will most certainly not survive this \nbody. We want a good treaty. We are not opposed to a global \nantipollution effort. But we want a fair treaty. You just cannot have \nthe former without the latter. We need to bring developing countries on \nboard in a responsible fashion. And if the Byrd-Hagel resolution is not \nadopted the administration will have missed a valuable opportunity to \ndo so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to begin today by thanking the Senator from West \nVirginia for his leadership on this issue as well as the Senator from \nNebraska. Citizens in my State are extraordinarily concerned about the \npotential treaty that has been in the media very much lately.\n  The people of Michigan care greatly about their environment and the \nramifications of various emissions that are released into it. At the \nsame time, I believe people of Michigan want agreements negotiated \noverseas and adopted in Washington to be based upon sound science and \nhard facts.\n  They also want those agreements to be ones that require all nations \nto work toward a common objective rather than singling out developed \nnations for all the pain while allowing developing nations to gain \ncompetitive advantages by continuing practices that might contribute to \nan international problem.\n  Mr. President, the people of Michigan are proud of their State, its \nnatural resources, and the industry with which they have made \nMichigan's economy among the best in the Nation. They want to keep \ntheir jobs, to raise their families, and see their children grow and \nenjoy the opportunities our State provides.\n  By all accounts, Mr. President, Michigan would suffer \ndisproportionately should a treaty go into effect that does not fairly \nbind all countries. Whether it is the business community, the \nagriculture community or organized labor, I have heard concerns from \nthem all, Mr. President.\n  Therefore, I commend the Senators who have introduced this \nresolution. I am happy to be a cosponsor. I look forward to supporting \nit and seeing it passed today so that we might, as a country, work in a \nconstructive way toward resolving these issues while avoiding a path \nthat is detrimental to America and the interests of the hard-working \nmen and women of my State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield 2 minutes of my time to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Byrd-\nHagel resolution expressing the sense of the Senate on international \nagreements covering greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I wish to thank and commend my colleagues, Senator Byrd and Senator \nHagel, for their efforts in forging this bipartisan, common sense \nresolution. I was proud to join them as an original cosponsor.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which I chair, has had \nsignificant interest and long involvement in the issue of greenhouse \ngas emissions and climate change because any attempt to address carbon \nemissions fundamentally affects energy investment, use, and policy.\n  Our committee has held a variety of hearings, seminars, and briefings \non this subject for the benefit of members, staff, and the public.\n  Moreover, we have remained closely attuned to the negotiations toward \na new climate treaty through close and regular contact with the \nprincipal State Department and Department of Energy officials.\n  My predecessor as chairman, Senator Bennett Johnston, also had a keen \ninterest in this subject, and made it a centerpiece of the committee's \noversight responsibilities.\n  So this is not a new issue to us.\n  Having said that, I believe Senators Byrd and Hagel have done a \nsuperb job with this resolution expressing the Senate's aspirations and \nconcerns with respect to any eventual climate treaty.\n  This resolution will strengthen the hand of our negotiators during \nupcoming meetings in August, October, and December.\n  Although this is not a binding resolution, it conveys the legitimate \nconcerns of the Senate to other parties in the negotiations.\n  Our negotiators can use this resolution to inform other nations of \nthe elements that must be contained in any new climate treaty that can \nbe ratified by this body.\n  Turning now to the substance of the resolution, I have a letter from \nPresident Clinton, dated August 21, 1996, that contains a statement I \nvery much agree with. And I quote:\n\n       Establishing a sound framework is a critical first step in \n     the negotiating process. We are already conducting additional \n     analyses and technical assessments . . . our ultimate \n     position will fully reflect economic considerations and our \n     commitment to the principle that environmental protection and \n     economic prosperity go hand-in-hand.\n\n  The President is right. Economic considerations are important. We \nmust not proceed down a path that will bring adverse economic \nconsequences, competitive disadvantages, and energy price increases.\n  The importance of economic considerations, as expressed by the \nPresident in his letter, are very much in line with this resolution.\n  This resolution simply says that any new climate treaty must not \nresult in serious economic harm to the United States.\n  The Byrd-Hagel resolution also states that any new climate treaty \nmust be global in its approach:\n  New commitments on the part of developed countries to limit or reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions must be accompanied by new commitments on the \npart of developing countries to do the same.\n  The issue of developing countries and their participation is \ncritically important:\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the \nDepartment of Energy, carbon emissions from China will exceed ours by \nthe year 2015. Their greenhouse gas emissions are expected to grow 185 \npercent above 1990 levels.\n  Emissions from developing nations as a whole will also exceed those \nfrom industrialized nations by 2015.\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\n  Clearly, this is a global issue that requires a global approach. If \nfurther science confirms the fact that carbon emission do indeed have \ndangerous implications for the climate, then all nations must take \nmeaningful steps.\n  The industrial nations simply do not have it in their power to do it \nalone, even if they wanted to.\n  But here is some good news: We have time to approach this issue in a \ncareful, deliberative manner.\n  We gain nothing by getting ahead of the science. Indeed, we risk a \ngreat deal by moving too quickly:\n  According to economic analysis by the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum, \nan orderly, long-term strategy of achieving a scientifically-justified \ncarbon emission reduction costs just one-fifth what it would cost to \nachieve the same reduction over the near-term.\n  In other words, you can get the same result 80 percent cheaper by \ntaking a long-term view, and allowing capital equipment to be retired \nin an orderly fashion as new energy efficient technologies come on \nline.\n  Mr. President, there is simply no need to compel working American \nfamilies to pay five times as much as they need to for the same \neventual outcome.\n  Clearly, there is not a need for extreme actions such as carbon \ntaxes, strict command and control regulations, and one-sided treaties \nthat will impose economic harm.\n  Let's take the time to do the job right and enjoy tremendous economic \nsavings.\n  Turning to the broader issue of climate change and climate science, \nlet me say we should all be concerned about increasing concentrations \nof carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.\n  It is an indisputable scientific fact that concentrations of \ngreenhouse gasses are on the rise.\n  Yet significant scientific uncertainties remain.\n  Some scientists believe that higher carbon dioxide concentrations \nwill bring only moderate change, warmer winters, reduced energy \ndemands, and longer growing seasons.\n  Virtually every climate scientist will tell you that the warming \nsignal suggested by some data sets are all within the bounds of natural \nvariability, and that climate change is the rule rather than the \nexception. Throughout the planet's history, the climate has changed.\n  I will confess to my own personal fascination with the Greenland ice \ncore records that I first became familiar with when the University of \nAlaska removed an ice core record spanning the entire depth of the \nGreenland ice cap.\n  These ice cores are high-resolution records of climate which can be \nanalyzed like the rings of a tree--only these records go back 100,000 \nyears or more.\n  The Greenland ice core record tells us that the earth's climate has \nalways changed and shifted, often dramatically and over surprisingly \nshort periods of time.\n  Thus, the investments we've made in the U.S. Global Climate Change \nResearch Program, approaching $2 billion per year and more, are \nexpensive but worthwhile. Because there is much more scientific work to \ndo.\n  The common refrain that I hear from climate scientists, virtually \nwithout exception, is this:\n  The climate system is remarkably complex, and exceedingly difficult \nto model.\n  Meanwhile, our current climate models are comparatively crude.\n  We lack sufficient data for model inputs, particularly information \nabout the effects of clouds and water vapor.\n  And finally, as we have learned more and refined our computer models, \nestimates of future warming have fallen, not risen.\n  Clearly, the science is uncertain, and the scientific debate is not \nover. Nor should it be.\n  And that brings me to what I see as a troubling trend:\n  Some who have argued for immediate and urgent action to sharply \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions have claimed that the science arguing \nfor quick action is unassailable, and that the scientists who express \ndoubts are somehow extreme or out of the mainstream.\n  Frankly, talk such as that makes me cringe, because the scientific \nmethod itself is based on challenge and peer review.\n  Contrarians should not be shouted down for the sake of political \ncorrectness.\n  Whenever scientists are called out of the mainstream or extreme by a \npolitical leader or a journalist, you can bet that an attempted \nsubversion of the scientific method is at hand.\n  We should condemn any subversion of the scientific method whenever we \nsee it occur in the climate debate. Too much is at stake.\n  Continued investment in science will only enhance our understanding. \nWe have invested billions in a climate change research program that is \nonly now beginning to yield significant results.\n  We should not stake our economic future on partial information.\n  Since extreme, unilateral actions are unwarranted at this point, we \nhave time to encourage developing nations such as China to participate \nin meaningful commitments.\n  The resolution before us states that new commitments on the part of \ndeveloped countries to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be \naccompanied by new commitments on the part of developing countries to \ndo the same.\n  I believe the Senate would have difficulty ratifying any new climate \ntreaty that imposed legally binding greenhouse gas reduction targets \nand timetables, which are essentially energy quotas, only on the most \ndeveloped nations.\n  Such an approach would be unfair, economically devastating, and \nineffective.\n  To repeat: New energy quotas, imposed only on one set of nations, \nwould be unfair, economically devastating, and ineffective. Let me \nexplain:\n  One-sided energy quotas would be unfair:\n  They would allow some nations to gain tremendous competitive \nadvantages over others by encouraging the movement of jobs, \nmanufacturing and capital from nations that are subject to the energy \nquotas, to nations that are not.\n  One-sided energy quotas would be economically devastating:\n  They would require carbon taxes or regulation that would cost jobs, \nharm our economy, and diminish our standard of living.\n  One-sided energy quotas would be ineffective:\n  Because manufacturing, capital, jobs, and even emissions would move \nfrom nations that are subject to the energy quotas, to nations that are \nnot, emissions would not diminish, they might even increase.\n  Moreover, because the total greenhouse gas emissions from developing \nnations will soon exceed those from developed nations, exempting \ndeveloping nations wouldn't do anything to improve the problem. \nGreenhouse gases would still increase. We would suffer economic pain \nwithout environmental gain.\n  What I am saying here today has been confirmed by some of the \nadministration's own economic analysis. A new study produced by the \nDepartment of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory contains some \nsurprising and compelling findings. Let me cite some of them:\n  Increased energy and fuel prices in industrial nations resulting from \na new climate treaty that does not contain meaningful commitments for \ndeveloping nations such as India, China and South Korea would encourage \na reallocation of investments away from industrial countries towards \nthe developing countries. To the extent this occurs, emissions would \nsimply be redistributed and could even increase.\n  Some 20 to 30 percent of the energy intensive basic chemical industry \ncould move to developing countries over 15 to 30 years, with 200,000 \njobs lost.\n  U.S. steel production could fall 30 percent with accompanying job \nlosses of 100,000.\n  All primary aluminum plants in the United States could close by 2010.\n  Many petroleum refiners in the Northeast and Gulf Coast could close, \nand imports would displace more domestic production.\n  Mr. President, these are serious economic impacts, and I believe we \ncan all agree that this is precisely what we must avoid.\n  That's what this resolution is about, and that's why I feel it should \npass with a broad, bipartisan margin.\n\n[[Page S8136]]\n\n  Some will argue that we cannot be successful in efforts bring \ndeveloping nations along in the negotiations in time for the December \n1997 meeting in Kyoto, Japan.\n  But I believe we should try. And if we cannot achieve a new treaty \nthat includes developing nations in this timeframe, then perhaps Kyoto \ncan at least produce a roadmap leading to meaningful commitments by all \nnations.\n  Mr. President, there is no need for a headlong rush toward rash \npolicies.\n  The carbon problem didn't appear overnight. It won't be addressed \novernight. We have time to devise and consider balanced approaches that \ncan work.\n  Time will allow new energy and efficiency technologies to mature.\n  Time will provide for global solutions that include the developing \nnations.\n  Time will allow us to sharpen our science and better understand the \ntrue threat of climate change, if it is indeed a dangerous threat.\n  Yes, the climate issue is a serious one. But it's not a reason to \npanic.\n  This resolution helps our negotiators. It sends an important message \nthat this is a global problem that requires the attention and \nparticipation of all nations.\n  I urge the Senate's adoption of the resolution, and I again commend \nSenators Byrd and Hagel for their leadership and tireless efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, I am \nvitally interested in this area because it is our responsibility. I \nthank my friends, the managers of the bill, and my good friend, Senator \nByrd.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding, and let \nme thank Senator Hagel and Senator Byrd for bringing this resolution to \nthe floor in a timely manner. I know several of my colleagues wish they \ncould have spent a longer period of time this morning debating the \nissue, and I can't blame them. Let me suggest to them that this is only \nthe beginning of a long and very important debate for our country to \nbecome involved in. It also was very important, though, that the Senate \nof the United States, the ratifying body of our Government and our \ncountry, speak out clearly and boldly before the ad hoc climate change \nnegotiating group convenes next Wednesday in Bonn, and carries their \nmeetings through August 8. The reason it is important that the Senate \nspeak out is because we do not believe the sky is falling. We are not \nsure if the sky is cracked, and if it is, maybe we need to build a \nsuperstructure to hold it up. But this country cannot commit itself to \nthis kind of binding agreement unless the science is clearer and the \nunderstanding of the American people is fairly reached when it comes to \nthis issue.\n  Let me speak for a few moments about my frustration that our \nPresident has decided to use his bully pulpit, in my opinion, to \nterrorize the American people into supporting the administration's \nquest for commitments for energy use reduction that are legally binding \non the United States. The President has been quite frank about building \na propaganda campaign about calamities of future global warming, \nbeginning with yesterday's White House meeting on climate change. The \nPresident has indicated his propaganda drive will culminate in a White \nHouse conference on global warming in October. The conference is not \nlikely to be a thoughtful roundtable. It may now be more thoughtful, \nbecause I think the administration has finally recognized that the \nSenate in fact will become engaged and must become engaged.\n  Why did I use the words I just used? Here is the reason. Here is the \nplan that our administration is now supporting: That they would cause \nus to enter into a binding agreement that the United States would be \nresponsible for 48 percent of the world's obligation to reduce energy \nuse. We said a long time ago that any climate change agreement that \naffects the United States should not be binding, but voluntary on the \nworld. Is the administration's plan a dramatic departure from where we \nwere? Here is where it is. It is dramatic because when we arrive at the \nyear 2010, to achieve our 1990 levels, the United States will be \ncontributing about 20 percent of the world's emissions, while the rest \nof the world will be contributing 80 percent. Yet China and India and \nother Asian nations and developing countries, by this administration's \nnegotiations, would be exempt. That is why it is time we come to the \nfloor to speak about this.\n  Senate Resolution 98, under the authorship of Senator Byrd and \nSenator Hagel, says just that, that we cannot become involved unless we \nare all involved and that we should not become involved unless the \nscience is sure, or so sure that we will commit this country and the \nrest of the world into a course that could bind us and reshape our \neconomies and clearly design a different destiny for the American \npeople than one that we might otherwise choose.\n  The President and the Vice President stand next to flooded homes in \nthe Dakotas and suggest that this unfortunate event is a product of \nglobal warming. That is not fair, because the science doesn't prove it. \nSo when I use the word ``terrorize,'' or I use the word ``propaganda,'' \nit is not by chance that I use those words. The science simply doesn't \nsupport the claims being made by this administration, it is important \nto understand that. Last year, in the Leipzig Declaration, 100 \nscientists from around the world, climate scientists--not politicians, \nbut scientists--expressed their doubts about the validity of computer-\ndriven warming forecasts. Why? You heard the Senator from Oklahoma just \nnow say the reason is the science isn't bearing it up. People who \nwatch our satellites say that our satellites tell us we are getting \ncooler. Yet people who watch our ground temperatures suggest we might \nbe getting warmer. Instead of sponsoring a fair debate, the \nadministration is only using part of the available science, while \ndenegrating the other side.\n\n  What is so important for this country to understand, what is more \nimportant for the parliamentarians of the world to understand, is that \nthe President does not necessarily speak for this Senate. But what is \ncritically important is that this Senate will speak for itself. And it \nis, without question, the responsibility of the Senate of the United \nStates to approve treaties. What we do not want to happen is the \nlifting of the level of expectation projected by the rhetoric and the \nselective science by an administration that would bring us into \nnegotiations to produce a treaty in Kyoto in December that simply would \nnot speak to the realities or the responsibilities that we ought to be \nengaged in.\n  The administration must realize that a strong American economy is \nessential to our Nation if we are going to spend upwards of $2 billion \na year on climate change research, if we are going to adapt to changing \nclimate, if needed, and if we are going to adjust our economy and our \neconomic base for those purposes.\n  So, I am pleased to endorse, and I hope Senators will join with me in \na strong endorsement, of Senate Resolution 98. It is important that we \nspeak now. I view, as others do, that this is a preliminary statement \nin what will be a long and complex debate for all of us to become \ninvolved in, because I don't know where our science will lead us. But \nif it, in fact, can show us the way and clearly demonstrate that there \nis a climate change responsibility for this Nation, then all the rest \nof the nations in the world must participate. We cannot shoulder 48 \npercent of the burden for the rest of the world.\n  Mr. President, let me close with this last chart. If you were to turn \nthe United States into a forest with no emissions whatsoever, by the \nyear 2100 here is the problem with the rest of the world. The problem \nis that we want to be at 1990 levels by 2010. If you take the United \nStates out of the equation, the total concentration of greenhouse gases \nhardly changes. Yet this administration, at least by their rhetoric of \nthe last several months, would take China out of it, the other \ndeveloping world nations out, and leave us to bear the burden. That is \nwhy S. Res. 98 is so critical for us today, for the world tomorrow, as \nwe march toward Kyoto in December.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who seeks \ntime?\n\n[[Page S8137]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself a couple of minutes before \nyielding to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a couple of Senators refer to the fact \nthat the science somehow, because of satellite observations, does not \nindicate the kind of warming that others are arguing is taking effect. \nThis is an example of how an individual scientific fact is used to \ndistort the record here for one purpose or another. We will have time \nlater to discuss all of those purposes. But the argument is made that, \nalthough thermometers located at the Earth's surface show an increase \nin temperature today higher than it has been for 130 years, people say \nthe satellite measurements, which are thousands of feet above the \nsurface, show a cooling since 1979.\n  That is true. That is the only part of this that is true. There is \nnothing in that fact that discredits the theory, the thesis, which has \nbeen accepted by scientists, with respect to the warming. Let me point \nout why. Thermometers in satellites and thermometers on the ground \nobviously measure temperatures at two very different places in the \natmosphere, and it is not surprising, according to most scientists who \ninterpret this, that there is a difference. At higher altitudes, \ntemperatures fluctuate far more than they do at the surface due to \nnatural climate influences like sunlight reflecting particles from \nvolcanoes and other variabilities. What scientists called variability, \nor noise in the satellite record, obscures the warming trend due to the \nbuildup of greenhouse gases that is apparent in the global surface \ntemperature.\n\n  Furthermore, the depletion of the ozone layer, which has occurred \nmostly since 1979, has had a cooling effect on the atmosphere which is \nmore marked at higher levels than it is at surface levels. The Earth's \nsurface has warmed over the northern and the southern hemispheres, \nwhich totally negates the notion of any kind of heat effect from urban \ncenters or otherwise.\n  There will be later times to discuss the science. But it is important \nto note that on June 22, 1997, the New York Times in an editorial said \nthat the reason we had voluntary agreements out of Rio was science was \nsomewhat murky. But in 1995, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, consisting of 2,500 scientists, concluded that there \nwas a serious impact they could discern, and the science became \ncertain.\n  So I think as time goes on Americans will come to understand that.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I commend particularly Senator Byrd and \nSenator Kerry for their leadership in this area and say I come to the \nfloor as a U.S. Senator from a State that is the first State in the \ncountry to put mandatory limits on carbon dioxide, the primary manmade \nsource of global warming. We have shown in our home State that it is \npossible to have a thriving, prosperous economy and take steps to limit \nthese environmental problems that our colleagues have talked about.\n  The fact is, our country can help play a leadership role in \ncontrolling global warming without causing an economic meltdown. There \nare, really, three approaches that the State of Oregon has used, as the \nfirst State in the country to have mandatory controls on carbon dioxide \nemissions.\n  First, as Senators Byrd and Kerry have talked about, we give great \nemphasis on market mechanisms. We are not talking about a big \ngovernment approach. We are talking about using the market.\n  Second, we have taken steps to build these new approaches into new \npowerplant design. It is prospective, so that all those who are \nconstructing our new powerplants understand the rules.\n  Third, we have given special rewards, credits, for innovative \napproaches such as proper management of our forests.\n  I conclude by saying that properly managed forests can be very \neffective in helping to capture greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, and \nremoving them from the air. Our Northwest forests are some of the very \nbest carbon sinks in the world. The older forests are estimated to be \ntwo to three times as effective in capturing carbon dioxide emissions \nas new growth.\n  I have heard several of my colleagues talk about some of the \nalternatives. Carbon taxes----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oregon has \nexpired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds?\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 7 minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield the Senator an additional minute.\n  Mr. WYDEN. My last point is we know, for example, that properly \nmanaged forests are a cost-effective alternative to end-of-pipe \nemission controls or carbon taxes. There are alternatives out there. My \nhome State has shown they can work, and I thank Senator Kerry for the \nextra time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to just read that New York \nTimes editorial and ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record, \nand I yield myself such time as I use.\n  With respect to the science it says:\n\n       One reason why the industrial nations opted for voluntary \n     targets in Rio was that mainstream scientists simply couldn't \n     agree whether manmade emissions have contributed to the small \n     rise in global temperatures that began in the late 19th \n     century. In 1995, however, the U.N. intergovernmental panel \n     on climate change consisting of about 2,500 scientists \n     concluded that they had. The language was cautious, their \n     forecasts were gloomy. Unless the current rates of combustion \n     of carbon-based fuels, coal, gas, oil, could be reduced, they \n     warned, temperatures would rise between 1.8 and 6.3 degrees \n     Fahrenheit over the next century. Temperature changes in the \n     middle level of that scale could cause a 20-inch rise in sea \n     levels that would flood coastal lowlands and tropical \n     islands, an increase in weather extremes and global damage to \n     forests and croplands. Despite challenges from businesses \n     which have been attacking the science in tobacco industry \n     fashion, the U.N. panel has not retreated from its basic \n     findings.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we are going to have a good debate in this country \nin the next months on the science, and that is appropriate; we ought to \nhave it. We ought to put to the test all of the theories. We should \ndemand the most exacting models. We should press for the most certitude \nthat we can gain. But there is no issue today scientifically about the \nfact that there is global warming taking place, about the fact that \nthere is sea-level rise occurring, and that, if it continues at the \ncurrent trend levels, the damages could be devastating.\n  We can quarrel about how much happens at what point in time, about \nwhat model is better at predicting the impact. I will acknowledge there \nare inherent uncertainties in that process. Clearly there are. But we \nknow we are living in the midst of the most significant increase that \nwe have seen in 130 years, and the evidence of the prognosis of our \nbest scientists is that it is going to continue at a rate that is \ngreater than anything we have known since humankind, since civilization \nhas existed, civilization within the last 8,000 to 10,000 years on this \nplanet. We owe it to ourselves and to common sense to try to make the \nbest judgments about that.\n  This resolution today, I want to emphasize, is not about the science. \nThis resolution is about how our team goes to Kyoto and how we \nnegotiate in the next months.\n  I want to emphasize with respect to my comments about the Berlin \nmandate that there is nothing in this resolution today that I deem to \nbe inconsistent with the mandate; nothing inconsistent. I do believe \nthat this begins to alter appropriately how we begin to approach some \nof the negotiations in Kyoto, and I accept what the Senator from \nNebraska has said, I accept what the Senator from West Virginia has \nsaid, and others. It is a matter of fairness and common sense that the \nUnited States should not be placed at a disadvantage and make a set of \nchoices that don't bring others into the process of solving this.\n  So, Mr. President, thanking the Senator from West Virginia for the \ncolloquy, clearly I am not calling my amendment up.\n  Mr. President, I have extra time. I will yield 2 minutes of my time \nto the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes that the Senator has 1 \nminute 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 1 minute 45 seconds to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may have an \nadditional 30 seconds over and above the time referred to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it was John Stuart Mill who said that ``On \nall great subjects, much remains to be said.'' I think we will all be \nsaying a good bit more than has been said here as the days come and go. \nWe are not yet debating the treaty itself. But my distinguished friend, \nMr. Kerry, has just said, in his judgment, there is nothing in this \nresolution that is inconsistent with the Berlin mandate.\n  Mr. President, that is not my view at all. I think we only have to \nread the resolution itself--it speaks for itself--and we will find that \nit is inconsistent with the Berlin Mandate, and I intended to say that.\n  Mr. President, I will try to elaborate on my view with a two-part \nobservation. First, with respect to significant emitters, such as \nChina, it makes no sense for the international community to begin this \neffort by agreeing to unchecked emissions growth from newly \nconstructed, but inefficient, power-generating and industrial \nfacilities. It is neither cost-effective nor environmentally beneficial \nto go back and retrofit dirty smokestacks.\n  We all know that China in particular has near-term plans to increase \nits power-generating capacity exponentially. We must anticipate the \nprospect of significant new industrial development in China and other \nplaces by providing incentives for deployment of new, cleaner \ntechnologies. In short, we must bring back from Kyoto some commitments \nthat China and other large emitters will grow in a smart way.\n  I want to make it clear that the current approach of the State \nDepartment is not acceptable to this Senator under the terms of the \nresolution. Their approach will not work. A promise by the developing \ncountries to only negotiate at a later date is simply unacceptable. Any \nagreement resulting from negotiations in Kyoto, or thereafter, that \nincludes binding commitments for developed countries must also include \nserious, specific, and binding commitments by the developing world.\n  I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes that all time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 60 seconds to \nclarify the record and respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I don't disagree with what Senator Byrd has \njust said. In a sense, I should correct my own comment when I talk \nabout the Berlin mandate. Obviously, we are altering the way in which \nwe are approaching the question of inclusiveness. When I say ``nothing \ninconsistent,'' I am talking about in the fundamentals of how you might \napproach the issue of timetable or compliance. We have discussed that \nin the course of this debate, and that is what I intended to say.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Res. 98) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 98\n\n       Whereas the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change (in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``Convention''), adopted in May 1992, entered into force in \n     1994 and is not yet fully implemented;\n       Whereas the Convention, intended to address climate change \n     on a global basis, identifies the former Soviet Union and the \n     countries of Eastern Europe and the Organization For Economic \n     Co-operation and Development (OECD), including the United \n     States, as ``Annex I Parties'', and the remaining 129 \n     countries, including China, Mexico, India, Brazil, and South \n     Korea, as ``Developing Country Parties'';\n       Whereas in April 1995, the Convention's ``Conference of the \n     Parties'' adopted the so-called ``Berlin Mandate'';\n       Whereas the ``Berlin Mandate'' calls for the adoption, as \n     soon as December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, of a protocol or \n     another legal instrument that strengthens commitments to \n     limit greenhouse gas emissions by Annex I Parties for the \n     post-2000 period and establishes a negotiation process called \n     the ``Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate'';\n       Whereas the ``Berlin Mandate'' specifically exempts all \n     Developing Country Parties from any new commitments in such \n     negotiation process for the post-2000 period;\n       Whereas although the Convention, approved by the United \n     States Senate, called on all signatory parties to adopt \n     policies and programs aimed at limiting their greenhouse gas \n     (GHG) emissions, in July 1996 the UnderSecretary of State for \n     Global Affairs called for the first time for ``legally \n     binding'' emission limitation targets and timetables for \n     Annex I Parties, a position reiterated by the Secretary of \n     State in testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations \n     of the Senate on January 8, 1997;\n       Whereas greenhouse gas emissions of Developing Country \n     Parties are rapidly increasing and are expected to surpass \n     emissions of the United States and other OECD countries as \n     early as 2015;\n       Whereas the Department of State has declared that it is \n     critical for the Parties to the Convention to include \n     Developing Country Parties in the next steps for global \n     action and, therefore, has proposed that consideration of \n     additional steps to include limitations on Developing Country \n     Parties' greenhouse gas emissions would not begin until after \n     a protocol or other legal instrument is adopted in Kyoto, \n     Japan in December 1997;\n       Whereas the exemption for Developing Country Parties is \n     inconsistent with the need for global action on climate \n     change and is environmentally flawed;\n       Whereas the Senate strongly believes that the proposals \n     under negotiation, because of the disparity of treatment \n     between Annex I Parties and Developing Countries and the \n     level of required emission reductions, could result in \n     serious harm to the United States economy, including \n     significant job loss, trade disadvantages, increased energy \n     and consumer costs, or any combination thereof; and\n       Whereas it is desirable that a bipartisan group of Senators \n     be appointed by the Majority and Minority Leaders of the \n     Senate for the purpose of monitoring the status of \n     negotiations on Global Climate Change and reporting \n     periodically to the Senate on those negotiations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     protocol to, or other agreement regarding, the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992, at \n     negotiations in Kyoto in December 1997, or thereafter, which \n     would--\n       (A) mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse \n     gas emissions for the Annex I Parties, unless the protocol or \n     other agreement also mandates new specific scheduled \n     commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for \n     Developing Country Parties within the same compliance period, \n     or\n       (B) would result in serious harm to the economy of the \n     United States; and\n       (2) any such protocol or other agreement which would \n     require the advice and consent\n\n[[Page S8139]]\n\n     of the Senate to ratification should be accompanied by a \n     detailed explanation of any legislation or regulatory actions \n     that may be required to implement the protocol or other \n     agreement and should also be accompanied by an analysis of \n     the detailed financial costs and other impacts on the economy \n     of the United States which would be incurred by the \n     implementation of the protocol or other agreement.\n       Sec. 2.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that the majority leader, after consultation \nwith the Democratic leader, may turn to S. 39, and one managers' \namendment be in order, and time for the amendment and the debate on the \nbill be limited to 30 minutes, equally divided in the usual form, and \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed \nto vote on the amendment, to be followed by third reading and passage \nof S. 39, as amended, if amended.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, I \nwant to say to our majority leader that I thank him for his patience. I \nwant to use this time in reserving my right to object, which I shall \nnot, to thank the majority leader for his patience in allowing us the \ntime we needed to come to what I think is a good compromise on this \nbill.\n  I want to say that Senator John Kerry stepped into the breach at the \nmoment we needed him to do so, and in working with Senator McCain and \nSenator Snowe, Senator Breaux, Senator Biden, myself, Senator Stevens--\nit was a big group of us, and a group that is pretty much known for \nsome very strong opinions. I want to thank him. And the administration \nwas at the table. It was not easy.\n  But in the end, what we are going to do basically is keep the label \nthe way it is and give some time for a study to begin, put all the \nother wonderful parts of that bill into place, and then when the \npreliminary results are known, we will make a decision--the Secretary \nof Commerce will--on whether or not to change the definition of what \nconstitutes ``dolphin safe'' tuna. So I think it is a victory for \nAmerican consumers.\n  Just in concluding my brief remarks here--and I will not object to \nthe unanimous-consent request--I want to thank the more than 44 \nSenators who stood with us, who were going to vote with us, so we were \nable to have the strength to negotiate this compromise.\n  I will not object to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Hearing none, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me wrap this up right quick because Senator McCain \nneeds to be able to comment on this, too.\n  For the information of all Senators, in light of this agreement with \nrespect to the tuna-dolphin legislation, the cloture vote was vitiated; \ntherefore, there will be no further votes to occur today. The next \nvotes will occur in stacked sequence on Tuesday, July 29, beginning at \n9:30 a.m.\n  I want to thank all Senators for their cooperation, especially the \nSenator from Maine, Senator Snowe. She did outstanding work. She did \nnot always receive the type of consideration she should have, but she \nhas risen above that. Without her agreement, this would not have been \npossible. Also, of course, Senator McCain has been diligent in his \nwork, as always, and also Senator Kerry, who got involved to help us \nwork this out.\n  I would like to make sure now that Senator McCain has a chance to \nspeak and put the proper perspective on all of this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I received a letter from the National \nSecurity Adviser. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 25, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I want to thank you for your hard work \n     and support to find an acceptable compromise on S. 39 the \n     International Dolphin Conservation Act. I am writing to \n     inform you that we accept the agreement that has been struck \n     between yourself and other Senators involved with the \n     discussions on the legislation. I also want to inform you \n     that we have consulted with the Government of Mexico and that \n     they do not object to the agreement. They, in turn, are \n     discussing this with the other signatories of the Panama \n     Declaration in order to secure their acceptance of this \n     compromise. I am hopeful that all the signatories will be \n     able to accept this compromise as well.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts to bring about a \n     successful conclusion to the discussions on S. 39.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    For National Security Affairs.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this letter indicates that negotiations we \nhave entered into making changes to the legislation will keep the \nInternational Dolphin Conservation Program intact. That has been our \nsole objective. With the administration's assurance, I believe we are \nprepared to enter into a time agreement for final passage of the bill.\n  Again, President Clinton has asked us to pass this legislation. \nGreenpeace, the Center for Marine Conservation, the Environmental \nDefense Fund, the World Wildlife Fund, and the National Wildlife \nFederation have asked us to pass this bill. My only test for accepting \nchanges to the bill is that the conservation agreement remains intact.\n  The agreement, which still must be put into legislative language, \nlifts the embargo on tuna from the eastern tropical Pacific, and would \nrequire the label change after the Secretary of Commerce makes a \nfinding on implementation of the international agreement does not \nadversely affect dolphin in any substantial way, by a time certain. We \nhave had months of negotiations on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. This \nagreement would not be where it is today without the Senator from \nMaine, Senator Snowe, the subcommittee chairperson, who conducted weeks \nand months of negotiations on this issue. The Senator from Maine is the \none that made this happen. Whenever there is a victory, there are all \nkinds of people that like to take credit for it. The Senator from \nMaine, Senator Snowe, entered into a months-long series of \nnegotiations, and has accepted amendments and reservations that she \nwould not otherwise want to. I am sorry that the thing that held up \nthis agreement was extreme partisanship, which motivated people to vote \nfor cloture on a bill that the administration and the environmental \ncommunity supported, and the characterization of this bill as some kind \nof cave-in is wrong. We demanded that the international signatories \nwould agree to any compromise that was made. That was done so in this \nbill. There will be, at a time certain, a labeling which will allow \nthis Nation--and the other nations who are signatories--to have the \nimportation of tuna into this country. I am sorry that these issues, \nwhich are really in the best interests of the Nation, somehow get \npoliticized so much, as this issue has been. The Senator from Maine has \nrefrained from that all along.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a fellow in my \noffice, Tom Richey, be permitted access to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that, from my \nperspective, this agreement on tuna-dolphin does not represent a cave-\nin. It doesn't represent one side sort of being bullied by another \nside. Also, I certainly don't think it represents a partisan effort \nbecause Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, and a number of our \ncolleagues across the aisle, were also very interested in the outcome \nof this and were prepared to join in a rigorous debate.\n  What I believe has happened is that, as it often does in the U.S. \nSenate,\n\n[[Page S8140]]\n\nwhen contentious views are brought together and people have a chance to \nbe able to air those views and work at it over time, we have been able \nto arrive at what I believe is a very good, sensible compromise--not a \ncave-in, a compromise. It is a compromise which I think takes the very \nbest of what was proposed originally by Senator Breaux and Senator \nStevens and helps to amalgamate it with other people's ideas about what \nwould make it even stronger. It is going to be a strong conservation \nethic. It is going to guarantee that we take the cooperation of other \ncountries that we are respectful of and grateful for their cooperation \nand utilize that in a way which is going to strengthen our relationship \nin the hemisphere and, at the same time, provide for a strong \nconservation capacity with respect to the dolphin stocks.\n  I think everybody ought to be very pleased with the outcome. I am \ngrateful to the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, for her efforts on \nthis. I regret that, yesterday, there were some misunderstandings \nduring the course of it. But she has exhibited great strength and \nwillingness to help provide for our ability to move forward. I thank \nher publicly for that.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, for \nhis efforts and patience, particularly. I think he allowed people to \nwork through this in a way that got us here. I particularly thank \nSenator Boxer for her tireless, tireless energy in fighting for what \nshe thought was right in this situation and for helping to create the \nability to come to this compromise. So I think it is positive for all \nconcerned, and I think everybody ought to feel good about it, without \nany sense of partisanship or any divisiveness.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. I rise to express my support for the \nagreement that ultimately was reached on this very important issue. I \nremind my colleagues that this was an issue that had been introduced in \nthe last Congress by the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and \nunfortunately, we weren't able to get it through in the last Congress, \nfor a lot of political reasons. I hope now that people recognize that \nthis represents a very strong step toward preservation and conservation \nof the species and, at the same time, an important agreement with 11 \nother nations on this issue, which I think ultimately will resolve the \nproblems that we are facing with respect to tuna, as well as with \ndolphins.\n  So I hope that our colleagues will ultimately support this agreement. \nI want to commend Senator McCain, who certainly forged an effort to try \nto create this, as well as Senator Boxer and Senator Kerry. Truly, the \nleadership was exemplified by Senator Stevens and Senator Breaux, who \noriginally introduced this legislation in the last Congress. So I hope \nthat we will take the steps necessary to implement this legislation \nand, ultimately, will ratify the agreement that was reached by this \nadministration with respect to this issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Tuesday, the New York Times stated \nthat the State Department would issue its first report on the worldwide \npersecution of Christians and this report would be sharply critical of \nChina. That report was, in fact, released this past Wednesday, and I \nurge all of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to read this report. This \nis the same report that the State Department originally promised to \nrelease to Congress on January 15, over 6 months ago. It is the same \nreport that the State Department promised to release by the end of \nJune, and the same report that the State Department promised to release \nbefore the House voted on China's most-favored-nation trading status.\n  On June 18 of this year, my good friend and colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold, and I sent a letter to both the President and to the \nSecretary of State, expressing our grave concerns about recent reports \nthat suggested that the State Department was deliberately delaying the \nrelease of its findings on religious persecution throughout the world. \nIt was my understanding that this report placed a specific focus on the \npersecution of Christians and other religious minorities around the \nworld, and that the report singled out China for especially tough \ncriticism.\n  It is, in fact, the case, as the report has been issued and as I have \nsurveyed that report, that that criticism is even more scathing than \nwhat had been anticipated. As I have stated on this floor many times, \nthe 1996 State Department's human rights report on China revealed that \nthe Chinese authorities had effectively stepped up efforts to suppress \nexpressions of criticism and protest. This report said that all public \ndissent had been effectively silenced by either exile, imposition of \nprison terms, or intimidation. This latest report from the State \nDepartment, issued this week, further underscores the seriousness of \nthe situation in China and the severity of the crackdown that has been \nimposed upon those who would express any opinion contrary to that of \nthe Communist government.\n  As an original cosponsor of the disapproval resolution on MFN to \nChina, I believe serious human rights abuses persist in all areas of \nChina today and that the continuous delay of this year's report on \nreligious persecution raises the question as to this administration's \nwillingness to engage in an open discussion of the effect of U.S. \npolicy on human rights in China and around the world.\n  I urge that the State Department report be delivered in a timely \nmanner to ensure its full disclosure and debate prior to a vote on the \nextension of MFN to China. It seemed to be only right, only proper that \nthe House and my Senate colleagues would have an opportunity to see the \nlatest and most accurate information as to what is going on in China. \nThat information was denied the House and it was denied my colleagues \nin the Senate, as we voted on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution last \nweek. I even publicly made a request on the Senate floor for that \nreport to be issued prior to any MFN debate and MFN vote.\n  The State Department informed me that I would receive a copy of the \nreport as soon as it was released. Mr. President, the fact was that the \nNew York Times received a copy of this report before Congress did. This \nyear's report states quite clearly that the Chinese Government has \nconsistently violated its own constitutional guarantees of religious \nrights, cracking down on Catholic and Protestant groups, raiding \nworship groups meeting in private homes, and sometimes detaining and \ninterrogating and even beating religious leaders. Furthermore, the \nreport states:\n\n       The government of China has sought to restrict all actual \n     religious practice to government-authorized religious \n     organizations. Some religious groups have registered, while \n     others were refused registration.\n\n  I want to commend and express my appreciation to Senator Ashcroft \nfrom the State of Missouri for his willingness to come to the floor of \nthe Senate this week and express his own outrage at the continuing \ndeterioration of human rights conditions in China.\n  Mr. President, I raise this question on the floor of the Senate \ntoday: Why was the State Department's report on religious persecution \ndelayed, delayed, and delayed again, so that it was only released after \nall congressional votes and all congressional debate on MFN was \nhistory?\n  Mr. President, I have serious concerns that officials of this \nadministration are not willing to engage in an open discussion about \nUnited States policy toward China, and I am deeply disturbed about the \ntiming of this report, especially in light of the votes that have \ntranspired in both the House and the Senate in recent weeks.\n\n[[Page S8141]]\n\n  The revelation that human rights abuses continue to worsen in China, \nwhile our policy remains status quo, I believe, gives our own tacit \nconsent to the terrible atrocities that are occurring in that great \ncountry.\n  To remain silent when evil is perpetrated and injustice is being \ninflicted, I think, is to become a participant in that evil. So I urge \nmy colleagues to obtain a copy of this year's report issued this week, \nread it, study it, and decide what action we should take as a nation \nagainst this regime that continues to disregard basic human rights.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens).

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the issue of independent counsel. Yesterday, I spoke about \nmy view that independent counsel ought to be appointed and the fact \nthat there appeared to be no chance of Attorney General Reno appointing \nan independent counsel, and then exploring the alternatives of \nlitigation and the alternative of an amendment to the independent \ncounsel statute. I stated at that time that I intended to pursue \nlegislation to modify the independent counsel statute and had hoped to \nput it on the appropriations bill on Commerce, State, Justice, and the \nJudiciary, but would not do so if it would tie up the bill.\n  After consultation with the distinguished majority leader and others, \nit was apparent to me that such an amendment would tie up the bill and \nmost probably provoke a filibuster on the other side, and that, in \nfact, a unanimous-consent agreement had been proposed which was \nconditional on tabling any amendment which I might offer.\n  In addition to the amendment on independent counsel, I was \nconsidering, along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Hatch, \noffering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling for the Attorney \nGeneral to appoint independent counsel. But even a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution would have provoked a likely filibuster to tie up the bill. \nSo I did not proceed to do that, but instead filed at the desk \nyesterday legislation for independent counsel, after consultation with \nthe majority leader, who said that if an opportunity presented itself \nthat that matter might be called up as early as next week. That would \nnot be certain because there are considerations as to what will happen \nwith the reconciliation bill and the tax bill.\n  In the alternative, after discussions with Senator Hatch, the \nalternative has been considered to have a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution perhaps acted on next week, if there is time. It is the last \nweek before the recess. But that is problematical.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC.    .

He worked over every script, watched \n     each ad, ordered changes in every visual presentation and \n     decided which ads would run when and where;''\n       (6) there have been conflicting and contradictory \n     statements by the Vice President regarding the timing and \n     extent of his knowledge of the nature of a fundraising event \n     at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple near Los Angeles on April 29, \n     1996;\n       (7) the independent counsel statute requires the Attorney \n     General to consider the specificity of information provided \n     and the credibility of the source of information pertaining \n     to potential violations of criminal law by covered persons, \n     including the President and the Vice President;\n       (8) the independent counsel statute further requires the \n     Attorney General to petition the court for appointment of an \n     independent counsel where the Attorney General finds that \n     there is a reasonable likelihood that a violation of criminal \n     law may have occurred involving a covered person;\n       (9) the Attorney General has been presented with specific \n     and credible evidence pertaining to potential violations of \n     criminal law by covered persons and there is a reasonable \n     likelihood that a violation of criminal law may have occurred \n     involving a covered person; and\n       (10) the Attorney General has abused her discretion by \n     failing to petition the court for appointment of an \n     independent counsel.\n       (b) It is the Sense of the Senate that the Attorney General \n     should petition the court immediately for appointment of an \n     independent counsel to investigate the reasonable likelihood \n     that a violation of criminal law may have occurred involving \n     a covered person in the 1996 presidential federal election \n     campaign.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I would like to call attention to an \nextraordinary experience that occurred last weekend, involving several \nMembers of this body who joined my wife and me in visiting our great \nState of Alaska: Senator Helms and Mrs. Helms, the Senator from North \nCarolina; Senator Jeffords from Vermont, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, \nand Senator Smith from Oregon. We left last Friday after the close of \nbusiness Thursday night. We covered approximately 7,400 miles in about \n64 hours. We visited eight cities and communities. I think we were in \nthe airplane some 23 hours, spent 6 hours on a bus, and at least 10 \nhours visiting with people on the ground in Alaska. But for that \nrelatively brief time, I think a great deal was learned.\n  The purpose of the trip, relative to aspects of the national energy \nsecurity of the country, was to observe the oil development on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska at Prudhoe Bay, and to follow the pipeline 800 \nmiles down to the terminus at Valdez.\n  We flew on Friday direct from Washington, DC, via Edmonton, Canada to \nCordova, AK, in Prince William Sound, where we were met by Mayor \nJohnson, who gave us an overview of the impact of the Federal \nGovernment relations and the aftereffects of the Exxon Valdez oilspill \nat Bligh Reef.\n  We then got into smaller aircraft and flew around Prince William \nSound. We viewed Colombia Glacier and at the area where the Exxon \nValdez went aground--we observed the beaches closely. I am pleased to \ntell my colleagues that there was absolutely no sign of any residue \nfrom that terrible accident.\n  We then landed in Valdez, were met by a group of people, and boarded \na bus to go around the harbor to the pipeline terminal, which is the \nlargest oil terminal in the United States. A full 25\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\npercent of our total crude oil production is dispatched on U.S.-flagged \ntankers that move it to Hawaii, to Los Angeles and San Francisco on the \nwest coast, and to other areas.\n  It was remarkable to note that there were hundreds of tourists \nfishing for salmon, right next to the oil terminal, in small boats. We \nsaw several fish being caught. These weren't shills, these were real \npeople, real tourists out there, Mr. President.\n  We had an opportunity to inspect the terminal. We observed the major \nstorage area. We actually went into one of the storage tanks that was \nbeing cleaned. The setting of the terminal--that I remind my colleagues \nhas the capability of supplying this Nation with 25 percent of its \ntotal crude oil--is really dramatic. It sits on a shelf across the \nharbor from Valdez, on solid rock, with a dramatic background of \nsnowcapped peaks. More significant still is, I think, the technology \nthat has been adopted there.\n  They are currently able to recapture any emissions from the loading \ntankers, that is, the fumes coming from loading the tankers, and put \nthem back into a closed recovery process. So there are virtually no \nemissions coming out during the loading process. To protect against \nliquids, each ship has a boom around it while it is loaded to make sure \nthat there is no oil can possibly escape. I think the oil spillage \nthere in the last several years has totaled less than a gallon, to give \nyou some idea of the safety and technology that has been adopted.\n  We next went back to Valdez by boat, met with community leaders and \nthen got back on our airplane and flew to Fairbanks. In Fairbanks we \nwere hosted at a dinner by the Arctic Slope Regional Corp., the Alaska \nNative corporation representing the North Slope area. Next morning we \nflew from Barrow to Fairbanks, about an hour-and-a-half flight. Point \nBarrow is the northernmost community in the United States. You can't go \nany further north without falling off the top.\n  There we met with a number of Native people, and they were very \nexplicit in explaining to us the significant difference that energy \ndevelopment has made to their lives. One young man indicated that he \nused to come to school to keep warm, because there was not enough heat \nin his home. They had to scrounge on the beach for driftwood, driftwood \nthat is not native to the area because Barrow is far north of the tree \nline, but would float in from the MacKenzie River 100 miles away to the \neast and wash up on the beach. He said things are different now. He \nwent to a school that was built by the North Slope Borough government \nand funded by the Arctic Slope Regional Corp. It is one of the finest \nschools in the United States. It has everything--even indoor recess \ncapability, a good idea in that climate. Really a magnificent facility. \nWe also visited the local hospital and several other things.\n\n  But the point the resident brought out is that they prospered only as \na consequence of having a tax base based on resource development--oil \nand gas. They were able to send their children to school. And it was \nnot like the past when there were no economic benefits, no support \nbase. I think everyone was very pleased at the presentation because it \nprovided a point of view on energy development that is not often made.\n  We next flew in our airplane to Prudhoe Bay, the beginning of the \n800-mile pipeline, to observe the oilfields. Then we went by bus to a \nsite called Endicott. This is a field based on a man-made island about \n11 miles offshore, made of gravel. It is the seventh largest producing \noilfield in North America, and yet it has a footprint of only 54 acres. \nThat's very significant when you consider the advancements in oil \ntechnology between Prudhoe Bay and Endicott, and realize they can \ndevelop oil using directional drilling from a very small platform--that \nis what Endicott means.\n  We then drove back to Prudhoe Bay, got in small aircraft and went \neast to the Canadian border. There, we were inside the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge--ANWR. We actually flew into the ANWR area to a village \nthat is in the middle of ANWR called Kaktovik. We met with the \nvillagers. They were out fishing. It was a beautiful day. There was \nvirtually no wind. The icecap moved away from the shore, leaving blue \nwaters. We saw maybe 10,000 caribou, and several hundred musk ox on the \ntundra.\n  The interesting thing is we saw where the proposed wells are going to \nbe developed on the State's side of ANWR, and then we went near a well \nsite that is very close to the edge of ANWR called Sourdough. This is a \nwell on State land adjacent to ANWR and which may be the site of a \nmajor oil discovery.\n  The question there is whether this discovery extends into ANWR or is \nlimited just to the State land next to it. Of course, this presents a \nproblem and a question of responsibility for the Secretary of the \nInterior. Because he has public trust responsibility to determine if \nthere is, in fact, a reservoir of oil on the Federal side. That's \nimportant because if the State allows drilling and the State pulls down \nthe oil deposit under its well, a portion of that resource could belong \nto the Federal Government.\n  We went to a couple of other areas that were interesting. Some in the \ngroup asked, ``Where are the pictures of the coastal plain that we see \nin the environmental magazines that portray the sensitive coastal plain \narea?'' We took the group back into that area, a dramatically different \nregion that is not in the same area as the coastal plain despite the \npictures we see so often. We also observed a number of areas where they \nplan to drill on the State's side, and flew over the one exploratory \nwell that had been drilled within the ANWR area. There was no evidence, \nother than you can see a discoloration of the tundra, of that well's \nexistence--no structures of any kind.\n  What that well may or may not contain we still don't know because \nthat information has never been released by the companies that did the \ndrilling. It is somewhat academic at this point, because if there were \nsubstantial reserves there, there is no way to take them out because \nit's all Federal land. Without the ability to transfer the oil through \na pipeline it is impractical and unreasonable to proceed until Congress \nresolves the issue of what to do with the 1002 area.\n  This is a unique area, part of ANWR, but just 1\\1/2\\ million acres \nout of the 19-million-acre total. The area of ANWR is basically made up \nof three parcels. About 8 million acres are in the wilderness, about 9 \nmillion acres are in what we call refuges. Only 1\\1/2\\ million acres \nare included in the so-called 1002 area, which was reserved for the \nCongress of the United States to decide whether or not it is in the \nnational interest to open that area for oil and gas exploration.\n  To conclude with a brief description of the trip, I think my \ncolleagues would agree, they saw a great big hunk of American real \nestate and got a feel for the sensitive areas. They got a feel for the \nadvanced technology that is underway currently for oil and gas \nexploration and production. We saw foxes. We saw caribou running ahead \nof our bus on the roads in Prudhoe Bay.\n  Then after that day, we flew back to Fairbanks where we were hosted \nby the Alaska miners to a dinner. The next morning, the University of \nAlaska, on Sunday, hosted the Members to a breakfast at 8 o'clock. Then \nat 9 o'clock, we went out to the Fort Knox gold mine. This is the \nlargest gold mine in Alaska producing from a new technology that gets \nthe very fine gold and is able to recover it. It is operating 7 days a \nweek, 24 hours a day with a shift of about 200 personnel, but the \nsignificance is that they brought in a bar of gold, a brick, a little \nbit bigger than a brick, very heavy. It was worth about $167,000. That \nis what one brick of gold is worth.\n  We drove back to Fairbanks, got in the airplane at noon on Sunday, \nand flew back the rest of the day, got in here at midnight, and went to \nwork Monday morning.\n  I simply describe this as evidence, I think, of an opportunity for \nMembers to see Alaska, such as Senator Helms, Senator Jeffords, Senator \nInhofe, Senator Smith, the current occupant of the chair, and see for \nthemselves what the issues are relative to the issue of ANWR and other \naspects of the national energy security interests which Alaska \ncontributes significantly to and address the dilemma associated with \ndevelopment on public land and talk to Alaskans who we feel are the \nbest stewards of the land.\n\n[[Page S8143]]\n\n  So I encourage my other colleagues to contact the Senators in \nquestion--Senators Helms, Jeffords, Inhofe, and Smith of Oregon, \nbecause we would like to host others in Alaska and let them see for \nthemselves as they address many of the issues that are going to \ndetermine the manner in which Congress authorizes resource development \non public lands in our Nation's largest State.\n  With that, I thank my colleague who has been patient, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8141-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8143-S8144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we just voted earlier today 95 to 0 to \ndirect the President of the United States not to enter into treaties in \nJapan dealing with global warming at this time. Those of us who care \nabout the Earth on which we live want to make sure we are good stewards \nof this planet that we are blessed to have and we care about it very \ndeeply.\n  I have had the opportunity to serve on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and have heard testimony from some of the Nation's most \noutstanding experts on the question of global warming. I am a new \nSenator, just having come here in January, and was very interested and \nfascinated by the possibility of trying to learn more about this \nproblem that I have been reading about, as have so many Americans.\n  I must admit to you that I have been somewhat surprised by a number \nof things, including a lack of unanimity among scientists, a lack of \ndata among scientists, and a serious disagreement among scientists. I \nam also somewhat surprised, despite the very strong feelings of people \nwho study this, that the President continues to be determined to enter \ninto treaties that could adversely affect the economic well-being of \nthe United States.\n  Let me say first, in my simple way of thinking about this problem, a \nregulation is the equivalent of a tax. It would be no different for us \nthan if we were to regulate the electric power industry and added costs \nto companies by mandating environmental controls in addition to the \nones that they have implemented to preserve the environment for years. \nIf we implement those controls, their customers are going to pay in \nterms of rate increases. Increases will be paid by the citizens who \nconsume power, and every American consumes power.\n  So we have to understand that a regulation that imposes a burden on \nsome big company, like a power company, is really a tax on all of us. \nIt is a regulation that impacts all of us. It adds to the cost of doing \nbusiness in America. Every small business that utilizes electricity \nwill have to pay for that power at a higher cost. It will make them, \ntherefore, less able to compete with other people around the world. I \nthink that is a fundamental principle we must not look for.\n\n  The Atlantic Monthly recently had a most marvelous article about \neconomic growth, progress, and technological advancement. Those, it \nsaid, are the greatest ways to fight pollution and to clean our \nenvironment. The areas that are most polluted, the areas that are least \nsafe to live in and where people have the shortest lifespan are the \nundeveloped nations of the world. This article devastated the myth that \nprogress and technological advancement imperil the environment. Indeed, \njust the opposite is the case. Improved technology and improved \nprogress allow us to do more for less and improve our environment.\n  We do know, though, that we are already, as a nation, facing a \ndifficult challenge around the world. We are having a difficult time \nprotecting the jobs of working Americans in the face of lower-wage \nnations that are taking our jobs. Ross Perot, in running for President, \nused the phrase ``a giant sucking sound,'' as he referred to jobs going \noverseas. The fact is, every day we place greater and greater burdens \non the productive businesses in our Nation. At some point, the \ncumulation of those burdens reach a point that makes those businesses \nuncompetitive in the world and can severely damage the economic \nstrength of this Nation. That is why the AFL-CIO and working unions all \nover America are questioning and opposing this treaty, because they see \nit will add one more burden to the United States and one more advantage \nto undeveloped nations who already have these low-wage rates to knock \ndown and take away the productive capacity of American industry. I \nthink it is a valid concern.\n  Second, Mr. President, my simple mind, as I have been here, has \ncaused me to think about how many treaties I see that we are entering \ninto. I have this vision in my mind of Gulliver among the Lilliputians \nlying there with strings tying the giant down where he couldn't get up. \nHundreds of little threads tied him down, and he could not move.\n  We are a great nation, the greatest really on Earth, the greatest \nperhaps in the history of the world. We have great privileges and great \nrequirements as a great nation. We ought not to lightly enter into \ntreaties that bind us, keep us from being able to fully effectuate the \ncapabilities that we have and enter into treaties with other nations, \nsome of whom may not honor those treaties. It is one thing for them to \nsign up. We have seen nations sign up and say they won't use poison gas \nand then they have used poison gas, and nothing is done about it. What \nif we sign a global warming treaty and other nations who sign it do not \ncomply? What will we do then? I suggest we will do nothing. We will \nhonor that treaty, as we always do, because we take those things very \nseriously.\n  Let me make a couple of points. The first thing that I have learned \nin our committee hearing is just how small a part of the problem we are \nfacing is caused from humankind. Look at this chart. It is a remarkable \nchart--CO2 emissions, natural versus man-made.\n  Eighty to eighty-five percent of emissions that cause global warming \nare supposed to be CO2. This is a big problem. 96.9 percent \nof the CO2 emissions on this Earth come from natural causes; \nthings which combustion and other things do not affect. The rest of the \nworld contributes 3.1 percent. The U.S. contribution is less than 1 \npercent, .6 percent. If we eliminated all the production of \nCO2 in the United States, we would only make a small dent in \nthe overall problem of CO2 emissions. That is why people are \nsaying they are not sure what is causing global warming, if we have \nglobal warming at all. I think we have to know that. Those of us who \nare talking about imposing tremendous economic burdens on American \nindustry place us in a position of not being able to remain competitive \nin the world, for a benefit perhaps nonexistent. I think this is a \nmatter we have to consider seriously.\n\n  Do we have global warming? That is a matter that I know is a given--\nit is said. Some 2,000 scientists say it is, but many do not know why. \nThere remains a lot of dispute about global warming. I am not sure what \nthe real situation is. I am certain that there is some slight warming, \nbut I must say that it is not clear.\n  Dr. Christy, a NASA contractor and a professor at the University of \nAlabama in Huntsville, a premier university in scientific research, has \nstudied satellite data for 20 years. He has been able to ascertain from \nthat data what the atmospheric temperatures are around the world, not \njust on one seashore where the gulf stream may affect it or some \nprevailing winds may have affected the temperature temporarily. This is \na global change. He has studied this over 20 years, beginning in 1979.\n  Dr. Christy reached a remarkable conclusion based on his studies of \ntemperature changes. As stated in his testimony before the full Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, the level of the atmosphere \nhe is testing should be warming, according to those who believe in the \nglobal warming models, because global warming caused by the greenhouse \neffect should be an atmospheric effect, but he found the atmosphere has \nnot warmed. This black line reflects the temperature, and it has \nactually gone down during the almost 20 years that he studied.\n  No one has contradicted that evidence. It wasn't evidence that he \nwent out and gathered. It was evidence that he just took from the \nsatellite information that was already available to the public, and he \nmade a comprehensive study of it.\n  What is interesting is, based on his information, we may not have \nglobal\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\nwarming at all. As I said, that information has not been disputed in \nany way.\n  Not many years ago, the prediction was that we were going to show a \n4-degree increase in climate temperature in the next 100 years; 4 \ndegrees growth would be the average increase in temperature in the next \n100 years.\n\n  Now, those numbers have dropped to 2 degrees. The experts have \nreduced those already just in the last few years to 2 degrees.\n  Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, professor of environmental sciences at the \nUniversity of Virginia and senior fellow of environmental studies at \nthe CATO Institute, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on June 26, 1997. This is what he said:\n\n       Critics argued some years ago, as I did, [he said] that \n     this would have to be a dramatic reduction in the forecast of \n     future warming in order to reconcile fact with hypothesis.\n\n  In other words, he realized that the people who were predicting this \n4-degree increase were wrong, and some time ago he predicted they would \nhave to modify this.\n\n       By 1995, [he said] in its second full assessment of climate \n     change, the IPCC [the U.N. panel] admitted the validity of \n     the critics' position [his position]. When increases in \n     greenhouse gases only are taken into account, most climate \n     models produce a greater warming than has been observed to \n     date--\n\n  In other words, we predicted a greater warming than we were actually \nseeing, than nationally has been observed.\n\n       unless closer climate sensitivity to the greenhouse effect \n     is used.\n\n  In other words, we were predicting too high a sensitivity to the \ngreenhouse effect.\n  The IPCC continued:\n\n       There is growing evidence that increases in aerosols are \n     partially counteracting the warming.\n\n  There are many things that are involved there.\n  Dr. Michaels then added this comment. I thought it was very \ninstructive, Mr. President. He said:\n\n       I believe the secular translation of this statement is that \n     either it is not going to warm up as much as was previously \n     forecast or something is hiding the warming. I predict every \n     attempt will be made to demonstrate the latter before \n     admitting that the former is true.\n\n  I thought it was interesting he used those words: ``I believe the \nsecular translation of that document.'' I thought about why he did \nthat, why he used those phrases. He is a scientist, a University of \nVirginia scientist. Why would he say that? I think he is saying that \nbecause he senses in many of the people who are promoting this agenda \nalmost a religious bent, a commitment beyond rationality, a commitment \nbeyond science, a sort of supernatural belief that we have to clean \nthis Earth, and nothing we do as human beings here is healthy, and it \nis all bad. It goes beyond rationality. I tend to agree that we have \nsome things that are said, that I have observed on our committee, that \nwould indicate that that is true.\n  Let me add one more thing before I conclude.\n  The other thing we have learned is that global warming is hard to fix \nobviously if 97 percent of--by far, the No. 1 problem of greenhouse \ngas--CO2, is from natural causes. So we have a problem.\n  We had testimony recently from four scientists before our committee. \nAnd I would like to share with you one of the exchanges that took place \nthere.\n  One professor thought that even though he was supporting the treaty, \nhe thought we should take only modest steps at this time. And he \nbelieved that a significant tax on fuel and carbon products would be \nthe way to do it. That is what he proposed. He said, ``I think we need \nto start moving in that direction.''\n  Dr. Richard S. Lindzen was a member of that panel. He is an Alfred P. \nSloane Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology. When testifying before the Senate Committee on Environment \nand Public Works on July 10, 1997, Dr. Lindzen said, ``I'm saying more \nthan that. I'm saying that Dale''--talking about the professor--``that \nwhat he's proposing, take the scenario that you expect, an increase of \n4 degrees''-- so Dr. Lindzen is saying, OK, let us assume that you are \npredicting a 4-degree increase in temperature in the next century, what \naffect would this tax, a significant tax on oil and all carbon \nproducts, have on our environment?\n\n  This is what he said, ``. . . take the scenario that you expect an \nincrease of 4 degrees, if we imposed his tax, that would knock the \ntemperature down over 100 years to 3.95 degrees. Only five one-\nhundredths of a degree would be affected by a tax to reduce that kind \nof emission of gases.''\n  We are dealing with a very serious problem. I am concerned about \nAmerican economic growth. I want the American people to have good jobs \nand be competitive in the world. I want a healthy environment. I \nbelieve in that. I am willing to invest some money in that. But I am \nnot willing to invest money in a project that will have almost no \neffect and perhaps is dealing with a problem that may not even exist.\n  We need more science, more study before we ask the people of this \nNation to commit their resources into an effort that we could do \nsomewhere else; $10 billion, $100 billion spent on this is $100 billion \nwe could spend on child health care, emergency room admissions, and a \nlot of other things that we desperately need in this country.\n  So, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share those \nthoughts with you. I think we are dealing with an important issue. And \nI hope that the American people will pay close attention to it as we go \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8143-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8144-S8146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MILITARY SERVICE AND HOMOSEXUALITY\n\n  Mr. COATS. I want to take just a few moments to put something in the \nRecord that has not really been high profiled recently but which is I \nbelieve important.\n  I picked up the Washington Post earlier this week and was reading \nthrough the Post, and in there was a small story detailing what the \nPresident's press secretary, Mike McCurry, had to say about an earlier \nstatement made by the White House relative to the law which governs the \nservice in the military of people with homosexual persuasion.\n  The administration had issued the comment in response to some court \nrulings that they thought that the law was working as intended. And \nthen Mr. McCurry, after admitted pressure from the gay rights lobby, \nissued a clarification which changed the response or at least was \nintended to change the response. I quote from the Washington Post \narticle which said:\n\n       After protests from gay rights groups, McCurry yesterday \n     said that contrary to an earlier statement, the Clinton \n     administration does have concerns about how its [so-called] \n     ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy [``so-called'' is my \n     emphasis] on homosexuality is being enforced in the military.\n\n  First of all, let me state that this, the current policy which is \ndescribed by many as a ``don't-ask, don't-tell policy,'' is not \ndescriptive of the particular policy. Therefore, I think it is \nimportant that we understand that what we are dealing with here is a \nlaw enacted by this Congress on a bipartisan basis, signed into law by \nthe current President of the United States, and not subject to \ndifferent interpretations but subject to exactly what is printed in the \nstatute.\n  Mr. McCurry needs to understand and the White House needs to \nunderstand that the prohibition against homosexuals serving in the \nmilitary is a statutory requirement that was passed overwhelmingly by \nCongress and signed into law by the President, his President.\n  The true test of whether the Department of Defense is faithfully \nexecuting the law is whether those who have engaged in or who have a \npropensity to engage in homosexual conduct are being separated from \nmilitary service. That is the statute. That is the intent of the \nstatute. That is the intent of the Congress, as enacted into statutory \nlanguage and signed by the President.\n  And that standard is that those who have engaged in or have a \npropensity to engage in homosexual conduct find themselves at a great \ninconsistency with longstanding military policy and are therefore \neligible and should be separated from military service. That is the law \nof the land.\n  Just a little bit of history.\n  In January 1993, just days after his inauguration, President Clinton \nannounced his intent to reverse the military's longstanding prohibition \nagainst\n\n[[Page S8145]]\n\nhomosexuals serving in the Armed Forces. That decision was uniformly \nopposed by our military commanders, and decisively overturned by the \nCongress after months of careful deliberation.\n  Just to reiterate here, the President, very shortly after taking \noffice, reversed longstanding military policy, and even though the \nPresident serves in his constitutional capacity as Commander in Chief, \nthe leaders of our military unanimously opposed, publicly opposed the \nPresident's position saying that it would undermine morale, undermine \nthe cohesiveness, undermine the very essence of what the military was \ndesigned to do.\n  The Congress' consensus--after very considerable examination, \nhearings and debate--the Congress' consensus on the issue was clear, it \nwas bipartisan, and it was broad. And the President ultimately signed a \nstatutory prohibition against homosexuals serving in the military. He \nsigned that into law.\n  The law clearly sustained the Department of Defense longstanding \npolicy and was based on several key findings of fact by the Congress. \nThose findings of fact are also law. And I would like to repeat those \nso that there is no confusion in this administration about either what \nthe intent of Congress was or what the law was that passed the Congress \nand was signed by the President and now is operative.\n  Let me just state some of these key findings.\n\n       (1) Section 8, article I of the Constitution of the United \n     States commits exclusively to the Congress the powers to \n     raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, and \n     make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and \n     naval forces.\n\n  As the committee report noted:\n\n       The framers of the Constitution expressly vested the powers \n     to raise and regulate military forces [they vested this power \n     and authority] in the Congress.\n\n  The statute goes on to say, with the findings:\n\n       The President may supplement, but [he may] not supersede, \n     the rules established by Congress for the Government and \n     regulation of the Armed Forces.\n       (2) There is no constitutional right to serve in the Armed \n     Forces.\n\n  The committee amplified:\n\n       The primary mission of the Armed Forces is to defend our \n     national interests by preparing for and, when necessary, \n     waging war. . .. Responsibility for the awesome machinery of \n     war requires a degree of training, discipline, and unit \n     cohesion that has no parallel in civilian society. . . . The \n     Armed Forces routinely restrict the opportunities for service \n     on the basis of circumstances such as physical condition, \n     age, sex, parental status, educational background, medical \n     history, and mental attitude. . . . The fundamental precept \n     [is] that the rights of the individual service member must be \n     subordinated to the needs of national defense.\n\n  And so in the instance, in the case where we formed our military, we \ndo not follow the same rules, the same civil rights, the same rights \nthat are available to Americans in other endeavors because of the \nunique function of the military, its unique calling and unique \nrequirements for those individuals to serve in it. The many, many \notherwise appropriate rights exercised by Americans are not rights \ngranted to people who voluntarily agree to serve in the military or \neven if they are involuntarily called up, which we do not do anymore.\n\n       (3) Pursuant to the powers conferred by section 8 of \n     article I of the Constitution of the United States, it lies \n     within the discretion of the Congress to establish \n     qualifications for and conditions of service in the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (4) The primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to prepare \n     for and to prevail in combat should the need arise.\n       (5) The conduct of military operations requires members of \n     the Armed Forces to make extraordinary sacrifices, including \n     the ultimate sacrifice, in order to provide for the common \n     defense.\n       (6) Success in combat requires military units that are \n     characterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and \n     unit cohesion.\n\n  A critical element in this fact finding:\n\n       (7) One of the most critical elements in combat capability \n     is unit cohesion, that is the bonds of trust among individual \n     service members that make the combat effectiveness of a \n     military unit greater than the sum of the combat \n     effectiveness of the individual unit members.\n       (8) Military life is fundamentally different than civilian \n     life in that the extraordinary responsibilities of the Armed \n     Forces, the unique conditions of military service, and the \n     critical role of unit cohesion, require that the military \n     community, while subject to civilian control, exist as a \n     special society; and the military society is characterized by \n     its own laws, rules, customs, and traditions, including \n     numerous restrictions on personal behavior, that would not be \n     acceptable in civilian society.\n       (9) The standards of conduct for members of the Armed \n     Forces regulate a member's social life for 24 hours each day \n     beginning at the moment the member enters military status and \n     not ending until that person is discharged or otherwise \n     separated from the Armed Forces.\n       (10) Those standards of conduct, including the Uniform Code \n     of Military Justice, apply to a member of the Armed Forces at \n     all times that the member has a military status, whether the \n     member is on base or off base, and whether the member is on \n     duty or off duty.\n       (11) The pervasive application of the standards of conduct \n     is necessary because members of the Armed Forces must be \n     ready at all times for worldwide deployment to a combat \n     environment.\n       (12) The worldwide deployment of the United States military \n     forces, the international responsibilities of the United \n     States, and the potential for involvement of the armed forces \n     in actual combat routinely make it necessary for members of \n     the Armed Forces involuntarily to accept living conditions \n     and working conditions that are often spartan, primitive, and \n     characterized by forced intimacy with little or no privacy.\n       (13) The prohibition against homosexual conduct is a \n     longstanding element of military law that continues to be \n     necessary in the unique circumstances of military service.\n       (14) The Armed Forces must maintain personnel policies that \n     exclude persons whose presence in the Armed Forces would \n     create an unacceptable risk to the Armed Forces' high \n     standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit \n     cohesion that are the essence of military capability.\n       (15) The presence in the Armed Forces of persons who \n     demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual \n     acts would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards \n     of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that \n     are the essence of military capability.\n\n  These are the facts as determined by the Senate Armed Forces \nCommittee, by the Congress, both the House and the Senate, certified by \nus, written into law, signed into law by the President of the United \nStates. These findings are as operative today as they were when they \nwere passed. They are not subject to interpretation by the President. \nThey are not subject to modification by the administration.\n  The law of the land is clear: Homosexuals may not serve in the \nmilitary. That is the law of the land. That is not the opinion of this \nSenator from Indiana. That is not subject to the opinion of the \nPresident's press secretary or people in the administration. It is the \nlaw of the land. The military has always defined, and continues to \ndefine, a homosexual as one who is engaged in or has a propensity to \nengage in homosexual conduct. Unfortunately, while the law speaks \nclearly, its popular title, ``don't ask, don't tell,'' is often \nconfusing to the press and the public. It seems to imply that a \nhomosexual may serve in the military as long as he or she is discrete. \nThis is simply not the case and it misinterprets the law.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee report language is clear about \nthe intent of the law, and again I quote:\n\n       It would be irrational to develop military personnel \n     policies on the basis that all gays and lesbians will remain \n     celibate or that they will not be sexually attracted to \n     others.\n\n  Jamie Gorelick, then general counsel to the Department of Defense, \ntestified:\n\n       The military is not required to take the risk that you will \n     not engage in the act.\n\n  At a later hearing, she stated further:\n\n       When someone makes a statement, it is reasonable to \n     conclude that they will act, and the military is not required \n     to take the risk that someone will not restrain a propensity.\n\n  I want to remind the White House that its constitutional obligation \nis to enforce the law of the land. After a prolonged national debate on \nthe question of homosexuals serving in the military, the President's \nposition failed. Recognizing that defeat, he signed the National \nDefense Authorization Act of 1994 into law. In that act is the language \nnow codified into law that clearly states the law of the land relative \nto homosexuals serving in the military. It is the obligation of the \nDepartment of Defense to separate those who engaged in, or have a \npropensity to engage in, homosexual conduct in the Armed Forces. Now, \nif the President wishes to reopen this debate, which I don't believe he \ndoes, he can look at modifying this law. But until that time, the \nadministration has a constitutional duty\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\nto uphold that law, regardless of what pressure is politically applied \nupon the administration by any one group or number of groups or any one \nindividual or group of individuals.\n  So I wanted to put this in the Record so there was no \nmisunderstanding about what the Congress had done, what the President \nhad signed into law, and what the current law of the land is. This was \nthe result of extensive--perhaps some of the most extensive--hearings \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee has ever held. There were hundreds \nof witnesses, thousands of pages of testimony, site visits, testimony \nfrom people on all sides of the issue, representing every perspective. \nThis was a carefully fashioned conclusion that was presented, approved \nby the committee, presented to the Congress and overwhelmingly approved \nby the Congress on a bipartisan basis, sent to the White House and \nsigned into law by the President.\n  I think it would behoove the President and the people speaking for \nhim to understand clearly what this law is and to fulfill their \nconstitutional responsibilities to uphold the law and not make vague \nclarifications of statements and policies simply because one or more \nparticular group protested their particular position on the issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8144-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8146-S8147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GLACIER BAY MANAGEMENT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have one more item, relating to \nlegislation addressing several important aspects of the administration \nand management of Glacier Bay National Park in my State of Alaska.\n  As many of you know, Glacier Bay National Park, west of Juneau in \nsoutheastern Alaska, has been named as the No. 1 national park in our \ncountry's National Park System. It is a unique tourist destination. It \ncan only really be reached by cruise ship. The season runs roughly from \nMemorial Day to Labor Day, the season for the cruise ships that visit \nsoutheastern Alaska.\n  For the most part, these are the same ships that traverse the \nCaribbean in the wintertime, then move to Vancouver, BC, in order to \nsail to Alaska in the summer. There are probably 30 ships. I believe \nthe number of tourists who visit Alaska by cruise ship is somewhere in \nthe area of 600,000 in that short 90-day period.\n  Because of the popularity of this unique tourist destination, the \nlegislation I have introduced would encourage the continuation of the \nPark Service's ongoing efforts to work with concession operators to try \nto improve visitor services, as well as deal fairly and finally with \nthe longstanding dispute over the status of the commercial and \nsubsistence fishing that has gone on in that park from time immemorial.\n  The footprint that any of these activities leaves in this park is \npretty insignificant in relationship to other parks, because the park \nis seen, for the most part, by visitors on a cruise ship. You might get \nan occasional candy wrapper blown overboard, but the ships are very \ngood at keeping their impact to a minimum. The point is, compared to \nimpressions left in other national parks by visitors, the footprint \nleft by visitors who come to the park on a ship--and never get off--is \nextremely small. That's part of what makes the park so unique--access \nby cruise ship.\n  In any event, this bill reflects the progress of several years of \ndiscussion with local interests and the Park Service. The efforts, I \nthink, are positive. But we have been hampered from achieving consensus \nby some groups who seem to be unwilling to compromise for reasons we \ncan only guess at--perhaps they don't want to see other visitors during \nthat short summer season.\n  Insofar as possible, this bill represents an attempt to stake out \nsome reasonable, responsible middle ground that would respect the \nwishes of all concerned. The issue of commercial fishing is one where, \nhistorically, fishermen have plied the waters of Glacier Bay and the \nouter coast, the Gulf of Alaska area now included in the park, for over \n100 years. Local Native villagers, the Huna Tlingit people, have been \ndoing so for thousands of years. At no time have their activities \ndamaged the park or its resources, nor have they harmed the area's wild \nand scenic qualities in any way. Their presence has provided a colorful \nbackdrop to the mystique of the park, as a matter of fact. This simple \nfact I don't think can be overemphasized.\n  To put it another way, commercial fishing and local villagers have \ncontinually fished in Glacier Bay since long before it became a park or \na monument. The fact that we value it so highly today is proof that \nthey have not had an adverse impact on the species in the bay. \nUnfortunately, some interests do not seem to be concerned about \nfairness, or the obligation to the Native people of Alaska, and would \nlike to see fishing and gathering banned, no matter how environmentally \nbenign or how critical to the local livelihoods it may be.\n  On subsistence, this bill corrects inconsistencies in the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act, known as ANILCA. Villagers \nliving near Glacier Bay, whose ancestors have used the bay continually \nfor at least 9,000 years, must be allowed to continue to use the bay's \nresources to feed their families, to fish for halibut, salmon, crabs, \ncollect clams, seaweeds, berries, and other foods that are part of \ntheir traditional culture.\n  Let me emphasize, we are talking about a relative handful of \nfamilies--most from the local Native village of Hoonah, which has a \npopulation of about 900 or so, and a few people from other nearby \ncommunities such as Elfin Cove, Gustavus, and Pelican. We are not \ntalking about thousands of people. These Alaskans do not have the \nconvenience of supermarkets or strip malls. They deserve consideration \nand respect. They deserve to have their historic use recognized and \nprovided for by this Congress.\n\n  My bill also addresses commercial fishing in the park. For \ngenerations, commercial fishermen caught salmon, halibut and crabs in \nGlacier Bay and have fished the rich grounds of the outside coast as \nwell. And there is no biological reason, none whatsoever, for \nrestricting commercial fishing activity anywhere in the park. The \nfishery resources are healthy, they are diverse, they are closely \nmonitored by the State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and they \nare very carefully regulated. It should also be noted that, of the \npark's approximately 3 million acres of marine waters, only about \n500,000 are productive enough to warrant real, significant interest.\n  There are few anadromous streams in the park--that's streams where \nthe salmon go up and spawn--because most of the fresh water that comes \ndown comes down from the glaciers and there is simply no place for the \nsalmon to spawn.\n  In any event, the fisheries are restricted both as to method as in \nthe number of participants, and are carefully managed and controlled to \nassure continued abundance. There is nothing in the bill and there is \nno desire by the fishing industry to change these controls or increase \nthe level of this sustainable activity. Alaska is a very careful \nsteward of its resources. Commercial fishing does not harm the \nenvironment in any way. In spite of what you hear, Alaska fisheries are \nin very good shape. We have had record runs 8 of the last 11 years. \nUnder Federal management, things got so bad there was one year when we \nonly took 25 million salmon, but when we became a State that began \nturning around. I think last year we put up 218 million. That's because \nwe don't open our season until we have had adequate escapement, that \nis, enough fish to go up the streams to spawn so that we are guaranteed \nrenewability of the resource.\n  So, in the grand scheme of things, and recognizing consideration of \nthe Nation's economy, these fisheries are small potatoes. But to the \nfishermen, the natives who depend upon them, to the families of small \nremote communities in which they live, these fisheries are of the \nutmost importance. They are harm free. And those who partake in them \ndeserve this Government's help, not the destruction of their simple \nlifestyle.\n  This bill authorizes traditional fishing throughout the park for \nsubsistence users as well as historical commercial activities. However, \nbecause there are special, sensitive areas inside Glacier Bay itself, \nit also designates the waters inside the bay as a special\n\n[[Page S8147]]\n\nreserve, in which a joint team of Federal and State scientists will \nmake recommendations on where fishing should occur and at what level.\n  A further special provision is also included in one area where there \nis significant potential for conflict between fishermen and certain \nlimited nonmotorized uses, such as kayaking, during the brief 3-month \nsummer period.\n  This area is in the Beardslee Islands, near the entrance of the bay. \nUnder this bill, the only commercial fishing that would be allowed in \nthe Beardslees would be crab fishing, and that only in a very small \narea, by a very small number of people who historically are dependent \non this fishing--less than a dozen people. This would only include \npeople who can show both a significant history of participation and a \nreal dependence on that fishery for their livelihoods. This privilege \ncould be transferred to one successor, when the original fisherman \nretires, but will cease after that. And at any point the Park Service \ncould eliminate all fishing in the Beardslees with a fair payment to \nthe individual fisherman.\n  The reason for such a special rule in the Beardslees is simply that \nthese fishermen have no other option than fishing in the Beardslees, \ndue to the small size of their vessels and their reliance on this one \nfishery, and a few other factors.\n  So this bill will not contribute to any increase in fishing. In fact, \nover time the opposite may occur. It will simply provide for the \nscientifically sound continuation of an environmentally benign \nactivity. Finally, I think it's important also to note that the \ncontinuation of both subsistence and commercial fishing enjoys wide \nsupport from local residents of Southeastern Alaska, including \nenvironmental groups such as the Southeastern Alaska Conservation \nCouncil.\n  I look to my colleagues for support on the merits of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I see no other Senators in the Chamber. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8146-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we had a very unfortunate story appear \nin the Washington Post this morning by Helen Dewar.\n  The first paragraph:\n\n       President Clinton had ``some choice words'' about the pace \n     of Senate action on administration nominations during a \n     Wednesday night meeting with Senate Democrats.\n\n  And then it quotes our distinguished minority leader:\n\n       Daschle estimated there are 30 ambassadorial nominations \n     awaiting action for countries that, according to a Senate \n     list, include Britain, France, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia \n     and, as of Tuesday, Mexico.\n\n  This is ill-placed and irresponsible criticism and does not serve the \nefficient management of these nominations. I read the article while I \nwas conducting a hearing that we had hurried to deal with the \nnomination of the Ambassadors for Guyana and Paraguay. I have just left \na meeting with the potential nominee for Ambassador to France, and I \nspent the better part of the last month doing everything we might do to \nget our Ambassador to Canada, which, I might add, has been without an \nambassador for over a year and a half. We just received the nomination \nfor that Ambassador on July 2--July 2--of this year. The vacancy began \nin April 1996--Canada. And there have been extended vacancies in \nGermany, Moscow, et cetera.\n  To clarify, this year, we have had 56 nominations received by the \nForeign Relations Committee; 14 have been confirmed, 9 are pending on \nthe Executive Calendar; 33 are pending in the committee. That sounds \nlike a lot. But the issue is, 26 of the 44 we have just received in the \nlast month. I repeat, there are 44 pending in the committee; 26 of them \nwe have just gotten.\n  The problem here is not in the Senate, nor is it in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. The problem with ambassadorial nominations is at \nthe other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I point out that Tokyo has been vacant since December, and we have no \nnominee. South Korea has been vacant since December, and we have no \nnominee. These are not just incidental relationships, I might add. We \nare talking about Japan and South Korea.\n  So, Mr. President, I think those were unfortunate words, and they \npaint an improper and inappropriate picture, and they do not help \nanything. I assume they are just ill-informed. But when you are going \nto make accusations of this kind, and you are the President of the \nUnited States, the word travels far. I think it would be more prudent \nto have your own description of the condition before you start hurling \nspears, because this kind of thing only confuses the process and makes \nthe work of both the Senate and the administration much more \ncomplicated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8147-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8147-S8149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMBASSADORIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, partisan politics, I guess, is a game like \nfootball, baseball, or checkers, and that game has, no doubt, been \nplayed in the Senate for as long as there has been a Senate. In it, you \nwin some, you lose some, and, as the saying goes, some are rained out. \nIt has been suggested from time to time that maybe a time or two I have \nplayed a little bit of it myself, and I plead nolo contendere to the \nsuggestion.\n  But the game, it seems to me, that the distinguished minority leader, \nMr. Daschle, has been playing of late has sometimes been marked by a \nrather interesting degree of misstatements of fact--unintentional, I'm \nsure--and curious conclusions. That, too, has not been unknown \nheretofore in the history of the Senate. And I do not suggest that the \nminority leader's misstatements or insinuations are deliberate, and I \nam willing to assume that his errors are accidental and unintentional.\n  Just the same, my observations this afternoon are based on my \nincredulous reaction early this morning when I read an article in the \nWashington Post, page A21, under a headline reading ``Confirmation \nProcess Frustrates President.'' That was, of course, Mr. Clinton, with \nwhom Senator Daschle says he met this past Wednesday night. It \nindicates that Senator Daschle confided to the Washington Post's very \ncompetent reporter, Helen Dewar, that--and I quote from Ms. Dewar's \nstory--``The President . . . expressed probably the highest level of \nexasperation I've heard him express on the subject, Daschle said, \nmaking clear that he (Senator Daschle) shares Clinton's frustration.''\n  Further, according to Ms. Dewar's report, ``[Senator] Daschle \nestimated that there are 30 ambassadorial nominations awaiting action \nfor countries that, according to a Senate list, include Britain, \nFrance, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia, and, as of Tuesday, Mexico.''\n  Well, Mr. President, if Mr. Clinton and Mr. Daschle are suffering \ntheir ``highest levels of exasperation,'' and if the President uttered \nthe ``choice words'' attributed to him by Senator Daschle regarding the \nwork of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, then I suggest that \nboth gentlemen dismount their high horses, examine the true facts, and \ncorrect their joint misstatements about the excellent work of the \nForeign Relations Committee, which I have the honor of serving as \nchairman, with Senator Joe Biden as the ranking member.\n  What the President is purported to have implied--and Mr. Daschle says \nhe agrees with it--is nonsense, I say respectfully; it is nonsense \nregarding the work and cooperation of the staff of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, of which Adm. ``Bud'' Nance is the Chief of Staff. \nBud Nance is among the top chiefs of staff ever to serve the Senate's \ncommittees, and I believe Mr. Clinton's State Department will join\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\nme in that assessment of the committee staff members, both majority and \nminority.\n  Now, let's look at some specific things and respond to the President \nwith what the actual facts are.\n  First, Thomas Pickering left the position of Ambassador to Russia on \nNovember 1, 1996. The Foreign Relations Committee received the \nnomination of James Collins to succeed Tom Pickering 7 months later, on \nJune 2, 1997. Let me just remind anybody who may be interested that \nRussia is selling sophisticated weaponry to terrorist states, such as \nIran, and Russia barely maintains control of its 20,000 warhead nuclear \narsenal. Now, by Mr. Clinton's own choice, the position of Ambassador \nto Russia went vacant for 7 months. We didn't get a piece of paper from \nthe White House. When we did get the nomination, we expedited the \nhearing process for this nomination, and we are prepared to send it to \nthe full Senate--that is, the nomination of James Collins --next week.\n  Second, Charles Redman left the position of Ambassador to Germany on \nJune 20, 1996, over a year ago. The Foreign Relations Committee \nreceived the nomination of John Kornblum for this position on May 22 of \nthis year, 1997. Now, Mr. President, Germany is the most powerful \ncountry in Europe and is central to virtually every decision made by \nour European allies. By the White House's own choice, don't you see, \nthe position of Ambassador to Germany was vacant for almost a full \nyear. The committee scheduled a hearing after finally getting the \npapers on the nomination of Mr. Kornblum, and we are prepared to send \nthe nomination to the Senate next week.\n  Third, John Menzies left the position of Ambassador to Bosnia in \nDecember 1996. The Foreign Relations Committee received the nomination \nof Richard Kauzlarich on July 8, 1997, just a couple of weeks ago. Now, \nit was the White House's choice that the position of Ambassador to \nBosnia was vacant for more than 8 months before we got a scrap of paper \nfrom the White House in the Foreign Relations Committee. Of course, \nthousands of American soldiers have been kept in Bosnia for 8 months, \nbut for 8 months the White House has delayed sending the nomination of \nthe successor, Mr. Kauzlarich. The committee, again, has scheduled a \nhearing to consider this nomination. We are prepared to send it to the \nSenate next week.\n\n  Fourth, James Blanchard left the position of Ambassador to Canada in \nApril 1996, over a year ago. The Foreign Relations Committee received \nthe nomination of Gordon Griffin on June 26, 1997. The Foreign \nRelations Committee held a hearing on July 15, after we had gotten all \nof the papers prepared, and reported his nomination to the full Senate \non July 17, where it is pending on the Executive Calendar of the \nSenate. The United States is engaged in foreign policy and trade \ndisputes with Canada, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to Cuba, and \nthe position to Ambassador to Canada was vacant--not the responsibility \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, but of the White House--the White \nHouse--for more than a year.\n  Fifth, the post of United States Ambassador to France has been vacant \nsince the death of Ambassador Pamela Harriman. She died on February 5 \nof this year. And then, after that, there was a month-long public \nbattle between several of President Clinton's political supporters and \na career Foreign Service officer who wanted the post, and the President \nfinally selected one of the substantial donors to the Democratic Party \nfor this position. Now, that is not unusual. The point is that all this \ntime elapsed. It was not the Foreign Relations Committee staff's fault. \nIt was the White House's fault. Mr. Daschle is bound to have known \nthat.\n  Let me say that the French leaders have opposed the United States on \nalmost every foreign policy decision regarding United States-European \nrelations, but by President Clinton's choice, the position of \nAmbassador to France, nevertheless, was vacant for just about 6 months.\n  The committee again has scheduled a hearing to consider the \nnomination next Tuesday, less than a week after the papers got up to us \nfrom the White House. So who is delaying all of these nominations, Mr. \nPresident? I think the facts speak for themselves.\n  Then there is the nomination of Philip Lader. I believe it came on \nJuly 22, just a few days ago. The committee has immediately scheduled a \nhearing for Mr. Lader for next Tuesday, less than a week after \nreceiving this nomination.\n  Seventh, the President has yet to name ambassadors for Japan and \nSouth Korea. Now, these Embassies have been minus ambassadors since the \nend of last year, nearly 8 months--not the fault of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, not the fault of the Senate, not the fault of \nanybody in the Senate, but the White House.\n  Let me reiterate and emphasize that there has been a high degree of \ncooperation between the State Department and the Senators who serve on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and, I might add, between the excellent \nstaff of the committee and the State Department staff. I think that the \ncooperation between the various entities has been remarkable and \nunheard of for several years prior to this year and last year. In fact, \nwe have done our best to work with and consult with the White House.\n  Therefore, statements made by Senator Daschle are not acceptable. To \nthe extent that the President has stated or has implied that any lag in \nthe ambassadorial nomination process is the fault of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, I have to say, no, sir; you are wrong.\n  Some time back the White House publicly identified a possible--a \npossible--nomination about which I had and still have a problem. I have \ntried to be as candid and up front about my position regarding that \nnomination since long before the nomination was made. When?

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that we mark the \npassing of William Brennan, who served so ably on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, the New Jersey \njudge soon rose to a position of intellectual leadership on the Court. \nEven his critics acknowledge that he has exercised a fundamental \ninfluence on the direction of American jurisprudence. He wrote almost \n1,400 opinions and helped shape countless others, providing guidance on \nissues from civil liberties, race relations and privacy to criminal \njustice, economic fairness, and governmental power.\n  Justice Brennan believed deeply that law must protect human dignity \nand that the Founding Fathers recognized that principle when they \ndrafted our Constitution. He saw the Constitution as a guarantee that \nour fundamental rights cannot be diminished or denied simply because \nthat is the will of the majority.\n  During his 34 years on the Court, Justice Brennan did not waiver in \nhis convictions, speaking out in his opinions and in public on the most \nimportant moral issues of the day. His deeply held beliefs and \ncarefully crafted judicial opinions have had a profound influence upon \nus all.\n  Along with his distinction as a jurist, Justice Brennan was well \nknown for his warmth and good humor, and he had friends from all parts \nof the political spectrum. I know that I speak for all of us in saying \nthat he will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8149-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8149-S8150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO JUSTICE WILLIAM J. BRENNAN, JR.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is with a sad and heavy heart that \nI rise to pay tribute to a great American and New Jerseyan, Justice \nWilliam J. Brennan, Jr., who passed away yesterday at age 91. The \nthoughts and prayers of all the people of our State and country are \nwith his wife Mary, his three children William J., III, Hugh, and \nNancy, as well as his seven grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, during nearly 34 years on the Supreme Court, Justice \nBrennan had an enormous impact on this Nation's constitutional \njurisprudence. Justice Brennan was a consistent champion of freedom of \nexpression, of strict separation of church and state, and of equality \nfor the poor, racial minorities, and women. In fact, he was a life-long \ndefender of the freedoms of all Americans.\n  William Brennan's life was truly the epitome of the American Dream. \nHe was born in Newark, NJ, on April 25, 1906, the second oldest of the \neight children of an Irish immigrant who started as a laborer but rose \nthrough the ranks to become an important labor leader and the city's \ncommissioner of public safety. ``Everything I am,'' the justice later \nwrote, ``I am because of my father.''\n  He was an outstanding student at Barringer High School in Newark. He \nthen went on to study at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton \nSchool of Finance and Commerce. He was graduated with honors and won a \nscholarship to the Harvard Law School, from which he received a degree \nin 1931.\n  Upon graduation, Bill Brennan embarked upon a successful and \ndistinguished career in private legal practice. He later served his \ncountry by entering active military service in 1942, eventually \nbecoming a colonel and troubleshooter for Army procurement.\n  After returning from the war, he quickly emerged as a leader of the \nNew Jersey bar, particularly his involvement in New Jersey's court \nreform movement under a nationally renowned Chief Justice Arthur \nVanderbilt. His talents were widely recognized in the legal community, \nleading to his appointment to the New Jersey trial bench, from which he \nrapidly ascended to the State supreme court.\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\n  Mr. President, it was during this tenure on the New Jersey court that \nJustice Brennan first gained national attention. He was one of the \nfirst public figures to take on the infamous Senator Joseph McCarthy \nand the excesses of the McCarthy-era.\n  Specifically, in one famous speech at the Monmouth County Rotary \nClub, he boldly referred to certain congressional inquiries as modern \ncounterparts to the Salem witch trials, sentiments very much ahead of \nhis time.\n  After 8 years as a State judge, 4 on the State supreme court, Bill \nBrennan was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 to be \nan Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Justice \nBrennan served on the Nation's highest court for 34 years before poor \nhealth forced him, at age 84, to retire in 1990. His tenure spanned \nthose of eight Presidents. In the High Court's history, only William O. \nDouglas wrote more opinions.\n  In fact, Justice Brennan's own confirmation as an Associate Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court was opposed by some because of views that he \nhad expressed about McCarthyism--the speeches that later caused Senator \nMcCarthy to be the lone dissenting vote to President Eisenhower's \nnomination of Brennan to our Nation's High Court.\n  Mr. President, it is not his remarkable life or long tenure on the \nbench that made William Brennan a towering figure in our Nation's \nhistory. Rather, his true legacy is the preservation and expansion of \nthe individual rights all Americans enjoy today. He was, in short, our \ncountry's strongest champion of the individual.\n  A recent survey of 96 scholars listed Justice Brennan as fifth in the \nlist of all-time great Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Ahead of him \nranked only John Marshall, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Earl Warren, and \nLouis Brandeis.\n  Justice Brennan crafted many landmark decisions associated with the \nWarren Court of the late 1950's and 1960's. His ruling led to the one-\nperson, one-vote principle of political reapportionment, and empowered \neveryday citizens to use the courts to fight city hall.\n  In more than 1,200 opinions, Justice Brennan defined obscenity and \nbroadened the rights of any person--including the poor, mentally \nhandicapped, or imprisoned--to seek redress against the Government \nthrough the courts. He also gave news organizations first amendment \nprotections in libel lawsuits.\n  During the Berger and Rehnquist years, he continued to champion the \nBill of Rights and the 14th amendment. In all of his opinions and \ndissents, liberty and equality were his bywords.\n  Historian David Halberstam described the source of Justice Brennan's \ngreatness. William Brennan, he wrote, never forgot where he came from. \nHe never forgot his immigrant father shoveling coal for a living, \ncourageously joining a union in an era when to do so could cost a man \nhis livelihood, if not his life. Brennan grew up on a house that knew \nthe meaning of layoffs and discrimination. He instinctively identified \nwith the disadvantaged and the dispossessed.\n  Justice Brennan himself revealed the secret of his unfailing \nhumanity, compassion and passion for individual freedom. He wrote that \nhe always focused on the people behind the cases, always aware that the \ncase before the Court was there because of ``a person who cried out for \nnothing more than common human dignity. In each case, our Constitution \nintervened to provide the cloak of dignity.''\n  Mr. President, through it all, Justice Brennan remained universally \nliked, even adored, by colleagues, law clerks, Court personnel, and \nvirtually everyone who came in contact with him. He was always \ndescribed as warm, gracious, and utterly without pretense.\n  I had the privilege and the honor to get to know Bill Brennan on a \npersonal level. Although it was late in his tenure on the bench, he was \nremarkably alert, witty and warm, and I greatly enjoyed our \nconversations.\n  Mr. President, Bill Brennan's character, personality, and intellect \nwere perfectly matched, each so unique so as to be totally \nunforgettable.\n  Despite the brevity of our personal relationship, every meeting that \nwe had--perhaps a half-dozen in all--left me feeling like I had just \nseen a lifelong friend.\n  He stood for so much that he helped me stand taller for those I \nserve. Knowing him was one of my life's most treasured experiences. I \ndeeply regret that our paths will not cross again.\n  In a tribute to Justice Brennan, his colleague Justice Byron White \nonce remembered that Bill Brennan's creed was that a judge should \nproceed with ``a sparkling vision of the supremacy of the human dignity \nof every individual.''\n  Mr. President, that majestic statement is a fitting tribute to the \nlife and work of Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8149-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8150-S8151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUPPORT THE ARMS TRANSFERS CODE OF CONDUCT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill introduced \njust yesterday by Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, the code of conduct \non arms transfers.\n  Many of our colleagues will recall that Senator Hatfield was the \nleader on this issue prior to his retirement last year. He introduced \nthis bill as S. 1677 in the 103d Congress and S. 326 in the 104th \nCongress. I cosponsored both bills, and I was pleased to offer the code \nof conduct as an amendment to last year's foreign operations \nappropriations bill.\n  I am delighted that the Senator from Massachusetts is showing his \nusual leadership on arms control issues by authoring this bill in this \nCongress.\n  This is a particularly timely effort because the code of conduct is a \npart of the version of the State Department authorization bill approved \nby the House of Representatives, a bill that is now in conference \nbetween the House and the Senate. I hope that by introducing this bill \nwe will encourage our Senate colleagues on the conference committee to \nsupport the House provision.\n\n\n                 THE United States LEADS IN ARMS SALES\n\n  This bill is also particularly timely because the end of the cold war \nhas propelled the United States to the rank of the world's leading arms \nsupplier.\n  During the last decade, U.S. arms sales have taken off. We now \ndeliver 56 percent of all the world's arms exports, according to the \nArms Control and Disarmament Agency. And in 1994 the United States \nsupplied 43 percent of all weapons sold to the developing world --the \ncountries who can least afford arms. We ranked first in arms shipments \nto developing nations from 1992 to 1995.\n  These countries have urgent domestic challenges, such as advancing \npublic health, controlling disease, and achieving food self-\nsufficiency. Yet we are catering to their governments' appetite for the \nlatest in high-technology weaponry.\n\n\n                       OUR CUSTOMERS ARE UNSAVORY\n\n  It is bad enough that these governments have better things to do with \ntheir money than to buy American weapons. Still worse is what these \ngovernments do with our weapons once they receive them.\n  According to the State Department's own human rights reports, more \nthan 75 percent of U.S. arms sales in 1993 went to governments that \nwere undemocratic. And we supply aid to 72 percent of the countries \nthat the State Department lists as authoritarian governments with \nserious human rights abuses.\n  Recent history tells a disturbing story of American weapons feeding \nethnic conflict and instability around the globe. Of 48 ethnic \nconflicts underway in 1993, 39 involved forces that had U.S. weaponry. \nIndonesia used American weapons to occupy East Timor illegally, and \nTurkey used F-16 fighters in bombing raids against Kurdish rebels.\n  Countries that have cracked down on domestic dissent using U.S. arms \ninclude Thailand, Indonesia and Guatemala.\n  We are literally giving repressive regimes the means by which they \nmaintain themselves in power. We must break ourselves of this habit.\n\n\n                  THEY RESELL THE WEAPONS WE GIVE THEM\n\n  And what if these unsavory customers resell the weapons we send them? \nThe answer is disturbing. We have too little effective control over \nwhat happens to our weapons once they leave our hands. The classic \nexample of this is the Stinger missile, a highly portable, shoulder-\nlaunched anti-aircraft missile.\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n\n  Stingers are actually very available on the international arms \nmarket. We sent about 1,000 Stingers to Afghan rebels during the \n1980's. However, since the departure of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, \nthe Afghan factions have been using Stingers to raise money and barter \nfor other weapons for their civil war.\n  The CIA was so alarmed by this trend that it began a program to buy \nStingers back from the Afghan rebels. But this program met with limited \nsuccess, since the result was that the price that Stingers could \ncommand on the international arms market doubled or trebled.\n  And the CIA's efforts came too late. Media reports suggest that Iran, \nLibya, and North Korea now have Stinger missiles. These are the rogue \nstates that pose the most immediate threat to our security and that of \nour allies.\n\n\n                     OUR ARMS BOOMERANG AGAINST US\n\n  Mr. President, if those Stingers are ever used against us, the \nmissiles we shipped abroad will have come full circle. It will be \nanother example of what is known as the arms trade boomerang, the \ntragic pattern of our troops facing enemies armed with U.S. weapons and \ntechnology.\n  The last four times American troops have seen significant combat--in \nPanama, Iraq, Somalia, and Haiti--our weapons and military know-how \nboomeranged against us.\n  For example, in the 5 years before our occupation of Panama to bring \ndruglord Manuel Noriega back to the United States for trial, the United \nStates accounted for 44 percent of Panama's arms imports. From 1950 \nthrough 1987, we also trained 6,700 Panamanian military officers under \nthe Pentagon's International Military Education and Training Program.\n  Worse than the Panama example is the fact that international arms \nmerchants sold Iraq $400 million in United States-designed cluster \nbombs plus our technology for manufacturing howitzers. We apparently \nintended the cluster bombs to be used against Iranian ``human wave'' \nattacks during the Iran-Iraq war. Fortunately, our control of the \nairspace over Iraq during the Persian Gulf war meant that these cluster \nbombs were never used against American troops.\n  We sold Somalia 4,800 M-16 rifles, 84 106-millimeter recoilless \nrifles, 24 machine guns, 75 81-millimeter mortars, and land mines--the \nkind of weapons that Mohammed Farah Aideed's technicals would later use \nto kill 23 American soldiers. From 1985 to 1989, we sold Somalia 31 \npercent of its arms imports.\n  And as for Haiti, where we had the good fortune not to suffer major \ncasualties, we had armed and trained Haiti's military. William Hartung \nof the World Policy Institute states that, ``Total US arms deliveries \nto Haiti . . . from 1987 to 1991 exceeded 25 percent of total Haitian \narms imports.'' The Duvalier regime faced no external threat, and we \nhad no business arming such a hated dictatorship. Yet we did it anyway.\n  Mr. President, that is why we need the arms transfers code of \nconduct. We need to exercise self-restraint in the international arms \nbazaar.\n\n\n                 CODE OF CONDUCT A COMMONSENSE APPROACH\n\n  The Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers Act is a commonsense approach \nto conventional arms control. It aims to block the arms trade \nboomerang, to prevent us from arming the wrong governments and to put a \nlid on ethnic conflict and instability.\n  In brief, the code would establish criteria for governments to be \neligible for U.S. military assistance or arms transfers. To be \neligible, a government must:\n  First, promote democracy through fair and free elections, civilian \ncontrol of the military, the rule of law, freedom of speech and of the \npress, and strong civil society;\n  Second, respect human rights by not engaging in gross violations of \ninternationally recognized human rights;\n  Third, observe international borders, and not be engaged in armed \nagression in violation of international law; and\n  Fourth, participate in the U.N. conventional arms registry, which \nprovides transparency to the world arms market by listing major arms \nsales and transfers.\n  There are two exemptions for countries that do not meet these \ncriteria. First, the President could determine that an emergency \nexists, and that it is vital in the emergency to provide arms and \nmilitary aid to a government that does not meet all of the above \ncriteria. This determination would waive the act's restrictions and \nenable the arms shipment or military aid to go forward.\n  Alternatively, the President could request an exemption from the \nCongress, certifying that it is in national interest of the United \nStates to provide arms or military aid to a government that does not \nmeet all of the above criteria. That exemption would take effect unless \nthe Congress passes a law disapproving the request.\n  I believe that these two exemptions--the emergency waiver and the \nnational security waiver--provide the President with appropriate \nflexibility.\n\n\n                       AMERICAN LEADERSHIP NEEDED\n\n  Lastly, I would note that the code of conduct concept is an \ninternational effort that requires American leadership. The worldwide \neffort to control arms sales needs a positive sign from the U.S. Senate \nin order to come to fruition.\n  The newly elected Labor government in the United Kingdom has taken \nthe first step by announcing on May 22 its intent to restrict arms \nsales. However, Britain's arms manufacturers are crying foul, because \nno other country has yet followed Britain's lead. British defense firms \nare losing out in the international arms market because Britain is out \nin front on this issue. We need to stand shoulder to shoulder with the \nUnited Kingdom on this critical issue.\n  It is important to note that if the U.S. Congress were to approve the \ncode, the European Union would likely follow. The United States and the \nEuropean Union between them account for at least 75 percent of the \ninternational arms market each year. Codes of conduct for American and \nEuropean arms sales would go far toward establishing a worldwide \nconventional arms sales regime.\n  That is what Oscar Arias, Elie Wiesel, the Dalai Lama, and 12 other \nNobel Peace Prize winners are working towards. A number of delegations \nto the United Nations, Germany's foremost among them, have been working \ntoward a U.N. General Assembly vote on a code of conduct. This is an \ninternational campaign, but it needs American leadership to succeed.\n  Last year the Senator from Massachusetts offered a second-degree \namendment to my Code of Conduct amendment making this very point. The \ncode of conduct must be a multilateral effort for it to succeed. \nOtherwise, our defense firms will simply see foreign defense \ncontractors grab our market share.\n\n\n               LET US SET A STANDARD THE WORLD CAN FOLLOW\n\n  In summary, I would like to congratulate the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his leadership on this matter. With his usual vision \non arms control matters, has grasped a fundamental point. We must try \nto extend the concept of arms control to the international conventional \narms market. The code of conduct is the right legislation for a world \nthat has seen the end of the cold war.\n  Passing the code of conduct bill will help us save taxpayer dollars, \nprotect the lives of American troops, prevent American weapons from \ngoing to repressive regimes, and safeguard innocent civilians from \nmilitary violence.\n  Let us set a standard the world can follow. Let us show the European \nUnion that we can exercise restraint--that we will not sell \nconventional arms to any government that asks for them. Once America \nleads, the nations will follow--to a safer world, for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8150-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8151-S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend section 353 of the Public Health Service Act \nto exempt physician office laboratories from the clinical laboratories \nrequirements of that section; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n       THE CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat is critically needed to reduce the regulatory burdens on our \ndoctor's offices today.\n  In 1988, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act as a \nreaction to reports about laboratories that inaccurately analyzed PAP \nsmears. CLIA 1988 was intended to address the quality of laboratory \ntest performance. Unfortunately, the regulations enacted as a result of \nthe CLIA 1988 legislation did not reflect the intent of the act. What \nin effect happened following the passage of CLIA 1988 was a series of \nregulations that substantially increased the amount of paperwork to be \nperformed in physician offices and now ultimately increases the cost of \nhealth care to the patients. There has been little, if any, \ndocumentation that the CLIA 1988 reforms resulted in an improvement in \npatient care.\n  In fact, a Texas Medical Association study showed that the annual \ncost of the labor and administrative overhead added by CLIA averages \n$4,435 per physician. This is in addition to the cost of registration, \ncontrols, proficiency testing, and inspection or accreditation. At a \ntime when the entire health care industry is under pressure to control \nhealth care costs, the CLIA regulations not only subject physicians to \nincreased administrative costs but also decrease the amount of time \ndevoted to patient care.\n  One Texas physician describes his CLIA inspection as being left with \na feeling that nothing of any real value was accomplished. Dr. McBrayer \nfrom the Texas Panhandle relates the inspection:\n\n       We were written up for such monumental things as the fact \n     that I had not signed the procedure manual for one of our lab \n     machines. Therefore, everything done on that machine, \n     including the training, was out of compliance. The fact that \n     the manufacturer's rep had come and trained the staff was to \n     no avail. Everything was out of compliance because I didn't \n     sign it. It didn't matter that they had learned how to use \n     it. That was irrelevant.\n\n  The CLIA amendments I am introducing will reduce the burdens on \nphysicians who perform laboratory tests in their offices and thereby \nfree up resources and time to dedicate to patient care. In Texas alone, \nof the physicians who provided testing services in their offices prior \nto CLIA, 27 percent have closed their office labs, and another 31 \npercent have discounted some type of testing, as a direct result of the \nCLIA 1988 reforms. This has resulted in some areas of Texas \nexperiencing physician shortages. Many physicians are concerned about \nthe possible consequences to patients caused by the decreased access to \ntesting or the delay in obtaining results. In the wake of the health \ncare reform debate, it is important to promote quality-driven cost-\neffective ways of delivery care.\n  Mr. President, the CLIA 1997 amendments will not jeopardize the \nquality of laboratory testing. This bill will exempt physician office \nlab tests from the CLIA 1988 restrictions that have caused many \nphysicians to discontinue simple laboratory tests due to the excessive \namounts of regulation involved in the performance of these tests. The \nCLIA 1997 amendments that I am introducing today in the Senate will \nhave the narrow purpose of ensuring that essential laboratory testing \nperformed by physicians remain a viable diagnostic option for \nphysicians and their patients without the excessive rules and \nadministratively complex requirements that currently exist, and, most \nimportantly, eliminate the strain the CLIA 1988 legislation is placing \non patients in rural areas who are losing access to necessary testing \nand care.\n  I hope that all my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nlegislation, which will reduce health care costs and improve the \nability of patients to receive laboratory tests in a timely fashion \nwhile providing the much needed regulatory relief to physicians all \nover the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1069. A bill entitled the ``National Discovery Trails Act of \n1997''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               THE NATIONAL DISCOVERY TRAILS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of \nintroducing legislation that I think is most significant. This \nlegislation will particularly appeal to those who are inclined to enjoy \nthe outdoors because it will establish our Nation's first coast-to-\ncoast multiuse hiking trail. Take a moment and think about that. You \nwill be able to hike from coast to coast on a hiking trail. That means \noff the highways, away from the roads, behind the freeways. A true \noutdoor experience.\n  Trails are one of America's most popular recreation resources. \nMillions of Americans hike, they ski, they jog, they bike, they ride \nhorses, they drive snow machines and all-terrain vehicles, they observe \nnature, commute, and relax on trails throughout the country.\n  A variety of trails are provided nationwide, including urban bike \npaths, bridle paths, community greenways, historic trails, motorized \ntrails, and long-distance hiking trails. This legislation will \nestablish the American Discovery Trail, or ADT as it is commonly \ncalled. The ADT is a continuous coast-to-coast trail to link the \nNation's principal north-south trails and east-west historic trails \nwith shorter local and regional trails into a nationwide network.\n  Mr. President, by establishing a system of discovery trails, this new \ncategory will recognize that using and enjoying trails close to home is \nequally as important as traversing remote wilderness trails, of which \nwe have many in my State of Alaska. Long-distance\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\ntrails are used mostly by people living close to the trail and by \nweekenders. Backpacking excursions are normally a few days to a couple \nof weeks. As an example, of the estimated 4 million users of the \nAppalachian Trail, each year it is estimated that only about 100 to 150 \nwalk the entire trail annually. This will be true of the American \nDiscovery Trail as well, especially because of its proximity to urban \nlocations throughout the country.\n  The ADT, the first of the discovery trails, will connect 6 of the \nnational scenic trails, 10 of the national historic trails, 23 of the \nnational recreation trails, and hundreds of other local and regional \ntrails. Until now, the element that has been missing in order to create \na national system of connected trails is that the existing trails, for \nthe most part, are simply not connectable. With the ADT that will no \nlonger be the case.\n\n  The ADT is about access. The trails will connect people to larger \ncities, small towns, urban areas and to mountains, forests, deserts and \nnatural areas, incorporating regional, local, and national trails \ntogether.\n  What makes this so exciting is the way it has already brought people \ntogether. More than 100 organizations along the trail's 6,000 miles \nsupport the effort. Each State the trail passes through already has a \nvolunteer coordination effort, and coordinators who lead an active ADT \ncommittee. A strong grassroots effort along with financial support from \nBackpacker magazine, Eco USA, The Coleman Companies and others, have \nhelped make the ADT move from a dream to a reality.\n  Only one very more important step on the trail needs to be taken. \nCongress needs to authorize the trail as part of our national trail \nsystem. I invite my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  The American Discovery Trail begins, or ends, when your two feet go \ninto the Pacific at Point Reyes National Seashore, just north of San \nFrancisco. Next are Berkeley and Sacramento before the climb to the \nPacific Crest National Scenic Trail in Lake Tahoe in the middle of the \nSierra Nevada Mountains.\n  Nevada offers historic Virginia City, home of the Comstock Lode, the \nPony Express National Historic Trail, Great Basin National Park with \nLehman Caves and Wheeler Peak.\n  Utah provides national forests and parks along with spectacular red \nrock country, which leads into Colorado offering Colorado National \nMonument with its 20,445 acres of sandstone monoliths and canyons. Then \nthere is the Grand Mesa over Scofield Pass and Crested Butte, in the \nheart of the ski country as you follow the Colorado and Continental \nDivide Trails into Evergreen. I wish I was there myself this afternoon.\n  At Denver, the ADT divides and becomes the northern and southern \nMidwest routes. The northern Midwest route winds through Nebraska, \nIowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio; the southern Midwest route leaves \nColorado and the Air Force Academy and follows the tracks and wagon \nwheel ruts of thousands of early pioneers through Kansas and Missouri \nas well as settlements and historic places in Illinois, Indiana, \nKentucky until the trail joins the northern route in Cincinnati.\n  West Virginia is next, then Maryland and the C Canal. This leads to \nWashington, DC, where the trail passes The Mall, the White House, the \nCapitol, and then heads on to Annapolis. Finally, in Delaware, the \ntrail reaches the eastern terminus at Cape Henlopen State Park and the \nAtlantic Ocean.\n  Between the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, one will experience the most \nspectacular scenery in the world, thousands of historic sites, lakes, \nrivers and streams of every size. The trail offers an opportunity to \ndiscovery America from small towns, to rural countryside, to large \nmetropolitan areas.\n  When the President signs the legislation into law, a 10-year effort \nwill have been achieved. The American Discovery Trail will become a \nreality. The more people who use it, the better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1069\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Discovery Trails \n     Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL TRAILS SYSTEM ACT AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Section 3(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1242(a)) is amended by inserting after paragraph (4) the \n     following:\n       ``(5) National discovery trails, established as provided in \n     section 5, which will be extended, continuous, interstate \n     trails so located as to provide for outstanding outdoor \n     recreation and travel and to connect representative examples \n     of America's trails and communities. National discovery \n     trails should provide for the conservation and enjoyment of \n     significant natural, cultural, and historic resources \n     associated with each trail and should be so located as to \n     represent metropolitan, urban, rural, and back country \n     regions of the Nation.''. Any such trail may be designated on \n     federal lands and, with the consent of the owner thereof, on \n     any non federal lands: Provided, that such consent may be \n     revoked at any time. The Congress does not intend for the \n     establishment of a National Discovery Trail to lead to the \n     creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones adjacent to \n     a National Discovery Trail. The fact that there may be \n     activities or uses on lands adjacent to the trail that would \n     not be permitted on the trail shall not preclude such \n     activities or uses on such lands adjacent to the trail to the \n     extent consistent with other applicable law.\n       (2) Feasibility Requirements; Cooperative Management \n     Requirement.--Section 5 of such Act (16 U.S.C. 1244) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g)(1) For purposes of subsection (b), a trail shall not \n     be considered feasible and desirable for designation as a \n     national discovery trail unless it meets all of the following \n     criteria:\n       ``(A) the trail must link one or more areas within the \n     boundaries of a metropolitan area (as those boundaries are \n     determined under section 134(c) of title 23, United States \n     Code). It should also join with other trails, connecting the \n     National Trails System to significant recreation and \n     resources areas.\n       ``(B) The trail must be supported by a competent trailwide \n     nonprofit organization. Each trail should have extensive \n     local and trailwide support by the public, by user groups, \n     and by affected State and local governments.\n       ``(C) The trail must be extended and pass through more than \n     one State. At a minimum, it should be a continuous, walkable \n     route not including any non-federal property for which the \n     owner had not provided consent for inclusion and use.\n       ``(2) The appropriate Secretary for each national discovery \n     trail shall administer the trail in cooperation with a \n     competent trailwide nonprofit organization.''.\n       (b) Designation of the American Discovery Trail as a \n     National Discovery Trail.--Section 5(a) of such Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1244(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by re-designating the paragraph relating to the \n     California National Historic Trail as paragraph (18);\n       (2) by re-designating the paragraph relating to the Pony \n     Express National Historic Trail as paragraph (19); and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(20) The American Discovery Trail, a trail of \n     approximately 6,000 miles extending from Cape Henlopen State \n     Park in Delaware to Point Reyes National Seashore in \n     California, extending westward through Delaware, Maryland, \n     the District of Columbia, West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, \n     where near Cincinnati it splits into two routes. The Northern \n     Midwest route traverses Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, \n     Nebraska, and Colorado, and the Southern Midwest route \n     traverses Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado. \n     After the two routes rejoin in Denver, Colorado, the route \n     continues through Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California. The \n     trail is generally described in Volume 2 of the National \n     Park Service feasibility study dated June 1995 which shall \n     be on file and available for public inspection in the \n     office of the Director of the National Park Service, \n     Department of the Interior, the District of Columbia. The \n     American Discovery Trail shall be administered by the \n     Secretary of the Interior in cooperation with a competent \n     trailwide nonprofit organization and other affected land \n     managing agencies. No lands or interests outside the \n     exterior boundaries of federally administered areas may be \n     acquired by the Federal Government solely for the American \n     Discovery Trail. This trail is specifically exempted from \n     the provisions of sections 7(e), 7(f), and 7(g).''.\n       (c) Comprensive National Discovery Trail Plan.--Section 5 \n     of such Act (16 U.S.C. 1244) is further amended by adding at \n     the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(h) Within three complete fiscal years after the date of \n     enactment of any law designating a national discovery trail, \n     the administering Federal agency shall, in cooperation with a \n     competent trailwide nonprofit organization, submit a \n     comprehensive plan for the protection, management, \n     development, and use of the federal portions of the trail, \n     and provide technical assistance to states and local units of \n     government and private landowners, as requested, for non-\n     federal portions of the trail, to the Committee on Resources \n     of the United States House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United \n     States Senate. The Secretary shall ensure that the \n     comprehensive plan for the entire trail does not conflict \n     with any existing\n\n[[Page S8155]]\n\n     agency direction and that the nonprofit organization consults \n     with affected land managing agencies, the Governors of the \n     affected States, county and local political jurisdictions, \n     and local organizations maintaining components of the trail. \n     Mandatory components of the comprehensive plan include--\n       ``(1) specific objectives and practices to be observed in \n     the administration and management of the trail, including the \n     identification of all significant natural, historical, and \n     cultural resources to be preserved, model agreements \n     necessary for joint trail administration among and between \n     interested parties, and an identified carrying capacity of \n     the trail and a plan for its implementation;\n       ``(2) general and site-specific development plans including \n     anticipated costs; and\n       ``(3) the process to be followed by the nonprofit \n     organization, in cooperation with the appropriate Secretary, \n     to implement the trail marking authorities in section 7(c) \n     conforming to approved trail logo or emblem requirements.''. \n     Nothing in this Act may be construed to impose or permit the \n     imposition of any landowner on the use of any non federal \n     lands without the consent of the owner thereof, which consent \n     may be revoked at any time. Neither the designation of a \n     National Discovery Trail nor any plan relating thereto shall \n     affect or be considered in the granting or denial of a right \n     of way or any conditions relating thereto.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n       The National Trails System Act is amended--\n       (1) in section 2(b) (16 U.S.C. 1241(b)), by striking \n     ``scenic and historic'' and inserting ``scenic, historic, and \n     discovery'';\n       (2) in the section heading to section 5 (16 U.S.C. 1244), \n     by striking ``AND NATIONAL HISTORIC'' and inserting ``, \n     NATIONAL HISTORIC, AND NATIONAL DISCOVERY'';\n       (3) in section 5(a) (16 U.S.C. 1244(a)), in the matter \n     preceding paragraph (1)--\n       (A) by striking ``and national historic'' and inserting ``, \n     national historic, and national discovery''; and\n       (B) by striking ``and National Historic'' and inserting ``, \n     National Historic, and National Discovery'';\n       (4) in section 5(b) (16 U.S.C. 1244(b)), in the matter \n     preceding paragraph (1), by striking ``or national historic'' \n     and inserting ``, national historic, or national discovery'';\n       (5) in section 5(b)(3) (16 U.S.C. 1244(b)(3)), by striking \n     ``or national historic'' and inserting ``, national historic, \n     or national discovery'';\n       (6) in section 7(a)(2) (16 U.S.C. 1246(a)(2)), by striking \n     ``and national historic'' and inserting ``, national \n     historic, and national discovery'';\n       (7) in section 7(b) (16 U.S.C. 1246(b)), by striking ``or \n     national historic'' each place such term appears and \n     inserting ``, national historic, or national discovery'';\n       (8) in section 7(c) (16 U.S.C. 1246(c))--\n       (A) by striking ``scenic or national historic'' each place \n     it appears and inserting ``scenic, national historic, or \n     national discovery'';\n       (B) in the second proviso, by striking ``scenic, or \n     national historic'' and inserting ``scenic, national \n     historic, or national discovery''; and\n       (C) by striking ``, and national historic'' and inserting \n     ``, national historic, and national discovery'';\n       (9) in section 7(d) (16 U.S.C. 1246(d)), by striking ``or \n     national historic'' and inserting ``national historic, or \n     national discovery'';\n       (10) in section 7(e) (16 U.S.C. 1246(e)), by striking ``or \n     national historic'' each place such term appears and \n     inserting ``, national historic, or national discovery'';\n       (11) in section 7(f)(2) (16 U.S.C. 1246(f)(2)), by striking \n     ``National Scenic or Historic'' and inserting ``national \n     scenic, historic, or discovery trail'';\n       (12) in section 7(h)(1) (16 U.S.C. 1246(h)(1)), by striking \n     ``or national historic'' and inserting ``national historic, \n     or national discovery''; and\n       (13) in section 7(i) (16 U.S.C. 1246(i)), by striking ``or \n     national historic'' and inserting ``national historic, or \n     national discovery''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1070. A bill to provide for a regional education and workforce \ntraining system in the metropolitan Washington area, to improve the \nschool facilities of the District of Columbia, and to fund such \nactivities in part by an income tax on nonresident workers in the \nDistrict of Columbia; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  The Metropolitan Washington Education and Workforce Training Act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today, \npursuant to many recent discussions about the rescue plan for the \nDistrict of Columbia, that reaffirms my strong belief that education \nmust be the keystone of that plan and that fair and ready funding is \navailable with no cost to the Federal Government.\n  Every Washington area citizen should keep a careful watch on what \nCongress is doing to rescue the Capital from its present plight. The \nchorus resounds, ``we must get people to move back into the Capital! \nIts future depends on it!'' But if we examine the present congressional \nand administration plans and overlay them onto the root causes for the \nplight, serious questions arise as to their effectiveness.\n  Studies indicate that the two leading causes, by far, that cause \npeople to leave the District and keep them from living in the city are \npoor schools and high incidents of crime. Let's examine the plans that \nCongress has before it.\n  Only the Senate plan as currently outlined even mentions education \nand that is basically a symbolic gesture to help repair the crumbling \nschool infrastructure. The administration does consider the crime \nproblem, but only at the end game of taking over the prison system. The \nadministration's plan has no mention of repairing the failing D.C. \neducational system; a system which is among the worst in the Nation.\n  The central administrative problem of the District's school system is \nnot money, it is management chaos. But money is a serious concern in \nthe area of school infrastructure, and D.C. has one of the worst school \ninfrastructures in the Nation. In fairness to General Becton, the new \nchief executive officer for the schools, he is trying valiantly to \nupgrade overall standards but too much of his time is spent dealing \nwith emergency school infrastructure repairs. Again this September, 43 \nschools will be threatened with closure at the outset of the academic \nyear. Over $2 billion are needed just to fix building code violations.\n  Crime in the District is directly related to the public school \nsystem. Some 40 percent of D.C. children drop out of school between \ngrades 7 and 12. National studies show that about 80 percent of prison \ninmates are school drop-outs. A plan to help D.C. must have a strong \ncomponent to improve education. As will be shown below, this need not \ncarry a significant dollar cost to the Federal Treasury. In fact it \nwill save millions.\n  The President wants to be known as the Education President. Congress \nwants to be known as the Education Congress. Wouldn't the best \ndemonstration of that intent be to start by improving the education \nsystem of the Nation's Capital?\n  The present plans for enhancing a middle-class tax base in the \nDistrict are based on business tax incentives. But if you are a middle-\nclass taxpayer with school-age children you currently have to factor in \napproximately $10,000 a year in private education fees to feel \ncomfortable with the level of education and safety you are providing to \nyour family--$10,000 a year, per child, is a huge barrier for most \nmiddle-class families.\n  The plans currently being considered in Congress that exclude \ndiscussion of schools may well create jobs. But jobs for whom? Even the \npromoters of those plans recognize that those jobs would primarily go \nto non-residents of the District. Projections show that two out of \nthree jobs will go to non-residents. This will leave the District with \nmore infrastructure demands and less money to deal with them--the exact \nstatus of the problems at present.\n  As stated in the recent Brookings Institution study on D.C. entitled \n``The Orphan Capital'' taxing metropolitan area residents where they \nlive instead of where they work creates a revenue boon for Maryland and \nVirginia and a revenue disaster for the District. D.C. is the only city \nin a multi-State configuration in the country that has an income tax \nbut is not able to tax its non-resident workers. This situation has \nalso led D.C. to have the highest income tax rate on its residents in \nthe area. That income tax rate is another barrier to the middle-class \nreturn to the city.\n  The result is that $20 billion in wages leaves the District each year \nwithout being taxed, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars \nflowing each year to the treasuries of Maryland and Virginia. Only 1 \npercent of this amount goes in the other direction--from D.C. residents \nworking in the suburbs back in to D.C. This is a huge inequity that no \nother major city suffers.\n  The history of the tax inequity began in 1973 when D.C. was given \nhome rule. An astute Virginia representative convinced Congress to \nprohibit the non-resident tax from being enacted. A brilliant move, \nperhaps justified at the time, but it is unjust now, particularly to \nthe children of D.C. It is not unexpected that the Maryland and \nVirginia Senators object violently when changing this situation is \nsuggested.\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\n  However, a win-win proposal for all D.C. metropolitan residents is \npossible. It will create high-paying job opportunities for high-school \ngraduates through improved skill training. It will provide the needed \nrepairs to the D.C. school infrastructure. It will provide funds to \nimprove schools and other area training institutions.\n  A recent report issued by the Greater Washington Board of Trade \nindicates that there are approximately 50,000 high-paying jobs \nrequiring information technology skills in the Washington metropolitan \narea. These jobs pay on average $40,000 a year. By filling these jobs \nthe Board of Trade estimates an additional $3.5 billion annually would \nbe injected into the economy of what we call `the golden crescent'--the \nWashington metropolitan region that stretches from Annapolis, Maryland \nto Winchester, Virginia.\n  But actually, this labor market shortage is a national problem. There \nare an estimated 190,000 information technology jobs going begging in \nthe Nation for lack of skilled workers. Congress is presently trying to \npass legislation to revamp our workforce training laws. We have at this \ntime a prime opportunity to solve the D.C. metropolitan problem and \nprovide a national model to help correct the serious national skill \ntraining deficiencies. I am introducing legislation today to accomplish \nthis ``win-win'' structure.\n  If the Washington metropolitan area were to become a model for the \nrest of the country we could jump start the rest of the country in \nsolving this serious national problem. And this could be done with no \nadditional Federal cost. But, of course, there is a hitch.\n  My plan would require a 3-percent non-resident income tax on D.C. \ncommuter wages. But remember, it would cost the commuters nothing \nbecause of laws requiring mutual offsetting tax credits. There would be \nan offset against the State income taxes of Maryland and Virginia. This \nwould allow the commuter dollars to stay within the metropolitan region \ninstead of going to Richmond and Annapolis with the hope of it coming \nback.\n  One percent of this new revenue would be used to repair the D.C. \nschool infrastructure. Bonds could then be amortized for the $2 billion \nneeded. The other two percent would fund a trust overseen by metro-area \nschool and business leaders to provide funding for regional skill \ntraining.\n  Benefits to the regional economy should more than offset any losses \nto the States. It is hard to argue against growing the local Maryland \nand Virginia metro-area economies by $3.5 billion a year. This and \nfuture gains would more than offset the 1 percent going solely to D.C.\n  And finally, this bill results in hundreds of millions of dollars in \nsavings to the Federal Government; hundreds of millions of dollars of \nhelp to the suburbs surrounding the capital; the repair of the D.C. \nschool system and the overall improvement of the regional school \nsystem; and potential revenue gains to Maryland and Virginia. Most \nimportantly, it would make the congressional and administration plans \nsensible instead of senseless.

Mr. President, last year, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously passed an amendment I sponsored to the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act that requires \nincoming immigrants to be immunized before they enter the United \nStates.\n  The amendment makes public health sense. Between 800,000 and 1 \nmillion individuals emigrate from their home country to the United \nStates every year. And, the Department of Health and Human Services has \nmade immunization of the U.S. population against vaccine-preventable \ndiseases one of its top health priorities. But before the passage of \nlast year's Immigration Act, there was no Federal policy with regard to \nthe immunization of foreign nationals seeking permanent residency in \nthe United States. With passage of the Immigration Reform Act, we can \nbe assured that incoming immigrants will be immunized against vaccine-\npreventable diseases.\n  There are special circumstances, however, when requiring an immigrant \nto be immunized in his or her home country before traveling to the \nUnited States doesn't make sense. The law allows the Attorney General \nthe authority to waive the immunization requirement whenever the \nrequirement ``would not be medically appropriate'' or when such \nimmunizations ``would be contrary to the alien's religious or moral \nconvictions.''\n  So, the Attorney General has complete authority to waive the \nimmunization requirement. Some House and Senate offices, however, \nincluding mine, have heard from representatives of the international \nadoption community about the difficulties this requirement has caused \nfor such parents and their children.\n  To address this issue, Senator McCain and I offer this amendment to \ninstruct the Attorney General ``to exercise the waiver authority \nprovided for in subsection (g)(2)(B) for any alien applying for an IR3 \nor IR4 category visa.'' That is, for any orphan in another country who \nis to be adopted by a U.S. citizen.\n  I have heard from adoptive parents and agencies in Arizona about the \nunique difficulties the immunization requirement is creating for some \nadoptive parents and their babies and young children. Their unique \nconcerns focus on a number of issues, including:\n  Unavailable background Records: Children from orphanages, which \ncomprise over 50 percent of international adoptions, often do not have \nhealth records on which to base recommendations for vaccinations.\n  Immunocompromised children: According to medical professionals, many \nchildren who have lived in orphanages exhibit significant immune \ndefects. These immunocompromised children should not receive certain \nimmunizations. Requiring such immunizations could cause the child to \nacquire the very disease the immunization is supposed to prevent.\n  The exact age of the child is unknown and, therefore, some children \ncould be forced to receive age-inappropriate immunizations.\n  The adoptive parents often have limited time and resources to travel \nto the adoptee's home country. Forcing the child to undergo as many as \nfive immunizations at one time, in order to reduce the amount of time \nand money a parent must spend in the child's home country, will drive \nup the cost of the adoption.\n  There is a danger that unsterile or reconstituted needles, or \nsubstandard immunizations, may be used to vaccinate children in some \norphanages in some countries.\n  It is also important to ensure that any immigrant who has received a \nwaiver be immunized once he or she has arrived in the United States. \nThe McCain/Kyl amendment requires the Attorney General and Secretaries \nof HHS and State to report back in 6 months on how to establish an \nenforcement program to ensure that immigrants who receive waivers be \nimmunized once they arrive in the United States. The enforcement \nprogram would not apply to immunizations that would not be medically \nappropriate in the foreign country or the United States or would be \ncontrary to the alien's religious or moral convictions.\n  On July 22, 23 of my colleagues, including Senators Abraham, Kennedy, \nAllard, Ashcroft, Coats, Conrad, Craig, D'Amato, DeWine, Dodd, Dorgan, \nDurbin, Frist, Grassley, Hutchinson, Inouye, Kohl, Landrieu, McCain, \nMoynihan, Robb, Gordon Smith, and Snowe joined me in sending a letter \nto Attorney General Reno urging her to generously use her authority to \nprovide waivers from the immunization requirement for these babies and \nchildren awaiting adoption. I am pleased that the Senate has adopted \nthis timely amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8157-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8157-S8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DARRELL COLSON, HOOSIER HERO\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a \ntrue Hoosier hero, Mr. Darrell Colson of Indianapolis. On July 15, \n1997, Mr. Colson performed a heroic act. While getting ready to leave \nhis apartment complex pool, he noticed that his neighbor, Orian \nWilliams, who moments earlier was swimming laps, was now drowning at \nthe bottom of the pool. After an attempt by Kim Williams, his fiance, \nto rescue the young woman, Mr. Colson dove into the water and pulled \nMs. Williams to safety. Once he was able to remove her from the water, \nDarrell Colson and Kim Williams performed CPR until the rescue team \narrived. Orian Williams, who by then was in a coma, was rushed to a \nnearby community hospital where she regained consciousness after \nreceiving medical treatment.\n  This is a remarkable act, by a remarkable individual. However, what \nmakes Ms. Williams' rescue truly amazing is that Mr. Colson is a \nparaplegic. Four years ago, Mr. Colson suffered a tragic accident when \nhe fell 40 feet from a tree; he is now confined to a wheelchair. To \nsave Ms. Williams, Darrell Colson maneuvered his wheelchair to the \npool, dove in, held onto her with one arm and used the other to swim \nher to the surface. Despite his condition, Mr. Colson found the courage \nto risk his own life for a fellow human being. Mr. Colson may not think \nof himself as special, but he is a hero to both Orian Williams and to \nall of us who look to his selfless example for inspiration.\n  I initiated the Hoosier Hero program in 1991 to recognize individuals \nwho have made significant contributions to Indiana life, while at the \nsame time serving as an inspirational example to the entire Nation. I \ncannot think of a more inspirational display of courage than saving the \nlife of another individual. Last week, Mr. President, I was pleased to \nofficially recognize Mr. Colson as a true Hoosier hero and awarded him \na Hoosier Hero plaque.\n  Mr. Colson never expected to save a life that day while he was \nrelaxing at the pool. Yet, he demonstrated how we all need to be \nprepared if we are called upon to help others.\n  Today I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Darrell Colson,\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\nwhose actions not only saved a life but demonstrated extraordinary \nbravery and courage. I challenge others to follow the example of \nDarrell Colson and other heroes in our communities. They ask for no \nrecognition, and no reward. For Darrell Colson, he just wanted to see \nOrian Williams awaken from her coma and walk out of the hospital. \nFortunately, he got his wish, but also the recognition of a grateful \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8157-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDER FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

METZENBAUM UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 833) to designate the \nFederal building courthouse at Public Square and Superior Avenue in \nCleveland, OH, as the ``Howard M. Metzenbaum United States \nCourthouse.''\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am very pleased that today the \nSenate will recognize the contributions of my dear friend and former \ncolleague, Howard Metzenbaum, by approving this bill designating the \nFederal Building Courthouse in Cleveland, OH as the ``Howard M. \nMetzenbaum United States Courthouse.'' Ohio's two Senators, Senator \nGlenn and Senator DeWine, were original cosponsors of this legislation, \nalong with Senator Hatch, when I introduced on June 5, 1997.\n  Mr. President, I proposed naming a courthouse after Howard because a \ncourthouse is a symbol of justice where all people can come and be \ntreated equally under the law. Howard Metzenbaum deserves this honor \nbecause he was a dedicated public servant, who served his home State of \nOhio for 18 years in the U.S. Senate. Howard's sense of fairness and \nequality for all Americans led one of his former colleagues to suggest \nthat Howard would have made an exceptional U.S. Supreme Court Justice \nwhen he retired from the Senate in 1994.\n  Mr. President, naming a courthouse after Howard is only a small \ngesture in attempting to remember a man so committed to justice and \nfairness. Howard's contributions to the Senate are extraordinary, and \nwe commemorate his unique contribution by passing this bill in \ncelebration of his 80th year, his 18 years in the U.S. Senate, and also \nthe special character he brought to our body.\n  I pay tribute today to a man who always stood up for what he believed \nwas right, fighting hard to preserve opportunity for those for those \nyet to come. As a Senator, Howard had a broad range of interests and he \npursued them with dogged perseverance, sincerity and clarity.\n  Howard and I worked on many issues together during our time in the \nSenate. Individual rights and environmental preservation were major \nconcerns. He poured his energy into clean air protection, nuclear \nregulation, cleaning up superfund sites and recycling. Howard provided \nstrong leadership on antitrust issues as chairman of the Subcommittee \non Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  He was a persistent gun control advocate, taking the lead on many \nantigun initiatives in the Senate. He was one of the lead sponsors of \nthe Brady bill handgun purchase waiting period, as well as the bans on \nassault weapons and plastic explosives.\n  But Howard's true passions lay with America's underprivileged and \nneedy communities, which never had a bolder champion. His work on \nbehalf of the poor, the disabled, and the elderly reflect his \nremarkable compassion for those members of society who face challenges \nthat many of us cannot fully appreciate. He tirelessly defended their \ninterests and fought for their protection. He was dedicated to \neradicating discrimination, ensuring adequate health care to those in \nneed and boosting public education. It has been said many times, but \nfor good reason, that Howard brought not only his conscience to the \nSenate, but also the courage to act on his convictions.\n  Howard remains a good friend to me, but was also a mentor and a \nteacher during his years in the Senate. He gave me good advice and \nplenty of it. And, I might add, he continues to do so today, which I \nwelcome! But more than that, his dedication to the office of United \nStates Senator is an example by which to live. He stood tall for the \nlittle people.\n  Some will affectionately remember Howard as determined, \nargumentative, and even irascible. I cannot deny that those words come \nto my mind every now and then when describing Howard. He was always at \nhis best then, and for good reason. I heard it said by one Senator, and \nnot a good friend: ``If there wasn't a Metzenbaum here, we'd have to \ninvent one to keep us alert.''\n  I have missed working with Howard Metzenbaum in this great \ninstitution, a place that has been truly enhanced by his presence. I \nsalute him on celebrating his 80th year.\n  The bill (S. 833) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nread the third time, and passed; as follows:\n\n                                 S. 833\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Dole U.S. Courthouse.''\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has acted \nexpeditiously on S. 1000, the legislation that Senator Brownback and I \nintroduced several weeks ago to designate the Kansas City, KS, Federal \nCourthouse after our Kansas colleague Senator Bob Dole. I appreciate \nthe efforts of Senators Chafee and Baucus and the other members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in their effort to approve the \nbill for its consideration by the Senate before the August recess.\n  After the bill was introduced, Kansans contacted my office about \nSenator Dole and their recollections of his work, which he continues to \ndo in behalf of Kansas. I thought it would be fitting to share an \nexample with my colleagues. Mrs. Rose Coughlin of Kansas City, KS, \nshared with me her story about Senator Dole calling her just several \nweeks ago. Mrs. Coughlin, who suffers from polio, wrote to Senator Dole \nin mid-June just to pass along her deep appreciation and admiration of \nhis perseverance during his legislative career on behalf of Kansas \ndespite his permanent injuries sustained during World War II.\n  Much to her surprise, Senator Dole called her upon receiving the \nletter and talked with her at some length, inquiring about her \ncondition. At the close of her letter to me she says, ``Needless to say \nhe made my day.'' Her letter is indicative of Senator Dole's commitment \nand caring for Kansans.\n  Mr. President, S. 1000 has been endorsed by Carol Marinovich, mayor \nof Kansas City, KS, the location of the soon-to-be Robert J. Dole U.S. \nCourthouse.\n  I look forward to joining Senator Dole along with proud Kansans in \nthe near future for the dedication ceremonies.\n  The bill (S. 1000) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nread the third time, and passed; as follows:\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\n                                S. 1000\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 43 submitted earlier today by Senators Grassley, Lugar, and \nHarkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 43) urging the United \n     States Trade Representative immediately to take all \n     appropriate action with regard to Mexico's imposition of \n     antidumping duties on United States high fructose corn syrup.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am offering this resolution with \nmy distinguished colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, Senators Lugar and Harkin. The resolution \naddresses an antidumping investigation being conducted by the \nGovernment of Mexico, on the import of high-fructose syrup [HFCS] from \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, I have often come to the Senate floor to discuss the \nimportance of international trade to our agricultural economy. American \nfarmers have become more reliant on global markets for their income. \nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 31 percent of \nfarmers' income will be derived from foreign markets by the end of the \ndecade.\n  Because American farmers are the most efficient in the world we \nshould not be frightened by this trend. But we must be more vigilant \nthan ever when it comes to eliminating foreign trade barriers.\n  Both the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] and the Uruguay \nRound Agreement of GATT were successful for American farmers. They \nserved to reduce or eliminate barriers to trade in agriculture products \nto a greater extent than any prior trade agreement. The implementation \nand enforcement of these agreements will be crucial to American \nfarmers.\n  That is why the recent actions of the Mexican Government are so \ndisturbing. The Mexican Government has imposed unreasonably high, \npreliminary tariffs on imports of HFCS from the United States. These \ntariffs are far in excess of what was negotiated under NAFTA. The \njustification for these tariffs is the antidumping action filed by the \nMexican sugar industry.\n  I and my colleagues are very concerned with the propriety of this \naction. There have been questions raised as to whether the action meets \nthe standards set forth in the World Trade Organization Agreement on \nAntidumping. I will submit for the Record a letter from the Deputy U.S. \nTrade Representative, Ambassador Jeff Lang, that outlines these serious \nconcerns.\n  The resolution we introduced today is very simple. It says that if \nthe antidumping action has not been conducted in accordance with WTO \nrequirements, it should be terminated immediately. And all tariffs that \nhave been imposed as a result of the action should be removed \nimmediately.\n  If the Mexican Government refuses to do this, the United States Trade \nRepresentative is directed to request consultations with the Mexican \nGovernment, under the dispute settlement provisions of the WTO. This \naction will trigger a resolution of this dispute according to WTO \nprocedures.\n  Finally, if the Mexican Government fails to accept our request for \nconsultations, Congress directs the USTR to take any and all applicable \nactions under United States trade law.\n  Mr. President, I am a firm believer in free and open trade. It is \nnever productive to engage in a trade war with one of our largest and \nmost loyal trading partners. And that is certainly not the intent of \nthis resolution.\n  However in order to have fair trade, we must insist that our trading \npartners live up to the obligations set forth in our trade agreements. \nThis is vital to facilitating the free trade that will raise the \nstandard of living for workers and consumers worldwide.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referred to \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Alvaro Baillet,\n     Jefe De La Unidad, Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento \n         Industrial, Av. Insurgentes Sur 1940 PISO II, Col. \n         Florida, C.P. 01030 Mexico, D.F.\n       Dear Mr. Baillet: The United States has recently been \n     contacted by American producers of High Fructose Corn Syrup \n     (HFCS) regarding the initiation of an antidumping \n     investigation concerning their exports of HFCS to Mexico. Our \n     producers are concerned that the applicable like product in \n     the investigation is HFCS, that the investigation was \n     initiated without the support of the Mexican producers of \n     that like product, and that certain information about the \n     Mexican producers of HFCS known to the Mexican authorities \n     was not considered in the initiation notice.\n       We have reviewed information that indicates that HFCS was \n     produced in Mexico during the 1996 period of investigation. \n     We further understand that this information was available to \n     SECOFI and the Mexican sugar chamber that submitted the \n     application for this antidumping investigation prior to \n     SECOFI's initiation of the investigation. The domestic \n     producers of the like product on whose behalf the antidumping \n     application was filed consequently would normally have \n     included any such Mexican producers of HFCS. SECOFI's \n     initiation notice, however, does not reference these \n     producers. It merely states, without support, that HFCS is \n     not produced in Mexico.\n       An investigation into allegations of dumping can be \n     extremely time consuming, expensive and have commercial \n     consequences even before a preliminary or definitive measure \n     is in place. For this reason, and because the Antidumping \n     Agreement is explicit about the need for the authorities to \n     examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in \n     the application, including that pertinent to the industry \n     support needed for initiation, we would appreciate your \n     attention to this matter in time to minimize any unnecessary \n     impediment to U.S. exports of HFCS.\n           Sincerely Yours,\n                                                     Jeffrey Lang,\n                        Deputy United States Trade Representative.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in my home State of Indiana, corn refining \nadds substantially to the value of our corn crop. On average, Indiana \nproduces 800 million bushels of corn annually. It is estimated that \ncorn refining--primarily through the production of high-fructose corn \nsyrup--adds about $200 million to the value of Indiana's corn crop. In \naddition to enhancing the value of our corn crop, corn refining results \nin the direct employment of approximately 1,700 Hoosiers with an \nestimated payroll of over $70 million.\n  It is for the above reasons that I join Senators Grassley, Harkin, \nDaschle,\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\nand Kerrey in introducing a concurrent resolution instructing the \nUnited States Trade Representative to take the appropriate actions in \nregards to a preliminary imposition of antidumping duties against \nUnited States exports of high-fructose corn syrup to Mexico. These \nduties were imposed on June 25 in response to a petition brought to the \nMexican Government by the sugar producers' organization in Mexico.\n  Prior to our adoption of the North American Free-Trade Agreement \n[NAFTA], duties on high-fructose corn syrup were 15 percent. This year, \nunder our negotiated agreements, with should have dropped to 9.5 \npercent. The preliminary antidumping finding has disrupted the planned \nprogram for the duty reduction on this important agricultural product. \nDuties now in effect because of this decision are as much as four to \nfive times the pre-NAFTA levels.\n  Mr. President, this case involves important matters of international \ntrade policy and the interests of U.S. agricultural producers. The \npreliminary finding of the Mexican Government appears to be in \nviolation of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Antidumping. \nThis agreement requires that governments fully investigate allegations \nbrought by private parties before opening government investigations. In \nthis case, Mexico's sugar industry stated that there was no production \nof high-fructose corn syrup in Mexico. This is inaccurate which means \nthe Mexican sugar industry did not have standing under WTO rules to \nfile this case.\n  Three years ago this chamber helped take a major step toward creating \na growing free-trade area in the Western Hemisphere. Passage of NAFTA \nwas not an easy matter, as you will recall. However, those of us from \nagricultural areas--with strong support from the U.S. corn industry--\nworked hard to achieve its passage.\n  With the passage of last years FAIR Act, we reduced price and income \nsupport for U.S. corn farmers. Increasing exports is the only \nalternative for U.S. farmers to maintain a stable level of farm income. \nOne of the best ways to continue agricultures export performance is to \nensure that unwarranted and unfair trade barriers are not erected. I \nhope you will join me in supporting this resolution.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nappear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  The concurrent resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 43) follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 43\n\n       Whereas the North American Free Trade Agreement (in this \n     resolution, referred to as ``the NAFTA'') was intended to \n     reduce trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the NAFTA represented an opportunity for corn \n     farmers and refiners to increase exports of highly \n     competitive United States corn and corn products;\n       Whereas corn is the number one U.S. cash crop with a value \n     of $25,000,000,000;\n       Whereas U.S. corn refiners are highly efficient, provide \n     over 10,000 non-farm jobs, and add over $2,000,000 of value \n     to the U.S. corn crop;\n       Whereas the Government of Mexico has initiated an \n     antidumping investigation into imports of high fructose corn \n     syrup from the United States which may violate the \n     antidumping standards of the World Trade Organization;\n       Whereas on June 25, 1997, the Government of Mexico \n     published a Preliminary Determination imposing very high \n     antidumping duties on imports of United States high fructose \n     corn syrup;\n       Whereas there has been concern that Mexico's initiation of \n     the antidumping investigation was motivated by political \n     pressure from the Mexican sugar industry rather than the \n     merits of Mexico's antidumping law: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Mexico should review carefully \n     whether it properly initiated this antidumping investigation \n     in conformity with the standards set forth in the World Trade \n     Organization Agreement on Antidumping, and should terminate \n     this investigation immediately;\n       (2) if the United States Trade Representative considers \n     that Mexico initiated this antidumping investigation in \n     violation of World Trade Organization standards, and if the \n     Government of Mexico does not terminate the antidumping \n     investigation, then the United States Trade Representative \n     should immediately undertake appropriate measures, including \n     actions pursuant to the dispute settlement provisions of the \n     World Trade Organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/25/senate-section/article/S8159-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JULY 28, 1997\n\n  Mr. HELMS.
