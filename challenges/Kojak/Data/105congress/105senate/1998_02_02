Mr. President, today, we will be in a period of morning \nbusiness from 12 noon until 1 p.m. to accommodate a number of Senators \nwho have requested time to speak. For this week's legislative schedule, \nit's my hope that the Senate will be able to complete consideration of \nthe legislation renaming the Washington National Airport after former \nPresident Ronald Reagan. At this time, I am still hopeful that the \nother side of the aisle will allow the Senate to get a time agreement \nworked out so that we can complete that very, I think, appropriate \nlegislation, in a reasonable time this week. Also, the Senate may \nconsider a resolution regarding Iraq, as well as several nominations on \nthe Executive Calendar, specifically, the nominations of Carlos Moreno \nand Christine Miller to Federal judicial appointments, as well as the \nnomination of David Satcher, to be an Assistant Secretary of HHS.\n  As I announced last week, no rollcall votes will occur today. \nHowever, all Members should be prepared to be present and voting \nthroughout the remainder of the week, with the exception of Friday. We \nwill not have recorded votes on Friday. We will not be in session on \nFriday because of a conflict we have with a conference that a number of \nMembers wish to attend. The first votes will occur as early as noon on \nTuesday, February 3, with respect to the two judicial nominations. We \nhad thought those votes would occur earlier, but we will have morning \nbusiness first in the morning, and then we will have the two recorded \nvotes probably right at noon. In addition, we will be in session next \nMonday, February 9. At this time, it is not anticipated that any votes \nwill occur on that Monday, February 9.\n  I thank all Senators for their attention. We will have, I suspect, a \nnumber of votes Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of this week. And then \nwe will continue to move on to legislation that we have pending, which \nare very important to be considered before we go out for the \nPresident's Day recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to address what I \nbelieve is a serious issue. Let me read just the opening paragraph of a \nstory that appeared this morning in The Washington Times. The headline \nof the story is ``Koop given waiver for burial at Arlington; former \nSurgeon General helped Hillary.''\n  The first paragraph of the story is this:\n\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\n\n       President Clinton overrode Army opposition and granted a \n     unique burial waiver at Arlington National Cemetery to C. \n     Everett Koop at a time when First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     had enlisted the former Surgeon General to support her \n     national health care plan, internal documents showed \n     yesterday.\n\n  The story goes on to talk about not just the dynamics of an implied \ndeal, but it is far more serious than just an implied deal in my \nopinion, Mr. President, because what we are talking about here is \ngiving sacred resting spots of our Nation's veterans away as deals, as \nrewards, as bargaining chips, as thank yous, as awards, as quid pro \nquos.\n  Mr. President, this is not only a bad precedent and very dangerous \nfor the future of our country, but it flies in the face of the honor \nand the trust that America has always placed in its veterans and their \nservice to our country. This is hallowed ground, Mr. President, this is \nsacred ground. Arlington National Cemetery is a national shrine. It \nshould be a national shrine. We have very strict regulations and \nlimitations as to who is allowed the great and distinct honor to be \nlaid to rest at Arlington.\n  Mr. President, I have no quarrel with Dr. Koop. He was a very \nsuccessful and important Surgeon General, a renowned doctor, and he has \ndone many good things for his profession and our country and our \nGovernment. But someone has to talk about this because, you see, there \nis a connection; there is a connection between what obviously was done \nand what is not being done today for our active military men and women \nin uniform and for our retirees. I would like to read just two lines \nfrom one of Rudyard Kipling's finest poems. This poem, Mr. Kipling \nwrote is called ``Tommy.'' Many veterans will know this poem. Two of \nthe last lines go like this:\n\n       For it's Tommy this an' Tommy that, an' chuck him out the \n     brute!\n       But it's ``savior of 'is country'' when the guns begin to \n     shoot.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a time when this body will debate and vote on \nshortly--in the next few weeks--whether we are going to ask our \nmilitary, our men and women in uniform, who we call on every day to \nprotect our liberties around the world, and we are going to commit them \nto more responsibility in Bosnia, NATO expansion, Iraq, maybe, yet we \nare now in a position to be giving away burial spots that were \noriginally always intended for the man and the woman who put on \nAmerica's military uniform and serve our country with great honor and \ngreat distinction. This is also a time, Mr. President, when veterans \nare having difficulty using the veterans' preference in getting jobs in \nthe Federal Government. We are asking them constantly, especially over \nthe last few years, as we have cut more and more of our defense budget, \nto do more with less. We are asking them to go on longer deployments \nand more deployments.\n  The state of our military housing is embarrassing. Yet, the President \nis very proud to submit a military budget that has no increases. I \nwatched this morning the President's news conference, bragging about \nthis small, limited little Government we have, that we have cut \nGovernment. Well, again, as I said last week, I don't know how he \nmeasures the cutting of Government, but the fact is we are going to \nspend $1.7 trillion on this Government this year. The Defense \nDepartment budget continually gets hammered and hammered. There has \nbeen no increase, but a 40 percent reduction in the last 10 years.\n  Health care. What have we done about health care for our retirees? We \nhave done nothing. We have essentially taken away the promise that we \nmade to these men and women in uniform, who served our country in time \nof war and peace, and now we are saying you need to get into the \nMedicare queue. I am sorry we cut back on military hospitals and on \nmilitary personnel. Don't we understand that this may well inhibit \nreadiness, retention, recruitment, and the best people for the \nmilitary? Of course, it will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  In closing, Mr. President, this is a bad signal and a bad symptom. I \nhope that the Congress of the United States addresses this issue.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the provisions of ISTEA, the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act, expired on September 30, 1997. \nThe Senate took up the ISTEA reauthorization bill on October 8, 1997, \nbut between that date and October 29, the Senate was unable to adopt \neven one substantive amendment due to the impasse over Senate \nconsideration of campaign finance reform legislation. As a consequence, \nthe six-year ISTEA Bill was taken down and returned to the calendar.\n  Finally, on November 10, the Senate passed a short-term extension of \nour existing highway and transit programs, thus delaying the completion \nof Senate action on our nation's surface transportation policy until \nthe second session of the 105th Congress, the first week of which has \nnow passed into history. Despite the stated intentions last November of \nthe distinguished Majority Leader to take up the ISTEA reauthorization \nbill, S. 1173, at the beginning of this session, the bill has not been \ntaken up, it is not before the Senate, and we are still operating on \nthe short-term extension.\n  With each passing day, I am increasingly concerned that the Senate \nmay not return to the ISTEA reauthorization bill until after action is \ncompleted on the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution, which may not \noccur until late spring.\n  I supported the enactment of the short-term extension bill back in \nNovember, but, as I said then, it was only a stopgap measure, and it \nprovided only for one-half year of funding for our existing highway \nprogram, the highway safety programs, and the transit programs. \nMeanwhile, the various highway departments in the 50 states cannot \nestablish a budget for the current fiscal year because they do not know \nthe final level of federal resources they will receive even for this \nfiscal year which ends on September 30. The short-term extension bill \nwill expire at the end of March, when the advent of spring will have \nmade its appearance. Whether a new short-term extension of our highway \nprograms will occur by the end of March is highly questionable. \nMeantime, how can the Governors and the highway departments of 50 \nstates plan for the construction season that will soon be opening \nthroughout the country? It is a classic case of dawdling and indecision \nin Washington which is throwing our states into highway planning and \nbudget limbo!\n  Dante, the author of ``The Divine Comedy'', in Canto IV, described \nLimbo, as the ``first circle of Hell.'' This, it seems to me, is a very \napt description of the situation in which the Governors and heads of \nhighway departments throughout the states now find themselves as they \nattempt to budget and plan for the upcoming construction season, and \ntheir situation may very well become worse than hell as, more and more, \nthey find themselves unable to do any long-term budgeting and planning \nin respect to highway construction.\n  They cannot develop and implement any long-term financing plan \nbecause they do not know the level of federal resources that will be \navailable to them over the five years following the current fiscal \nyear. This is an impossible situation for our state highway \ndepartments. Given the costs and the duration of major highway \nprojects, and the complexities associated with short construction \nseasons in our cold weather states, planning and predictability are \nessential to the logical functioning of our Federal-Aid Highway \nprogram. That kind of rational planning is precisely what our states \ncannot do at this time because of the inaction of Congress regarding \nthe highway bill. This is not how our state and local transportation \nagencies should have to do business. It is, nonetheless, the precise \ncircumstance in which our transportation agencies are being placed due \nto the failure of Congress to enact a multiyear ISTEA reauthorization \nbill in a timely manner.\n  It is not only unreasonable, it is also very unfair, for Congress--\nbecause of inaction--to place this burden upon the Governors, the \nMayors, and the highway agencies throughout the country.\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\n Plainly speaking, Congress is shirking its responsibility!\n  Meantime, while Congress sits on its hands, Americans who buy \ngasoline are continuing to pay a 4.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax every \ntime they drive up to the pump. That gas tax previously went to deficit \nreduction, but it is now being deposited in the highway trust fund, and \nCongress should pass legislation to authorize that it be spent on our \nnation's considerable highway needs. The money from these gas taxes is \naccumulating in the highway trust fund, but Congress has passed no \nlegislation authorizing it to be spent for surface transportation \nneeds. The American people have been told by the Congress that monies \nin the highway trust fund would be spent for highways and other surface \ntransportation needs.\n  And as long as Congress fails to live up to its commitment the \nAmerican people are being misled. As long as Congress fails to live up \nto its commitment, the American people are being duped into believing \nthat the gas taxes in the highway trust fund will be spent on highway \nconstruction and other transportation needs, but Congress, meanwhile, \ndillydallies, sits on its hands, and lets these tax revenues build up \nin the highway trust fund. It amounts to an abuse of the trust which \nthe American people have placed in us. Meanwhile, the potholes deepen, \nthe asphalt chasms open wider, and danger stalks our nation's highways.\n  By the end of this fiscal year, more than seven billion dollars in \nadditional new revenues will have been deposited into the highway trust \nfund, not one penny of which is, as of this moment, authorized to be \nspent on highway construction and other surface transportation needs \nunder the committee reported ISTEA bill.\n  Instead, these funds will continue to sit in the highway trust fund, \nearning interest, and being used as an offset to the federal deficits--\nif, indeed, they are not siphoned off, in the meantime, and used for \npurposes other than highway and other surface transportation needs.\n  The time to act on the highway bill is now! The first week of the \nsecond session has gone with the wind. We are now into the second week. \nThe clock is ticking and the calendar is running. The highway \nconstruction seasons will soon be upon us, and yet, as of this moment, \nthere is no indication that Congress will return to the highway bill.\n  I hope that the Governors, who will soon be meeting in the Nation's \nCapital, will contact the leadership in both Houses and request that \nthe highway bill be taken up immediately. I hope that the Mayors and \nthe state highway departments will do the same. The first day of spring \nis only seven weeks away, and Congress must begin promptly to debate \nthe highway bill in both houses if we are even to hope that the bill \ncan be enacted by the time that ``the lark's on the wing'' and ``the \nsnail's on the thorn.'' It should be done. But it can be done only if \nthe leadership will bring up the bill. I respectfully urge the Senate \nleadership to do that promptly.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S246-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S247-S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES FREEDOM TO CONTRACT ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to provide a brief update for my \ncolleagues this morning on the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom To \nContract Act.\n  This is the bill which has 46 cosponsors in the Senate, 150-some \ncosponsors in the House, led by the chairman of the House Ways and \nMeans committee, Bill Archer, to restore the freedom to America's \nsenior citizens to seek the medical care they desire rather than to be \ndictated to by the Medicare Program to only receive that care under \nMedicare that they may desire.\n  Here is the situation as it evolved. Mr. President, up until January \n1st of this year, senior citizens in this country had always had the \nright under Medicare to go to the doctor of their choice, and if they \nwanted to be treated outside of Medicare they could do that. Of course, \nMedicare couldn't pay the bill. But that freedom always existed. As of \na couple of years ago, the administration began to threaten physicians \nsaying that they had to submit all bills for senior citizens to \nMedicare. The rationale was that anybody over 65 was ``Medicare \neligible'' because they were 65, and if they were ``Medicare eligible'' \nthen a doctor had to submit the bill to Medicare. So physicians began \nbeing concerned that they couldn't treat people outside of Medicare \neven though that had always been the patient's right and the \nphysician's right.\n  To ensure that situation wouldn't continue, I introduced an amendment \nlast year during the negotiations--during the time we were negotiating \nthe balanced budget amendment--and it passed here under a vote of 64 to \n35 to ensure that patients had the right to ``privately contract,'' as \nit is called, and go to the doctor of their choice; not necessarily to \ngo to Medicare, if they didn't want to. That amendment passed. It \nbecame part of the Medicare portion of the balanced budget amendment. \nBut in the middle of the night some negotiators from the House and \nSenate caved in to the President's demands that if the Kyl amendment \nstayed in then the entire balanced budget amendment would be vetoed \nand, therefore, caved into his demands that a special limitation be \nplaced on any physician providing this care; namely, that the physician \nhad to get rid of all of his or her Medicare patients for a 2-year \nperiod in advance or you couldn't treat the person outside of Medicare. \nThat is what went into effect January 1st.\n  This legislation that I just reported on will remove that 2-year \nrequirement so that the patient has the freedom to go to the doctor of \nhis or her choice. Even though you are over 65 years old, you don't \nhave to be treated under the Medicare system if you do not want to be, \nand the physician has the right to take care of you without getting rid \nof his or her other Medicare patients.\n  When did this situation arise? There are a lot of different \nsituations. Take for example the psychiatric patient who doesn't want \nthe records in Medicare to reveal the kind of treatment that patient \nhas been receiving. Under the current administration plan--Medicare or \nno care--you either do it under Medicare or you don't get the \ntreatment. No doctor can take care of you. Our bill would say no. You \ncan go outside of Medicare and be treated. Again, you have to pay the \nbill--not the taxpayer. But you can do it.\n  Another case: You are in a small town. There are not that many \nspecialists. You need specialty care. You go to a doctor who says, ``I \nam not taking any more Medicare patients. The President and the \nCongress have cut our payments so much that it don't pay me anymore. In \nfact, I lose money on every one. I will take care of the ones that I \nhave, but I am not going to see any more new Medicare patients.'' This \nenables the patient to say, ``Fine. Just bill me. I will pay you. We \nwill save Medicare the money.'' And that will be the end of it.\n  Another situation: You want to go to that specialist. Maybe it is a \nperson who is on a university faculty who is not taking Medicare \npatients, and you want to be treated by that person because it is the \none person that can save your life or your spouse's life. You ought to \nhave the right to do that in this country. Under the current law that \nwouldn't be possible.\n  So our legislation restores the right of senior citizens--and all the \nrest of us have this right--to go to the doctor of their choice, and if \nthey want to be treated outside of the Medicare system have the right \nto do that. It does not enable the doctor to charge more money to \nMedicare. Whatever the doctor charges they have to pay outside of the \nMedicare Program.\n  So this is not going to be used very often, I suspect. But in those \nsituations where people really want to take advantage of their freedom \nin contract they ought to have the right to so.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, this is not something that is just of \nconcern for America's senior citizens, because all of us should be \nconcerned about a fundamental right being taken away from us--the right \nto provide the health care that we want for ourselves or our families.\n  As the President is talking about making Medicare available to more \nand more people at younger and younger ages, I would have to ask them: \nIs it such a good deal to buy into Medicare when the first thing that \nhappens when you do that is you give up a basic right that you have \ntoday--that every one of\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\nus has today--but doesn't exist for somebody who is 65 years old or \nolder because they are Medicare eligible? It is not a good bargain.\n  So what I am hoping is that the Finance Committee will hold hearings \nlater this month--those hearings have already been set, I understand, \nby Senator Roth--and that there will be legislation coming to the \nfloor, and our bill coming to the Senate floor very soon thereafter. \nAnd sometime in the early spring we can pass on to the President a bill \nwhich will restore the right of all seniors in this country to go to \nthe doctor of their choice without being told by Medicare that they \ncan't do that; that, in effect, it is either Medicare or no care. That \nis un-American. It is wrong. It denies the basic right of all \nAmericans. And we need to ensure that we can correct that problem \nthrough the passage of the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom Contract Act.\n  In closing, if any one of my colleagues who have not done so already \nwould like to sponsor the legislation, please see me because we will be \nmoving forward on this very quickly.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Byrd has already spoken about the \nhighway bill. I want to amplify on what he has said.\n  When you go to the filling station and you pull up your car or truck \nand you take out that pump and stick it into your gasoline tank, now \nmost filling stations don't have the little clip on the bottom. So you \nhave to stand out there and pump it. Probably most people have done \nwhat I have done. And that is while you are standing there you read \nwhat is written on the gasoline pump. What is written on the gasoline \npump is sort of bad news and good news. The bad news is that a third of \nthe cost of a gallon of gasoline in this country on average is taxes. \nThe good news is, as it says right on the gasoline pump, that every \npenny you pay in gasoline taxes is going to build roads.\n  The problem that Senator Byrd and I are talking about today and the \nproblem which we are trying to fix is that the bad news is true. A \nthird of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. But the good news--\nthat it is spent on roads--is not true. In fact, today over 25 cents \nout of every dollar collected in gasoline taxes goes to general \nGovernment. It funds programs that have absolutely nothing to do with \nhighways, transportation, or with gasoline taxes.\n\n  My colleagues will remember--perhaps some people in the country that \nfollow the debate will remember--that last year I offered an amendment \nto the tax bill that took the 4.3 cents a gallon tax on gasoline that \nhad been part of the President's 1993 tax increase, and took that money \naway from general revenue and put it back into the highway trust fund \nwhere it belongs.\n  That became the law of the land last October 1st. It went into \neffect. It went into the highway trust fund. Senator Byrd and I are \ntrying to take a final step which we view as an honesty-in-Government \nstep, and that is to require that the money that we collect in gasoline \ntaxes be spent on roads. Those who oppose this amendment are trying to \ndelay its consideration to get it commingled with the budget so that it \nsimply can be portrayed as another competition for available money, and \nperhaps an effort to bust the budget.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that the amendment which Senator Byrd \nand I have offered specifically does not bust the spending caps. All we \nare doing is asking that the money that we collect in gasoline taxes be \nspent for the purpose that we are telling the American people that the \nmoney will be spent. That would require us over the next 5 years to \nreallocate 1.4 percent of nondefense discretionary spending, and by \nreallocating it guarantee that the money goes to the purpose that we \nsaid that the money would go when we collected it at the gasoline pump.\n  We have 50 cosponsors. I urge my colleagues to join us in this \neffort. I urge our leadership to not commingle this with the budget. We \nhave a highway bill to write. The current highway bill will terminate \non May 1. Money will not be available for construction after that time \nunless we act.\n  I think it is important that we bring the bill up and that we have an \nup-or-down vote on honesty in Government, and that vote is, do you \nbelieve the gasoline tax, which we tell people goes to road \nconstruction, should actually go for that purpose? I believe it should. \nThat is why I am a cosponsor with Senator Byrd, Senator Baucus, Senator \nWarner, and many others in this effort to basically require that \ngasoline taxes be spent on roads.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I see the Senator from Texas. I would ask \nhim, although it would elicit probably too long a response, if he has \never done anything that is really politically stupid. And I am sure he \nhas either knowingly or not knowingly--as I am about to do--done \nsomething that would fall into the category of political stupidity.\n  Tomorrow an execution is scheduled to take place at 6 p.m. in the \nState of Texas. The young lady's name is Karla Faye Tucker. It happens \nwe have an individual we know in common, so I became somewhat familiar \nwith this case, and I will just give a thumbnail sketch as to what \nhappened.\n  Karla Faye Tucker, when she was a very, very small child, went into \nheroine at age 10. She is the daughter of a prostitute. Karla Faye went \ninto prostitution when she was 13 years old. She never had a childhood, \nI guess we could say. Fourteen years ago, while living in a drug cult, \nan individual on a motorcycle came riding into her living room, \ndripping oil and breaking things and stealing things and rode out. And \nthe next day, Karla and an accomplice broke into the apartment of the \nmotorcycle rider, who was in bed with a girl, and murdered both of \nthem--a brutal murder.\n  I do not think there is anyone in the Senate who has a stronger \nrecord and background in punishment as a deterrent to crime than I \nhave, nor is there anyone here who has been more active in establishing \nstronger death penalties than I have. The Furman case took place in \n1972, and that is what struck down most of the States' capital \npunishment laws. I was in the State Senate at that time, and for 5 \nconsecutive years I was the author of the capital punishment bill in \nthe State of Oklahoma. I have always felt that punishment should be \nsevere, it should be swift, and it should be equal.\n  We had a person who became very famous after 15 years on death row, \nRoger Dale Stafford, who brutally murdered nine Oklahomans. This guy \nwas left on death row for 15 years. No one ever questioned that he was \nguilty. He never had any remorse. He just sat there and got fat. He \ngained 100 pounds while he was in there watching color TV. I have often \nsaid the longer the length of time between the conviction, the sentence \nto death and the carrying out of that sentence, the less that \npunishment serves as a deterrent to crime. So I have always felt that \npunishment should be carried out immediately.\n  But as I watched developments unfold with Karla Faye Tucker, I came \nto the conclusion that I have reached in a very unusual way. It is \nsomething I never thought I would do. It occurred to me that if Carla \nFaye Tucker had been a man, Carl Tucker, already either he would have \nbeen executed or would have been commuted to life and we would never \nhave even known about it. Nobody would have cared.\n  The controversy that has been stirring around this--which I think \nprobably would have gotten a lot more controversial if it had not been \nfor the sex scandal that has dominated the media in recent days--was, I \nthink, primarily because Karla Faye Tucker is a woman. It would not \nhave happened if Karla Faye Tucker had not been a woman. Now there is \nall the public and\n\n[[Page S249]]\n\npolitical pressure to execute this person for this heinous crime she \ncommitted that I don't think there would be if she had not been a \nwoman.\n  I took the time a few weeks ago through the Richmond Law Review to \ncheck to see how many cases have been commuted to life imprisonment \nfrom death row since the Furman case of 1972. I found that there have \nbeen 76 cases. I have not reviewed all of these cases because I have \nnot had the time to do it, but I did look at several of them. I found \nthat there are a lot of circumstances in the Tucker case that were \nsimilar to those which caused these other cases to be commuted, 76 of \nthem since 1972. And I will use as an example, in the State of Georgia, \nWilliam Neil Moore whose sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.\n  There were several reasons, but the four that kept coming up in his \ncase were, No. 1, an exemplary prison record; No. 2, a strong feeling \nand expression of remorse for the crime he committed; No. 3, a \nreligious conversion; and, No. 4, pleas from the families of the \nvictims of the crime for clemency. I looked at Karla's case to find \nthat all four of those are there, but it is much more so than it was in \nthe case of William Neil Moore whose sentence was commuted to life \nimprisonment.\n  In the Tucker case, it is not just the sister of one of the victims \nand the brother of the other, but three of the four prosecutors who \nhave made a plea for clemency. The homicide detective, J.C. Moser, the \nguy who put her away, has quite a passionate story that he tells on how \nhe has never felt any kind of remorse for anyone he has sent up and now \nhe is lined up with several others. Even the prison guards have \nactually passed a petition around asking for clemency.\n  I have a letter here I just received this morning from Mr. W.C. \nKirkendall, who is from Seguin, Tx. I will read the first and last two \nsentences of this letter. This is a letter of December 9 to Governor \nBush. ``I have been a prosecutor since 1984, favor the death penalty in \nthe appropriate cases and have prosecuted many people who I believe \ndeserved the ultimate penalty that society can inflict.''\n  The last paragraph says, ``In sum, there is nothing that her \nexecution will accomplish and much that commuting her sentence to life \nwill do to show both the efficacy and justice of the Texas death \npenalty system. Please spare her life.''\n  In this letter he goes into all kinds of detail as to how strong he \nfeels about the death penalty and why he would be asking the Governor \nfor an exception in this case.\n  Having looked at this, I think there can be a case made that if Karla \nFaye Tucker had been Carl Tucker, there would not have been all of the \npublic and political pressure applied to demand the death penalty.\n  We went through something very similar in Oklahoma. In Oklahoma 2 \nyears ago we had the most cruel, I guess, mass murder or terrorist act \nin the history of America when 168 innocent Oklahomans were murdered. \nAnd Timothy McVeigh went through the necessary trials, and they found \nhim to be guilty, and they gave him the death sentence. And then Terry \nNichols, who was an accomplice in the case, went through the trial, and \nthey did not give him the death penalty.\n  I never try to second-guess what juries do. I had an experience \nmyself back in the 1970's after the Furman case. I was in the State \nSenate, and I was the author of the death penalty bill, and I was \ncalled for jury duty. There I was. And it was a murder case. And so \nwhen they were trying to decide whether or not we should qualify as \njurors, they asked me a series of questions. I said, ``Look, I can save \nyou a lot of time. I am a member of the State senate. I am the author \nof the death penalty bill. I already know this guy is guilty. I have \nbeen reading about it, and the guy ought to fry.''\n  They did not disqualify me, and I ended up being the chairman of the \njury that acquitted him. So a long time ago I stopped trying to second-\nguess the decision. Anyway, in the case of Terry Nichols, they did not \ndo that. I wondered quite a bit since this case came up if Terry \nNichols had been a female, would there have been so much pressure \napplied to everyone who would be listening to make sure that Terry \nNichols got the death penalty because we didn't want an exception being \nmade because Terry Nichols might have been a woman.\n\n  And so I look at what's happened. Just a few minutes ago, the Texas \nPardons and Parole Board made a decision, and I think it was a decision \nthat we all knew they would make, that they would deny any clemency to \nKarla Faye Tucker. In fact, a guy named Victor Rodriquez--I do not \nhappen to know him, he is the chairman of the Texas Pardons and Parole \nBoard--said way back on the 6th of January on the ``Rivera Live'' show \nthat it did not make any difference what they came up with, that he was \nnot going to be willing to offer commutation to Karla Faye Tucker. And \nthe commutation petition was not even filed until January 22. So that \ndecision has been already made. It was a done deal. And, of course, \nthey came out and said she should not be granted clemency.\n  I do know Governor Bush. He is a very fair and very compassionate \nindividual. I have looked at the constitution of the State of Texas. It \nis a little bit different. It gives a lot more power to the Pardons and \nParole Board than some of the other States, but in the case of the \nTexas Pardons and Parole Board, after they have said they would deny \nclemency, article 4, section 11, of which I will read one sentence that \nis significant, says:\n\n       The Governor shall have the power to grant one reprieve in \n     any capital case for a period not to exceed 30 days.\n\n  All Governor Bush can do right now is to make that recommendation. \nAnd during that time he would be able to look at some of these cases. \nWhat I think I would do, if I were the Governor of Texas, and knowing \nwhat I know so far, is go ahead and grant that 30 days reprieve; \nnothing would really be lost by that, and then in the meantime during \nthat period of time I would send for--in fact, I would be glad to send \nthem to him--the 76 cases in America where clemency has been offered in \nthe form of commutation of a death sentence into life imprisonment and \nthen look at the standards to see if those standards are not at least \nmet or exceeded by Karla Faye Tucker. I think he would be able to do \nthat.\n  In the absence of that, of course, tomorrow at 6 o'clock Karla Faye \nTucker will be executed. I hate to think that we would wake up on \nWednesday morning and go back and start researching and find that those \nstandards were at least met or exceeded. I guess we could call this \ngender backlash.\n  The other day I was watching someone on TV--I cannot remember who it \nwas right now, but they said on the 3d of February at 6 o'clock Karla \nFaye Tucker will be executed in Texas and O.J. Simpson will be playing \ngolf.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise, with all due respect, to ask the \nmajority leader to reconsider the schedule which he has set so that we \ntake up the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act, otherwise known as \nISTEA, right away rather than deferring it as presently seems to be the \ncase. I say this because our States, contractors, all of our people who \ndepend on highways, very much depend upon the Congress to reauthorize \nthe highway bill. Unfortunately, we have yet to do that.\n  The current program, as we know, expired last year on September 30. \nHowever, despite the fact that the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee favorably reported a six-year reauthorization in October, \nneither the full Senate or the House considered it. Instead, we were \nforced to pass a temporary, stopgap, 6-month extension, which expires \nMay 1.\n  Mr. President, if the current schedule holds, that is, if the highway \nbill is not brought up until after the budget resolution, there is a \nstrong possibility that Congress may not pass a highway bill until \nshortly before it adjourns this year, which is in October.\n  That result would be totally unacceptable. It would be unacceptable \nto our people, to our contractors, and to our highway workers. And it \nwould be unacceptable to me. Frankly, it would not be a responsible way \nto conduct our Nation's business. Senators should understand just how \nlong it takes a\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\nState highway commission and contractors to plan these projects. It \ncertainly requires months and in many cases it takes years. \nFurthermore, State legislatures must set their budgets so they can come \nup with the funds to match the Federal highway funds. This takes time, \nespecially if a legislature meets once every two years. Transportation \nprojects are not something you just turn on and turn off like a spigot. \nOur current course is very disruptive.\n  All this is critically important because States cannot obligate funds \nfor highways unless obligation authority is provided by law. Our \ncurrent 6-month extension expires May 1. After May 1, States will be \nunable to enter into contracts for their highway programs. That will \nbring hundreds of projects to a stop, with the resulting loss of jobs.\n  We might ask, Why doesn't Congress pass another short-term extension? \nFirst, that is an on-again-off-again way of doing business. No business \nwould operate like that. And government shouldn't either. We are \nplaying with people's livelihoods if we continue this ``on-again-off-\nagain,'' strategy by passing a series of short term extensions.\n  Second, there is no guarantee that Congress can easily pass another \nshort-term extension. That's because it would probably take unanimous \nconsent in the Senate so that we limit amendments. We know some states \nlike the current formula and others like the new formula. As we get \ncloser to the election, it will be increasingly difficult to get \nSenators to refrain from offering amendments to change the formula. I'm \nsure most of my colleagues can appreciate how incredibly difficult it \nwould be to quickly pass another simple extension under those \ncircumstances. And even if we could, it would be continuing a bad on-\nagain-off-again policy.\n  We have only 49 days in session until May 1. The bill is going to \ntake a couple or three weeks in the Senate. The House must pass its \nversion of the bill. Then we have to go to conference. That is a lot to \ndo in just 49 days. So it is all the more reason to start as soon as we \ncan in the Senate.\n  Furthermore, we don't have a lot of business before us right now. \nThere is nothing that is so urgent, except the highway bill. The \nhighway bill is urgent. It is just common sense that if something is \nboth important and urgent, we should be devoting our attention to it. \nWell, the ISTEA legislation is both urgent and important. We should \ntake it up now, not later.\n  I know the majority leader has lots of competing considerations here. \nOne is the budget and how to handle the expected surplus. Should we pay \noff the debt? Lower taxes? Increase spending for priority programs? \nSecure Social Security and Medicare? Invest in our transportation \ninfrastructure? I understand the argument that some are making: Let's \nput the highway bill off so we do it all together, all at once. The \nproblem with that is very simple, it means we will probably not have a \nhighway bill until September. And in the meantime, we will be hamstrung \nwith formula fights and other issues on short-term extensions. As I \nsaid before, we all know the closer we get to the end of this year, to \nelections, the more difficult it is because then the formula fights \namong States become more real.\n  I think there are ways to work this out. Basically, we have to sit \ndown with people on both sides of the argument here and find some way \nto resolve this to get the highway bill up.\n  I also might add that this is not just a highway bill. It is a mass \ntransit bill. For those people in our country who live in the more \npopulated States where mass transit is more important than it is in \nmore rural States like Montana where I come from, they must know the \ntransit legislation is an integral part of the ISTEA bill.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Actually, the Senator's 5 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, may I have 2 more minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is highways that are being postponed; \nit is transit being postponed; it is all the safety programs that are \nin the highway bill that are being postponed; it is the intermodal \nconnections. My friend Senator Moynihan is the father of the ISTEA \nbill. All his good work will be on hold until we can reauthorize the \nprogram. Senator Dorgan has been very helpful in this matter, as has \nSenator Byrd, Senator Gramm, Senator Warner--many of us want the \nhighway bill up now. Our basic point is let's just bring it up now \nwhile we have the time. Otherwise we are going to be caught in a \nsituation where delay upon delay means the ISTEA bill is not \nreauthorized until September or October.\n  So I close by asking the majority leader to again look at the \nconsequences of delaying the highway bill and to reconsider his \ndecision, because this is a very, very serious matter and I hope we can \nfind a way to avoid these kinds of disruptions. I am willing to work \nwith the leadership, with Senators Chafee and Warner, and other members \nto accomplish that objective.

Mr. President, I want to talk about the Clinton budget \nwhich was sent to Congress this morning. I want to try to outline \nbasically what the budget does in terms of spending and taxes. I want \nto talk a little bit about the tobacco settlement. I want to talk about \nprotecting Social Security. And I want to note that it is very \nimportant for people, in understanding the President's budget, to look \nbeyond just the cover page, because the President's budget has a number \nof new programs that are funded by offsetting receipts and, as is \nusually true when a Government document is half as high as you are, \nthere is a lot of hidden agenda, hidden spending, hidden taxes in the \nPresident's budget. My staff and I have spent yesterday evening and \nthis morning going over the President's plan. I am not sure we have \nferreted out all the new spending and all the new taxes, but we have \nnumbers and I think they are important.\n  First of all, the President proposes $130 billion of new spending \nprograms. That is a larger scale of new Government spending than has \nbeen contemplated by any budget since 1994 when the President proposed \nhaving the Government take over and run the health care system. If you \nexclude the health care proposal, where the President proposed that the \nGovernment on a massive scale take over and run the health care system, \nyou have to go all the way back to at least the Carter administration \nto find a budget that proposes the massive increases in social programs \nthat are contained in the Clinton budget. Interestingly enough, when \nyou look at the Clinton budget it claims to spend $1.733 trillion, but \nin reality, as large as that number is and as substantial as that \nincrease is over last year, there is at least another $42 billion that \nis hidden in spending that is offset by fees and by asset sales, so \nthat in reality the budget spends $1.775 trillion, which makes it far \nand away the largest budget ever submitted in the history of America.\n  I think it is startling to note that the President's budget contains \n$115 billion worth of new taxes. Some of these taxes are called by \ndifferent names, but they all represent taxpayers paying more in taxes, \nmore in fees, more for the things they buy so that Government can spend \nmore as their real purchasing power is less. There is some tax relief \nin the President's budget: $24 billion. But when you add it all up it \nis a net tax increase of a whopping $91 billion.\n  What I think is amazing about this tax increase, which is the largest \ntax increase since President Clinton proposed his tax increase in 1993, \nis that the tax burden on American workers is higher today than it has \never been in the history of our Republic. Not during the peak of the \nwar effort in the Civil War, not during the peak of the war effort in \nWorld War II, did the average American citizens send 30.5 cents out of \nevery dollar they earn to government at some level before. This year \nAmerican families on average will send 30.5 cents out of every dollar \nthey earn to government, which will spend it on\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\ntheir behalf and supposedly in their interests. It is amazing to me \nthat the President, when we are facing the highest tax burden in \nAmerican history, would be talking about another $91 billion of net \ntaxes.\n\n  Let me talk about the tobacco settlement. The President is counting \non $65 billion of revenues coming from the tobacco settlement and, \nexcept for a tiny amount--$800 million which is spent on Medicare--this \n$65 billion goes to an array of new spending programs that have \nabsolutely nothing to do with the tobacco settlement. I want to remind \nmy colleagues and anyone who is interested in this issue that the whole \nlogic of the tobacco settlement is that the tobacco companies, by \nselling tobacco to consumers, and through the health effects of \nsmoking, have imposed a massive cost on the Federal taxpayer. But where \nhas that cost occurred? It has not occurred in child care, it has not \noccurred in new school buildings, it has not occurred in the cost of \nnew teachers--it has occurred in mounting costs for Medicare. \nInterestingly enough, while the States are big beneficiaries in their \nMedicaid Program from the tobacco settlement, for every $1 of cost \nimposed on Medicaid by people smoking in the past, there have been \nperhaps $6 of costs imposed on Medicare.\n  So I believe if we have a tobacco settlement, that money ought to be \nput to a noble cause and that cause is saving Medicare, not just for \nour parents but for our children. I don't think we ought to take money \nin the name of reimbursing the taxpayer for medical care costs that \nhave been borne through Medicare and spend that money on other things. \nI believe, if there is a tobacco settlement, that the money ought to go \nto save Medicare and I intend, as chairman of the subcommittee with \njurisdiction over Medicare, to fight to see that any tobacco settlement \ngoes to Medicare, that it doesn't just become a grab bag to fund new \nGovernment programs that have nothing to do with the health effects of \ntobacco.\n  The President says that he wants to use the surplus to save Social \nSecurity. No. 1, I think the President's words ring hollow when you \nnote that he is busting the spending caps that we agreed to last year \nin a bipartisan budget. I am sure some of my colleagues will remember \nthat I thought the spending level was too high in last year's budget. \nIn fact, last year in writing that budget we broke the spending caps of \nthe budget that President Clinton had pushed through Congress in 1993. \nBut now the President is already trying to break the agreement that we \nadopted last year, and I reject that.\n  Finally, I don't know how the President can claim to be saving Social \nSecurity when the Social Security system will pay in $600 billion more \ninto the Social Security trust fund than will be spent on Social \nSecurity, and the President spends $400 billion of the $600 billion. I \nbelieve we need to set up a program to take that $600 billion and \ninvest it in Social Security by making real investments that are owned \nby the individual worker so that young Americans will have some chance \nof getting some benefits from Social Security.\n  So I believe the President's budget breaks the agreement that he \nentered into with Congress last year. The President's budget breaks the \nspending caps. The President's budget proposes the largest increase in \nspending contemplated by Government since he proposed having the \nGovernment take over and run the health care system. The President \nproposes the largest tax increase, $91 billion, larger than the tax cut \nfrom last year--he proposes the largest tax increase contemplated by \nour Government since 1993. The President takes $400 billion that will \nbe paid into the Social Security trust fund and spends it on general \nGovernment under this budget. I believe that should be stopped.\n  Finally, if we have a tobacco settlement, the money ought to go to \nsave Medicare, it ought not to go to fund general Government.\n  So, I believe the President is breaking the deal that he made with \nCongress. I believe your word is your bond on these matters.\n  I am opposed to the President's budget. I think we should hold the \nline on spending. I think whatever surpluses we have, A, we ought not \nto do anything with them until we have them, and, B, when we do have \nthem, we should use them to make real investments so that our young \nworkers will have some benefit from Social Security, a program that \nthey will pay into their entire working lives.

Mr. President, we have had this afternoon several Members \nrise to talk about ISTEA funding. I rise to support the things that \nthey have said. One of the most important bills that we passed in our \ncommittee last year, and I think one of the most important elements \nbefore us now in the Senate, is the funding of the Intermodal \nTransportation Act.\n  We worked a great deal last year. I happen to be on the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, and we came up with an extension of the \nISTEA bill, which expired last year, by the way. Now, of course, we are \noperating on a temporary arrangement, which makes it very difficult for \nState highway departments to make the contracts that are necessary. I \nthink it is particularly important for States like Wyoming and the \nnorthern part of the country, where you have a relatively small short \ncontracting and construction time, that we move to pass this bill so \nthat the States will know what money is available to them.\n  There should have been approval last year, other than an extension. \nUnfortunately, we couldn't come to an agreement with the House. \nFurthermore, right here in the Senate, as I recall, there were some \nthings that were brought up that kept us from considering ISTEA. But \nnow it is time to do that.\n  We also have before us a proposal to extend the authority for \nspending, to use more of the dollars that are collected, and I agree \nwith that. I have not yet become a sponsor of it, but I, frankly, \npropose to be. We have been spending in the neighborhood of $21 billion \na year on ISTEA, but Federal taxes have been raising more like $27 \nbillion. Now, of course, as a result of last year's budget, we \nconverted the 4.3-cent tax, having gone to the general fund, to now go \nto the highway fund. I support that idea. So it is time for us to do \nthat.\n  I am concerned, of course, that we do it within budget guidelines. I \nam not interested in breaking the budget caps by simply spending. I \nknow when you have a unified budget, if you are going to spend more \nmoney here, you have to make arrangements on the other side, too, which \nrestricts spending. I am for that.\n  I think it is necessary for us to do it. I am sorry that it has been \npostponed. It was my understanding that it would be the first item of \nbusiness to be considered or early, at least, in this session. I know \nthere is controversy now with the budgeteers in terms of how that \nworks, but this is an authorization, as I understand it. It is not an \nexpenditure, of course. It authorizes what will then be put together by \nthe budgeteers and appropriators.\n  Mr. President, I certainly want to endorse the notion that there is \nnothing more important or nothing that needs to be dealt with more \ncurrently than the idea of expanding ISTEA. I hope\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\nthat the leader and others in the leadership will give some \nconsideration to that. I think we can move forward. I know that there \nis not certainty in the House as to the direction they want to take, \nbut I believe passage of the Senate proposal and shipment of it to the \nHouse would cause that to happen. If it is difficult, it is difficult. \nIt is no more difficult now than it will be later. To the contrary, as \nwe get toward the end of this session, it may be even more difficult to \nfind time.\n  I suggest, hope and urge that we bring it to the floor as soon as \npossible, and we resolve that issue so that we can move forward on this \ntransportation question, which is probably one of the most important \neconomic things we do in our States. These dollars go there, they are \ncontracted, they go into business, and we provide a better \ntransportation system.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this month marks the 22nd year the United \nStates has celebrated Black History Month. I want to take this \nopportunity to mark a relevant piece of Senate history. I am proud to \nserve with Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois and to have served with \nEdward Brooke of Massachusetts. These outstanding Senators and African \nAmericans are well known and recognized by those who follow the Senate. \nBut today, I also want to recognize McKinley Wise.\n  Twenty years ago this month, McKinley Wise was asked to work in the \noffice of the Official Reporters of Debates and in March 1978 became \nthe first African American to stand on the Senate floor and record the \nwords of this body.\n  I was privileged to be a Member of the Senate at that time, and I \nknow that this happened not because there was a quota to be achieved \nbut because McKinley Wise's ability qualified him to work on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  In 1978, the Senate was beginning its debate on the Panama Canal \ntreaties. Because this was such an important debate and all Senators \nwere expected to participate, the Chief of the Official Reporters of \nDebate expected long hours and knew that they were going to need more \nstaff. G. Russell Walker, the chief reporter at the time, set out to \nfind qualified people to work part time and help record the Senate's \ndebate. One of those people he recruited was McKinley Wise. Here's how \nMr. Walker explained how Mr. Wise's name came to his attention:\n\n       We had before the Senate in late January the Panama Canal \n     Treaties, and there was a very good possibility of the \n     Senate's having 12- and 14-hour-a-day sessions, and we needed \n     more reporters. I went through our file and saw McKinley \n     Wise's name. He was well qualified, had all the certificates, \n     and seemed to have a good background. I asked for and \n     received authority to call him, to see if he could come down \n     and assist us. It was on Friday, February 24th, when I called \n     him and asked him if he could come in the following Tuesday. \n     Not many reporters could leave their businesses and come to \n     Washington on such short notice, but Mac was there, and he \n     did a magnificent job.\n\n  Mr. President, I remember that very well. And we did have those 12- \nand 14-hour and sometimes longer days. But he was there.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the May \n1978 issue of the Circuit Reporter, the official publication of the \nUnited States Court Reporters Association, be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I bring this to the attention of the Senate \nto highlight not only this moment in the Senate's history, but also to \nnote that qualifications and hard work do count. Although no longer \nworking for the Senate, McKinley Wise has continued to use his skills \nover the past 20 years and is currently working in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania. We spend a lot of time in the Senate talking about \nopportunity and providing every American the same chance at life, \nliberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hard work is the key to success, \nbut people need the opportunity to perform. The Senate gave that \nopportunity to Mac Wise in 1978, and both are better for it.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n  Former U.S. District Court Reporter, First Black Reporter on Senate \n                                 Floor\n\n       February 24, 1978, was the day a dream came true. McKinley \n     (Mac) Wise, a former Official Court Reporter in the United \n     States Court in Philadelphia, Pa., had long dreamed that some \n     day he would have the honor and privilege of being the first \n     black court reporter to serve on the Senate floor--but he \n     thought it was just another of his dreams.\n       G. Russell Walker, Chief Reporter, Official Reporters of \n     Debates, United States Senate, had Mac's name on his list of \n     highly qualified reporters to call upon in an emergency. He \n     made that call to Mac on February 24, inquiring whether Mac \n     could report for temporary duty in connection with the \n     expected lengthy debate on the Panama Canal Treaties.\n       Mac lost no time in rearranging the busy schedule of his \n     reporting firm, McKinley Wise & Associates, Inc., of \n     Philadelphia, and four days after the call he was on his way \n     to achieving another ``first'' in his long career of \n     ``firsts.''\n       When he arrived at the Office of the Official Reporters of \n     Debates, Mac was cordially greeted by all of the reporters, \n     transcribers, and staff, and before he knew what was \n     happening, he was there--on the Senate floor--with his \n     Stenograph machine.\n       A feeling of awe came over Mac when he realized that here \n     he was at last, sitting among this august and distinguished \n     body of United States Senators. At first, Mac had a \n     supervisor beside him, identifying the speakers, and \n     explaining the procedures. Mac said, ``I was able to conquer \n     the words spoken, but when it came to putting them into the \n     proper format, it was an art to which I had never been \n     exposed. In the beginning I felt inept, but said to myself, \n     `The job must do done', and I did it.''\n       Everything went along smoothly until the arrival of Morning \n     Business, which was somewhat like taking pleas before a \n     magistrate. The proceedings go very rapidly, because it is \n     usually routine to the lawmakers, with deviations coming \n     later in the office where proper headlines and sub-headlines \n     are inserted.\n       Mac said that the cooperation of his colleagues overwhelmed \n     him, and that their knowledge on just about any subject was \n     astounding. No one was ever too busy to take time to answer \n     any question that Mac had.\n       Mac said, ``I think that being the first black reporter on \n     the Senate floor, especially at a time when a debate of \n     critical importance to the country was taking place, is \n     something which I will never forget. It isn't often that one \n     of your wildest dreams comes true.''\n       Mr. Walker, Chief Reporter of the Official Reporters of \n     Debates, confirmed the fact that McKinley Wise was the first \n     black or any other minority reporter to serve on the Senate \n     floor. Walker said that, to his knowledge, no black or \n     minority reporter has yet served on the floor of the House.\n       When asked how he came to call Mac Wise, Mr. Walker \n     replied, ``We had before the Senate in late January the \n     Panama Canal treaties, and there was a very good possibility \n     of the Senate having 12 and 14-hour-a-day sessions, and we \n     needed more reporters. I went through our file and saw \n     McKinley Wise's name. He was well-certified, with all of the \n     certificates, well-qualified, and he seemed to have a good \n     background.\n       ``I asked for and received authority to call him, which I \n     did, to see if he could come down and assist us. It was a \n     Friday when I called Mac, asking if he could come in the \n     following Tuesday. Not many reporters could leave their \n     business and come to Washington on short notice, but Mac was \n     there, and he did a magnificent job.''\n       Mr. Walker went on to say, ``Ordinarily, when someone comes \n     into this office as one of the Official Reporters of Debates, \n     he or she is given great in-depth training in all of our \n     forms, and parliamentary procedures, Senate rules, and so \n     forth. I didn't give Mac any of that. We just wanted somebody \n     to write, and write fast, because this is the kind of debate \n     where there was not at that time a lot of parliamentary \n     procedure going on; it was mostly stand-up, straight, hot and \n     heavy debate.\n       ``As I said before, he did a magnificent job.''\n       Mac was born in Jeanrette, Louisiana, but with his parents \n     moved to Port Arthur, Texas, at a very early age. He was \n     graduated from Lincoln High School there, after which he \n     served in the United States Navy, where he was given a \n     stenomask reporting in order to report courts-martial and \n     other related proceedings. Mac found the stenomask \n     unsatisfactory, and while in the Navy started studying \n     stenotype at the Certified School of Stenotype in San \n     Francisco, California, completing his course after being \n     discharged from the Navy.\n       Since then Mac Wise has had a varied reporting career, \n     involving free lance work in New York City, substituting in \n     many of the courts in New York City; serving as an assistant \n     in the Philadelphia County courts,\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\n     free-lancing in Philadelphia, before becoming an Official \n     Court Reporter in the United States District Court in \n     Philadelphia, where he served the Hon. Charles R. Weiner and \n     the Hon. J. William Ditter, Jr., from 1967 to 1975.\n       Mac left his official job to return to the free lance \n     field, and is now the owner of McKinley Wise and Associates, \n     Inc., with a staff of seven certified reporters. Daily copy \n     is the specialty of the firm.\n       During the time when Mac was reporting in the Federal \n     courts in Philadelphia, he was a member of USCRA. He is a \n     member of PSRA and NSRA. Mac is now serving NSRA as Chairman \n     of the Free Lance Committee, as a member of the Advisory \n     Committee, Professional Examination Service, the Committee on \n     Testing, and the Ad Hoc Committee for Professional Standards.\n       Mac is the holder of the following certificates from NSRA, \n     RPR, CP, CM, and in Pennsylvania holds the CSR certificate, \n     as well as being a Qualifier in the PSRA Speed Contest at 280 \n     wpm.\n       USCRA is proud of the fact that one of its former members \n     has achieved the distinction of being the first of his race \n     to serve on the floor of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S252-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S253-S254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE PRESIDENT'S FISCAL YEAR 1999 BUDGET PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to commend the President of the \nUnited States on his budget submission to Congress. For the first time \nsince 1971, a President has proposed a balanced budget. I hope and \nbelieve that this Congress will be the first in almost 30 years, since \n1969, to enact a balanced budget without sacrificing our educational, \nenvironmental, health care and law enforcement priorities.\n  The President noted in his State of the Union speech last week, two \nhistoric pieces of legislation have reduced the deficit to the point \nwhere a balanced budget is now within our grasp: The Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I am \nproud to have voted for both of these historic laws.\n  When President Clinton took office, the deficit was at its highest \npoint ever: $290 billion. But he decided to tackle the runaway deficits \nof previous administrations. In 1993, the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives passed President Clinton's economic plan by the \nslimmest of margins and without a single Republican vote.\n  That was a tough vote around here, but it was the right thing to do. \nI am proud that I voted for it. It reduced the deficit by 75 percent. \nUnfortunately, we were forced to make this historic deficit correction \nwithout the help of a single Republican vote in either the House or the \nSenate.\n  Last year, Democrats and Republicans together made additional deficit \nreduction progress by passing the bipartisan budget agreement to reach \nbalance by 2002.\n  That package included net savings of more than $900 billion over the \nnext ten years. It also secured and strengthened Medicare for our \nseniors and made the largest investment ever in education for our \nchildren.\n  Today, the deficit is at its lowest dollar figure since 1970--$5 \nbillion--and at its lowest point as a percentage of the economy in 30 \nyears. This past year, the Gross Domestic Product grew at its highest \nrate since 1988, unemployment fell to a 24-year low, and inflation \ndropped to levels last seen in the 1960s. Our economy is in the best \nshape in a generation in no small part because of these two historic \ndeficit reduction measures.\n  I am most proud that the President and Congress can achieve a \nbalanced budget this year without demeaning the fundamental charter of \nour democracy, the Constitution of the United States. The proposed \nconstitutional amendment to require a so-called balanced budget did not \nreduce the deficit by a single dollar or move us one inch closer to \nachieving those goals. Rather, it was a political exercise serving only \nto delay and distract--a display in bumper sticker politics.\n  I hope the Senate will learn from this lesson and abandon such \ndestructive efforts for illusionary quick-fixes by constitutional \namendment for the rest of this session and into the future.\n  Instead, Congress working with the President can do the job today.\n  Hard choices and bipartisan cooperation are what is needed. We cannot \nlegislate political courage and responsibility. No amendment to the \nConstitution can supply the people's representatives with these \nessential attributes.\n  Political courage has been an essential ingredient that has helped us \nachieve remarkable deficit reduction over the past six years. We have \nsucceeded in reducing the deficit every year of the past six. We have \ncut the deficit by more than 98 percent in that time while pursuing \nsound economic and strong fiscal policies.\n  Now we need to stay the course and work in a bipartisan way to \nfinally balance the budget. We should now be focusing our attention and \nenergies on the strenuous tasks of building a working consensus on \nbudget priorities and achieving agreement on how to balance the budget.\n  Within a balanced budget, we must reach consensus on strong support \nfor education funding as one of our top priorities. As I watched my \ncolleagues during the State of the Union address, I noticed that those \nwith school-aged children cheered the loudest at the President's \ncontinuing commitment to keep education a national priority. A national \ncommitment to education, however, is not just for the students and \nparents of today; it is for all of us.\n  Only a few decades ago, our students were taught that the countries \nblessed with the most natural resources held the keys to the highest \nstandards of living and the most vibrant economic growth. Today, it is \nthe countries that invest in their ``human capital'' that have the \ngreatest success in the global economy.\n  I applaud the President for investing in our people by making a \nhigher priority of education at all levels--from an expansion of Head \nStart, to access to affordable quality child care, to more teachers in \nthe classroom, to literacy training, to lower fees for college students \nusing loans.\n  The only way to keep our nation strong and successful in the global \nmarketplace is through an educated workforce. To do this children must \nunderstand the basics, the three R's. We need to make sure that \nteachers are trained and have access to continuing training education. \nOnly after this foundation is built will computers and other \ntechnologies in the classroom help students reach their full potential.\n  Technology in the classroom can be a great leveler. On the Internet \nstudents can see Michelangelo's work on ceiling of the Sistine Chapel \nin wonderful detail. Students in the United States can ``chat'' with \nstudents in Japan or South America or even their U.S. senator about \ntheir daily lives to better understand one another.\n  Another great leveler is to ensure that students of all abilities \nhave access to quality education. To this end, I am committed to \nincreasing federal funding for the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA). More than two decades ago the federal government \nmade a commitment to local school districts to provide assistance in \nthis funding, and the federal government has not lived up to its end of \nthe bargain. I am disappointed that the budget did not include an \nincrease for this program. I am committed to working with my colleagues \nas we move through the budget and appropriations process to remedy this \nshortfall.\n  I also find room for improvement with the Administration's proposal \nfor Amtrak. Last year was a critical one for our national passenger \nrailroad. Included in the Taxpayer's Relief Act was a one-time, $2.3 \nbillion infusion of capital, intended to modernize Amtrak and enable it \nto reap sufficient revenues to become self-sufficient. Congress also \npassed a far-reaching Amtrak Reform Bill, which will refine the way \nAmtrak does business for the 21st Century, while making sure that its \nemployees are fairly treated. I am disappointed that the Administration \nhas proposed using a portion of these capital funds, instead, for \nAmtrak's day-to-day operating costs. This would undermine Amtrak's \nmodernization plan and all of the hard work we did last year on these \nproposals. As always, I will work with my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee to try to find ways to ensure that Amtrak \nreceives the resources it needs.\n  Mr. President, on balance, the President has proposed a budget that \nreflects priorities that are good for the nation and that will find \nstrong support by the American people. I am delighted that the \nPresident and Congress can achieve a balanced budget this year while \nserving the needs of the nation. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact the first balanced \nbudget in a generation.\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\n  Mr. President, I see nobody else seeking recognition, so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to note my opposition to the \neffort to overshadow the name of our first President, which graces the \nairport that serves as the gateway to the city bearing his name.\n  Washington National Airport is located in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, the birthplace of George Washington. It lies adjacent to the \ncity of Alexandria, the hometown of George Washington.\n  The people of Alexandria are proud to live in George Washington's \ncity and have asked this Congress not to displace Washington's name on \nthe airport.\n  In fact, the original airport terminal, whose facade reflects the \ndesign of Mount Vernon's portico, was preserved when the airport was \nrecently renovated.\n  The people of Arlington County, the local municipality that surrounds \nWashington National Airport, have expressed their strong opposition as \nwell.\n  The Greater Washington Board of Trade, as well as local businesses \nthat would be harmed by this bill, oppose the legislation that has been \noffered.\n  In 1986, Mr. President, legislation was approved by the U.S. Congress \ntransferring the operation of Washington National Airport from the \nFederal Government to the Metropolitan Airports Authority.\n  The Airports Authority is a nonfederal entity established by \ninterstate compact between the District of Columbia and the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  President Ronald Reagan, who championed State and local control, \nrather than Federal control, whenever and wherever it was appropriate, \nwas the President who signed that legislation.\n  Former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton, a Republican and the \nchairman of the Airports Authority, said, ``Unilateral action by the \nCongress to take the drastic action of changing the name of the airport \nis inconsistent with both the spirit and the intent of the transfer.''\n  It is highly ironic that this Congress is attempting to impose its \nFederal will on local governments, a State/local airports authority, \nand the local business community, in the name of Ronald Reagan, whose \ncareer and legacy centers on his deep commitment to limiting the reach \nof the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, creating a controversy that is contrary to his legacy \ndoes not honor Ronald Reagan.\n  Like the vast majority of Americans, I have long admired President \nReagan's personal courage, his strong convictions, his infectious \nspirit, and his leadership of our Nation and the international \ncommunity.\n  There are many appropriate ways to honor the name and the legacy of \nthis great American.\n  On May 5, we will dedicate the Ronald Reagan Building and \nInternational Trade Center in downtown Washington. It is the largest \nFederal building ever built in Washington, DC. Among all Federal \nbuildings throughout the entire Nation, only the Pentagon is larger.\n  In addition, Congress has appropriately named the next aircraft \ncarrier after President Reagan in a resolution I heartily supported and \nwas pleased to cosponsor.\n  The U.S.S. Ronald Reagan will be a magnificent and, indeed, a fitting \ntribute to a Commander in Chief who stood for U.S. military strength \nthroughout our world.\n  There will undoubtedly be many more opportunities to honor Ronald \nReagan and his legacy--and, indeed, jurisdictions where it might be \nparticularly appropriate, such as California or Illinois, might choose \nto put his name on an airport.\n  But overshadowing the name of our first President, ignoring the \nexpressed views of local governments and their people, as well as the \nlocal business community, interfering in operations of an airport, that \nbecause of a bill signed by Ronald Reagan is no longer truly Federal, \nis not the way to do it.\n  Mr. President, in summary, there are many appropriate ways to honor \nthe name and the legacy of Ronald Reagan. Renaming Washington National \nAirport is not one of them.\n  So I ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation, not out of \ndisrespect for the man, but as a symbol of respect for the principles \nfor which he has lived. It may be that after appropriate consultation \nwith the local jurisdictions directly involved, and indeed with the \nPresident and particularly Mrs. Reagan, whose views on this particular \nmatter have not been publicly ascertained, that some action regarding \nWashington National Airport would be in order. But to move forward \nwithout that consideration would detract from the honor intended, as \nwell as the very appropriate and fitting ceremonies planned for May 5.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S254-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S254-S255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TIME TO TACKLE UNFAIR TAXES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there are a lot of things wrong with our \nnation's Tax Code, but two things in the code that have always struck \nme as particularly egregious are the steep taxes imposed on people when \nthey get married and when they die. While it will probably take some \ntime to build the kind of public consensus that will be necessary to \noverhaul the Tax Code in its entirety, there is broad public support \nfor us to do something in the short term about these taxes--the \nnotorious marriage penalty and the death tax--and in the process take \ntwo meaningful steps closer to a tax system that is simpler and more \nfair.\n  Mr. President, what rationale can there possibly be for imposing a \nmarriage penalty? All of us say we are concerned that families do not \nhave enough to make ends meet--that they do not have enough to pay for \nchild care, college, or to buy their own homes. Yet we tolerate a \nsystem that overtaxes families. According to Tax Foundation estimates, \nthe average American family pays almost 40 percent of its income in \ntaxes to federal, state, and local governments. To put it another way, \nin families where both parents work, one of the parents is nearly \nworking full time just to pay the family's tax bill. It is no wonder, \nthen, that parents do not have enough to make ends meet when government \nis taking that much. It is just not right.\n  The marriage penalty alone is estimated to cost the average couple an \nextra $1,400 a year. About 21 million American couples are affected, \nand the cost is particularly high for the working poor. Two-earner \nfamilies making less than $20,000 often must devote a full eight \npercent of their income to pay the marriage penalty. The highest \npercentage of couples hit by the marriage penalty earns between $20,000 \nand $30,000 per year.\n  Think what these families could do with an extra $1,400 in their \npockets. They could pay for three to four months of day care if they \nchoose to send a child outside the home--or make it easier for one \nparent to stay at home to take care of the children, if that is what \nthey decide is best for them. They could make four to five payments on \ntheir car or minivan. They could pay their utility bill for nine \nmonths.\n  A constituent of mine from Tucson, Arizona put it this way: ``We need \nyour help as young married middle class Americans to plan our family's \nfuture. We need help to plan our retirement, our children's education, \nour dignity. Please help get rid of the marriage tax.''\n  Mr. President, this constituent is simply asking that a young family \nbe able to keep more of what it earns. Taxing marriage is wrong. It is \nbad social policy and bad economic policy. We ought to do away with it \nthis year. And with that in mind, I have joined Senators Faircloth and \nHutchison and 35 of our colleagues who have cosponsored S. 1285, the \nMarriage Tax Elimination Act. A similar bill on the House side, H.R. \n2456, has 233 cosponsors. Given the broad support the initiative enjoys \nin both chambers--and around the country--I think we stand a good \nchance of getting this done this year. We should.\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\n  The death tax is just as wrong, and we ought to do something about \nit, too. It is wrong to make grieving families face the funeral \ndirector and the tax collector in the same week. And it is wrong to \nbreak up family-owned businesses just to extract an additional tax from \nsomeone one last time before he or she is laid to rest.\n  The death tax imposes a heavy toll on families, as well as the \ncommunities in which they live. Maybe that is why 15 states have \nrepealed their state death taxes since 1980.\n  Mr. President, in its January 12 edition, the Wall Street Journal \ncarried a story about the impending sale of America's largest African-\nAmerican newspaper chain, Sengstacke Enterprises, Inc. The chain's \npioneering leader, James Sengstacke, passed away last May, and the \nchain is now faced with the daunting task of raising enough cash to pay \nthe estate tax--something that is more commonly known as the death tax.\n  I do not know the Sengstacke family, but their story is compelling, \nand I hope our colleagues will listen closely as I read a few lines \nfrom the Journal's report. The article begins by noting that the \nnewspaper chain is comprised of the daily Chicago Defender and three \nweeklies--the New Pittsburgh Courier, the Tri-State Defender, and the \nMichigan Chronicle. And then it goes on with the extraordinary story of \nthe family business:\n\n       Founded by Robert Sengstacke Abbott in 1905, the Chicago \n     Defender helped ignite the Great Migration--the move of tens \n     of thousands of Southern black sharecroppers northward to \n     Chicago and other cities. When Mr. Abbott's nephew, John \n     Sengstacke, took over in 1940, the Defender grew from a \n     weekly to a daily, printing stories that challenged \n     discrimination on nearly every front, from the U.S. Army to \n     the baseball field.\n       Mr. Sengstacke was instrumental in persuading Brooklyn \n     Dodgers owner Branch Rickey to hire baseball's first black \n     player, Jackie Robinson. For several decades, the Defender \n     was viewed as the most important training ground for aspiring \n     black journalists.\n\n  Mr. President, the tragedy is that the death tax may force the \nSengstacke family to part with this treasured piece of their heritage--\na family-owned company that has, among other things, worked hard to try \nto stamp out the scourge of discrimination around the country. \nContemplating the thought of the chain being taken over by outsiders, \nthe founder's grandniece, Myiti Sengstacke, said, ``No one--black or \nwhite--is going to understand and cherish the vision my uncle had for \nstarting the company other than someone in his family.''\n\n  Other families around the country have similar stories to tell. Here \nis what a good friend and constituent of mine wrote in a letter to me \nlast year:\n\n       Since my father died, our lives have been a nightmare of \n     lawyers and trust companies with the common theme, ``you have \n     to protect the family business.'' It was hard enough trying \n     to recuperate after my father's long illness, and then \n     adjusting to the reality he was gone.\n\n  This family in Arizona built up a printing business from just one \nemployee 39 years ago to over 200 employees today. The founder--the \nfamily patriarch--was one of the most generous people I have ever met. \nHe gave to just about every charitable cause in our community, and he \nmade our community a much better place in the process.\n  Mr. President, hard work and thrift, creating jobs, and contributing \nto the community are among the last things we ought to penalize. And so \nI sponsored the Family Heritage Preservation Act, S. 75, to repeal the \ncruel death tax. Twenty-nine of our colleagues have joined me as \ncosponsors of that measure, and the companion House bill, which was \nintroduced by Congressman Chris Cox, has 166 cosponsors. A recent poll \ncommissioned by the seniors group, 60 Plus, found that fully 77 percent \nof Americans are supportive of death-tax repeal.\n  We took some important steps in the direction of death-tax relief \nlast year when we approved a phased increase in the unified credit and \nnew protections for a limited number of family-owned businesses. \nUnfortunately, the ``family-business carve-out'' made what is arguably \nthe most complex portion of the Tax Code even more complicated. Here is \nwhat representatives of small businesses told the House Ways and Means \nCommittee on January 28.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business told the committee \nthat even though the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act gave small-business \nowners some relief from the unfair death tax, small-business owners \nshould not be paying this tax at all. Jack Faris, the President of \nNFIB, said that the organization continues to fight for complete \nelimination of this onerous tax.\n  The Small Business Council of America described last year's changes \nthis way. ``The new Qualified Family-Owned Business Interest Exclusion \nis now the most complex provision in the Tax Code. At best, it will \nhelp less than five percent of family businesses facing sale or \nliquidation from the death tax.''\n  These sentiments are consistent with the message we heard from \ndelegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business, who \nplaced death-tax repeal fourth among their 60 recommendations to \nCongress and the President. And with good reason. The death tax is \ngradually destroying family enterprise, first by slowing business \ngrowth, then by forcing companies to restructure through mergers or \nsales.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, repeal of the death tax would \nfree capital resources for more productive investment, leading to an \naverage of $11 billion per year in extra output, an average of 145,000 \nadditional jobs created, and personal income rising an average of $8 \nbillion per year above current projections. So not only would death-tax \nrepeal be good for families, it would help the economy as well.\n  Mr. President, repealing the marriage penalty and the death tax \nshould be among our top priorities this year. Together, these two steps \nwill get us closer to the kind of Tax Code we all say we want--one that \nis fairer, flatter, and simpler. Let us do this for America's families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S254-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

SCHLESINGER'S STATEMENT BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE \n  ON ARMED SERVICES ON THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE NATIONAL \n                             DEFENSE PANEL\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \naddress the comments made by James R. Schlesinger, the former Secretary \nof Defense, Secretary of Energy, and Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, in his appearance last week before the Committee \non Armed Services. The purpose of the hearing was to review the \nQuadrennial Defense Review of the Department of Defense, and the report \nof the National Defense Panel, in order to determine what measures are \nnecessary to ensure our national security establishment is able to meet \nthe threats of today and tomorrow.\n  The testimony provided by Secretary Schlesinger was very sobering in \nthat he provided the Committee with a clear picture of the crisis we \nare facing due to the imbalance between our foreign policy commitments \nand the diminished capabilities of our Armed Forces. In his own words, \n``By early in the next century, at the latest, we shall be obligated to \nspend far greater sums on procurement. Alternatively, we can watch the \nforce structure itself age and erode--until it will no longer be \ncapable of sustaining the ambitious foreign policy that we have \nembraced.''\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the entire Senate was not able \nto attend last week's hearing and discuss the problems outlined by \nSecretary Schlesinger. I believe it is important, especially at a time \nwhen the U.S. military may once again be called upon\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\nto protect our interests in the Persian Gulf, for all of the members to \nfully understand the extent to which our military capability has \ndiminished in recent years, and the impact this will have upon our \nability to pursue an aggressive foreign policy.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement \nprovided by Secretary Schlesinger to the Committee on Armed Services be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of James Schlesinger Before the Armed Services Committee, \n   United States Senate, on the Report of the National Defense Panel \n                            January 29, 1998\n\n       Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: You have requested \n     that I comment on the Report of the National Defense Panel \n     and, in particular, to develop further the discussion of \n     alternative strategies and alternative force structures. At \n     the outset, let me say that the Panel has done a commendable \n     job. Overall, its diagnosis of the emerging international \n     scene is excellent, its stress on the need for the \n     transformation of defense is correct. Many of its specific \n     recommendations are admirable. While I shall later comment to \n     some extent on alternative strategies, at the moment I simply \n     wish to state that the reticence of the Panel in the area of \n     alternative strategies and force structures is \n     understandable.\n       For reasons I shall spell out, I sympathize with the Panel \n     on this point, for it was facing a formidable task. Quite \n     simply you can't get there, that desired point in the 21st \n     Century, from here--given the apparent fiscal limits. The \n     United States has a very ambitious foreign policy. It has \n     accepted the role of the world's principal stabilizing power, \n     the one universal power. Yet, there is no way that it can \n     sustain over time the force structure that the QDR calls \n     for--on three percent of the gross Domestic Product. That is \n     not a matter of analysis; that is simple arithmetic. To \n     fulfill our present commitments and to modernize the QDR \n     force for the more challenging years of the next century \n     would require four percent-plus of the GDP. That does not \n     appear a surprising sum for a nation that aspires to be the \n     sole universal power. Our present level of expenditure, \n     relative to GDP, is less than it was before Pearl Harbor.\n       In this decade, we have been cushioned by allowing the \n     principal equipments, inherited from the Cold War years, to \n     age. Obviously such action is tolerable only in the short \n     run. We now spend some forty billion dollars a year on \n     procurement. Yet, the depreciation on our equipment--at \n     replacement costs--runs over a hundred billion dollars per \n     year. In brief, we have been enjoying an extended Procurement \n     Holiday. By early in the next century, at the latest, we \n     shall be obliged to spend far greater sums on procurement. \n     Alternatively, we can watch the force structure itself age \n     and erode--until it will no longer be capable of sustaining \n     the ambitious foreign policy that we have embraced.\n       In the period around 2010, the Department of Defense \n     believes that a new peer-competitor of the United States \n     might emerge. It would be a time, according to present \n     assertions, that we now intend to expand NATO to include \n     portions of the former Soviet Union. It would be a time that \n     expenditures on entitlements programs would be escalating as \n     the baby-boom generation retires, and the budget is projected \n     to go into deficit. Yet, at that very time the effects of the \n     aging of major items of equipment and the erosion of our \n     military capabilities would become clear. Unless we alter our \n     present course, under those circumstances we would have no \n     prudent choice but to retrench on our foreign policy \n     objectives and commitments.\n       Can we not shrink the present force structure--and thereby \n     provide more funds for modernization? In principal, we should \n     be able to do so, but in practice we would encounter vast \n     difficulties. The operations tempo of the Armed Forces is at \n     this time at an all time peak in peacetime. Force deployments \n     in the post-Cold War years have been far more frequent, of \n     substantially larger size, and of longer duration than in the \n     1980's. To be sure, the optempo of the Services could be \n     trimmed. We should certainly review the training regime of \n     the Services, which has not changed since the end of the Cold \n     War. With Goldwater-Nichols, the regional CINC's have piled \n     on additional requirements. We do need an overall review to \n     see whether so high an optempo is desirable. But, we \n     should recognize, given our present foreign policy \n     commitments, we can only trim rather than substantially \n     reduce the optempo. So long as that is the case, any \n     hankering substantially to reduce the force structure \n     remains unachievable.\n       Quite rightly, the National Defense Panel points to the \n     growing strategic uncertainties of the early part of the 21st \n     Century, the possible emergence of a peer-competitor, the \n     serious arrears in funding the re-equipping of the forces, \n     the emerging (re-emerging) issue of homeland defense, the \n     need for space control, the need to incorporate the benefits \n     of the revolution in military affairs, in short, the need to \n     transform defense. It questions whether the two major-\n     regional-conflicts measuring rod is realistic--or is just ``a \n     means of justifying current forces.'' It points to the \n     generally low-risk international environment of today. Quite \n     rightly, the Panel states that the ``priority must go to the \n     future.'' It argues that the pursuit of the two MRC strategy \n     consumes resources that could reduce the risk to our long-\n     term security. given the budgetary limits, the Panel suggests \n     that we surrender the two-MRC standard. There are risks and \n     certain strategic questions that arise following such a path. \n     Yet, given the constraints, it is a plausible suggestion. \n     Nonetheless, at this time, the optempo of the Armed Forces \n     precludes a reduction of the force structure sufficiently \n     large to generate the funds for re-capitalizing the forces.\n       The Panel recommends other means of generating funds within \n     the present budget. It correctly urges a further attack on \n     our excessive infrastructure--and urges the outsourcing of \n     some 600,000 positions in the DOD, including the \n     civilianizing of certain active military positions. I applaud \n     the further closing of bases and I am receptive to pushing \n     outsourcing as far as feasible. I note, however, that there \n     are still some 20 major domestic bases to be closed still \n     left from the BRAC of 1993. I note that most of the \n     reductions in civilian personnel under the quadrennial review \n     is based upon a base-closing exercise which the Congress has \n     already rejected. I note that base closings to this point \n     have generated less than $6 Billion in savings. Thus, \n     admirable as a further assault on our infrastructure may be, \n     it will not generate substantial additional savings to re-\n     capitalize the Forces.\n       Yet, the suggestion that we move more vigorously to \n     outsourcing is certainly correct. In the view of the doubts \n     and resistance that inevitably will occur, it will be many \n     years before the resources become available. Given the legal, \n     administrative, and political constraints, less is likely to \n     be obtained by these measures in the necessary time-frame \n     than both the Panel and I would wish.\n       All in all, the transformation of defense is a meritorious, \n     if not an essential, objective. Yet, it is a far more \n     difficult task, given the resources available, than we are \n     ready to acknowledge. We are not dealing with a system at \n     rest, a garrison military like the pre-World War II German \n     Wehrmacht. The U.S. military now is always on the go, moving \n     around the world and conducting operations in dozens of \n     countries. To transform a force so active is a far more \n     arduous task. While we should embrace the objective, we \n     should also recognize the difficulties that stand in our \n     path.\n       Mr. Chairman, let me now turn away from household tasks to \n     an examination of what the Panel describes as the ``cusp of a \n     military revolution.'' The opportunity for such a revolution \n     has been created by the immense technical advances in \n     computers, microelectronics, telecommunications, sensors, and \n     precision guided munitions. These new military technologies \n     were first unveiled in the Gulf War. Admittedly, the \n     conditions were ideal for exploitation of these new \n     technologies. It permitted our senior officers to have \n     dominant battlefield awareness, while Iraq's unfortunate \n     generals had limited ability to communicate and were largely \n     unaware of what was transpiring on the battlefield. However, \n     one element must be kept in mind: our showcasing of these \n     military technologies means that we will never again have the \n     element of surprise, nor will we again be able so easily to \n     exploit the advantages that these technologies offer. We \n     shall have to labor hard, as others acquire these \n     technologies, both to stay ahead and to exploit fully the \n     opportunities offered by them. When I say that we must work \n     hard, I mean that we must not be lulled into complacency by \n     such phrases as ``full spectrum dominance.'' There is no \n     guarantee of permanent American military dominance. Others \n     will be learning the capabilities of information warfare \n     and weapons of mass destruction. Thus ``eternal \n     vigilance'' remains essential.\n       That leads me--all too briefly--into alternative strategies \n     and alternative force structures. You will understand, of \n     course, Mr. Chairman that I can only throw out a few brief \n     observations. A complete review would require far more time. \n     But it is essential that, as conditions change we continue to \n     seek alternative means to achieve military or national \n     goals--and to choose those means that achieve our goals most \n     effectively. I have dwelt upon the Gulf War as a watershed \n     event. The military establishments of many nations are busily \n     seeking to discern the lessons of the Gulf War.\n       In this light I find it curious that the United States, \n     which developed, exploited, and revealed these new military \n     technologies in the Gulf War, has failed fully to grasp at \n     least one of the principal lessons from that war. The lesson \n     I refer to, that has not been fully absorbed, is the immense \n     success of the air offensive prior to and during the hundred \n     hour ground war. The six weeks of coordinated air attacks \n     prior to the launching of the counter offensive on the ground \n     significantly crippled the combat power of the Iraq forces--\n     and continued to do that during the four days of the ground \n     war. Nonetheless, to date the U.S. military establishment has \n     failed to absorb the lessons of the immense success of the \n     air war into either doctrine or war plans. In touching on so \n     many issues, the Panel failed to note the centrality of this \n     issue of strategy. And the Air Force itself has been remiss. \n     For so many years it treated ``strategic'' and ``nuclear'' as \n     synonymous that it failed to analyze and articulate the \n     strategic role that Tac Air can play.\n       Despite all our talk of jointness, the Services still have \n     yet to formulate a sufficiently shared vision of our military \n     future. Air\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\n     power is not just an ancillary to the ground \n     counteroffensive. If we have air superiority, it too can \n     attrit enemy ground forces. And it can do so at a far lower \n     cost in American blood. All this potentially has major \n     implications for budgets and force structure. It is ironical \n     that those who comment upon--and sometimes complain--that \n     sixty percent of the procurement budget goes to Tac Air, have \n     not fully grasped the potential advantages that that confers. \n     It raises a question, for instance, whether the allocation \n     between platforms and munitions is the right one. Given the \n     military significance of precision-guided munitions, one \n     wonders whether it is wise to allow our inventories to be as \n     low as they are. (The Committee may wish to check what kind \n     of a dent the air war against the Bosnian Serbs in 1995 or \n     (what may be) the forthcoming military operations against \n     Iraq put into our inventory of precision guided weapons.) It \n     is a regrettable fact that, if inventories are constrained \n     and are expected to be limited, that in itself may alter \n     military plans--in a way that makes them less effective. The \n     size of inventories is also a choice.\n       An issue of at least equal importance that we have not yet \n     thought through is what dependence on these newly-available \n     military technologies may do to our vulnerability. Not only \n     is the United States more dependent upon these technologies \n     than any other nation, its extraordinary military leverage \n     now comes from these technologies. That makes us more \n     vulnerable to all of those stratagems that fall under the \n     rubric of information warfare.\n       That underscores at least two things. First, it is \n     essential for the United States to continue to forge ahead of \n     other nations, not only in the exploitation of information \n     warfare, but in defensive measures. Other nations are now \n     industriously studying how to exploit information warfare. \n     The secret is now out.\n       Second, we must continuously examine whether or not we are \n     becoming overly dependent on these new technologies in a way \n     that might create a critical vulnerability. If these \n     technologies are essential as force multipliers, \n     neutralization by others of our exploitation of these \n     technologies would place us at an immediate disadvantage. We \n     must, therefore, examine to what extent we should hedge \n     against such a vulnerability. Such hedging could be costly. \n     To hedge against the neutralization of force multipliers, one \n     can maintain larger forces. But if one were totally to hedge, \n     one would forfeit the cost benefits (though not the benefits \n     in effectiveness) embodied in the revolution in military \n     affairs.\n       I close by reminding the Members of the Committee of the \n     longer-term problems of sustaining our military advantages \n     and thereby sustaining our ambitious foreign policy. The \n     Department of State has recently stated (in response to \n     Russian complaints about our indifference to their sphere of \n     influence in the ``Near Abroad'') that the Department of \n     State states that the United States does not acknowledge the \n     legitimacy of spheres of influence. That presumably applies \n     only to other countries, since the United States, as the \n     single universal power, regards all the outside world as its \n     sphere of influence. Yet, if we are unable to sustain our \n     military forces and sustain our military advantages into the \n     21st Century, despite the ambitions of our foreign policy, we \n     would be obliged to retreat.\n       Mr. Chairman, I thank you and the Members of the Committee \n     for your attention. I would be pleased to answer any \n     questions that you may have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S255-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S257-S258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEMORIAL FOR ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, two years ago last November, Israel lost \nits beloved Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and the world lost a great \npeacemaker. My son Patrick and I had the sad honor of traveling to \nIsrael for the funeral. Like millions of people around the world, we \nadmired his leadership and the power of his vision of reconciliation \nbetween Israel and the Arab world.\n  On November 13, friends and admirers of Prime Minister Rabin gathered \nin Boston for a memorial service to commemorate his life and pay \ntribute to his leadership in putting Israel on the path to peace. His \nEminence Bernard Cardinal Law, Israel's renowned poet Yehuda Amichai, \nand Israel's Consul General Itzhak Levanon gave voice to the grief of \nthe world. As we work to carry on the work of peace in the Middle East, \nthe guiding presence of Prime Minister Rabin is deeply missed.\n  I believe my colleagues will be interested in the eloquent \nreflections of the speakers at the service on Prime Minister Rabin's \nlife and death, and especially on his extraordinary commitment to peace \nin the Middle East. I ask unanimous consent that the remarks at the \nmemorial service in Boston be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Invocation by His Eminence Bernard Cardinal Law\n\n       To remember is at the heart of Jewish (and Christian) \n     faith. To recall God's covenant, His fidelity and His \n     promises, is a solemn duty which each son and daughter of \n     Abraham is asked to fulfill. Only by thinking back on what \n     God has accomplished yesterday, will we have sufficient \n     courage for today and tomorrow.\n       In light of this profound religious conviction, we are here \n     to remember a life, prematurely snatched from us by the \n     bullet of an assassin--Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.\n       Because his death had so many tragic implications, our mood \n     may be dark and despairing as the one described in the Book \n     of Wisdom: ``. . . they seemed to be dead; their departure \n     was reckoned as defeat, and their going from us a disaster.''\n       Wisdom confronts and challenges this earthly despair with \n     the emphatic reminder that, ``The souls of the just are in \n     the hands of God . . . they are at peace, for though in the \n     sight of men they may be punished, they have a sure hope of \n     immortality; and after a little chastisement they will \n     receive great blessings, because God has tested them and \n     found them worthy to be His.'' (Wis: 3; 1-6).\n       We shall also never forget--but remember with undiminished \n     hope--Yitzhak Rabin's dream of peace between Israel and the \n     Palestinian people. The steps toward this peace which he took \n     with such great courage cannot be reversed, for both people \n     have gone too far along the path toward that day when the \n     pslamist's prayer will be answered.\n       Let the psalmist's words be ours this evening:\n\n     Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: ``May they prosper who love \n           you.\n     Peace be within your walls, and security within your \n           towers.''\n     For the sake of my relatives and friends I will say, ``Peace \n           be within you.''\n\n       Amen.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       Remarks of Yehuda Amichai\n\n       I would like to strike a rather personal note. There were a \n     lot of traumatic events for us, one event which has a lot of \n     trauma in it. Trauma number one is that it is the death of \n     our generation, the generation of people who grew up towards \n     1948 and we were in the Palmach, the commando unit of the \n     Haganah, and later the Israeli army. Yitzhak was already a \n     big commander there, I was a very small commander, and he was \n     actually the last of the Palmachniks to fall, many years \n     after the end of the war, and there had been about two \n     thousand out of six thousand that had fallen in the war, so \n     he was the last of us. And the second trauma is the trauma of \n     Jewish history, of ``milhemet achim'', of Jews killing each \n     other, and it brings up the whole traumatic event of the \n     destruction of the second temple, and we were hoping that it \n     would never be again.\n       When Yitzhak Rabin received his peace award in Oslo, he \n     invited me and my wife to join him there, and he read this \n     poem which I am going to read, in his acceptance speech in \n     Oslo of the peace award.\n\n     G-d has pity on kindergarten children.\n     He has less pity of schoolchildren\n     And on grownups he has no pity at all\n     He leaves them alone\n     And sometimes, they must crawl on all fours in the burning \n           sand to reach the first aid station, covered with \n           blood.\n\n     But perhaps he will watch over true lovers\n     And have mercy on them and shelter them\n     Like a tree over the old man sleeping on a public bench.\n     Perhaps we too will give them the last rare coins of \n           compassion that mother handed down to us so that their \n           happiness will protect us now, and in other days.\n\n       And Yitzhak Rabin added to this poem his own words, and he \n     said ``Let's hope that now'' after the peace agreement \n     ``there will be pity for all of us.''\n       He was already, I must say, he was already in his fighting \n     days as a commander of the Har-El brigade, he had already the \n     clear eyes of vision towards peace. While he was deeply \n     involved in winning that war against this vast Arab majority, \n     in his eyes there was something of a vision, very harsh and \n     hard vision of peace. While all of us were still involved in \n     war he was a very down to earth like our prophets. He never \n     was enthuasiastic or showed enthusiasm about peace, he was \n     always very inverted, and very much introverted, but he was \n     down to earth like our prophets. Perhaps the most famous \n     prophecy of peace in the bible is about the lamb and the wolf \n     shall lie alongside each other and not disturb each other. \n     They never, the prophets were down to earth, they knew that \n     love and peace may be far away, but at least you start by two \n     enemies lying alongside each other without disturbing each \n     another. And Yitzhak Rabin was one of those, that is why his \n     vision was so wonderful because it was down to earth. I would \n     like, I think that in a way, with Yitzhak Rabin, it is \n     perhaps the greatest trauma for all of us. It was as if, in \n     your American terms, Kennedy and Lincoln were murdered with \n     him again, because he engulfed everything--the beginning of \n     the state, and the middle of the state, the war and the \n     peace, our our national anthem is called Hatikvah, The Hope. \n     And I hope that we will still have, and his spirit will not \n     let our hope die.\n       And I would like to finish with a poem that I read at his \n     first ``shloshim,'' first memorial in Jerusalem. And it is \n     about a friend of both of ours who was in the Palmach and who \n     fell back in 1948, and I wrote this poem and I think it fits \n     Yitzhak too.\n\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\n\n     And you, who remember only a face,\n     Do not forget the outstretched hands, and the legs that run \n           so easily in the earth.\n     Remember that even the road to terrible battles always passes \n           by gardens and windows, and children playing, and the \n           barking dog\n     Remember the fruit that fell and reminded of its leaves and \n           the branch\n     Remind the hard ones that they were soft and green in \n           springtime\n     And do not forget that the first too was once the palm of an \n           open hand and fingers.\n\n       May Yitzhak be forever.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           Remarks of Israeli Counsel General Itzhak Levanon\n\n       A master in the skies, the Albatross was soaring high in \n     the air. Remaining airborne on motionless wings, and gliding \n     abreast the strongest winds with little effort. He was \n     watched from the land, flying majestically towards new \n     horizons. The sky was clear and the winds favorable. The \n     Albatross showed self-confidence, determined to reach new \n     heights, disregarding the dangers. None would dare to defy \n     him on his royal journey.\n       Suddenly three gun shots fatally hit the Albatross. He \n     swung in the air, refusing to bend and hit the ground. He \n     looked toward the sky, which he has just conquered a few \n     moments before and whispered: why?\n       Rabin was like this. He flew high in the sky, defied strong \n     winds, knew which direction to head and covered long \n     distances in a short time. He too asked himself, lying on the \n     ground, why? Why should a leader who dedicated his entire \n     life to the welfare of his own people, die like the Albatross \n     died? This question is still on the lips of every Israeli, \n     two years after his assassination, and will remain so for \n     years to come.\n       Rabin's fatalism reminds me of another leader in the Middle \n     East--Anwar Sadat. He too disregarded the warnings. He too \n     believed that he was doing only what was right for his people \n     and therefore, there was no cause for one of them to harm \n     him. But both were so trusting, and both paid the price.\n       I remember his face, full of happiness and satisfaction \n     that evening in Montreal, after a poignant speech at the \n     General Assembly where he spoke in all frankness about his \n     fears and his hope for the peace process. When we arrived in \n     this room he laid his eyes on his wife Lea, and, with a \n     typical Israeli expression said to her ``Nu?'' You could see \n     the joy in his face and how, with his timid smile, he wanted \n     to say `I am happy that they hear my words,' and how he felt \n     that he was not alone in his struggle. Indeed, battalions \n     were behind him.\n       Senator Edward Kennedy recently wrote to me about Rabin, \n     and the absence created by his death, describing him in the \n     following words: ``The cause of peace lost one of its \n     greatest champions of our time, perhaps of all time, and I \n     continue to miss his leadership.''\n       After Rabin's death, many poems were written. I have chosen \n     one of them, which in my judgment reflects the feelings of \n     most Israelis, The Tears, by Smadar Shir:\n\n     There are left wing people and there are right wing\n     There are religious and there are secular\n     There are Sephardi and there are Ashkenazi\n     There are Israelis and there are Arabs\n     There are clever people and there are dumb\n     But for all of them there is the same tear and the tears are \n           still warm, aching and painful\n     These tears are for a great man, who fell down while trying \n           to reach peace between all these people.\n\n       Many disagreed with Rabin's ideas. Others criticized him, \n     but none can argue the fact that for most Israelis he was \n     like a godfather, the one who took care of everything. He was \n     the mind which thought, the authority which made decisions, \n     the man who endorsed responsibility and the leader who did \n     not worry about damaging his standing if it benefited his \n     people. Rabin was a leader, but he was also the commander, \n     the diplomat, the politician, and most of all, the father.\n       May the soul of this great man be blessed forever.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S257-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING STEVEN CHOTIN\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Steven has been a legend in a variety of charitable causes in \nColorado, giving of his time and energy generously, as well as \nfinancially, to The Denver Center for the Performing Arts, The Colorado \nSymphony, The Allied Jewish Federation of Denver, National Jewish \nHospital, Shalom Park and many other worthy endeavors.\n  Mr. Chotin has served on the boards of numerous community and \ncharitable organizations, including Fresh Start, a program committed to \npaving a way out for Denver's inner-city youth. Equally renowned are \nSteven's activities in civic and business affairs. As head of The \nChotin Group Corporation, National Mortgage Corporation and Merchants \nMortgage Corporation, he has succeeded in providing gainful employment \nto a significant number of Denver area residents.\n  I am sure I speak for all Coloradans in extending Steven my \ncongratulations and appreciation for leaving such an indelible mark on \nour state by the young age of 50.

Madam President, last week in remarks on the floor I \nreferred to the Congressional Budget Office's report, ``Economic and \nBudget Outlook for the Fiscal Years 1999 to 2008.'' And at that \nparticular time, Madam President, I pointed out that even the \nCongressional Budget Office had projected deficits not only of $188 \nbillion for the present year and $170 billion for 1998, but of $200 \nbillion for 1999, the year in which everyone in this town has been \nscreaming we will reap a budgetary surplus.\n  Now we have the President's budget. Madam President, this morning we \nnot only received that budget, we saw in this country's newspapers of \nrecord such headlines as ``On Budget Eve, Congress Feels Surplus \nFever.'' This particular article reports that the distinguished Speaker \nof the House, Newt Gingrich, stated, ``We are on the edge, if we will \nhave discipline, of a generation of surpluses.''\n  So we have the President talking about balanced budgets as far as the \neye can see in his State of the Union Message. And we now have the \ndistinguished Speaker talking about surpluses as far as the eye can see \nfor the next generation.\n  Would that it were so. Would that we did not have any increase in the \nnational debt. Would that we had no increase in the deficit. Would that \nwe had no increase in the interest costs of the carrying charges on our \nnational debt, which are now projected, Madam President, to be $1 \nbillion a day, or $365 billion a year. That is one thing that everyone \ncan agree on: that the interest on the federal debt is going up, up, \nand away.\n  Let me emphasize the matter of the debt before I home in on the \nmatter of Social Security and the spending of surpluses. In 1981, we \nhad a national debt of $995.5 billion. We had not reached a trillion-\ndollar debt.\n  For the first 200 years of our history, including the costs of all \nthe wars our nation fought during that time--the Revolutionary War, the \nWar of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, the Spanish-\nAmerican War, World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam--we did not \nreach a trillion-dollar debt. But in the last 16 years, we have reached \nnow a $5.5 trillion debt, with interest costs of a billion dollars a \nday. Interest on the debt used to stand at a mere $95 billion; it now \nstands at $365 billion. So we are spending $270 billion more on \ninterest alone than when we supposedly were going to balance the budget \nback in 1981.\n  I remember when our distinguished President Ronald Reagan ran on \nbalancing the budget and was elected in 1980. He came into office in \n1981 and said, ``Whoops. This is way worse than I ever expected. \nInstead of balancing the budget in a year, it's going to take me 3 \nyears.''\n  Even after passage of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Bill, we ran into the \nhighest deficits we ever had heard of. The deficits and debt went up, \nup, and away under Reaganomics. Of course,\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\nthe whole idea of Reaganomics, which George Bush called voodoo \neconomics, was that cutting tax revenues some 25 percent would spur \npeople to spend more, thus leading to increased government revenues \nfrom sales taxes and income taxes. This in turn, proponents of so-\ncalled Reaganomics said, would enable us to grow out of the federal \ndeficit and national debt. In contrast, of course, we have grown into \nthem.\n  As a result, we now spend a billion dollars a day on interest to \nservice the federal debt. The first thing at 8 o'clock every morning \nthat the Government does is go down to the bank and borrow a billion \ndollars--every Sunday morning, Christmas morning, every holiday, every \nday in the year. It borrows and spends this billion dollars to pay the \ncarrying charges on the debt. This money doesn't go for anything \nconstructive: no highways, no foreign aid, no defense money. It's just \nwaste added to the debt.\n\n  This is the dilemma we find ourselves in. This is really the bottom \nline. But it has never been emphasized in this body. And momentarily, \nseeing that I had an opportunity to emphasize this on the floor of the \nSenate, I said to myself: ``Now's my chance to sober everyone up, \nbecause we are spending more and getting less.'' And everybody wonders \nwhy they are not getting adequate Government services. The reason we \nare not is because we are spending $270 billion more on interest than \nwe were spending in 1981. We are spending more for absolutely nothing--\na total of $365 billion for nothing.\n  And now we have the President's budget. And as is the usual custom, \nthe Administration says one thing and does another. I will never forget \nAttorney General John Mitchell's admonition, ``Watch what we do, not \nwhat we say.'' That could be the mantra of Congress and the White House \ntoday: ``Watch what we do, not what we say.''\n  Of course, if you look in the very first part of the President's \nbudget, you can see projected on page 10 of the budget for next year, \n1999, a $9.5 billion surplus. Isn't that grand? Isn't that wonderful? \nThere it is: a $9.5 billion surplus on page 10.\n  But, Madam President, let us, if you please, go all the way back to \npage 367 of the President's budget. You have to go search through the \nwhole budget. I don't know that anybody has done this, but I have \nlearned how to search out the truth in these budgets. On page 367 you \nwill find a chart similar to the one by the CBO titled ``Projections of \nthe Federal Debt by Fiscal Year.'' You will find the Federal \nGovernment's financing and debt. And when you look in the very, very \nsmall print, you will see it under the title ``Total Gross Federal \nDebt.''\n  Of course, they have highlighted other elements of the budget, such \nas ``Debt Outstanding End of the Year.'' They have highlighted in bold, \nblack letters the ``Debt Subject to Statutory Limitations End of the \nYear.'' But it is in very small letters that they provide the ``Total \nGross Federal Debt.'' But if you squint your eyes, you can see that the \ndebt goes from $5,543.6 billion in 1998 to $5,738.1 billion in 1999.\n  So the President, in his own budget--although you have to be a \ndetective to find this--projects a deficit that, if adopted, ipso facto \nwill be $194.5 billion.\n  This is the situation that confronts us. But today one has to read in \nall the papers and magazines about this ``surplus fever and tax cuts''; \nand you have to listen to the debate on the floor. ``No, I think we \nought to spend more for this program or that program. No, I think we \nought to have tax cuts. That's what we ought to do with the surplus.''\n  Madam President, the only way that anyone can possibly project any \nkind of balanced budget or surplus for next year of $9.5 billion is to \nuse the trust funds--not just those of Social Security, because there \nis another $113 billion of Social Security being used--but the $90 \nbillion in other trust funds.\n  The easiest way to figure whether or not you have a deficit is to see \nwhether or not you make more money than you spend each year. This works \nfor families; it works for everyone. We must look at whether the \nFederal Government receives more money than it spends. Of course, if it \nspends more than it receives, it has a deficit. And that is why you \nmust look at the bottom line of the national debt, where you will see \nthat we actually spend $194.5 billion more than we take in.\n  But the greatest gimmick and the actual fraud, Madam President, is \nthe so-called unified budget. Supporters of this sham argue that \nPresident Lyndon Johnson and the Congress balanced the budget this way \nin 1968-1969. This is absolutely false; absolutely false. President \nLyndon Baines Johnson did not use any surpluses in order to balance the \nbudget.\n\n  Madam President, I have a chart that shows the state of the national \ndebt under President Johnson. In fact, it provides the debt under all \nthe Presidents, beginning with President Truman in 1945 and continuing \nto February, 1998. I have here the United States' total budget. I have \nthe borrowed trust funds. This is in the chart and I ask unanimous \nconsent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

With this chart, we can see the borrowed trust funds \nand the unified deficit including the trust funds. But then we see the \nactual deficit without the trust funds, the real deficit, with a column \nfor each President: Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, \nCarter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton. This table shows the national debt \nunder each President, as well as the annual increases in spending on \ninterest costs on that debt.\n  If we look at 1968-1969, we find that listed actual trust funds \ntotalled $300 million. Since the unified deficit with trust funds was \n$3.2 billion, the actual deficit without Social Security trust funds \nwas $2.9 billion. So trust funds were not used to balance the budget. \nThis is a fallacious argument.\n  In fact, let me clear that up. In those days the distinguished \nChairman of the Ways and Means Committee was Congressman Wilbur Mills \nof Arkansas. He was the authority on the federal budget and our \nnation's fiscal state. If you ever wanted to find out about a tax or \nrevenue, if you ever wanted to talk about fiscal policy or otherwise, \nyou went to see Wilbur. He was a brilliant individual. In 1972, he \nentered the Presidential race. Of course, before he got into that \nPresidential race--I cannot remember the exact year he announced--he \ncame out and said we had so much money in Social Security that we \nshould give recipients a cost-of-living-increase of 10 percent. And \nPresident Nixon said, ``Well, if Wilbur Mills will give you 10 percent, \nI will give you 15 percent,'' and we started spending away the Social \nSecurity moneys. We never did have a difficulty with Social Security \nuntil those shenanigans commenced.\n  By 1980, we determined that Social Security would be running into the \nred and we created the Greenspan Commission, under the distinguished \nhead of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. The Greenspan Commission \ncame out with a report adopted in 1983, which said that not only are we \ngoing to balance Social Security's budget, we are going to have an \ninordinately high tax, a graduated tax, to make sure that we build up a \nsurplus to take care of the baby boomers. That was the intent of \nbuilding up the surplus. They knew they were going to have extra money. \nIt wasn't a mystery because it was an inordinately high tax. They built \nup this surplus intentionally. And Section 21 of the Greenspan \nCommission report states that in order to maintain the surplus for the \nbaby boomers through the year 2056, we must take Social Security out of \nthe unified budget.\n  Now, that is what Greenspan recommended. And this Senator worked as a \nmember of the Budget Committee to get that done. Finally, in 1990, we \nreported it out from the Budget Committee by a vote of 20-1 that we do \njust that, take Social Security off budget. And 98 Senators voted for \nthat on the floor of the Senate. And President George Bush, on November \n5, 1990, signed section 13-301 into the law. Section 13-301 of the \nbudget law says that the Congress and the President you shall not \nsubmit a budget using Social Security trust funds.\n  Of course, that was violated and it is being violated now in this \nparticular budget. Right here, it is violated. There is no question it \nis being violated because that is what all the newspapers are reporting \non--they are talking about page 10, not page 367.\n  Here is what has been occurring. Let's go right to Social Security. \nLast year we owed the trust funds $631 billion; by the end of September \n1998, the Congressional Budget Office estimates we will owe $732 \nbillion; and under the President's budget plan, by the year 2002 we \nwill owe $1.236 trillion. Everybody is saying, wait a minute, we have \nto do something because in 10 years Social Security is going to be \nbroke. Come on, it is broke now. If we look to the end of this year, we \nwill owe Social Security $732 billion. Now, who in the year 2002 is \ngoing to recommend a tax increase of $1.236 trillion to redeem the \nSocial Security IOUs? He will not be able to stand on the floor and get \none vote. They will run him out. That will not happen.\n  That is why this particular Senator has been insistent from the very \nbeginning that we look at all the trust funds and the condition of the \nGovernment--Medicare, military retirement, civilian retirement, \nunemployment, highway, airports--to evaluate the federal deficit and \ndebt.\n  For example, at the end of this fiscal year we will owe highway trust \nfunds $23 billion. Now, why are the highways crumbling and the bridges \nfalling? Because the vehicle-automobile, gasoline taxes are not being \nused on the roads and the bridges. They are being used for food stamps, \nfor foreign aid, or for any and every other purpose except for \nhighways. Why don't we have updated radar at all the major airports in \nthe U.S. for passengers' safety? After all, who pays airline tax? But \nthe airline tax is not going to the airports. It is going for any and \nevery other purpose but the airports. We owe them $10 billion. And I \ndon't want to get the military retirees or the Civil Service retirees \nupset, but as of the end of September we will owe $133 billion to make \npayments to them. We will owe $460\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\nbillion, almost half a trillion dollars, to civilian retirees.\n  This charade, this fraud, has got to stop. It is outrageous that the \nPresident comes to the American people and says in one breath, \n``Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that is \nevery penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the measures \nnecessary to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st \ncentury.'' And then, after giving that message last week, today he \ncomes and loots the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $113 \nbillion in order to report a $9.5 billion surplus. Of course, all the \neditorial writers and news columnists are writing that we will enjoy \nbalanced budgets as far as the eye can see. We will have surpluses as \nfar as the eye can see, they say, when the actual deficit under the \nPresident's budget is $194.5 billion. Look on page 367 of his report \nand you will see nothing but deficits for as far as the eye can see--\nnamely, the debt increasing; namely, a billion dollars a day being paid \nnow with the lowest of interest rates that we have had in our history. \nThat amount is going to soar when interest rates rise because spending \nfor interest goes up, up and away under the President's budget \nproposal. We really are in a downward spiral of financial \nresponsibility here in the National Government.\n  Now, I delight in the President's budget with respect to child care. \nI delight in the provisions in there for 100,000 more Border Patrol \nagents; 100,000 more cops; higher pay for teachers; and smaller \nclassroom size. But we are going to have to pass a tobacco tax \nsettlement or some other measure to get extra moneys for these \nparticular programs. This Senator is willing to vote to pay for those \nprograms. I am trying to put Government on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n  I know about fiscal responsibility. I achieved the first AAA credit \nrating for the State of South Carolina, the first Southern State to \nreceive this bond rating. In 1959 I worked like the dickens to get it \ndone. I voted for that federal balanced budget in 1968-69. The entire \nbudget, with the costs of the war in Vietnam and the Great Society, was \nonly $178 billion. Today, we suffer from a $1.7 trillion budget. But we \nbalanced it then.\n  I was a cosponsor of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings in order to try to cut the \ndeficits, but of course the quickest way to anonymity in public office \nis to cosponsor a bill with Senator Gramm or Senator Rudman. I never \nheard since from it but that is how it works around here. But we did \nget the majority of Democratic votes, 14 votes up and down against the \nopposition of the majority leader, the chairman of the Budget Committee \nand the Democratic whip. They all opposed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, but we \nhad a majority of Democrats on this side of the aisle vote for Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings. I even suggested at one time a value-added tax to get \non top of this sea of red ink, allocated to the deficit and the debt so \nwe wouldn't get into this waste of $1 billion a day.\n  I am still working now, not just on the amount of the deficit and \ndebt but for the principle of truth, truth in budgeting. How do you get \nthe national media, the national press, who are co-conspirators in this \ncharade, to report the truth. They are talking about conspiracy around \nthis town with regard to special prosecutors, when in reality the \nconspiracy is right here, in the so-called unified budget. The budget \nthe White House submitted today results without question in a $194.5 \nbillion deficit if adopted as it is now submitted. It is time everyone \nrealize this. It is time we practice truth in governing and reporting.\n\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wanted to make a couple of comments \nfollowing those of the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings. \nHe knows that I certainly agree with him on the issue of the Social \nSecurity trust funds and the unified budget. There are some \ndefinitional issues about the budget.\n  I was at the White House this morning, at the invitation of President \nClinton, when he made a presentation on the budget that he released \ntoday. Frankly, the budget contains a lot of good news. The Senator \nfrom South Carolina is correct about the unified budget. But it is also \ncorrect to say that this President, beginning in 1993, said that we are \ngoing to change courses here and we are going to set this country on a \ndifferent direction. Between then and now, we have wrestled the Federal \nbudget deficit to the ground.\n  Is our job over? No. There is more to be done because of the Social \nSecurity trust funds and some other issues. But this President deserves \nsubstantial credit for deciding that we are going to change courses, \nchange directions, and wrestle this budget deficit to the ground. I \nmust say that, in 1993, when he proposed to do that, it was very \ncontroversial because, up until then, we had seen budget after budget \nwith deficits that continued to increase, year after year. It was 535 \nbad habits around here, wanting to give tax cuts and spending \nincreases. And the deficit continued to grow, and the Federal debt \ncontinued to escalate.\n  In 1993, when President Clinton said let's change direction here, he \nproposed a couple of things that were very controversial. He said, \nlet's really cut some Federal spending, let's really increase some \ntaxes on a selected basis. And it became very controversial because all \nthose folks who had stood up and talked the loudest about controlling \nthe Federal deficit, when it came time to take the vote, where were \nthey? They weren't here. We didn't get one vote from the other side of \nthe aisle--even by accident. We won by one vote in the U.S. Senate and \none vote in the U.S. House, and that set this country on a different \ncourse.\n  Five years later, we now see daylight with the Federal deficits, and \nthe deficits in future years are well under control. In fact, in the \nlong-term, even with Social Security funds out of the calculation, we \nwill reach a balanced budget.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator is right on target with respect to giving \nthe President credit. There is no question, we increased taxes, cut \nspending, and cut the number of Federal employees. And in increasing \nthe taxes, I will never forget the colleague from Texas, when he stated \non the floor--regarding increasing taxes on Social Security--that they \nwere going to be hunting us Democrats down in the streets and shooting \nus like dogs. I will never forget that. They not only projected a \nrecession and a depression, but that Social Security tax increase, \nwhich I don't see anybody putting into a bill or talking about today--\nbut at that particular time, taking on that hard choice, as they talked \nabout, without a single Republican vote, was very, very difficult. But \nwe faced the fire, and to President Clinton's credit, now we have the \neconomy headed in the right direction. My comments on the unified \nbudget and deficit is to make sure we don't go in the other direction.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is certainly correct. The last thing we want \nto do is step back into the hole we were in before. Just the hint of a \nbudget surplus in the future has persuaded a legion of people here to \ntalk about new tax breaks on the one hand or new spending on the other \nhand. We ought rather to decide to have discipline. Let's accept the \ngood news that we have wrestled the Federal budget deficit to the \nground. Let's work to keep it there, instead of getting right back into \nthe same fiscal mess we were in before.\n\n  I know some will dispute my recitation of the facts. But there is no \ndispute that, in 1993, we had a huge vote in the Senate. And we passed \nthat deficit reduction bill by one vote, which sent this country on a \ndifferent course. That vote indicated that we cared\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\nabout bringing down Federal budget deficits. We knew they hurt this \ncountry and we did something about it.\n  Everybody else wants to talk about it and shout about it and chant \nabout it. But when it comes time to vote, the question is, who is going \nto stand up and, on behalf of the country's future, say, count me in, I \nwant to cast a vote that is tough; I am willing to cast a vote that is \nhard, politically. In fact, some colleagues who voted the same way I \ndid are not here in the Senate anymore because they cast that vote.\n  I just think it is important for all of us to understand that this \nPresident and enough Members of Congress, in the Senate and the House, \n5 years ago, said that we are going to change direction and put this \ncountry on a course of fiscal policy that will wrestle the Federal \nbudget deficit to the ground, and we have done that.\n  Now, the fact is, there are some people around here who handle good \nnews like a chronic toothache. You could not get them to smile for any \nreason. But things are better. The budget is better, the economy is up, \nunemployment is down, inflation is down, the deficit is down, crime is \ndown, welfare is down. Does that cause a smile? No. It is as if they \nare in a dental chair getting a root canal. They have to be crabby \nabout something. I just saw a press conference by colleagues who are \ncontinuing to be crabby about what is going on in this country.\n  The fact is, this country is on a better course, moving in a better \ndirection, and the news is better. Most of the American people \nunderstand that.\n  The President's budget, incidentally, is not perfect. I have some \ndisagreement with portions of it. But, on the whole, I think it is an \nawfully good blueprint for this country. The President proposes some \nthings that I think make a lot of sense.\n  The President proposes that we increase some spending in certain \nareas, and he pays for it with cuts in other areas. Let me describe one \narea where he proposes an increase in spending.\n  President Clinton proposes a 50 percent increase in funding over the \nnext 5 years for the National Institutes of Health. There is not a \nfamily in this Chamber, or listening to these proceedings, that hasn't \nbeen touched by heart disease, stroke, cancer, AIDS, those scourges \nthat kill Americans and ruin families.\n  Guess what is happening down at the National Institutes of Health? I \nhave been down there. I have gone through the Lung and Blood Institute \nand National Cancer Institute. It is remarkable what is going on. It is \nbreathtaking. If you take a look at the money we are investing in \nresearch on heart disease, the money that we are investing in research \non cancer, to find a cure for AIDS, arthritis, diabetes, and so many \nother things, it is breathtaking.\n  One of the wonderful things I saw at the National Institutes of \nHealth--without digressing too far--when I went into the building was, \nthey had something called a ``healing garden,'' a little healing \ngarden. They described the plants and vegetation they have collected \nfrom all over the world--50,000 to 60,000 plants and shrubs they have \ncollected. They described the research they are doing to find the \nhealing properties of plants.\n  Two thousand years ago, in China, if somebody got a headache, like \nsome of my colleagues have about the fiscal policy of this country, \nwhat did they do? They would chew on a little willow bark. We do the \nsame thing today, except we get the willow bark in pill form and call \nit ``aspirin.''\n  The most exciting thing is not the combination of chemicals and \ncompounds, but the research on the healing properties of shrubs and \nbushes and plants. It is remarkable. It is wonderful what is going on.\n\n  The fact is, when we invest a dollar, a million dollars, or a billion \ndollars in health research, we provide enormous hope for the people of \nthis country that we can begin to cure cancer. And we have done that \nwith respect to some forms of cancer. We provide enormous hope to \npeople around the country that we can deal with heart disease and \nstroke, the biggest killers in this country, in a much different way.\n  So in those areas of the budget--for example, the increase in direct \ninvestment in the National Institutes of Health--does that funding make \nsense? I think it does. Would people come here and say that the \ninvestment in medical research is worthless?\n  What about the woman that stood up at a town meeting and said, ``I \nhad new knees put in and a new hip and cataract surgery, and I feel \nlike a million dollars.'' Where did all that come from?\n  Fifty years ago, she would have been in a wheelchair, unable to walk \nor see. Now when someone's heart muscle plugs up and they have the \nbreathtaking surgery that opens it up, they feel, when they are \nrecovered, stronger than ever and they can go on for the next 10, 20 \nyears and extend their lives.\n  The point is this: There are certain things we do that make a lot of \nsense. This President says, let's continue the investment in the \nNational Institutes of Health and increase that investment and save \nlives in this country through the breakthroughs that will come from \nresearch and medicine. That makes a lot of sense to me.\n  The President says, among other things, let us save Social Security \nfirst, a point just discussed by my colleague from South Carolina. I \nknow there are some people who never liked Social Security, and have \nnever thought it was a good program.\n  They have a right to feel that way. But that is not the way the \nAmerican people feel.\n  About 60 some years ago, we created a Social Security program, and I \nmust say that the mathematics of it were quite interesting. Life \nexpectancy, then, was 63 years of age. Social Security was created with \na retirement of 65 years of age. That all works out pretty well. If you \nare expected to live until 63 and get retirement at 65, that system is \npretty well financed. Now the life expectancy is not 63; it has gone to \n77 or 78. So things have changed.\n  There are future challenges to the Social Security system because of \nthat. We have to make some changes to put it on a sound basis for the \nlong term. But what the President has said makes a lot of sense as a \nmatter of priority. He has an answer to those who would rush off to \nprovide tax breaks because they are popular, or who want to take the \nbest 10 programs and add funding to them. The President has said that \nwe should, as a priority in fiscal policy, save Social Security first.\n  That makes a lot of sense. We are going to have a debate on that in \nthe Congress. Is that the priority? Or will we hear something \ndifferent, as we have heard today, from those naysayers on fiscal \npolicy, those who would be unhappy no matter what is happening? Will we \nhear that no, that is not a priority, saving Social Security is not a \nfirst priority, not even second or not even tenth priority? Will we \nhear people say that their priority is to give more tax breaks to their \nfriends?\n  Let us decide that the responsible thing for the future of this \ncountry would be to embrace the principle the President has put \nforward. Let us save Social Security first.\n  The President talked in his budget message today about the priority \nfor education. He is absolutely correct about that priority as well. He \nhas talked about decreasing class size, and hiring 100,000 more \nteachers. He has talked about creating tax credits to help modernize \ncrumbling schools. All of those things make sense to me.\n  President Clinton has paid for these proposals by cutting other \nfunding and rearranging priorities. Instead of in the aggregate saying \nwe are going to add substantial funding, he has done it within the \nconfines of what we can and should spend relative to the budget \nagreement, the bipartisan agreement of last year.\n\n  The budget is not perfect. There are things in it that I don't like \nand there are some things not in it that should have been in it.\n  But this President has submitted a budget plan that is a responsible \nset of priorities for this country's future. This President should get \nsome credit. And those in this Congress who have supported deficit \nreduction, both the 1993 bill and the bipartisan agreement last year, \ndeserve some credit too for a budget outlook that is much, much \ndifferent now than anyone would have expected 2 or 3 years ago.\n\n\n                            The Highway Bill\n\n  Madam President, let me make one further point about the priorities \nfor the Congress this year.\n  We must bring to the floor of this Senate, sooner rather than later, \nthe\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\nhighway funding bill. I know there has been a lot of juggling back and \nforth about whose fault it is that we haven't considered this bill \nsooner. But the fact is, the highway bill was supposed to have been \ndone last year by the Senate, and it ought to be done now.\n  We were told it was going to be one of the first items of business. \nNow we are told by the budgeteers that it must wait to follow the \nbudget. To me, that approach is a big mistake. Let me tell you why.\n  If we delay the highway bill until after we have finished the budget \nthis year, we will have delayed the highway bill, which we should have \npassed last year, until well after the middle of this year.\n  States like mine, North Dakota, in the Northern region of this \ncountry, will be terribly disadvantaged once again if we do not pass \nthis bill soon. Northern states have a short construction season. They \nneed to commit most of their money in the spring in order for necessary \nwork to get done before winter sets in again. The plans for highway \nbuilding and bridge building, in my state and many other states, are on \nhold because this Congress has yet to pass this bill. That is why the \nCongress must act quickly in this matter.\n  This is a jobs issue. It is an issue about investment in our \ninfrastructure. Highways and bridges are vitally important to economic \ndevelopment in every state. The longer the highway plans are on hold, \nthe longer people have to wait to make their investment decisions.\n  So I say to the majority leader and others, when the leaders of the \nSenate are planning what the Senate should do tomorrow, the next day, \nor the next week, I hope they will decide to bring the highway bill to \nthe Senate floor.\n  This country needs a highway bill. We have it in our grasp to bring a \nhighway bill to the floor and to debate it and pass it.\n  Someone said, ``Well, gee, there are 100 or 200 amendments to the \nhighway bill.'' So that means it should have been brought up yesterday \nor the day before, and maybe we would have gotten rid of 20 of those \namendments.\n  Let us, day by day, make progress on the highway bill so the American \npeople know that this Congress views transportation investment as a \nhigh priority.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S261-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S263-S268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--S. 1575\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 301, S. \n1575, the Ronald Reagan airport legislation.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be one amendment in order \nto be offered by myself, Senator Coverdell, relative to a modification \nof the original bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the total time for debate be limited to \n2 hours equally divided between Senator McCain and Hollings, or their \ndesignees, and following the debate the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the amendment to be followed by third reading and a vote on \npassage of S. 1575.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, this is \nvery similar of course to the offer made last week.\n  I guess I will just ask: What is wrong with regular order? What is \nwrong with bringing a bill to the Senate floor, having a good debate, \nallowing the opportunity to offer amendments, and proceed under the \nrules of the Senate? Why do we need this gag rule with regard to this \npiece of legislation? Many of us are confused about that. And, \nunfortunately, many of the objections raised are being, in my view, \nmisinterpreted by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nAll we want is an opportunity to offer amendments and to have a good \ndebate.\n  Some have suggested that this opposition is cynical. I don't know \nthat the opposition expressed in the last several days by local \nofficials including the mayor of Alexandria, Kerry Donley, by the \nChairman of the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, Chris \nZimmerman, by the former Governor of Virginia, Linwood Holton, are \ncynical in their opposition to this piece of legislation. We are simply \nraising concerns about whether or not this is the right thing to do.\n  But that again argues, it seems to me, that we need the opportunity \nto have a good debate. This should not be done in 2 hours and with just \none amendment. I give the distinguished Senator credit for his \npersistence and his determination to see this legislation through--but \nas I understand it, the one amendment to be offered by our Republican \ncolleague is the one that literally takes the name ``Washington'' out \nof the title and instead puts in the name ``Reagan.'' We ought to have \na discussion about that.\n  I suggest that perhaps there are other airports that should be \nconsidered to be renamed rather than Washington National Airport. For \ninstance, it seems to me that Dulles International Airport might be a \nbetter candidate. We could have two airports named after two Presidents \nin the Washington area, ``Washington'' and ``Reagan,'' without \naffecting the first President of the United States. But we ought to \nhave an opportunity to debate it. We ought to have an opportunity to \ndiscuss it and consider other amendments.\n  We have suggested as well that nothing would honor this former Ronald \nReagan more than the opportunity to directly address a concern that he \nraised while he was President: the need to reform the IRS. Legislation \nto do just that passed 426 to 4 in the House of Representatives last \nyear. We ought to pass it unanimously here in the Senate before more \nand more Americans are adversely affected by actions taken by IRS. \nSince we failed to act last November, one and a half million Americans \nhave been adversely affected by actions taken by the IRS.\n\n  So let's deal with that legislation. Let's offer that as an amendment \nin tribute. We could even refer to it as the ``Ronald Reagan IRS reform \namendment.''\n  I would just hope that we don't proceed as the first order of \nbusiness imposing a gag rule on the Senate not allowing the opportunity \nfor regular order, not having an opportunity to debate, to listen and \nrespond to local officials.\n  How ironic that in the name of Ronald Reagan we carelessly \ndemonstrate a lack of sensitivity to the local officials that Ronald \nReagan said ought to be paramount in governmental decisionmaking. \nUnfortunately, we are attempting to override the objections that local \ndecisionmakers have about what name should be placed at Washington \nNational Airport. Do we really want to do that? Again, how ironic it \nwould be if we did.\n  So, Madam President, for all those reasons I would simply ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator's request be modified to provide for \nthree first-degree amendments to be in order per side during the \nconsideration of that bill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator agree to modifying his \nrequest?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, regrettably, under those circumstances \nI would have to object to the distinguished Senator's request as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, first let me say this to my good \nfriend, my distinguished colleague, the minority leader. It is \nincorrect to suggest that we are not talking about debate. We want to \nmove to the bill and debate its merits, both for or against it. It is \ntrue that perhaps I, more than any other, am objecting to the concept \nof taking a memorial statement to a former President and turning it \ninto a free-for-all about IRS or other issues. I just do not think that \nis appropriate. I can understand. And if we have a local official, a \nformer Governor, who is opposed to it, then during the course of\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nthe debate that can be heard and people can make their judgments about \nwhether that is correct or wrong. But I can't accept the idea of taking \nsomething in the face of the family and finding ourselves in who knows \nwhat.\n  With regard to the propounding of but one amendment--and that being \nmine, although I know the minority leader and the majority leader have \nnot had a chance to talk about this--but from my point of view that \namendment does not need to be offered. It was an administrative attempt \nto be in concurrence with the House which removed it and made it Ronald \nReagan National Airport. My original legislation is Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport just like it is Washington Dulles Airport. \nI know this is not the moment to resolve that. But the minority leader \nis here, and I am here, and I am passing that along.\n  With regard to the minority leader's suggestion as to other \namendments, of course I would not know what those are. And I hope that \nduring the course of the afternoon or tomorrow that the minority leader \nand the majority leader will have a chance to come to terms on it. But \nI do say in the strongest way that, while we can debate whether we \nshould or shouldn't, I do not think it is appropriate. I think it would \nbe unseemly to the family and everybody associated to open this up \nwhere we are debating other issues--no one wants to modify IRS more \nthan I. But I wouldn't do it on this bill. And that is just a point of \ndisagreement between us.\n\n  I agree with the Senator that it is unfortunate. I do think it is--I \nam the one that used the word ``cynical''--I do think it is reflective \nof the city, that we find ourselves dealing with this effort in this \nway, approaching a filibuster again. I think that it speaks for what it \nis.\n  We can debate it and vote for it or against it depending on whatever \nthe individual Senator's desire would be, no matter their side of the \naisle. I did think that the arguments--and the minority leader wasn't \nthe source of all of those arguments--but they were, I thought, derived \nin an attempt to suggest a debate when in fact it was an attempt to \nstall or delay the legislation.\n  I say to the minority leader, I am going to go on and talk a bit \nabout this, and I do not want him to feel impounded by that in that I \nbasically responded to his comments.\n  Madam President, let me first say this legislation is awfully simple. \nIt doesn't require some of the work such as an overhaul of the IRS or \nredesignation of Medicare. This is an attempt, a very appropriate \nattempt, to honor one of the great Presidents of our time.\n  This past Friday I referred to the process as being cynical. It \nreminds me of just how many changes have occurred in this Capital City \nof ours. At first it was suggested last week that to name it Ronald \nReagan National Airport was removing the name of a former President, \nbut everybody knows that the use of the word ``Washington'' with regard \nto Washington National is referring to location, although I certainly, \nas I told the minority leader, have no problem leaving it the Ronald \nReagan Washington National Airport. But I am doing that because I am \nstill certifying where the airport is. It is in Washington, DC.\n\n  It was suggested to me a little bit earlier that the Baltimore-\nWashington International Airport is not named after Lord Baltimore--it \nis named after a city called Baltimore that is named after Lord \nBaltimore--any more than the designation ``Washington'' in Baltimore-\nWashington International Airport refers to our first President. It \nrefers to the two geographic locations in a very wise marketing attempt \non the part of Baltimore to be an auxiliary airport to Washington \nNational, or to the city airport here in Washington. I just do not feel \nthat is a real nor meritorious problem in dealing with this \nlegislation.\n  Probably the most offensive of the arguments that were offered this \npast Friday was the argument that the Reagan family is not here asking \nfor this to be done. What an unseemly thing to be saying, ``Well, if we \nare going to honor former President Reagan you all have to come here, \nkind of crawl through the door and ask us to do this.'' They will never \ndo that. They will never do that. What are they supposed to do, launch \na lobbying effort or buy some public relations firm to come up here and \nplead with the U.S. Senate that this would be an appropriate gesture?\n  Madam President, I have already taken issue with the idea that you \ntake a memorial, a memorial to a great American leader, and you use it \nas a vehicle to handle all the other processes that go on in the \nCapital City, whether it's IRS or Medicare or some other issue. We all \nknow better than that. Protocol and etiquette simply dismisses that as \nbeing inappropriate, related to a memorial designation. As I said last \nweek, this ought to stand or fall on its own merits. You either support \nthe idea of honoring President Reagan in this way or you don't. But the \nidea of trying to cripple it through a series of amendments is \ndemeaning and inappropriate.\n  I frankly think this filibuster is inappropriate. It seems to become \nmore and more of the process the other side is using. But if you had to \nfind one area where it just was inappropriate, it would be using it in \nthe context of a memorial statement to a former President. And I want \nto repeat, we are dealing with a gentleman who was a great American \nPresident, who was wounded in the twilight of his years, made one of \nthe most magnanimous statements to his countrymen, one of the finest \ndemonstrations of courage and bravery and ongoing public \nresponsibility, whose birthday is this week. This town is not honoring \nitself in this debate--both in the context of the way this is being \nhandled and now we find ourselves in the midst of yet another, in my \njudgment demeaning characteristic, and that is a filibuster.\n  In an era where America yearned for a leader, Ronald Reagan answered \nthe call. It is easy to forget that leadership is not doing what is \npopular based on a poll, it is doing what is right. Time and time \nagain, President Reagan made his decisions on the strength of his \nconvictions, regardless of current polls or popular opinion. How \nquickly we forget how he was mocked, chided, ridiculed when he called \nthe Soviet Union an evil empire, but history has borne him out.\n  I remember very vividly the mocking of President Reagan when he \ncharacterized the Soviet Union as an evil empire, and I remember \nwondering in my mind, and aloud, why in the world would anybody mock \nsomebody for describing the Soviet Union in such a way? This was an \navowed adversary that had enslaved millions of people in a \ndictatorship. But he was mocked when he referred to the Soviet Union as \nan evil empire.\n  Did it deter him? Was he shaken by this? Did he call another press \nconference to try to explain what he meant? No. He said it was an evil \nempire and an avowed adversary and we ought to understand it in that \nway. As I said, people scoffed at his naivete when he demanded that \nMikhail Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall. I can still see him \nstanding there: ``Tear down this wall.'' Freedom won. The Berlin wall \nfell and the world is a completely different place because of the \nconvictions--not only of him. He'd be the first, if he were here, to \nsay, ``I didn't do this alone.'' But he was a giant in the effort.\n\n  I remember several years ago, before his illness, he was in Atlanta, \nGA. It was a Republican Party event that he had agreed to attend. At \nthe end of the meeting, in a very inspiring way, very emotional, the \nchairman of the dinner walked over and gave him, encased, a piece of \nthe Berlin wall, and said, ``I hope you will let this rest on your desk \nto remind you of the achievement your strength of convictions meant to \nour country and to the world.''\n  Now that the wall was down--and instead of this forceful edifice of \noppression that looked down on people, that enslaved people, that \nthreatened people--it had come to the point that it was but a mere \nsouvenir to be sitting on desks or in libraries around the world.\n  Originally, the Congress that I am unfortunately dealing with here \ntoday balked at the idea that families, not Government, should decide \nhow to spend tax dollars. Under Ronald Reagan, the families won one of \nthe largest single tax cuts in American history. And we certainly have \nseen the benefit of it--millions of new jobs. The decade of the 1980s \nwas one of unbridled optimism. As we lowered the pressure on our \nfamilies, left more of the income they produced in their checking\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\naccounts, we saw an unprecedented turnaround from stagflation, from \nunbelievable interest rates, from high taxes; and you saw the American \npeople come forward with almost boundless optimism.\n  For some of the people in this city, they called that a decade of \ngreed. I call it a decade of growth and strength and authority for the \nUnited States--not only in the context that we were able to stand up \nand force the Soviet Union to tear the wall down, but that our everyday \nfamilies from Iowa to Georgia, were better off, and they were \noptimistic, and they regained--you know--it's ``morning in America,'' \nas he would say. And it showed. We were a smiling Nation again.\n\n  Throughout his Presidency, Ronald Reagan stood on principle, and \nhistory has, again, borne him out. In 1981, the office he inherited and \nthe country he was to govern was in grave crisis, both at home and \nabroad. We forget, inflation was double digits.\n  What is that versus today? Several times what it is today. Interest \nrates were over 20 percent. It means if you wanted to buy a house, if \nyou wanted to buy a car, you were going to pay 20 cents on the dollar \njust to use the money. All of you have seen the ads for automobiles \ntoday. Some are as low as 6 percent. So it was dragging our economy \ndown.\n  Ronald Reagan's most critical opponents would acknowledge that \nPresident Reagan's policies reversed our course, bringing prosperity to \nhome and allowing us to stand tall once again abroad.\n  President Reagan taught us that leadership, as I said, is more than \npolls and focus groups. Leadership is not doing what is popular and \nthen trying to make it right. It is doing what is right and then making \nit popular. As Eric Sevareid said of Harry Truman in David McCullough's \nbook ``Truman,'' ``Remembering him reminds people of what a man in that \noffice ought to be like. It's character, just character, and he stands \nlike a rock in memory now.''\n  Madam President, Ronald Reagan is a rock of our time, and history is \ngoing to demonstrate that again and again.\n  The Wall Street Journal of Monday, January 5, 1998, talks about \nRonald Reagan. ``Reagan National Airport'' is the headline. I am going \nto share it with the Senate:\n\n       The Republican Governors Association has unanimously \n     endorsed renaming Washington's chief transportation gateway \n     the ``Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.''\n\n  I might add, that includes the current Governor of Virginia, not a \nformer Governor, the current Governor.\n\n       The move gives impetus to a plan by Congressional leaders \n     to pass legislation honoring the former President in time for \n     his 87th birthday on February 6.\n\n  This week, which is what is so frustrating about this filibuster. We \nare running on a short fuse here, Madam President.\n\n       A big booster of the idea is Governor George Allen of \n     Virginia, where National Airport is located.\n\n  Of course, he is now retired from that governorship.\n\n       He notes that many airports are named after famous people, \n     from San Diego's Lindbergh to New York's LaGuardia, Chicago's \n     O'Hare, Washington's Dulles Airport and Orange County's John \n     Wayne Airport. A serious effort is under way to rename Los \n     Angeles' airport after actor and World War II aviator Jimmy \n     Stewart. The late President John F. Kennedy was honored by \n     having the nation's largest international airport named after \n     him in 1964.\n       Friends of Mr. Reagan say National Airport is a more \n     appropriate memorial than the new $818 million government \n     office building in Washington that is also named after him.\n\n  I know this to be the case. Washington National is a symbol. It is \nsomething that millions of passengers see every year, both domestic and \nforeign. Those of us who share my view think that is the appropriate \nmemorial to designate Ronald Reagan Airport.\n\n       To have him identified with [this building]--\n\n  And I am going to modify this language, I don't want to read it \nexactly--``represents everything he was opposed to, is the ultimate \nirony.''\n  That is the big building.\n\n       ``He wanted to pare back government,'' says former Senator \n     Paul Laxalt. In contrast, renaming National Airport would \n     cost almost nothing.\n\n  Now we know it costs nothing because we have had letters from people \nwilling to pay for any changes, citizens who are willing to step \nforward.\n\n       ``You're talking about a few signs and a logo,'' says David \n     Ralston, chairman of the airport's authority. Grover \n     Norquist, who came up with the idea as head of the Ronald \n     Reagan Legacy Project, says he will be happy to raise money \n     to pay for any extra costs if Democrats find that a reason \n     to object.\n\n  We have already put that to bed. We have another citizen who already \nstepped forward who said he would see to any financial costs associated \nwith renaming the airport.\n\n       A few already are grouching privately. While President \n     Clinton has declined to say if he would sign the name change \n     into law, some Democrats in Congress mutter that Mr. Reagan \n     is an inappropriate choice. Washington, D.C.'s Mayor Marion \n     Barry says ``a host of other people'' should be considered.\n\n  As I have said, if they believe that this memorial is inappropriate, \nthey should speak to it and vote against it. But using specious \narguments to somehow cloud the effort I do not think is appropriate.\n\n       But the first frontal assault on the idea came from Mary \n     McGrory, the Washington Post's venerable liberal columnist. \n     She says the idea ``should be nipped in the bud.''\n\n  She must have some influence here.\n\n       Mr. Reagan ``didn't only rail against Washington, he \n     genuinely despised it. . .''\n\n  I have to say that is just such an inappropriate characterization of \nour former President. He didn't like a lot of the ideas. He didn't like \nthe idea that this town thought it ran America, but he did love \nAmerica, and he was a believer in its optimism and its glory and \nunderstood that this was the capital of the free world for which he \ngave so much of his life to protect.\n  She says:\n\n       He took no part in its revels or its problems. He was in no \n     way attached to it.\n\n  I think most Americans would find not being attached to the Capital \nCity an attribute. If I have one criticism of the city in the brief \ntime I have been here, it is that too many people succumb to this city \nand the idea that it dominates the Nation.\n\n       She concludes by saying ``we do not know what Ronald Reagan \n     feels about all this. He is not himself.''\n\n  That is accurate. He has fallen ill, as we all know.\n\n       That may be true, but Nancy Reagan and Mr. Reagan's son \n     Michael are on record as supporting the idea. Governor Allen \n     says a Reagan Airport would gladden the hearts of millions of \n     Americans who don't view Washington as an imperial city.\n\n  It is true that President Reagan did not view this as an imperial \ncity.\n\n       He says generations of future lawmakers would do well to \n     remember Mr. Reagan as they fly in to pass laws. ``Every time \n     they come here, they'll be reminded they're here to serve the \n     people, even though they're far from home,'' Governor Allen \n     says.\n\n  Nothing can restore Ronald Reagan to the inspirational vitality that \nso inspired Americans during the 1980s, qualities that are vividly \nrecalled in the superb PBS biography of Mr. Reagan that will air \nnationally on February 23 and 24. Still, we can't help but think the \ncountry would benefit from having such a visible national symbol \nhonoring him.\n\n  Great last line:\n\n       Name this one for the Gipper.\n\n  Madam President, I have alluded several times here this afternoon to \nthe fact that our former President has been afflicted with a crippling \nillness. President Reagan faced personal adversity many times during \nhis Presidency. Being cut down by an assassin's bullet would have been \nenough to knock the wind out of almost anybody, but not President \nReagan. I remember this incident so vividly. I think most Americans \nwould.\n  I happened to be in London that afternoon. Nancy and I were having \ndinner. It is very interesting. The waiter came over, and he leaned \nover, and he said, ``Pardon me. Are you Americans?''\n  I guess we must have looked a little different to him or maybe it was \nthe southern accent. I am not sure. But he said, ``Are you Americans?'' \nAnd I said, ``Yes, we are. Thank you.'' And in the most somber way, he \nleaned over and he said that he was so sorry to advise me that, ``Your \nPresident has been shot.'' He was just stunned. And he said, ``We would \nlike to help you, so we have arranged for a television in our living \nquarters upstairs, if you might like to understand what has happened.'' \nWe immediately dashed upstairs.\n  We shared the shock of everyone in the world wondering at that \nmoment,\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nhad we lost this great President. And where was the Vice President? And \nwhat was actually happening? But even in that moment you could sense \nthe world's admiration, even in this waiter, even in this community, \nthis restaurant, their admiration for President Reagan, and trying to \nhelp the only Americans that were right there in front of them to see \nthem through this situation.\n  Or do you remember when he was diagnosed with cancer? He bounced back \nagain. Couldn't take the Gipper down.\n  But now he faces his greatest battle--Alzheimer's disease. And he has \nnot shrunk from the challenge. Ronald Reagan chose to use his personal \nsuffering to bring public focus on the devastation caused by this \ndisease, and in so doing once again took the cards he was given and \nturned them to another public use.\n  Last Thursday, Madam President, I shared the unbelievable letter that \nPresident Reagan wrote to his fellow countrymen and to the world, for \nthat matter. I am going to share that again this afternoon because it \nis not long. And I think it speaks to the nature of the individual we \nare trying to honor on his 87th birthday.\n  He said, on November 5, 1994--not that long ago:\n\n       My fellow Americans, I have recently been told that I am \n     one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with \n     Alzheimer's disease.\n       Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether \n     as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or \n     whether we would make this news known in a public way. In the \n     past, Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer \n     surgeries. We found through our open disclosures we were able \n     to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a result, \n     many more people underwent testing. They were treated in \n     early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives.\n       So now we feel it is important to share it with you. In \n     opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater \n     awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a \n     clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are \n     affected by it.\n       At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the \n     remainder of the years God gives me on this Earth doing the \n     things I have always done. I will continue to share life's \n     journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy \n     the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and \n     supporters.\n       Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's disease progresses, the \n     family often bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some \n     way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience. When \n     the time comes, I am confident that with your help she will \n     face it with faith and courage.\n       In closing, let me thank you, the American people, for \n     giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your \n     President. When the Lord calls me home, whenever that day may \n     be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of \n     ours and eternal optimism for its future.\n       I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset \n     of my life. I know that for America there will always be a \n     bright dawn ahead.\n       Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you.\n       Sincerely, Ronald Reagan.\n\n  Every time I read this I am just struck, as I was with the \nassassination attempt, with the bout with cancer. I remember when he \nwas first running for President--he had been an actor --and there was \nno way he possessed the qualifications to be President. And then, of \ncourse, he was too old. I think this President defied about everything \nthey could put in front of him. And he turned out to be one of the \ntruly great American Presidents of this century and for all time.\n  I know that if we are able to accomplish this, and can do so by his \nbirthday this week, we will have made but a small gesture to \nacknowledge our gratitude for an enormous career and an America for \nwhich all time--all time--will be changed, for which millions of people \nare now free that were not, for thousands upon thousands of men and \nwomen in our military and others who did not have to lift up their arms \nto accomplish the transformation in Europe.\n  Many of those people probably do not realize how much they are \nindebted to this great President. Wouldn't it be nice to remind them, \nand wouldn't it be nice for them to understand, through this gesture, \nwhat a great leader can mean to the Nation, our country and our future?\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, one of President Reagan's most ardent \nsupporters, if not the most ardent, oddly enough, is not an American \ncitizen. A moment ago I was talking about an individual--I wish I kept \nthis person's name--that was a British citizen. Oddly enough, it was \nthis individual's Prime Minister who is probably President Reagan's \nmost ardent supporter, Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of Britain, \n1979 to 1990.\n  Recently, a book has been published of vignettes and remembrances of \nRonald Reagan. There is a short one from Margaret Thatcher that I will \nshare with the Senate.\n\n       I . . . met Governor Reagan shortly after my becoming \n     conservative leader in 1975. Even before then I knew about \n     Governor Reagan because Denis [her husband] had returned home \n     one evening in the late 1960s full of praise for a remarkable \n     speech Ronald Reagan had just delivered to the Institute of \n     Directors.. I read the text myself and quickly saw what Denis \n     meant. When we met in person [she is talking about meeting \n     Governor Reagan] . . . I was immediately won over by his \n     charm, sense of humor, and directness.\n\n  These are all very important characteristics of President Reagan. \nCharm. The other side all referred to him as Teflon. Sense of humor. It \nwas absolutely captivating to be in his presence because he could so \neffectively use humor to calm things down, to take the sting out of a \nconfrontation, to move people back to the table. He was the best at \nusing his sense of humor. And then the directness. Directness.\n  Years ago when he was first running for President, in 1976, I was \nsummoned to a meeting at Atlanta International Airport which is named \nfor Hartsfield, one of our distinguished former mayors. The Governor \nwas going to visit with us. He was reaching out and trying to meet \nRepublicans everywhere. We didn't have many in Georgia at that time, \nbut a few of us gathered together, and he came in the room. I tended to \nsupport our sitting President, President Gerald Ford. I thought it made \nsense the party should stick with the incumbent President. The Governor \nwas making a case for himself.\n  I asked the very last question. I asked the Governor, ``Now, look, if \nwe are going to be in such a tough election, why does it make sense to \nreplace a sitting incumbent with all the assets that that person can \nbring to the contest?'' And that threw Governor Reagan a bit, threw him \noff. So then the person stood up and said, ``Well, that concludes our \nmeeting,'' and without a heartbeat, Governor Reagan said, ``We are not \nending this meeting on that question,'' and he took another question \nthat was on a more optimistic note and completely turned the meeting \naround. His directness and his ability to take charge in any setting \nwas remarkable.\n\n       In the succeeding years I read his speeches, advocating tax \n     cuts as the root to wealth creation and stronger defenses as \n     an alternative to detente. I also read many of his radio \n     broadcasts which his press secretary sent over regularly for \n     me. I agreed with them all. In November 1978 we met again in \n     my room in the House of Commons.\n       In the early years Ronald Reagan had been dismissed by much \n     of the American political elite though not by the American \n     electorate. . . [they considered him] a right-wing maverick \n     who could not be taken seriously. Now he was seen by many \n     thoughtful Republicans as their best ticket back to the White \n     House. Whatever Ronald Reagan had gained in experience, he \n     had not done so at the expense of his beliefs. I found him \n     stronger than ever. When he left my study, I reflected on how \n     different things might look if such a man were President of \n     the United States. But, in November 1978, such a prospect \n     seemed a long way off.\n       The so-called Reagan Doctrine, which Ronald Reagan \n     developed in his speech to both Houses of Parliament in \n     1982, demonstrated just how potent a weapon in \n     international politics human rights can be. His view was \n     that we should fight the battle of ideas for freedom \n     against communism through the world, and refuse to accept \n     the permanent exclusion of the captive nations from the \n     benefits of freedom.\n       This unashamedly philosophical approach and the armed \n     strength supporting it transformed the political world. \n     President Reagan undermined the Soviet Union at home by \n     giving hope to its citizens, directly assisted rebellions \n     against illegitimate Communist\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\n     regimes in Afghanistan and Nicaragua [in our own hemisphere] \n     and facilitated the peaceful transition to democracy in Latin \n     American countries and the Philippines. Of course, previous \n     American governments had extolled human rights, and President \n     Carter had even declared that they were the ``soul'' of U.S. \n     foreign policy. Where President Reagan went beyond these, \n     however, was in making the Soviets the principal targets of \n     his human rights campaign, and moving from rhetorical to \n     material support for anti-Communist guerrillas in countries \n     where Communist regimes had not securely established \n     themselves. The result was a decisive advance for freedom in \n     the world . . . In this instance, human rights and wider \n     American purposes were in complete harmony.\n\n  Madam President, I will read a letter to the Senate.\n\n                                                  January 2, 1998.\n       Gentlemen: I endorse and support H.R. 2625 and S. 1297. \n     Both would redesignate Washington National Airport as \n     ``Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gerald R. Ford.\n\n  Madam President, this next Friday, February 6, as President Reagan \nlikes to put it, will be the 48th anniversary of his 39th birthday.\n  We have been blessed to have had such a great leader, dedicated to \nprinciple. Ronald Reagan distinguished himself in several careers in \nhis lifetime. He was a radio sportscaster, announcing Cubs games for \nWHO in Des Moines, IA; an actor in films, such as ``Knute Rockne, All-\nAmerican;'' a union leader--head of the Screen Actors Guild; a two-term \nGovernor of California; and a twice-elected President of the United \nStates.\n  So today, Madam President, I say to my colleagues, let's pass this \none for the Gipper.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, we are developing a position here that I \ndon't particularly like, as it relates to naming an airport after one \nof our great Presidents. One of the things that concerns me most is \nwhat Ronald Reagan did as President. When he wrote his federalist \npapers, the Executive Order, I believe, 12612, it related to States \nrights and local authority.\n  I want to explain my views on this legislation to rename the \nWashington National Airport. This airport has been named the Washington \nNational Airport since 1941. Franklin Roosevelt laid the cornerstone \nfor the airport. The airport is on property that once belonged to the \nfamily of Martha Washington and the stepson of George Washington. What \nwe are about to do is not an appropriate way to honor, in my opinion, \none of our Presidents. In fact, in a sense, it dishonors our first \nPresident.\n  Ronald Reagan will have his place in history, having served two terms \nas President. His name is already etched on the second-largest \nGovernment building in this community. And in April, his lovely wife \nNancy will be here to celebrate and dedicate the opening of that \nbuilding. President Reagan clearly believed that State and local \ngovernments should be given the power to act, wherever possible, rather \nthan the Federal Government. In fact, he issued an Executive order so \nthat all Federal agencies made sure that local decisions were \nrespected.\n  Each of our major airports named after a President was accomplished \nbecause of local decisions. In Houston, George Bush's name was added to \nthe name of the airport because of a decision by the mayor and the city \ncouncil. In New York, the mayor, city council, and port authority \nhonored John F. Kennedy. Here, we have objections, not support, from \nlocal communities. We may all agree that it should be renamed, but \nshould we run roughshod over the views of the local citizenry? That \nwould be contrary to President Reagan's papers, the Executive Order \n12612.\n  One year prior to signing the executive order on federalism, Congress \nenacted legislation, championed by President Reagan's Secretary of \nTransportation, that created a multi-State airport authority to run and \noperate the two Washington-area airports. We turned over the keys to \nthe Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which we refer to as \nMWAA. On March 1, 1987, Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole \nsigned a 50-year lease with MWAA. Lock, stock and barrel, subject to \ncertain limitations, we gave them the keys to the Washington National \nAirport.\n  Section after section of the 1986 act recognizes the independence of \nMWAA from the Federal Government for the purposes of running the \nairport. The lease also has similar language.\n  It is not clear to me that we can clearly usurp the local airport \nauthority's power and merely rename the airport. Yet, this bill does \njust that. In 1990--just think back a few short years ago--Senator Dole \nappropriately introduced a resolution to rename the Dulles Airport \nafter former President Eisenhower. Now, Eisenhower was a very good \nPresident. He was a very good military leader; World War II was won by \nhis genius. The Dole bill, however, recognized the local operating \nauthority, and rather than usurping that authority, it urged the \nairport authority to make the name change. That was done appropriately \nand by the law and by President Reagan's federalist papers, where he \nsaid local authority should be the uppermost.\n\n  If we had worked this issue properly, Madam President, I suspect we \nwould have come to a similar conclusion and found a way to recognize \nour former President. Instead, we will rename the airport by fiat and \nlet the lawyers have their day in court. The legality may be challenged \nand, in my view, the lawyers may have an excellent chance of winning. \nWe are running over local authority with this piece of legislation. \nThey say that closer to the runway are those who are associated with \nthis area, and those who operate the airport would prefer that the 56-\nyear-old airport stay Washington National. And joining officials from \nAlexandria, who are opposed, and Arlington, who have previously said \nthey oppose the change, the Greater Washington Board of Trade weighed \nin against this change last week. ``With all due respect to President \nReagan, we believe that renaming the airport would be very confusing to \nair travelers, visitors, and local residents alike,'' the chairman of \nthe Board's Transportation and Environment Committee said.\n  Let me quote the first Republican Governor of Virginia this century--\nand I served with him--A. Linwood Holton, Jr.:\n\n       I also urge Congress not to impose the change on the \n     Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, which oversees \n     National and Dulles International Airport under this 50-year \n     lease from the Federal Government.\n\n  Linwood Holton says:\n\n       I hate to see even something as politically popular as this \n     begin to chip away at the independence of local authority.\n\n  It's not easy to stand up here and be opposed to having the name of a \nfamous and well-liked President on an airport. But someone, somehow has \nto understand that we are usurping local authority and the local people \ndo not want it, and we would be giving them something they don't want, \nand that is typically Federal Government.\n  My colleague from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, read a letter from the \nformer President announcing his problems with having Alzheimer's and \nhis wife having a problem as it relates to breast cancer. And if the \nGipper could tell us today what he would rather have, I believe he \nwould rather have something named on behalf of his wife as it relates \nto the fight against breast cancer in this country today. That would be \nmeaningful. That would be helpful. And it would be something that I \nthink you would find 100-percent support for.\n\n  So, Madam President, I regret that I must oppose this piece of \nlegislation. You can go across the country. I named Houston for \nPresident George Bush, New York for President Kennedy, Denver--they \ndecided to name the airport after a former mayor. And Las Vegas named \nit after a former Senator.\n  So it is on and on, and all of the decisions were made by the people \nof those communities. President Reagan would not want us to violate his \nprinciples in the process of naming something in his honor.\n  Let's think about that just a minute. President Reagan would not want \nus to violate his principles in the process of naming something in his \nhonor.\n  The law states that the airport assumes all rights and obligations as \nan airport. And it should be treated like all other airports. Can we \nmandate a renaming of any other airport? I don't think so.\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\n  So, Madam President, I hope that something can be worked out rather \nthan having the resolution amended to add other names; the resolution \nbe amended to take care of the IRS, the resolution be amended to do a \nlot of other things.\n  So let's look at the ownership of this property for a moment, if we \nmay.\n  Originally it was owned by the Alexandria family, for which the city \nof Alexandria is named. That is who owned this property.\n  The property was later owned by the Custis family. John Parke Custis \nacquired the land from the Alexandria family. John Parke Custis was the \nson of Martha Washington, and the stepson of George Washington.\n  George Washington was close to John Custis, and following John's \ndeath adopted his two children. The children then lived at Mount \nVernon. And the airport was designed after Mount Vernon.\n  The Abington Plantation was returned later to the Alexandria family.\n  In the 1920's, the land was owned by Lewis Smoot, and later sold to \nthe Richmond, Fredricksburg, and Potomac Railroad.\n  Two airports were located near the Virginia side of the 14th Street \nBridge; one the Hoover Field. That was after a President, which opened \nin 1926, and Washington Airport opened in 1927. The airports merged \nbecause of the Depression.\n  The decision to build Washington National Airport did not occur until \n1938 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt effectively bypassed this body and \nbegan construction.\n  Following a series of disputes over who actually owned the land, the \nDistrict of Columbia and Virginia claimed title. The Federal Government \nasserted jurisdiction in 1946.\n  So not only has the George Washington family--the first--of these \nUnited States been involved in this property in this area for the \nlifetime of this country but I think that leaving the name as it is, or \nchanging the name to whatever should be, as President Reagan insisted \nthat we do back in the 1986 when he wrote his Federal Executive order, \nI think it would be much better to honor his wife since his name is \nalready etched in the second-largest building in this area, second only \nto the Pentagon. I hope that a way can be found rather than to make it \nlook partisan, and some will take my position because they think it is \nright. Others will take an opposite view because of the political \narena. Some will take the same view I have because of politics. I have \ntaken the view because of what President Reagan said in his papers, \nExecutive Order 16612, that said that communities and the States and in \ntheir judgment should be respected. And I think we ought to do what the \nformer President asked us to do.\n  I see no one wanting the floor. Madam President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S263-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S268-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S268-S271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT OF THE BUDGET OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 88\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January 30, 1975, to \nthe Committee on Appropriations, and to the Committee on the Budget.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The 1999 Budget, which I am submitting to you with this message, is a \nbalanced Federal budget, marking the first such budget in 30 years and \nbringing an era of exploding deficits to an end.\n  By reaching balance, my budget represents a remarkable turnaround in \nour fiscal policy over the last five years. It brings to an end three \ndecades of fiscal chaos, a period in which Americans had lost \nconfidence in their Government and the ability of their leaders to do \nthe people's business.\n  This budget is not just balanced, it is balanced the right way. It \nnot only ends the deficit, it reflects the values that Americans hold \ndear--the values of opportunity, responsibility, and community. The \nbudget reflects my commitment to continue helping working families with \ntheir basic needs--to raise their children, send them to college, and \npay for health care.\n  The budget invests in education and training and in research to raise \nthe standard of living for average Americans. It invests in the \nenvironment and in law enforcement to raise the quality of life across \nour Nation. It invests in our communities at home while providing the \nresources to maintain a strong defense and conduct the international \nrelations that have become so important to our future.\n  In the public and private sectors, prospects for a budget surplus are \nspurring a wide array of ideas about how to spend it. At this point, \nthe Government has not yet reached the surplus milestone, and I \ncontinue to believe strongly that we should not spend a surplus that we \ndon't yet have.\n  More specifically, I believe that the Administration and Congress \nshould not spend a budget surplus for any reason until we have a \nsolution to the long-term financing challenge facing Social Security. \nWith that in mind, my budget proposes a reserve for the projected \nsurpluses for 1999 and beyond.\n\n\n            Preparing the Nation for A New American Century\n\n  Five years ago, my Administration took office determined to restore \nthe American Dream for every American. We were determined to turn the \neconomy around, to rein in a budget that was out of control, and to \ncreate a Government that once again would focus on its customers, the \nAmerican people.\n  Five years later, we have made enormous progress. Our economy is \nstrong, our budget is headed toward balance, and our Government is \nmaking noticeable progress in providing better service to Americans.\n  We are beginning to bring Americans together again, to repair the \nsocial fabric that has frayed so badly in recent decades. All across \nAmerica, crime is down, poverty is down, and welfare is down. Incomes \nare rising at all levels, and a new spirit of optimism is sweeping \nthrough many of our urban and rural communities that are rebounding \nfrom decades of lost jobs and lost hope.\n  Now that we have turned the economy around, our task is to spread the \nbenefits of our economic well-being to more Americans, to ensure that \nevery American has the chance to live out his or her dreams. As we move \nconfidently ahead as a Nation, we want to ensure that nobody is left \nbehind.\n  A century ago, the economy shifted from agriculture to manufacturing, \nchanging the way that Americans lived, the way they worked, the way \nthey related to one another. Today, the economy is shifting once more, \nthis time from manufacturing to services, information, technology, and \nglobal commerce.\n  We can ensure that every American fully enjoys the benefits of this \nexciting new age, but only if we continue to give people the tools they \nneed and create the conditions in which they can prosper. That is what \nmy budget is designed to do.\n\n\n                   Creating a Bright Economic Future\n\n  When my Administration took office, the Nation was mired in economic \nproblems. The economy had barely grown over four years, creating few \njobs. Interest rates were high. Incomes remained stagnant for all but \nthe most well-off. The budget deficit, which had exploded in size in \nthe early 1980s, had reached a record $290 billion and was headed \nhigher. Clearly, the Nation needed a new course.\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\n  We launched an economic policy with three central features that had \nnever before been tried together: We set out to reduce the deficit, \ninvest in the American people, and open up markets abroad. Only by \npursuing all three elements could we restore the economy and build for \nthe future.\n  My 1993 budget plan, the centerpiece of our economic strategy, was a \nbalanced plan that cut hundreds of billions of dollars of Federal \nspending while raising income taxes only on the top 1.2 percent of \nAmericans. By cutting unnecessary and lower-priority spending, we found \nthe resources to cut taxes for 15 million working families while \ninvesting in education and training, the environment, and other \npriorities.\n  Five years later, we have cut the deficit dramatically, and this \nbudget will finish the job by reaching balance and keeping the budget \nin balance for the foreseeable future. We have invested in the \neducation and skills of our people, giving them the tools they need to \nraise their children and get good jobs in an increasingly competitive \neconomy. We have expanded trade through global as well as bilateral \nagreements, generating record exports that create high-wage jobs for \nmillions of Americans.\n  The economy responded almost immediately to our policies. When I \nannounced my 1993 budget plan, interest rates fell, and they fell even \nmore as I worked successfully with Congress to put the plan into law. \nThese lower interest rates helped to spur the steady economic growth \nand strong business investment that we have enjoyed for the last five \nyears. Our policies have helped create over 14 million jobs, while \ninterest rates have remained low and inflation has stayed under \ncontrol.\n  As we move ahead, I am determined to ensure that we stick with the \npolicies that are working. We must maintain our fiscal discipline so \nthat we not only reach balance, but also keep the budget in balance.\n\n\n            Improving Performance through Better Management\n\n  We are balancing the budget the right way, by reducing the size and \nscope of our Government.\n  We have done more than just eliminate hundreds of Federal programs \nand projects. We have cut the civilian Federal work force by over \n316,000 employees, giving us the smallest work force in 35 years. In \nfact, as a share of our total civilian employment, we have the smallest \nwork force since 1931.\n  But we set out to do more than just cut Government. Under the \nleadership of the Vice President's National Performance Review, we set \nout to make Government work, to create a Government that is more \nefficient and effective, to create a Government focused on its \ncustomers, the American people.\n  We have made real progress, but we still have much work to do. We \nhave reinvented parts of departments and agencies, but now we are \ndetermined to turn our agencies around from top to bottom. For 1999, \nthe Vice President will lead an effort to improve the performance of \nagencies that interact most with the American people. We want to enable \nAmericans not only to quickly enjoy better service from our Government, \nbut to regain confidence in Government as well.\n  At the same time, I am determined that we will solve the very real \nmanagement challenges before us. A good example is the challenge of \nensuring that our computer systems can accurately process the year 2000 \ndate change. I have directed my Administration to take the necessary \nsteps to meet the problem head-on.\n\n\n                     Preparing for the 21st Century\n\n  Nothing is more important to our future than education. It has become \nthe dividing line between those who are moving ahead and those who are \nlagging behind. That is why I have devoted so much effort to ensure \nthat we have a world-class system of education and training in place \nfor Americans of all ages. Over the last five years, we have worked \nhard to ensure that every boy and girl is prepared to learn, that our \nschools focus on high standards and achievement, that anyone who wants \nto go to college can get the financial help to attend, and that those \nwho need a second chance at education and training or a chance to \nimprove or learn new skills can do so. My budget significantly \nincreases funds to help children, especially in the poorest \ncommunities, reach challenging academic standards and makes further \nprogress in implementing voluntary national tests. It proposes to build \nmore classrooms and pay for 100,000 more teachers so that we can reduce \nclass sizes. For higher education and training, my budget increases \nPell Grants and other college scholarships from the record levels that \nwe have already achieved; expands College Work-Study to a record one \nmillion students; streamlines student loan programs and cuts student \nfees; and expands access to job placement services, training, and \nrelated services for dislocated workers and others. Now that anyone who \nwants to attend college can find the means through Hope scholarships, \nPell Grants, and other assistance that we worked so hard to enact, I \nwant to provide the same universal opportunity for job training and re-\ntraining to those who need it.\n  Over the last five years, we have worked hard to help working \nfamilies. We cut taxes for 15 million working families, provided a tax \ncredit to help families raise their children, ensured that 25 million \nAmericans a year can change jobs without losing their health insurance, \nmade it easier for the self-employed and those with pre-existing \nconditions to get health insurance, provided health care coverage for \nup to five million uninsured children, raised the minimum wage, and \nprovided guaranteed time off for workers who need to care for a newborn \nor address the health needs of a family member. Now, with my new Child \nCare Initiative, I am determined to provide the help that families need \nwhen it comes to finding safe, high-quality, affordable child care. \nParents should know that, when they go to work, their children are in \nsafe, healthy environments. I also propose to address the problems \nfaced by a particular group of working families--legal immigrants. In \nsigning the 1996 welfare reform law, I said that I would try to restore \nthe cuts in benefits for legal immigrants that were not only harsh and \nunnecessary but that had nothing to do with the fundamental goal of \nwelfare reform--to move people from welfare to work while protecting \nchildren. My budget restores Food Stamps to 730,000 legal immigrants \nand lets States provide health insurance to the children of legal \nimmigrants.\n  This past year, we continued to improve health care for millions of \nAmericans. We strengthened Medicare by extending the life of the trust \nfund until at least 2010, while we also invested in preventive \nbenefits, introduced more choice of health plans, and strengthened our \nexpending array of activities to combat fraud and abuse. We extended \nhealth care coverage to up to five million uninsured children. We \ncreated the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in \nthe Health Care Industry and we later endorsed its Health Care Consumer \nBill of Rights. With this budget, I propose that we build on our \nachievements on a host of important fronts. I want to work with \nCongress to enact national bipartisan tobacco legislation; nothing is \nmore potentially important to the health of our people, particularly \nchildren. My budget also proposes to expand health care coverage for \nsome of the most vulnerable Americans aged 55 to 65, to enroll more \neligible children in Medicaid, to provide for unprecedented levels of \ninvestment in health research, to expand access to powerful AIDS \ntherapies, to expand access to cancer clinical trials, to increase \nfunds for substance abuse treatment and prevention, and to help reduce \nhealth-related disparities across racial and ethnic groups.\n  Last year was a remarkable one for the environment, and I am \ndetermined to build on our progress. Led by the Vice President, the \nAdministration reached a historic international agreement in Kyoto that \ncalls for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. We also issued new, more \nprotective air quality standards to better safeguard public health, and \nwe strengthened our citizens' right to know about toxic chemical \nreleases. We continued to protect our natural treasures, such as \nYellowstone National Park and Florida's Everglades, and to make further \nprogress toward my goal of cleaning up 900 hazardous waste sites under \nthe Superfund by the end of the year 2001. With this budget, I am \nproposing an Environmental Resources Fund for America that will support \nincreases for many of\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nour key environmental programs. It provides for more construction, \nmaintenance, and land acquisition for national parks, forests, refuges, \nand other public lands; for a new effort to improve the quality of our \nwater; for improvements to community drinking water and wastewater \nfacilities; and for continuing our efforts to clean up abandoned \nhazardous waste sites. My budget also includes a new, five-year, $6 \nbillion program to prevent global warming, and more resources to \nprotect endangered species, control pollution, and preserve the global \nenvironment.\n\n  I am proposing a Transportation Fund for America, reflecting my \ncommitment to provide the resources to ensure that our transportation \ninfrastructure remains safe, integrated, and efficient enough to serve \nour growing needs. Investment in infrastructure is good for America \nbecause it helps grow the economy, improve safety and public health, \nstrengthen our competitiveness abroad, support our national security, \nand increase the mobility, access, and choice for Americans who need to \ntravel. We must build upon our vast network of roads, highways, and \nbridges to meet the demands of the next century for a system that links \nour various modes of travel, that is cleaner and safer, and that helps \nbring together and support our urban and rural communities. My budget \nmaintains the Administration's record support for transportation, and \nthe Fund includes all of the Transportation Department's highway, \nhighway safety, transit, and air transportation programs.\n  Scientific and technological advances have created a world vastly \ndifferent from the one our grandparents knew. They have helped generate \nhuge leaps in the speed and economy of transportation, enormous \nincreases in farm productivity, lightning-fast flows of information and \nservices across national borders, and advances in treating and \npreventing diseases and protecting the environment. Because I am \ncommitted to America's continued leadership in science and technology, \nI am proposing a Research Fund for America, from which many of our \nimportant investments will flow. It includes record increases for the \nNational Institutes of Health, higher funding for the National Science \nFoundation, new resources to address global climate change, and a wide \nvariety of investments in basic and applied research. These investments \nare vital; they help to create new knowledge, train more workers, spur \nnew jobs and industries, address our health care challenges, strengthen \nour understanding of environmental problems, better educate our \nchildren, and maintain a strong national defense.\n  Our anti-crime strategy is working. Serious crime is down five years \nin a row and, in 1996, we witnessed the largest drop in violent crime \nin 35 years. But, because crime remains unacceptably high, we must go \nfurther. My budget expands our community policing (COPS) program, which \nis already putting 83,000 more police on the streets toward my goal of \n100,000 by the year 2000. The budget also proposes a new Community \nProsecutors Initiative to help prosecutors prevent crimes from \noccurring, rather than simply prosecuting criminals after the fact. And \nit provides the necessary funds to prevent violence against women, to \nhelp States and Indian Tribes build prisons, and to address the growing \nlaw enforcement crisis on Indian lands. To boost our efforts to control \nillegal immigration, the budget provides the resources to strengthen \nborder enforcement in the South and West, to remove illegal aliens, and \nto expand our efforts to verify whether newly hired non-citizens are \neligible for jobs. To combat drug use, particularly among young people, \nmy budget expands programs that stress treatment and prevention, law \nenforcement, international assistance, and interdiction. It continues \nto build on our innovative Drug Courts initiative, proposes School Drug \nPrevention Coordinators for our schools, supports local efforts that \ntarget drug-using offenders, expands drug testing, and strengthens our \nefforts to make our ports and borders more secure from drugs while \ndisrupting drug trafficking organizations overseas.\n\n  Most Americans are enjoying the fruits of our strong economy. But \nwhile many urban and rural areas are doing better, too many others have \ngrown disconnected from our values of opportunity, responsibility, and \ncommunity. Working with State and local governments and with the \nprivate sector, I am determined to help bring our distressed areas back \nto life, to replace despair with hope. My budget expands my national \nservice program, giving more Americans the chance to serve their \ncountry and help solve problems at the local level while earning money \nfor college. I am proposing to create more Empowerment Zones and \nEnterprise Communities that offer tax incentives and direct spending to \nencourage the kind of private investment that creates jobs, and to \nprovide more capital for lending through my Community Development \nFinancial Institutions program. My budget also expands opportunities \nfor homeownership, provides more funds to enforce the Nation's civil \nrights laws, maintains our Government-to-Government commitment to \nNative Americans, and strengthens the partnership we have begun with \nthe District of Columbia.\n  Because America continues to have a tremendous stake in world \naffairs, my budget proposes the necessary funds to maintain national \nsecurity, to conduct our diplomacy, to promote democracy and free \nmarkets abroad, and to increase exports. Last year, my Administration \nworked with Congress to increase international affairs spending. But, \nCongress faces an unfinished agenda to provide financial support for, \nand fulfill America's obligations to, a number of international \norganizations that benefit our economy and serve other objectives, \nincluding the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations \nsystem, and the multilateral development banks. Congress should \ncontinue to support the decisive action of the IMF as well as our \nleadership in that institution by providing the supplementary \ncontingent IMF funding that the Administration has sought and \nreplenishing the IMF's basic financial resources. Congress also should \ngive the President traditional trade negotiating authority to help fuel \nour surging exports into the next century. To enhance national \nsecurity, my budget maintains large-scale funding to support the Middle \nEast peace process, continues assistance to Bosnia to carry out the \nDayton Accords, supports NATO expansion, and increases aid to the New \nIndependent States of the former Soviet Union to support the \ndevelopment of democracy and free markets. I am also proposing a major \ninitiative to provide critical, targeted assistance to African \ncountries that are undertaking difficult economic reforms, and my \nbudget increases counter-narcotics aid to Latin American countries and \nsupports the Summit of the Americas.\n  Our military serves as the backbone of our national security \nstrategy, and I am committed to maintain a strong and capable military \nthat protects our freedoms and our global leadership role as we \napproach the 21st Century. The budget continues the Administration's \nplan to complete the careful resizing of our military forces, to fully \nsupport military readiness, to strengthen quality of life programs for \nour armed forces, and to provide increased funding to modernize our \nforces as new technologies become available after the turn of the \ncentury. My budget reflects the recommendations of the Quadrennial \nDefense Review and of the Defense Department's recent Defense Reform \nInitiative to achieve a leaner, more efficient, and more cost-effective \norganization by improving management and business practices. To \nimplement these improvements, the Defense Department will send \nlegislation to Congress in conjunction with this budget, including a \nrequest for two more rounds of base closures and realignments.\n\n\n                      investing in the common good\n\n  Our commitment to balance the budget, and to keep it in balance, will \nmean that the Administration and Congress must use taxpayer dollars as \nwisely as possible. If we are to continue funding Federal programs, \nthey will have to show that they are reaching the goals set for them. \nThat is, they will have to show that they are well-run and that they \ncan produce results.\n  In 1993, I actively supported, and was eager to sign, the Government \nPerformance and Results Act. With this budget, I am delighted to send \nCongress what the law envisioned--the\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\nfirst comprehensive, Government-wide Performance Plan.\n  In developing this budget, the Administration for the first time \ncould rely on performance measures and annual performance goals that \nare now included in agency Annual Performance Plans. We have made a \ngood start on the process that the Administration and Congress outlined \nin enacting the 1993 law.\n  As we continue to implement this law, my Administration will focus \nmore and more attention on how programs work, whether they are meeting \ntheir goals, and what we should do to make them better. We look forward \nto working with Congress on our shared goal of improving Government \nperformance.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Bank Protection Act of 1968 for purposes \nof facilitating the use of electronic authentication techniques by \nfinancial institutions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n    the digital signature and electronic authentication law of 1998\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Digital \nSignature and Electronic Authentication Law (SEAL) of 1998.\n  We Americans place such trust in the act of signing a document that \nwe traditionally have referred to the written signature as a ``John \nHancock'' after one of the first signers of the Declaration of \nIndependence and one of our country's founding fathers. As the country \nmoves into the 21st century and into the digital age, it is necessary \nfor the government to validate the use of equally trustworthy forms of \nauthentication for electronic transactions. In doing this, our country \nwill secure its position as a leader in the international digital \neconomy.\n  Electronic authentication, broadly defined, is any technology which \nprovides a way for the recipient of a message to verify the identity of \nthe sender, make sure the message was not altered in transit, and \nconfirm that the message was the one the sender intended to transmit. \nParties to electronic transactions must have access to this \nauthentication process in order to feel secure in conducting business \nover open networks.\n  While this concept is fairly simple, the legislative process has \nproven quite complex. Many states have enacted legislation on \nelectronic authentication, but the state laws are vastly different. \nBecause electronic transactions do not respect state or national \nboundaries, there are no clear rules to govern this activity. This lack \nof direction has limited the use of electronic authentication. The \nprocess is further complicated by the number of competing technologies \navailable to provide authentication as well as the fact that businesses \nfrom all different sectors of the economy seek to use and offer \nauthentication services.\n  As Chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Financial \nServices and Technology, I have examined this issue and have determined \nthat the appropriate first step toward addressing it is to introduce a \nfirmly grounded, free-market bill that addresses the concerns of \nfinancial institutions. In introducing this bill, I do not want to \nsuggest that this authority should belong exclusively to that group. I \nhave stated repeatedly my belief that all entities, banks and nonbanks \nalike, should be authorized to use electronic authentication for their \nown transactions and offer the service to third parties. In attempting \nto fashion a bill that would appropriately address the needs and \nconcerns of all interested groups, however, I have reached an impasse. \nMy attempts to reach out and engage those representing nonbank \ninterests in serious discussions have failed. I have determined, \ntherefore, that it is appropriate for me to take a first step and \nintroduce this bill to address the needs of financial institutions.\n  While I do not intend to create a monopoly for banks, and indeed hope \nthat this legislation can be amended to include other entities, I do \nrecognize that there are valid reasons why we may choose to address the \nconcerns of financial institutions separately.\n  Financial institutions are accustomed to assuming ``trusted third \nparty'' roles, including serving as trustee and offering notary and \nsignature guarantee services. Offering electronic authentication \nservices is the functional equivalent of those traditional bank \nactivities.\n  Financial institutions are highly regulated entities, and the \nfinancial institution regulators have experience in supervising these \n``trusted third party'' activities.\n  Many of the transactions which individuals and businesses will seek \nto authenticate are likely to be financial transactions.\n  In Europe and other countries around the world, electronic \nauthentication activities are conducted almost exclusively by financial \ninstitutions. By taking a first step and authorizing our financial \ninstitutions to use electronic authentication, we will strengthen our \nposition in establishing the conditions for international transactions.\n  The Digital SEAL Bill is, as I have described it, a minimalist, free-\nmarket bill. It provides quite simply that a financial institution may \nuse electronic authentication in the conduct of its business and that \nthe use of such electronic authentication shall be valid. A financial \ninstitution's use of electronic authentication shall be governed by the \nrules of the system or agreement under which it operates and shall be \nregulated by the appropriate financial institution regulator. The bill \ndefines electronic authentication broadly in an effort to be as \ntechnologically neutral as possible.\n  Of equal importance is what this bill does not do. It does not create \na new regulatory bureaucracy to supervise this activity. It does not \nimpair consumers' rights under the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic \nFund Transfer Act, or any state law of similar purpose. Finally, it \ndoes not limit, in any way, the ability of any other entity to use or \noffer electronic authentication in the course of its business.\n  The time has come for Congress to begin a serious discussion of the \nimpact of technology on commercial transactions and consider how age-\nold concepts, like the importance of a signature, will fit into an \nincreasingly electronic world. Electronic authentication is a good \nstarting point for this discussion, and passage of this bill will \nadvance the development of electronic banking and commerce.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nlegislation to give financial institutions, and appropriate other \nentities, the authority to use electronic authentication.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Lott, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 1595. A bill to provide for the establishment of a Commission to \nPromote a National Dialogue on Bioethics.\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\n      the commission to promote a national dialogue on bioethics \n                       establishment act of 1998\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, In recent years, I have often voiced \nconcern that medical technology is moving at an unprecedented pace, \nleaving the rest of society ill-prepared to cope with the increasingly \ncomplex moral and ethical dilemmas that follow in the wake of new \ninventions. We must never attempt to divorce scientific progress from \nethical considerations. We must instead fashion timely answers to the \ntimeless question ``Is there a line that should not be crossed even for \nscientific or other gain, and if so, where is it?'' (Washington Post \neditorial, Oct. 2, 1994)\n\n  The recent furor over Dolly the cloned sheep, and Dr. Seed's \nsubsequent announcement that he intended to clone a human being through \nthe same technique, has highlighted the necessity of an independent, \nbalanced forum to address the ethical implications of new technological \ncapabilities. Two temptations threaten both science and ethics in the \ncurrent milieu. There is pressure on legislators (often unfamiliar with \nscientific issues) to rush to draft laws that could hamper important \nresearch efforts. There is a parallel tendency on the part of academic \nscientists to resist any input from law or ethics into their research. \nThus, science and ethics are lost in the political morass, while the \npublic often remains uninvolved and frightened. The example of the \ncloning debate provides ample evidence of this tendency.\n  There are no fewer than six legislative proposals to address cloning \non the horizon, ranging from sweeping prohibitions to largely symbolic \nbans. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (a commission \nappointed entirely by President Clinton) did a good job of trying to \nassimilate the information on cloning under their ninety day deadline \nlast year, but they were unable to substantively address the ethical \nissues surrounding human cloning. The Commission cited inadequate time \nto tackle difficult ethical issues in the context of our pluralistic \nsociety, and primarily focused on scientific concerns as well as the \nless abstract issue of safety. They then appealed to each American \ncitizen to step to the plate and exercise moral leadership in forming a \nnational policy on human cloning.\n  In an effort to follow up on the Commission's recommendations, the \nSenate labor Committee's Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, \nwhich I chair, held a hearing June 17, 1997, entitled ``Ethics and \nTheology: A Continuation of the National Discussion on Human Cloning.'' \nWe heard testimony on all sides of the issue, from the Christian, \nIslamic, and Jewish traditions, and from philosophers well-schooled in \nbiomedical ethics. We launched a broader public debate with questions \nabout the nature of human individuality, family, and social structure.\n  However, time has shown that both a Presidential Commission, and the \nUnited States Congress are inadequate and inappropriate forums for \nbioethical issues of intricacy and importance. I am therefore proposing \nto establish a new independent National Bioethics Commission, \nrepresentative of the public at large, with combined participation of \nexperts in law, science, theology, medicine, social science, and \nphilosophy/ethics with interested members of the public.\n  It is my hope that this Commission will forge a new path for our \ncountry in the field of bioethics. That they will enable us to have an \ninformed, thoughtful, scientific debate in the public square without \nfear or politics driving our decisions. The Majority and Minority \nLeaders of Congress would appoint members of the panel, but no current \nMember of Congress or Administration political appointee would be \nallowed to participate during their term of office. We simply must \ndepoliticize these discussions while simultaneously broadening input \nfrom the general public. Each and every citizen should have the \nopportunity to contribute to these great debates.\n  I anticipate that some may question the role of theology in a public \npolicy debate. Certainly the President's advisory commission found that \ntheir considerations were incomplete without examining the religious \nmores of our culture. Our founding fathers also recognized that public \npolicy could not be formulated in a theological vacuum. While they \nforbade the establishment of a state religion, they simultaneously \naffirmed the rights of God-fearing people to make their voices heard in \nthe public arena. Today, and throughout history, religion has been a \nprimary source of the beliefs governing these decisions for men and \nwomen of all races and creeds.\n  So it is vital that our public debate and reflection on scientific \ndevelopments keep pace, and even anticipate and prepare for new \nscientific knowledge. The moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in the \ncloning of human beings may well be our greatest test to date. We do \nnot simply seek knowledge, but the wisdom to apply that knowledge. As \nwith each of the mind boggling scientific advances of the last century, \nwe know that there is the potential for both good and evil in this \ntechnology. Our task as legislators is to define the role of the \nfederal government in harnessing this technology for good. Our task as \ncitizens is to exercise responsible stewardship of the precious gift of \nlife. May this Commission enable us to fulfill our trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, every day we read about bone-\nchilling atrocities around the world, in Algeria, Colombia, Sri Lanka, \nand even in Mexico.\n  I have always felt relations between the United States and our \nsouthern neighbor left a lot to be desired. On the one hand it is a \nrelationship fraught with tensions fueled by illegal immigration, \nracism, drug trafficking, and a long history of misunderstanding. Yet \non the other hand it is a relationship based on friendship and respect, \nand of many shared interests.\n  A traveler to Mexico is immediately struck by the great disparity in \nthe standards of living between our two countries. Millions of Mexico's \npeople, especially members of indigenous groups, live in poverty. If \nthey are lucky they own a piece of land, but rarely enough to support \ntheir families. They work from sunrise to nightfall bent over a hoe in \nthe fields, or at some other backbreaking job. They sleep in a house \nbuilt of scraps of wood and tin with a dirt floor, wash in a polluted \nstream, live in fear of the police, and do their best to care for half \na dozen poorly clothed, hungry children who have little hope of \nanything better.\n  But there is another Mexico. It is one of modern factories, busy \ncities, a government that is evolving from one-party rule to democracy, \nand an economy that has been largely state controlled becoming \nincreasingly market-based. It is managed by well-educated professionals \nwho grapple daily with seemingly intractable problems.\n  Mexico is, above all, a land of contrasts, and the United States has \nan enormous stake in Mexico's development. Our economies are \nincreasingly interdependent. Some of our most pressing problems are \nalso Mexico's. No fence, no matter how impenetrable, along our border, \nwill solve those problems, whether they are drugs, other types of \ncrime, infectious diseases, polluted air and water. If we are to combat \nthese threats successfully, we have to work together.\n  It is for that reason, Mr. President, that the recent violence in \nMexico--in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero and Oaxaca--should be of \nsuch concern to both our countries. Last July I spoke on this floor \nabout the situation in Chiapas, and warned that unless the Mexican \nGovernment dealt effectively with the causes of the conflict there, \nrenewed violence was likely. My warning, like similar warnings by many \nothers, was ignored. Today I rise to speak again about Chiapas, and the \ntragic events there shortly before Christmas. But I want to emphasize \nthat Chiapas is representative of a much larger problem in Mexico--as \nin so many other parts of the world--which can most succinctly be \nattributed to the widening disparity between the haves and have-nots.\n  The brief but dramatic Zapatista uprising in 1994 was the result of \ncenturies of discrimination and mistreatment of indigenous people in \nChiapas, a situation largely unknown outside Mexico's borders. That \nviolent outburst shook the nation, and led to talks between the \nZapatistas and Mexican authorities which sought to address the \nunderlying causes of the unrest. Those negotiations resulted in the San \nAndres Accords, but the Mexican Government walked away from that \nagreement apparently concluding that it was too favorable to the \nZapatistas. Whatever hope there was that those negotiations would lead \nto profound changes in Chiapas had been virtually extinguished by the \nend of last year. The Mexican Government's attention was focused \nelsewhere, mostly on the national elections which to its credit were \nthe most free and fair in Mexico's history.\n  Meanwhile, Chiapas has remained in an undeclared state of war between \nthe Zapatistas and their sympathizers, and anti-Zapatista paramilitary \ngroups who have been encouraged and supported by local and state \nauthorities. Tens of thousands of Mexican soldiers have also been sent \nto Chiapas, where they have contributed to the tensions and they have \napparently stood by as local officials have armed the paramilitary \ngroups. Caught in the middle are the people of Chiapas.\n  Three days before Christmas, Chiapas again exploded in violence. In \nthe village of Acteal, 45 unarmed Indian men, women and children were \nslaughtered in cold blood by paramilitary forces reportedly with the \nsupport of government authorities. Two weeks later, Mexican police \nfired on a crowd in the town of Ocosingo that was protesting the \nDecember 22nd massacre, killing a woman and wounding her 3 year-old \ndaughter and a 17 year-old boy.\n  Mr. President, who but the most hate-filled people would carry out \nsuch a barbaric deed? The fact that government officials are reputed to \nhave had a role in the slaughter is particularly outrageous. But it \nshould not surprise anyone who knows the history and has followed \nevents in Chiapas. In fact, in the months leading up to the Acteal \nmassacre human rights groups issued report after report describing acts \nof provocation and violence by paramilitary groups and Mexican \nsoldiers. Members of Congress sent letters of concern to President \nZedillo. Yet these reports and letters did not even receive a response. \nChiapas was a powder-keg waiting to explode even before the Zapatistas \nfirst emerged on the scene in support of indigenous concerns about \ndiscrimination, land rights and the lack of social services. What \nhappened in Acteal is only the latest example, albeit a particularly \natrocious one, of the kind of brutality that is a fact of daily life \nfor many indigenous people in Chiapas.\n  Since then, the Mexican Government has taken several encouraging \nsteps. A federal investigation is ongoing. At least 40 persons \nsuspected of committing the murders have been arrested. State and local \nofficials who allegedly instigated the attack, and who later tried to \ncover it up, have been arrested or removed from office. The Minister of \nthe Interior has been replaced. The Government of the State of Chiapas \nfreed several hundred prisoners, in an attempt to restart the peace \ntalks. These are important steps. Had the government taken the advice \nof so\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\nmany people years ago and treated this situation with the sensitivity \nand urgency it deserved, this entire debacle might have been avoided \nand many people might be alive today.\n  The situation in Chiapas remains tense. While the recent violence \nseems to be primarily a result of local and state officials taking the \nlaw into their own hands and unpardonable passivity on the part of \nfederal authorities, I also continue to receive reports of provocative \nacts by Mexican soldiers. It is a situation the United States cannot \nignore, both because Mexico's political and economic stability are of \ngreat importance to us, and because we have trained and supplied \nMexico's security forces for many years. That training and equipment \nhas been provided exclusively to combat the drug trade, but has it \nalways been used for that purpose? Or have US-trained police or \nsoldiers, armed with US-made weapons, also been involved in counter-\ninsurgency operations? Were any of the weapons used by the assailants \nin Acteal and Ocosingo obtained from the United States--either through \nthe anti-drug assistance program or through commercial sales licensed \nby the US Government?\n  These are not accusations, they are only questions. But they need \nanswers. So far, I am not aware of any evidence that US equipment was \nused in the Acteal or Ocosingo killings. I hope there is none. It would \nbe totally contrary to the understandings between the Congress and the \nadministration, and between the United States Government and Mexican \nGovernment, if our assistance were misused in this way.\n  Two years ago I wrote an amendment, which was enacted into law and \nre-enacted last year, which has become known as the Leahy Human Rights \nLaw. It is quite simple. It says that if the Secretary of State has \n``credible evidence'' that a unit of a security force of a foreign \ncountry has committed gross violations of human rights, then we cannot \nprovide assistance to that unit unless the foreign government is taking \n``effective measures'' to bring the responsible individuals to justice.\n  Accordingly, I have posed my questions in a letter to our Assistant \nSecretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Jeffrey Davidow, who I \nrespect and who may become our next Ambassador to Mexico. I have, in \nthat letter, also asked for additional information, such as what \nassistance we have provided to Mexico's security forces, and which \nunits of those security forces have received our assistance. I have \nurged the administration to carefully review the evidence to determine \nif the recent events in Acteal and Ocosingo would trigger the Leahy Law \ncut-off of assistance.\n  I would also urge the administration to examine whether any US \nweapons, helicopters or other military aircraft which were licensed for \nsale to Mexico have been used by paramilitary or government security \nforces in counter-insurgency operations in Chiapas. I further urge the \nadministration not to grant any license applications of this kind until \nwe have a full accounting of these recent incidents.\n  Mr. President, Chiapas is not unique. There are countless examples \naround the world of indigenous groups that are suffering from \ngovernment neglect and violence. It should also be emphasized that the \ncrisis in Chiapas is a Mexican problem that only the Mexican people can \nsolve. But as their northern neighbor with a long history that links us \nculturally, politically, and economically as well as geographically, we \nhave, as I have said, many shared interests. And one of those interests \nis to ensure that human rights are not violated and that the United \nStates is not implicated in those violations.\n  President Zedillo has said the investigation of the violence in \nChiapas will be carried through to its conclusion. I hope that includes \nnot simply the Acteal and Ocosingo killings, but the activities of \nparamilitary groups throughout the region. The government also needs to \naddress the plight of the thousands of indigenous people in Chiapas who \nhave fled their homes to escape the paramilitary groups and are living \nin makeshift camps. They are suffering from acute shortages of drinking \nwater, food and shelter. It is a miserable situation and the sooner \nthey can safely return to their homes the better.\n  President Zedillo has also said that he wants to resume negotiations \nwith the Zapatistas. I know this has the support of the US Government. \nWhat is lacking, I am afraid, is a clearly defined strategy, or road \nmap, for resolving this conflict. Unless both sides have confidence \nthat such a strategy can lead to an acceptable resolution, it will be \nonly a matter of time before another violent outburst, and more \nneedless deaths.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S274-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S275-S276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DOLLARS TO THE CLASSROOM ACT\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good \nfriend from Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson, in introducing the \n``Dollars to the Classroom Act''. This is a critically important piece \nof education legislation, of which I am honored to be an original \ncosponsor.\n  The ``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will send funds supporting \nroughly thirty one K-12 education programs in a block grant to states, \nwith the requirement that 95 percent of these funds go to local \nschools. This is a very simple concept. We should demand that 95 \npercent of the Federal money we spend on elementary and secondary \neducation must be spent in the classrooms of our local schools. That's \nit.\n  Let me be clear about one thing. This legislation does not reduce the \nfunding for the schools. Rather, it makes sure that the tax monies our \ncitizens give for education actually makes it to the classroom.\n  Mr. President, I served as a public school teacher. My wife served as \na public school teacher. And let me say this, there is nothing more \nspecial, than the moment when a young student and a teacher connect in \nthe classroom. Unfortunately, there exists a complex, confusing, \npaperwork driven federal system that too often hinders rather than \nhelps the students. Mr. President, this bill provides the badly needed \nresources to not only enhance these magic moments between students and \nteachers but it also guarantees that every single student and every \nsingle teacher will have the resources needed to make this all \npossible.\n  Mr. President, this is how the bill works. Instead of sending the \neducation dollars through the usual bureaucratic gauntlet--paying the \nbureaucrats at the Department of Education and the state education \nestablishments--individual tax dollars would go directly to the states \nin a block grant administered by the Governor. Local school districts, \nparents, teachers, and local school officials could then use those \nfunds for education priorities they think are most important. Mr. \nPresident, this will allow parents and local education officials to \ndecide how to spend these dollars. They would decide their schools' \npriorities and, most importantly, how best to allocate these funds.\n  There is another important reason for this legislation. Federal \neducation programs and their grant processes have become so burdensome \nmany local schools are not even applying for funds. Often our local \nschools and school officials are forced to spend a significant amount \nof their Federal education tax dollars just to apply for these funds.\n  Let me give you an example. The Mobile County Public Schools system, \nmy home county in Alabama, which contains 65,443 students in grades K-\n12 was forced, on two different occasions, to hire grant writers at \n$50,000 a year just to help the school system apply for these federal \ngrants. These grant writers were in addition to the many \nadministrators, principals and teachers who are forced to dedicate \ntheir valuable time to filling out the paperwork associated with \napplying for these grants instead of educating the students of Mobile \nCounty.\n  And there are countless other examples. The state of Ohio calculated \nin 1990 that over 50 percent of its paperwork burden was related to \nfederal education programs, even though only 5 percent of its education \nrevenues came from federal sources.\n  A recent audit of the New York City public schools found that only \n43% of their local education budget reaches the classrooms.\n  A 1996 Heritage Foundation study of federal spending on elementary \nand secondary education found that only 85\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\ncents of every education tax dollar sent to Washington, was returned to \nlocal school districts--that's school districts not local classrooms.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education, of the more than $15 \nbillion allocated to its elementary and secondary education programs in \n1996, over $3 billion went for purposes--like administrative overhead--\nrather than the real needs of local school districts.\n  The Superintendent of the Mobile County Public School system, Mr. \nPaul Sousa, supports this legislation for one simple reason: this \nlegislation dedicates valuable dollars to the classrooms and eliminates \nthe bureaucracy that has placed a stranglehold on his principals, his \nteachers, and his students. And I would say to all my colleagues, the \n``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will help to eliminate these scenarios \nand require that 95% of all Federal education dollars be spent in the \nclassroom.\n  Mr. President, I would like to end my comments by sharing with you a \nquote from President Clinton, concerning this very issue. On March 27, \n1996, in a speech to the National Governors' Association, the President \nstated: ``We cannot ask the American people to spend more on education \nuntil we do a better job with the money we've got now.'' Mr. President, \nI fully agree. We can not continue to spend billions of dollars on \nfederal education programs that don't even reach our students. We must \ndemand accountability for the federal dollars we spend on education. We \nneed to know where our education dollars are going and how much \nactually gets to the individual classrooms in Alabama and across this \ncountry.\n  The ``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will provide the hardworking \nparents and students of this country the resources and the \naccountability they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S275-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A NEW INITIATIVE AGAINST ELEPHANTIASIS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the global battle against \ninfectious diseases, inaccessibility to safe and effective drugs \nremains a major obstacle for developing countries. The lack of the \npublic health infrastructure to respond effectively to infectious \ndiseases contributes to widespread and needless suffering. Even where \nthat infrastructure exists, many of the world's poor cannot afford the \nprice of drugs.\n  But many disfiguring and debilitating diseases can be prevented at \nminimal cost--in some cases with just one pill, once a year, for as \nlittle as a few cents per dose. Last May, the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee heard testimony about the need for pharmaceutical \ncompanies and governments to work together to combat infectious \ndiseases around the world. Dr. Gordon Douglas, the President of Merck \nVaccines, described the company's success with the donation of its \ndrug, Mectizan, in fighting river blindness. Since 1987, Merck has \ntreated 18 million people, spending $70 million on the program in 1996 \nalone. While the global elimination of river blindness is not expected \nuntil at least 2007, Merck has made an invaluable contribution toward \nthis goal.\n  Last November, Congress provided an additional $50 million to \nstrengthen global surveillance and control the spread of infectious \ndiseases. On December 16, 1997, amid alarming reports about the Hong \nKong flu, the U.S. Agency for International Development gathered public \nhealth experts from around the world to set priorities and develop a \nU.S. strategy to support the global campaign against infectious \ndiseases. And then on January 26, 1998, Smithkline Beecham, one of the \nworld's largest pharmaceutical companies, announced that it was taking \non elephantiasis, one of the world's most disabling and disfiguring \ntropical diseases which afflicts some 120 million people, and endangers \nas many as one billion people. Smithkline Beecham has generously agreed \nto provide for free an anti-parasitic drug called Albendazole to combat \nthis scourge. The company estimates that it will spend some $500 \nmillion over the next two decades working with the World Health \nOrganization to tackle elephantiasis in parts of Africa, Asia, the \nPacific Islands, and Central and South America. Over time, the effort \ncould even lead to the eventual elimination of this horrible disease. \nIn addition to protecting against elephantiasis, it is predicted that \nthe yearly distribution of Albendazole will improve the health of \nmillions of children who suffer from chronic intestinal parasites.\n  Mr. President, Merck and Smithkline deserve our praise and gratitude. \nThis kind of cooperative initiative between governments and private \nindustry is a model for how we can combat infectious diseases in the \nyears ahead, and in doing so make life better for millions and millions \nof people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S276-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RICHARD HIROMICHI KOSAKI\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on December 30, 1997, Hawaii's \nsenior journalist, A. A. Bud Smyser of the Honolulu Star Bulletin, \nfeatured in his biweekly column, ``Hawaii's World,'' the contributions \nof a dear friend and classmate, Richard Hiromichi Kosaki. Dr. Kosaki \nrecently retired as the President of Hawaii Tokai International \nCollege, phasing out a distinguished educational career that has \nspanned over 47 years. However, I am certain that the Richard Kosaki I \nknow will consider this to be just an end of another chapter of his \nlife. I am certain he is now looking forward to his next chapter, \nequally challenging, and equally glorious.\n  I ask that the text of the column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                             Hawaii's World\n\n                            (By A.A. Smyser)\n\n       Richard H. Kosaki is retiring as president of Hawaii Tokai \n     International College, returning to an adivisory role, and \n     phasing out a distinguished educational career that has \n     spanned 47 years.\n       We talked about it at a Kaimana Hotel lunch table where we \n     could see down the curve of Waikiki Beach to all the giant \n     hotels now clustered on the water and along Kalakaua Avenue.\n       It was symbolically appropriate. Kosaki was born near the \n     beach, grew up there, swam and fished there and watched its \n     tremendous changes over his 73 years. Only the Moana and \n     Halekulani hotels were there when he was born. The Royal \n     Hawaiian didn't open until 1927. All the high rises rose \n     since statehood in 1959.\n       Kosaki, for his part, has been a big mover for educational \n     change in Hawaii. He is the architect of the University of \n     Hawaii's community college system that now embraces well over \n     half of all UH enrollment. He was with the UH faculty group \n     that generated the concept of the East-West Center.\n       After he retired as chancellor at UH-Manoa he carried his \n     belief in Hawaii as an international education center to \n     helping Japan's enormous Tokai University Educational System \n     establish an outpost here in a superbly built high rise at \n     2241 Kapiolani Blvd.\n       In his beginning years as an educator, he taught political \n     science, worked with the Legislative Reference Bureau, and \n     helped educate many students who went on to be leaders in \n     government. He even helped to wise up newspaper writers like \n     me.\n       We talked about two things: international education in \n     Hawaii, and other educational changes to expect in the years \n     ahead.\n       The Tokai University Pacific Center here, the umbrella \n     under which the college exists, is not the gangbuster success \n     early visualized. It still needs heavy subsidy from Japan. \n     International students have never filled all of its 200 dorm \n     spaces but they have totaled over 100, and international \n     visitors have filled a lot of the rest.\n       While most of the international enrollment is from Japan, \n     annual outstanding student award winners have come also from \n     Taiwan, Cambodia, Vietnam and Brazil. The only U.S. winner \n     came from Molokai.\n       Courses deal mostly with English and an introduction to \n     America. They provide a ``friendly gateway'' to America for \n     international students planning study elsewhere. Besides its \n     help to these full-year students the center offers short-term \n     introductions to Hawaii and Hawaiians to students regularly \n     enrolled on Tokai's numerous Japanese campuses.\n       And what about education generally?\n       More use of Internet and TV for off-campus education.\n       Less emphasis on classroom lectures, though they won't \n     disappear.\n       More lifelong learning. UH community college students \n     illustrate the trend with an average age over 30.\n       More interaction between education and active life \n     experiences.\n       He has a favorite maxim: ``Tell me and I forget. Teach me \n     and I remember. Involve me and I learn.'' He succeeded under \n     the old system of listening to lecturers, memorizing and \n     feeding things back in exams. But he thinks involvement is \n     better and should be lifelong.\n       Real education starts at conception, he says. Early life \n     experiences are the most formative. Kindergarten teachers \n     thus are more important in shaping a life than graduate \n     school professors. The latter are much better paid but the \n     balance is worth re-examining.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S276-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S277]]\n                      TRIBUTE TO HERSCHEL CREASMAN\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr President, I rise today to honor Herschel \nCreasman, who after more than four decades of dedicated service to \nspreading the gospel to various organizations and in performing \ncommunity services retired on Sunday, January 18, 1998. He is an \noutstanding example to his family and friends, and has been an asset to \nthe many communities that he has touched over the years including Coral \nSprings, Florida, where he currently resides; Athens, Tennessee where \nhe was born; and numerous others across the South and abroad.\n  Herschel chose to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a \nminister. He first graduated from Carson Newman College and then went \non to the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, which marked the onset \nof more than 45 years of faithful leadership in Texas, Oklahoma, \nGeorgia, Florida and even five years in Brazil. Herschel has preached \nin more than 20 countries and has served as an instructor at the \nSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. He \nfostered an environment within his churches that welcomed many new \nfaces, from differing religions and communities, who come to hear his \nwonderfully inspiring sermons.\n  Many would think that with this busy schedule and his devotion to his \nwife Joanne, their two daughters and one son, and four grandchildren, \nHerschel would not have time for much more, but this is definitely not \nthe case with this extraordinary individual. Over the years he has \nreceived several honorary doctorates, including a Doctorate of Theology \nand Doctorate of Philosophy from the Great Commission Seminary in \nKentucky and a Doctorate of Divinity from Freedom Seminary in \nJacksonville, Florida.

Mr. President, I would like to commend Phoebe \nPutney Memorial Hospital in Albany, Ga., for being named one of five \nnational 1998 American Hospital Association (AHA) NOVA Award winners. \nThe award recognizes innovative AHA member hospitals for their \noutstanding progress toward restructuring the health care system with a \nfocus on community health.\n  Phoebe Putney, the largest hospital in southwest Georgia, is being \nhonored for its Network of Trust program for pregnant and parenting \nteens. The program was established in 1994 through a community \ncollaborative, in partnership with Phoebe and the school system, to \naddress the teen pregnancy problem in Albany/Dougherty County. The \ngoals of the program are to (1) promote healthy mothers and babies; (2) \ndecrease child neglect and teen drug abuse; (3) increase self-esteem \nand; (4) prevent school dropouts.\n  In 1994, the rate of birth to teens in the U.S. was 59 per 1,000; the \nrate in Georgia was 72 per 1,000; and in Albany/Dougherty County, the \nrate was 91 per 1,000. More than 400 babies were born to teenagers at \nPhoebe in 1994, with 18 percent of those babies requiring treatment in \nthe high risk nursery and 25 percent of the mothers delivering for the \nsecond or third time.\n  Network of Trust is based on the concept of teens as peer counselors. \nThe program is implemented in the school system in three phases. Phase \nI involves early identification to offer prenatal care and education \non-site at the school. This is designed to reduce school dropout rates, \nbuild self esteem, promote parenting skills, reduce fears related to \nchildbirth and teach anger management.\n  Phase II targets teen mothers after delivery to discourage repeat \npregnancies. Mothers are encouraged to maintain competitive grades and \nare provided training to alleviate parental frustrations that often \nlead to child abuse. Phase II teen mothers also act as mentors to Phase \nI pregnant teens.\n  Phase III offers a summer internship at Phoebe Putney Memorial for \nselected Phase II participants to enhance self-esteem and decision-\nmaking skills. Interns are matched with hospital staff mentors and the \nparticipants are encouraged to pursue future education, with an \neducational stipend given to each teen that successfully completes \nPhase III.\n  Network of Trust also includes a component for teen fathers with \nweekly classes taught by instructors with special training and school \ncounselors. Students utilize infant simulator dolls that are \ncomputerized to record the type of treatment they receive from their \n``parents.''\n  The program's immense success can be measured in many ways. \nParticipation has increased steadily each year, with 38 students \nparticipating in the 1994-95 school year, 241 in the 1995-96 school \nyear, and approximately 273 students in the 1996-97 school year.\n  The program has also greatly reduced the number of repeat \npregnancies. In 1994, 22 percent of births to teens in the U.S. were \nrepeat pregnancies. Of the 38 participants in the Network of Trust in \n1994, there were only two repeat pregnancies, or 5 percent. In 1995-96, \nonly 3 percent of participants had repeat pregnancies. And in 1996-97, \nthere were only 1.5 percent repeat pregnancies.\n  The high school dropout rate decreased significantly. In 1994, the \ndropout rate for Dougherty County was 45 percent. In 1995-96, only 8 \npercent of the participants dropped out of school and, in 1996-97, just \n1.4 percent.\n  Also, for the first time in the 90s, the number of low birth weight \nbabies born in Dougherty County dropped. The economic impact of the \nstudents who graduated from high school produces an additional $830,000 \nin anticipated income for those students as workers.\n  Phoebe will receive the AHA NOVA Award on Monday, Feb. 2, in \nWashington as part of the AHA's Annual Membership Meeting. I \nrespectively ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Phoebe \nPutney Memorial Hospital on this important achievement in improving \nGeorgia's community health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S277-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MORT SILBERMAN\n\n Mr. CLELAND.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a group of \nAmericans that contributed greatly to the game of baseball. Although \nnot widely known in this country, the Japanese American community has \ncontributed a significant chapter to the history of baseball as it has \nto many other important aspects of American society.\n  Beginning at the turn of the 20th century, Issei, or first generation \nJapanese Americans, developed a love for baseball that led to the \ncreation of an extensive network of Japanese American leagues \nthroughout the United States. Japanese American baseball leagues began \nto appear in towns and cities throughout Hawaii and the western \ncontinental United States. The popularity of baseball spread to the \npoint where there was a team in nearly every Japanese American farming \ncommunity.\n  By the 1920's, more than 100 teams had been formed consisting \nprimarily of talented Nisei, or second generation Japanese Americans. \nBecause of the discrimination and forced segregation of the time, the \nNisei teams, like the teams in the Negro Leagues and in the All-\nAmerican Girls Professional Baseball Leagues, played mostly against \neach other. However, they also successfully compete against high \nschool, college, and semi-professional teams from white America, teams \nfrom the Negro Leagues, and even against baseball legends such as Babe \nRuth, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson, and Joe DiMaggio.\n  In 1937, all-star teams consisting of Nisei players from California \ntraveled to Japan, Korea, and Manchuria as ambassadors of goodwill. The \nNisei teams competed throughout Asia where they impressed audiences \nwith their talented play, sportsmanship, and aggressive style of fast-\npaced American baseball. However, the outbreak of World War II abruptly \nended their overseas campaign as ambassadors of American goodwill. In \nthe following months, many of these players and their families, because \nof their race, became the object of suspicion and mistrust in their own \ncountry.\n  The serene life of farming and playing baseball ended abruptly with \nthe announcement of Executive Order 9066. More than 120,000 Japanese \nAmericans were relocated to remote internment camps across the United \nStates. In an effort to preserve a sense of community and improve the \nliving conditions of the interment camps, Japanese Americans set \nabout recreating many of the social networks and clubs that were an \nintegral part of their lives prior to their internment. For many of the \nyounger Japanese Americans this meant banding together and forming \nbaseball leagues that played several seasons behind barbed-wire fences.\n\n  For Japanese Americans interned during World War II, playing, \nwatching and supporting baseball was an important reprieve from the \nharsh nature of camp life. Popular Japanese American baseball players, \nsuch as Kenichi Zenimura, made it a mission to bring baseball to the \ninternment camps. He and the Japanese American community worked \ntirelessly to build makeshift baseball stadiums where, for several \nhours each week, Japanese American communities could forget their \nworries and enjoy their worries and enjoy their favorite American \npastime. For the many Japanese Americans who participated in the \nbaseball leagues and the thousands who watched and supported the teams, \nthe baseball leagues helped to rebuild a sense of civic pride and \ndignity which had greatly suffered as a result of their forced \ninternment.\n  In the post-war years, Japanese American baseball players took up \ntheir former role as ambassadors of goodwill and began traveling across \nthe Pacific to play exhibiting games in Japan. In addition, prominent \nJapanese American baseball players, like Tsuneo ``Cappy'' Harada, \ncontributed to the explosion of baseball's popularity in Japan by \nbringing famous Americans such as Lefty O'Doul and Joe DiMaggio to \nJapan for exhibitions and public appearances. These efforts by Harada \nand other greatly contributed to the internationalization of baseball \nas a professional sport and the popularity of baseball in Japan. The \ncurrent practice of playing exhibition games in both American and Japan \nwas started by Japanese American baseball players and provides \nopportunities for both American and Japanese players to compete in each \nother's countries. In recent years, American Cecil Fielder played for \nthe Hanshin Tigers in Japan's Central League, while Japanese players, \nlike Hideo Nomo, have competed for American teams. In addition, \nAmerican and Japanese All-Star teams regularly compete in Japan.\n  In spite of this rich tradition and history, the popularity of the \nNisei Baseball Leagues gradually waned as discrimination and \nsegregation faded in American society. By the 1970's the leagues had \nalmost completely disappeared. However, the important contributions of \nJapanese American baseball players had, in recent years, been \nrediscovered for the benefit of all Americans. Historical exhibits, \nlike ``Diamonds in the Rough: Japanese Americans in Baseball,'' which \nhave traveled to many sites throughout the United States, have brought \nto the public's attention the important role Japanese Americans played \nin baseball's history. In addition, many younger Japanese Americans, \nhave begun to participate in the historic Japanese American baseball \nleagues again.\n  It is a great privilege to bring to the attention of the Congress and \nthe American people the important contributions of the Japanese \nAmerican baseball players. From their early days playing in segregated \nJapanese American leagues to their more recent role as promoters of \nbaseball around the world, they have consistently demonstrated an \nincredible ability to overcome adversity and make the most of \nopportunities in even the most difficult of circumstances. In light of \ntheir many accomplishments, I am honored to commemorate the Japanese \nAmerican baseball players today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S278-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S278-S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VIOLENCE IN ALGERIA\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, few weeks pass when there is not a \nreport of an appalling atrocity in Algeria. The testimony of \neyewitnesses echo the same refrain--a tale of slaughter, decapitation, \nmutilation, burning, and shooting of innocent men, women, and children. \nThousands of civilians have fled their homes as the violence has \nescalated, but the protection and safety they seek is difficult, if not \nimpossible to find.\n  The reaction of the international community has not been one of \noutrage and alarm, but a quiet, almost uneasy expression of concern. It \nis almost as though the reports are too grisly, too horrific to even \nbroach--as though by addressing the subject and opening it up to \nscrutiny, one will somehow be tainted by the extreme levels of violence \nand degradation. However, the subject must be addressed and a credible \ninvestigation must be carried out.\n  Time and again around the world, we have seen the needless suffering \nthat occurs when governments and the world community as a whole are too \nslow to shoulder their mantle of moral responsibility. The crisis in \nAlgeria presents another opportunity to change this pattern and set a \nnew standard for the next century.\n  Mr. President, on January 26, 1998, fifteen Members of Congress, \nDemocrats and Republicans, Senators and Representatives, sent a letter \nto Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the tragic situation in \nAlgeria. I ask that the text of the letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 January 26, 1998.\n     Hon. Madeleine Albright,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: We are writing to express our alarm \n     concerning the recent massacres in Algeria, which have \n     brought the toll of those killed in the five-year civil war \n     to an estimated 80,000 persons, mostly civilians. The \n     Algerian Government has consistently failed to adequately \n     investigate the atrocities and bring those responsible to \n     justice. The administration's call for an international \n     inquiry is an appropriate and necessary first step in \n     responding to this crisis.\n       Since the civil war erupted in 1992, extremist opposition \n     groups have increased their attacks on innocent people. The \n     tactics of these groups rank among the most inhumane seen \n     anywhere. While their conduct should be strongly condemned, \n     there are persistent reports that Algerian security forces \n     have failed to stop or prevent the massacres or to arrest \n     those involved. Eyewitnesses to the violence report that \n     terrorist groups have operated in collusion with, and under \n     the\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\n     protection of, units or factions of the army, police, and \n     state-armed militias. According to human rights monitors, no \n     one has been arrested by Algerian authorities in connection \n     with a series of bloody attacks that occurred in August and \n     September leaving hundreds of civilians dead. Algerian \n     authorities have made no effort to explain why army and \n     police garrisons located nearby failed to intervene. Since \n     then, the frequency and brutality of the attacks have only \n     increased--over 1,000 Algerian civilians have reportedly been \n     killed in the last month alone.\n       Little progress was made during a January 20, 1998 \n     diplomatic mission led by British Minister of State for \n     Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Derek Fatchett. \n     Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has reportedly denounced \n     international expressions of concern about possible official \n     complicity in the killings. In addition, the ability of human \n     rights organizations and the media to look into allegations \n     of abuses has been increasingly limited by the Algerian \n     Government and details about armed attacks are often \n     censored.\n       We believe it is essential that the administration take an \n     active and visible role in ensuring that an international \n     investigation occurs in an expedient and effective manner \n     with the necessary political and logistical support. We urge \n     the administration to sponsor a resolution calling for such \n     an inquiry to ascertain the facts and make recommendations at \n     the March 1998 meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in \n     Geneva. We further urge that the administration send a clear \n     message of support for this initiative in public as well as \n     in diplomatic contacts with Algeria and other governments.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Patrick Leahy, Senator; Sam Brownback, Senator; Paul D. \n           Wellstone, Senator; Nancy Pelosi, Representative; \n           Robert Torricelli, Senator; Edward Kennedy, Senator; \n           Frank R.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one \nof my favorite heroes, Clayton Moore, better known to most as the Long \nRanger. Clayton Moore, the world's most popular masked man, has \ninspired and entertained millions of Americans during the span of his \ncareer.\n  Before assuming the role of the Lone Ranger, Clayton began his \nperforming career as a trapeze artist. Unsatisfied with this career \nchoice he moved to Los Angeles to fulfill his dream of becoming a \ncowboy actor. This year marks the 65th anniversary of the first time \nthe Lone Ranger rode into our homes over our airwaves. ``The Lone \nRanger'' was created for radio in 1933, and in 1949 Clayton was chosen \nto be the first Lone Ranger for the new television series which began \nairing that year. He continued to be the man behind the mask through \n1952 and then again in 1954, until the series ended in 1957. Over the \nyears, Clayton has appeared in over 45 films and 10 major serials. He \nalso starred in two feature films, ``The Lone Ranger'' and ``The Lone \nRanger and the Lost City of Gold,'' and is the author of ``I Was That \nMasked Man,'' his autobiography which was published in 1996.\n  The 169 television episodes showed faithful fans that characters and \nplots in the world of the Lone Ranger were simple--good guys vs. bad \nguys. We all eagerly watched as the exclaimed the four simple words of \n``Hi Yo Silver, Away,'' and role off into the sunset with Tonto, his \nfaithful Indian companion. In every thought, word and deed, the Lone \nRanger provided a practical guide to living in a difficult and \nchallenging world. He embodied a code that has served as a standard of \nmoral development--combining honesty, fairness, caring, respect, \nloyalty, tolerance, duty, and moral courage.\n  Born on September 14, 1914, in Chicago, IL, Clayton has lived a fine \nand exciting life, filled with adventure, glamour, danger and hard \nwork. He was an athlete, a trapeze artist with the Flying Behrs Trapeze \nAct at the 1934 Chicago Worlds Fair, a model while living in Chicago \nand New York, and a soldier in the Air Force during World War II.\n  In whatever venture he has pursued, Clayton has served as a wonderful \nand positive example to us all. He has entertained us throughout his \nacting career, has exemplified courage and patriotism as he fought for \nthis Nation during World War II, and has been a wonderful husband to \nhis wife, Clarita, and father to his daughter, Dawn. It is with great \nadmiration and respect that I congratulate and applaud this fellow \nveteran, Clayton Moore, on an outstanding career and prosperous life. I \nthank Clayton for teaching us that the good guys do win.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/02/senate-section/article/S279-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1575\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
