Mr. President, other Senators and I have spoken numerous \ntimes over the past several weeks about the significant problems that \nwill arise in States across the country if the Senate further delays \naction on the highway bill. Each day we delay adds to the burden of \ncommuters sitting in traffic that is often moving at a crawl or brought \nto a complete stop because many of our highways are simply overcrowded. \nEach day we delay brings us closer to the May 1 deadline--just 39 \nsession days away from today. That includes today--39 days. The time \nbomb is ticking. Senate session days remaining before May 1 deadline: \n39. That includes May 1 as it includes today.\n  Since 1969, the number of trips per person taken over our roadways \nincreased by more than 72 percent and the number of miles traveled \nincreased by more than 65 percent.\n  The combination of traffic growth and deteriorating road conditions \nhas led to an unprecedented level of congestion, not just in our urban \ncenters but in our suburbs and rural areas as well. Congestion is \nliterally choking our roadways as our constituents seek to travel to \nwork, travel to the shopping center, to the child care center, and to \nthe churches. According to the Department of Transportation, more \ntravelers, in more areas, during more hours are facing high levels of \ncongestion and delay than at any time in our\n\n[[Page S866]]\n\nhistory. And these congested conditions make us more susceptible to \nmassive traffic jams as the result of even the most minor of accidents. \nThe DOT tells us that, during peak travel hours, almost 70 percent or \nthe urban interstates and just under 60 percent of other freeways and \nexpressways are either moderately or extremely congested. That is lost \nman hours, reduced productivity, wasted fuel, and wasted time.\n  The worsening congestion is taking a horrible toll on our economic \nprosperity. I direct the attention of my colleagues to a study \nconducted by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A \nUniversity. According to the Institute's study, the annual cost of \nhighway congestion in our nation's 50 most congested cities has grown \nfrom $26.6 billion in 1982 to almost $53 billion in 1994. In other \nwords, it has doubled. Delay accounted for 85 percent of this cost, \nwhile fuel consumption accounted for 15 percent. While more recent data \nare still being collected, the Institute's researchers state that, in \nthe last four years, the cost of congestion in these cities has only \ncontinued to grow. This multi-billion dollar hemorrhage is found not \nonly in our largest cities where eight of the top ten cities had total \nannual congestion costs exceeding $1 billion; we find congestion taxing \nseverely the economies of several small- and medium-sized cities as \nwell. According to the Institute, the economy of Albuquerque, New \nMexico endures an estimated annual cost of congestion approaching $150 \nmillion per year; Memphis, Tennessee-- almost $150 million per year; \nNashville, Tennessee--almost $200 million per year; Norfolk, Virginia-- \nmore than $350 million per year; Columbus, Ohio-- more than a quarter \nof a billion dollars per year; Jacksonville, Florida--more than $350 \nmillion per year; and San Bernadino-Riverside, California--over $1 \nbillion per year.\n  There are a lot of explanations for traffic congestion's growing \nimpact on our cities, but a principal cause of congestion, clearly, is \nthe fact that road mileage has not kept pace with a growing population, \na growing work force, and an American lifestyle in which the personal \nmobility afforded by automobiles is as essential to daily life as are \neating and sleeping. Many people say that Americans have a love affair \nwith their cars. More than a love affair, however, Americans simply \ndepend on their cars to squeeze their myriad chores and activities into \na busy work day.\n  A vehicle is one tool that many American workers cannot do without. \nThey do not just drive to and from work anymore. Americans stop at the \nday care, the grocery store, the dry cleaners, the PTA meeting, the \ngymnasium, and at volunteer programs, all in the course of driving to \nand from work. Transportation researchers call this phenomenon ``trip-\nchaining,'' and it is a trend that continues to grow and shows no sign \nof slowing.\n  While the size of our highway network has remained relatively static \nfor years, the condition and performance of those roads has \ndeteriorated. Poor road and bridge conditions must share part of the \nblame for our nation's congestion problem. According to a 1995 U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation's report to Congress, 28 percent of the \nmost heavily traveled U.S. roads are in poor or mediocre condition. \nThat means that those roads need work now--work now--to remain open and \nprotect the safety of the traveling public. And more than 181,000 \nbridges, or 32 percent of our nations' 575,000 bridges, are in need of \nrepair or replacement, including 70,000 bridges built in the 1960's and \ndesigned to last 30 years under 1960's travel conditions. These roads \nand bridges that have outlived their useful life or that are falling \napart from under-investment often are traffic choke-points that can be \ncorrected with the proper repairs.\n  And Senators don't have to travel very far away to see the traffic \nchoke-points, as they attempt to cross the bridges, get on the bridges \nand cross the Potomac every morning and every evening. It took me an \nhour and 15 minutes to get from my home in McLean, 10 miles away, this \nmorning, to get to my office because of traffic congestion feeding into \nthe streets, and feeding on and feeding off the bridges. We have to get \nacross that Potomac. As I say to my colleagues, we don't have to travel \nfar to see these choke-points working against us, against the traveling \npublic.\n  If Senators would like examples of a choke points, they need look no \nfurther than the bridges that cross the Potomac River. Most of these \nbridges were not designed to carry the traffic that accompanies the \nmorning and evening rush hours. As a result, traffic jams back up for \nmiles every work day, in both directions. That is the gridlock that \npoor roads and bridges can cause. I am sure that if Senators contact \ntheir own state transportation departments, they will find numerous \nexamples of traffic choke-points in their own states where a new \nbridge, smoother pavements, where an additional lane would alleviate \nthe problem and get people and freight moving again.\n  And congestion means more than just economic costs. Obviously, \ncongestion costs Americans time that could otherwise be spent with the \nfamily, with those children who are coming in from school and times \nthat otherwise could be spent at work, time that could be otherwise \nspent in school or elsewhere. According to a study by the Texas \nTransportation Institute, commuters in the country's 50 largest urban \nareas lose an average of 34 hours each year idling in traffic. Now that \nis not only time wasted, it is not only gasoline wasted, it is \npollution in the air.\n  Another, and equally important, cost of congestion is, as I say, its \nimpact on air quality. As cars and trucks are slowed by traffic \ncongestion, they emit more pollutants, thereby impeding efforts in many \nparts of the country to come into compliance with federal air quality \nstandards. Road improvements aimed at smoothing the flow of traffic can \nreduce auto-related pollutant emissions substantially. All such \nimprovements, however, cost money. And the Senate should be doing \neverything possible to ensure that our state and metropolitan officials \ndo not run out of federal highway funds that can help them relieve \ncongestion and improve air quality.\n  Today, Mr. President, Americans rely on automobiles for 90 percent or \nmore of all trips. In many areas of the country, we need additional \nhighway capacity to accommodate that travel. And federal highway funds \nare often a critical source of capital for these projects.\n  What can we do about congestion, Mr. President? What can Congress do \nto help eliminate the $53 billion annual burden borne by commuters in \nour large cities? What can we do to give people more time at home with \ntheir families or on the job instead of stuck in traffic? What can \nCongress do to our cities and counties to help their air quality?\n  Probably the single most important action Congress can take to help \nalleviate these problems is the prompt enactment of the 6-year highway \nbill. That bill is on the Senate calendar, ready to go, and the country \ncannot afford to wait any longer. The May 1 deadline after which States \nwill have no more Federal money--the Governors are in town and I hope \nthat some of them are watching the Senate at this moment--the May 1 \ndeadline after which States will be unable to obligate any more money, \nand if there is any doubt as to whether or not the States may obligate \nany more money after midnight, May 1, take a look at what the law says, \npublic law 105-130, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997, \nwhich is the short-term highway authorization that Congress passed last \nNovember before adjourning Sine die.\n  Here is what it says. This is the law. ``. . . a State shall not''--\nit doesn't say it may not--``. . . a State shall not obligate any funds \nfor any Federal-aid highway program project after May 1, 1998 . . . .''\n  There it is. That is the law. Unless a new law is passed that will be \nthe law on midnight, May 1, all the highway departments throughout the \ncountry, the Governors and mayors and other officials and the employees \nof the various highway agencies throughout the country, will feel the \npinch. So the May 1 deadline, after which States cannot obligate new \nFederal money to finance congestion relief projects, as I say and I \nrepeat it, is just 39 session days away--including today and including \nMay 1. It is drawing nearer with every passing minute.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford to delay. Our constituents stuck in \ntraffic\n\n[[Page S867]]\n\njams need our help. They want their highway taxes used to get them out \nof gridlock, but we cannot do that while the Senate is stuck in \nlegislative gridlock. I urge the majority leader to get the Senate--and \nthe country--out of gridlock by calling up the highway bill now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/24/senate-section/article/S865-6", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I want to thank those who have \nparticipated thus far in this debate about campaign reform. I am sure \nthat many of those who view C-SPAN with any regularity are experiencing \na sense of deja vu about this debate, wondering whether or not we \nhaven't already had debate very similar to this and whether we are not \nstuck in the same spot, whether we are ever going to stop talking about \nit and actually start moving toward some resolution. Today we are about \nto find out. This will give us the opportunity for the first time to \nvote this afternoon at 4 o'clock to indicate to the American people \nthat, indeed, we have resolved to deal with the extraordinary problems \nthat we have in campaign finance today. This is probably going to be \nour best chance in a generation for meaningful campaign reform, and a \nclear-cut vote is something that will allow us to move to that next \nstep toward resolution. We do not need any procedural excuses, no \namendment trees, no obfuscation. This will be clearly an up-or-down \nvote on the McCain-Feingold bill, through a tabling motion, that we \nhave sought now for some time.\n  The vote on Senator McCain's amendment answers the question, are you \nfor reform or not? A vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote, in my \nview, to end reform, at least for this Congress, once again. I am very \nproud of the fact that each one of the members of the Democratic caucus \nwill stand up and be counted. And my hope is that a number of \nRepublicans will join us in this effort. The only question is how many \nRepublicans and Democrats will come together in the middle to make this \na reality this afternoon.\n  I believe the fate of campaign reform rests in the hands of those who \nhave not yet publicly taken their positions with regard to campaign \nreform. It has been a generation since the last time we passed any \nmeaningful legislation having to do with campaigns. In 1971 and in \n1974, Congress enacted major reforms that first limited the amount of \nmoney in politics and, second, required candidates for the first time \nto disclose how they got their money. Today those laws are outdated and \nvirtually useless, and some have been circumvented by new decisions \nand, as a result of those decisions, loopholes that have been created \nin the campaign finance law.\n  Other aspects of that reform effort in 1971 and 1974 today are \nunenforced or completely unenforceable because of the systematic \ndefunding of the FEC, the Federal Election Commission. Still others \nhave been overturned by narrow and, many believe, incorrect court \ndecisions. Many reforms were thrown out by the Supreme Court in 1974 in \nthe 5-to-4 ruling, a very controversial ruling, in Buckley v. Valeo.\n  So, for the last 23 years now, Democrats have tried to overcome \nobstacles put in place by the Buckley ruling and to pass a campaign \nfinance reform modification, a realization that what happened in 1974, \nand what was addressed in that Court decision, needs to be addressed \nwith clarification in statute.\n  So, consider the record of a decade, beginning in 1988. At the \nopening of the 100th Congress, then majority leader Robert Byrd \nintroduced a bill to limit spending and reduce special interest \ninfluence. We had a record-setting eight cloture votes when that \nhappened. Democratic sponsors modified the bill to meet objections, but \nthe fact is that it was killed in a Republican filibuster.\n  In the Democratic-led 101st Congress, the House and the Senate passed \ncampaign finance bills. President Bush threatened to veto the bill, \neffectively killing it, because it contained voluntary spending limits.\n  In the 102d Congress, also a Democratically-led Congress, again the \nHouse and Senate passed campaign finance reform bills and President \nBush vetoed the bill with the backing of all of his Republican \nfilibuster.\n\n  In the Democratic-led 101st Congress, the House and the Senate passed \ncampaign finance bills. President Bush threatened to veto the bill, \neffectively killing it, because it contained voluntary spending limits.\n  In the 102d Congress, also a Democratically-led Congress, again the \nHouse and Senate passed campaign finance reform bills and President \nBush vetoed the bill with the backing of all of his Republican \ncolleagues.\n  In the 103d Congress, again under Democratic control, we passed a \ncampaign finance reform bill with 95 percent of the Democrats in the \nSenate and 91 percent of the Democrats in the House voting for reform. \nAgain, Republicans filibustered the move to take the bill to \nconference.\n  That brings us, then, to the 104th Congress, supposedly the reform \nCongress. Senators McCain and Feingold introduced their bipartisan \nreform plan, and reform at that point, for the first time in almost 2 \ndecades, actually seemed to be within reach. Republicans, again, in the \nSenate, filibustered the measure, while Republicans in the House \nintroduced a bill to allow more spending--a family of four would have \nbeen able to contribute $12.4 million in Federal election. The \nlegislation again failed to produce results of any kind. As a result of \nthat impasse, nothing was done for the remaining months of the 104th \nCongress, which now brings us to this Congress and last year.\n  In his State of the Union Message in January of 1997, President \nClinton called on Congress to pass campaign finance reform by July 4, \n1997. In the House, Republicans have voted time and again against \nbringing campaign finance reform to the floor. Speaker Gingrich has \npromised consideration this year, but also shook hands with the \nPresident on a campaign reform commission that really never came to \npass. Here in the Senate, we have traveled a tough road to get here \ntoday. We forced our way to the floor and refused to yield; poison \npills, amendment trees and cloture votes were all tactics used, and \nthis is probably the last opportunity we have to do something \nmeaningful in the 105th Congress.\n  The problem is really one that can be described in one word: money. \nThe amount of money, after two decades of delay, has skyrocketed. That \nis the fundamental problem. We hear talk in this debate about hard \nmoney and soft money, this money and that money. They are not the core \nof the problem. The core of the problem is that there is just too much \nmoney in politics, period. Total congressional campaign\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\nspending in 1975 was $115 million; in 1985, $450 million; in 1995, $765 \nmillion. We are expected, for the first time in this cycle, to exceed \n$1 billion in election year spending, shattering every other record we \nhave ever seen in politics in 220 years. A 73 percent increase over the \nprevious Presidential cycle is anticipated in the year 2000. In other \nwords, what we spend in 2000 on Presidential politics will exceed by 73 \npercent what we spent in 1996 on Presidential politics. To put that in \nperspective, wages rose 13 percent, college tuition rose 17 percent--\npolitics has increased in spending 73 percent.\n  The average cost of winning a Senate seat in 1996 was $4.5 million. \nTo raise that much money, a Senator has to raise approximately $14,000 \na week every week for 6 years. Given the current political rate of \ninflation, by the year 2023, in just 25 years, it will cost $145 \nmillion to run for the U.S. Senate.\n  We have pages on the right and left, Republican and Democratic pages. \nI talk to them; I look at them; I encourage them to run for public \noffice. But how can I tell them that I want them to run if in their \nlifetime they will be asking the question: How do I raise $145 million \nto have the position you have today, Senator Daschle? I can't answer \nthat. I don't know the answer to that. And I am troubled by that. What \nhappens if the U.S. Senate is only made up of those who have $145 \nmillion to spend? Is it a truly democratic legislative body if we lose \nthe opportunity to bring in families who pay their bills and confront \nall of the many, many challenges that an American family faces today \nand has a real appreciation of the enormity of those challenges? If \nthat vacuum, that void, is demonstrated cycle after cycle, year after \nyear here in the Senate, what kind of decisions will this body actually \nmake affecting those working families? If we don't have the broad \nrepresentation anticipated by our Founding Fathers, do we then have the \nkind of democracy so anticipated? Mr. President, I don't think we do.\n  So, indeed, it is not a question of soft money or hard money; it's \nreally a question of money. Do we tell our pages, we want you to be \nwomen and men in the U.S. Senate in your lifetime, but we also expect \nthat sometime, if you choose to do so, in order to be successful you \nwill have to raise $145 million? I hope not.\n\n  Obviously, this legislation is not going to solve that problem \nentirely, but it is going to give us an opportunity to deal with it \nmore effectively. At the very least, what we ought to do is recognize \nthat if we do not solve this problem, we are never going to be able to \nencourage effectively people getting into public life, people expecting \nto serve in public office.\n  The antipathy, the skepticism, is reflected in the polls taken of the \nAmerican people these days. They understand the circumstances. They \nunderstand that it is not just a question of a Senator or a Congressman \nspending inordinate amounts of time and effort raising money. They \nunderstand that there is a problem that goes beyond whether or not a \nyoung person today, contemplating public office, can come up with $145 \nmillion. What they understand is that just the sheer effect of money is \nas important as the amount of money.\n  In the eyes of most Americans, the current system makes Congress \nappear to be for sale to the highest bidder. The recent Harris poll \nshows it very clearly. Mr. President, 85 percent of people think \nspecial interests have more influence than voters; 85 percent, almost 9 \nout of 10 Americans today, said if you put a special interest and a \nvoter side by side, there is more likelihood that a Senator is going to \nlisten to the special interest than he is to the voter. Three-quarters \nof voters think Congress is largely owned by special interests. Voter \nturnout has plummeted, public confidence in this institution has \neroded, and democracy simply can't survive with the cynical atmosphere \nthat exists today.\n  It is just amazing to me as I talk to world leaders who come from all \nparts of the world, who have not experienced democracy until just \nrecently--they are from countries where they have not had a chance to \nvote; they are from countries where totalitarian regimes are the order \nof the day, where their whole lives were dictated by government in \nlarge measure that had everything to do with every facet of their \nlives. Now they have this new-found freedom, and, in an explosion of \ninterest in democracy and the joy of participation, we are seeing \nrecord numbers of turnout, 80, 90 percent at the polls. They come from \nEastern Europe, they come from Africa, they come from Asia, all \nexpressing to us this profound joy that they now have democracy. But do \nyou know what they say to us? They say, what is amazing to us is that \nwhen we look at your country, you have more freedom than we even have \ntoday and yet your participation in that freedom is the lowest of any \ncountry in the world. How is it that you can be so free and yet so \ncallous towards that freedom, so unwilling to commit to prolonging that \nfreedom, that democracy? And they worry out loud about how long our \nfreedom can last if no one cares; how long will it be before we lose \npart or all of it because we don't care.\n  Mr. President, it is so critical that we restore trust and confidence \nin our democracy, that we recognize we are dealing here with a very, \nvery fragile institution that will rise or fall based in large measure \non whether or not we care enough to make participation in democracy a \nreal aspect of this country's future.\n  So that is, in part, what this is about. Do we care enough? Are we \nprepared to take the responsibilities seriously that we hold as U.S. \nSenators to bring back participation, to allow the voters more \nconfidence that we are listening to them and not the special interests, \nand to deal with the reality--the reality that I can't ask a young \nperson today to come up with $145 million when he or she is my age and \nwants to run for the U.S. Senate?\n  We also have a serious problem with regard to the ads themselves and \nall that comes from spending this money. It is the amount of money, the \nperception of to whom we are indebted, but now we also have a problem \nwith the virulent advertising that comes from it. I believe that \nnegative advertising is the crack cocaine of politics. We are hooked on \nit because it works. We are hooked on it because we win elections using \nit. There is no accountability, no reporting; it is publicly not tied \nto any candidates. And I expect that in 1998 we are going to see a \nmeltdown of the process, because we are going to see more virulent ads \nthan we have ever seen in our lifetimes. The crack cocaine of politics \nwill be at work again.\n  Negative ads from anonymous sources push candidates to the margins. \nCandidates become bit players in their own races. How many times have I \nheard candidates actually say, ``I couldn't keep track of who was on my \nside. I'd watch television and I'd hear my name used pro and con, and I \ndidn't have anything to do with those ads. I am sitting like a man at a \ntennis match, watching both sides play it out.'' And the debate now is \ndefined by who has the most money; that is how it is defined.\n  The solution to all of this is not going to be achieved today. There \nare those who look at all of this and contend that nothing is wrong. \nSome have argued that the system is not broken, that we actually need \nmore money in politics. We believe the system is badly broken, and so \ndo the American people.\n  They don't want to be subjected to this barrage of negative \nadvertising that we know we are going to see again. They don't want to \nsee the dumbing down of politics year after year, in spite of the fact \nthat we see the creeping up of costs, the explosion in increases in \ncosts.\n  So it brings us really to the issue of the day: McCain-Feingold. It \ndoes not cover all the critical components of reform, overall spending \nlimits, but it lets us at least get off dead center. If it doesn't \naddress the central problem, it does address several problems, \nincluding banning one very, very difficult aspect of campaign finance \ntoday--soft money; setting restrictions on independent expenditures; \nbetter disclosures so people have an idea of who is giving how much to \nwhich candidate and why; and it limits the ability of the superrich to \nbuy political office.\n  So we are here and all 45 Democrats stand ready to pass it. We have \nmade a lot of changes to pick up Republican support. We have dropped \nspending limits, we have dropped reduced TV rate, we have dropped PAC \nrestrictions, we codified the so-called Beck decision having to do with \nlabor contributions.\n\n[[Page S869]]\n\n  There is no more we can do, particularly since McCain-Feingold is the \nleast we should do. We want to do more. If we were in the majority, we \nwould fight to cap spending. The Valeo decision, as I said, was 5 to 4. \nMr. President, 126 scholars have said spending limits are \nconstitutional. But we simply can't let the perfect be the enemy of the \ngood. We are confronted with a systemic problem, and we need a systemic \nsolution. We have a chance to make some changes we plainly know are \nneeded to restore some dignity and sanity to this process.\n  So much time and money in this Congress has been spent already to \ninvestigate perceived abuses in the 1996 election. There are cries of \noutrage, cries of shock and indignation. The American people are \ncynical because they don't think Congress is going to do anything about \nit. They believe that the politicians' self-interest will again \noverride the public good. If, after all the hearings, all the press \nreleases, all the statements, all the reports, all the votes, we do \nnothing, then frankly, Mr. President, that cynicism will be justified.\n  The American people get it. They know the system is broken. They know \nwe have an opportunity to fix it, but they don't think we will. We \nshould surprise them. We need sincere bipartisan efforts to clean up \nour own house. We need Republicans to join with Democrats to make that \nhappen this afternoon.\n  People who think they can quietly kill this effort are wrong. One \nday, hopefully today, but one day we will succeed. We will not give up. \nBut this is the time to do it. If we squander this opportunity, it will \nnot go unnoticed. If we seize this moment, we can make history and do \nthe right thing for those people who want to be a part of the process, \nfor all Americans, for people who want once more to participate in our \nFederal elections system. This is our opportunity. Let's do it right. \nLet's do it this afternoon. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/24/senate-section/article/S867-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1663, the Paycheck Protection Act, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1663) to protect individuals from having their \n     money involuntarily collected and used for politics by a \n     corporation or labor organization.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain amendment No. 1646, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am sorry the Democratic leader has \nleft the floor. I did want to make a couple of observations.\n  First, with regard to the Buckley case, it was 9 to 0 on the issue of \nspending is speech. Quoting that great conservative Thurgood Marshall:\n\n       One of the points on which all Members on the Court agree \n     is that money is essential for effective communication in a \n     political campaign.\n\n  This was an extraordinarily important Supreme Court decision. It \nwasn't 5 to 4 on any of the critical issues, and, as a matter of fact, \nMr. President, the Court has had an opportunity over the last 22 years \nto revisit the Buckley case in various subcomponent parts and has \nconsistently expanded the areas of permissible political speech.\n  I heard the Democratic leader saying all of this spending is getting \nout of control. Bear in mind that what he is saying is that all of this \nspeaking is getting out of control. What he is suggesting, and our dear \ncolleagues on the other side are suggesting, is we need to get somebody \nin charge of all this speech and, of course, it is the Government that \nthey want to be in charge of all this speech. The courts are not going \nto allow that. They didn't allow it in the mid-seventies, they haven't \nallowed it any time they have revisited that issue since, they are not \ngoing to allow it now, and they are not going to allow it ever, because \nit is not the Government's business to tell citizens how much they get \nto speak in the American political process.\n  The suggestion was made that all this spending is out of control. I \nalways say, how much is too much? I asked my colleague from Wisconsin \nduring the debate last October, how much is too much? I could never get \nan answer. Maybe today we can get that answer. How much is too much?\n  In the 1996 campaign, the discussion was intense. Spending did go up, \nthe stakes were big--big indeed. It was the future of the country--a \nPresidential election, control of Congress. But we only spent about \nwhat the public spent on bubble gum.\n  Looking at it another way, Mr. President, of all the commercials that \nwere run in 1996, 1 percent of them were about politics. Speaking too \nmuch? By any objective standard, of course not. Of course not.\n  It is naive in the extreme to assume everybody in this country has an \nequal opportunity to speak. Dan Rather gets to speak more than I do and \nmore than the Senator from New Hampshire does, as do Tom Brokaw and \nLarry King and the editorial page of the Washington Post. Maybe we \nought to equalize their speech. I am saying this, of course, tongue in \ncheek. But you can make the argument, it is the same first amendment, \nthe same right applies to all of us.\n  I wonder how they would feel if we said, ``OK, you are free to say \nwhat you want on the editorial page, but, henceforth, your circulation \nis limited to 5,000. We haven't told you what to say, but we think you \nare saying it to too many people, and so the Government has concluded \nthat this is pollution.''\n  I heard the Democratic leader talking about all this polluting \nspeech--I am not sure that is the exact word he used --all this \nnegativity, all this hostility. Most of the negativity and hostility I \nsee is on the editorial page of the American newspapers. Maybe we ought \nto suggest they can't do that in the last 60 days of the election.\n  There isn't a court in America that is going to uphold this bill. But \nthe good news is they are not going to get it and have the chance to \nuphold it.\n  The Democratic leader said we wanted to quietly kill it. We are not \nquietly killing it, we are proudly killing it. We are not apologizing \nfor killing this unconstitutional bill. We are grateful for the \nopportunity to defend the first amendment. No apologies will be made, \nnot now, not tomorrow, not ever. The Government should not be put in \ncharge of how much American citizens as individuals or as members of \ngroups or as political candidates or as political parties may speak to \nthe people of this country.\n\n  I heard the Democratic leader complain that candidates can't control \nthe campaigns. Well, it is not theirs to control. Of course we don't \nlike issue advocacy. Of course we don't like independent expenditures. \nBut the Supreme Court has given no indication that the political \ncandidates are entitled to control all of the discourse in the course \nof a campaign. I wish I could control the two major newspapers in my \nState that are always against what I am doing. It irritates me in the \nextreme, Mr. President. But I am not trying to introduce a bill around \nhere to shut them up the last 60 days of an election.\n  The good news is there has been a whole line of court cases on this \nquestion of trying to control what is called ``issue advocacy''; that \nis, groups talking about issues at any time they want to, up to and \nincluding proximity to an election.\n  The FEC has been on a mission for the last few years to try to shut \nthese folks up. They have lost virtually every single case in court. As \na matter of fact, in the fourth circuit in a case about a year and a \nhalf ago, not only did the FEC lose again, but the court required that \nthey pay the lawyer's fees for the group they were harassing. It was \npretty clear, Mr. President, there is no authority to do this.\n  That is really where we are in this debate. The American people are \nnot expecting us to take away their right to speak in the political \nprocess, and the Supreme Court has made it very, very clear. Let me say \nit again. They have said, unless you have the ability to amplify your \nvoice, your speech is\n\n[[Page S870]]\n\nnot worth very much. You could go door-to-door for the rest of your \nlife in California and have no impact on the process. So the Court \nwisely recognized that citizens under the first amendment had to have \ntheir right either as individuals or to band together as a part of a \ngroup to amplify their voice.\n  Spending has been critical in the political process going back to the \nfounding of the country. Somebody paid for those pamphlets that were \ndistributed around the time of the American Revolution. Somebody paid \nfor those.\n  It is suggested under the most recent incarnation of McCain-Feingold, \n``Oh, we are not going to shut them up, we are just going to make them \nreport their donors.'' Put another way, the price for discussing \npolitical issues at the end of a campaign is to disclose your donor \nlist. The courts have already dealt with that issue in 1958 in an NAACP \ncase in Alabama, that a group cannot be compelled to disclose its donor \nlist as a condition for criticizing all of us.\n  This kind of effort to quash speech, to shut up the critics of \ncandidates is not only going nowhere in the Senate, it is going nowhere \nin the courts. There has been an effort around the country, financed by \nsome very wealthy people. George Soros, when he is not financing a \nreferenda to legalize marijuana, is also financing this effort. And \nJerome Goldberg, one of the wealthy financiers on Wall Street, has been \nproviding money to go out and try and get these kinds of referenda on \nthe ballot and approved around the country.\n  The good news is they are all getting struck down. Even if they are \npassed, they are getting struck down. It happened in California a \ncouple weeks ago. It happened in Wisconsin. The courts understand the \nlaw, and the law is clear, and no effort to circumvent the first \namendment, either in Washington in the Congress or community by \ncommunity or State by State around the country is going to succeed, \nbecause the law is clear.\n  We are not apologetic in defeating this bill. It richly deserves to \nbe defeated. For the moment--I see that there are some colleagues here \nwho wish to speak--let me just recount some of the points from the \nBuckley case as a way of beginning today's discussion.\n  As I said earlier, the great conservative Thurgood Marshall said:\n\n       One of the points on which all Members of the Court agree \n     is that money is essential for effective communication in a \n     political campaign.\n\n  That is not Mitch McConnell or Bob Smith, that is Thurgood Marshall. \nFurther excerpts from the Buckley case that we ought to be aware of, \nthe Court said:\n\n       The first amendment denies Government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views is \n     wasteful, excessive or unwise.\n\n  The Government doesn't have the power to do that to individual \ncitizens and groups.\n  The Court went on:\n\n       In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not \n     the Government but the people--individually as citizens and \n     candidates and collectively as associations and political \n     committees--who must retain control over the quantity--\n\n  How much we speak--\n\n     and range--\n\n  What we say--\n\n     of debate on public issues in a political campaign.\n\n  In other words, this is beyond the province of Government to regulate \nin our democracy.\n  The Court went on:\n\n       A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend on political communication during a campaign \n     necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting \n     the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \n     exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is \n     because virtually every means of communicating ideas in \n     today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.\n\n  It is a statement of the obvious. It is a statement of the obvious. \nIf it did not require money to communicate, why would Common Cause be \ndoing direct mail finance solicitations all the time? They have to have \nmoney to operate. And I do not decry them that opportunity.\n  The Court observed that even ``distribution of the humblest \nhandbill'' costs money. Further, the Court stated that the electorate's \nincreasing dependence on television and radio for news and information \nmakes ``these expensive modes of communication indispensable''--Mr. \nPresident, this is the Supreme Court--``indispensable instruments of \n[free speech].''\n  In other words, it is a statement of the obvious. In a country of 270 \nmillion people, unless you have the ability to amplify your speech, to \namplify your voice so you might have a chance of competing with Dan \nRather, Tom Brokaw, and the editorial pages of your newspapers, at \nleast during the last 30 days of your election, you do not have a \nchance. So we shut down all of these people, Mr. President. It is a \npower transfer to the broadcast industry and to the print industry in \nthis country, which some of us think have a good deal of power as it \nstands now.\n  With regard to the appearance of corruption issue, it is frequently \nsaid that all of this money is corrupting the process. The Court held \nthere is ``nothing invidious, improper or unhealthy'' in campaign \nspending money to communicate-- nothing.\n  With regard to the growth in campaign spending, I heard the \nDemocratic leader projecting some astronomical figure that candidates \nwere going to have to spend in the future. Let me say, there is nobody \nin the Senate spending all their time raising money. That is said all \nthe time. That is not true. Eighty percent of the money raised in \nSenate races is raised in the last 2 years, it is raised in the last 2 \nyears by candidates who think they may have a contest.\n  What is wrong with that? We do not own these seats. If we are in \ntrouble, we are probably going to want to express ourselves in the \ncampaign. And if you are going to express yourself in the campaign, you \nare not going to write the check for it out of your own bank account. \nYou better get busy to get the resources to communicate your message or \nyou are history.\n  The Court said, with regard to the growth in campaign spending, ``. . \n.the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of \nitself provides no basis''--no basis--``for governmental restrictions \non the quantity of campaign spending. . .''--no basis.\n  It is often said that we need to level the playing field. How many \ntimes have we heard that? The Court addressed that issue in Buckley as \nwell. The Court said, with regard to leveling the playing field, ``. . \n.the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements \nof our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is \nwholly foreign to the First Amendment.'' ``Wholly foreign to the First \nAmendment''-- brilliant and thoughtful words from the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo.\n  And the Court has never retreated from the major principles in this \ncase, Mr. President. In fact, they are moving in the opposite \ndirection, in the direction of more and more permissible political \nspeech.\n  In fact, one of the few things in the Buckley case that the reformers \nliked has created one of the biggest problems in the last 20 years. The \nreformers liked the fact that the Court did uphold a limit on how much \none could contribute to another, the contribution limit. Well, the \nCongress has never indexed the contribution limit. Even President \nClinton said last month that the hard money contribution should be \nindexed to inflation. And he was absolutely right. That $1,000 set back \nin the mid-1970s, at a time when a Mustang cost $2,700, is now worth \n$320. In a medium- or small-sized State, it does not produce a huge \ndistortion, but it is an absolute disgrace for a candidate seeking to \nrun for office in a big State where you have a huge audience, like \nCalifornia or New York or Texas, to be stuck with a $320 per person \ncontribution limit.\n\n  So ironically, Mr. President, the only part of the Buckley case that \nthe reformers applauded has produced the biggest distortion in the \nprocess and the biggest problem for candidates running in large States.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just conclude this part of my remarks, as I \nsee others here. We make no apologies for beating this terrible piece \nof legislation. It does not deserve to pass. It will not pass. The \nfirst amendment will be protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In a moment I will yield to the Senator from Minnesota \nwho I very much want to hear from on this issue.\n  Just a very brief comment with regard to the comments of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. The language of the McCain-Feingold bill on issue \nadvocacy was not an issue in the Wisconsin case. In fact, in that \nWisconsin case the judge specifically suggested our provision on issue \nadvocacy may be a model of what might pass constitutional muster.\n  The Senator made a lot of general comments on Buckley v. Valeo, but \nthe one thing he didn't do is relate Buckley v. Valeo to our bill. Our \nbill was specifically crafted to be constitutional under Buckley v. \nValeo. We have a letter from 126 constitutional scholars who say that \nour bill is in fact constitutional, especially with respect to the ban \non soft money. It is 126 constitutional scholars against the mere \nconstant repetition of the claim that our bill is unconstitutional. We \nhave the weight of legal authorities on this issue on our side. Of \ncourse, it is our intention and belief that this would pass \nconstitutional muster.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it has been reported that a majority--\nmajority; that is, Republican party--written portion of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee draft report reaches the following \nconclusion or contains the following statement: ``In 1996, the federal \ncampaign finance system collapsed.'' I would like to associate myself \nwith this observation by the majority members of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  Mr. President, the system did collapse. Americans witnessed a \ncorruption, a tarnishing of our political system. And I say to my \ncolleague from Kentucky, the Supreme Court is very clear that that in \nfact is a justification for reform. People saw in a very systematic way \nspecial interest money dominate the discourse. And the American people \nstayed home in record numbers.\n  It is not surprising that as this system becomes more and more \ndominated by big money, and regular people feel like they are locked \nout of involvement, and that this system dominated by money does not \nrespond to the concerns and circumstances of their lives, they stay \nhome.\n  As a matter of fact, we did not even have 50 percent of the people \nvoting in the last Presidential election. That was the third lowest \nturnout in the history of our country. Some people here on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate may be comfortable with that reality. I am not. It is \nthe opposite of what I live and work for. And it is the opposite, I \nwould say to my colleagues, of real representative democracy.\n\n  Mr. President, a New York Times headline: ``1996 Campaign Left \nFinance Laws in Shreds.'' I agree with the judgment of this article, \nwhich I quote:\n\n       Beneath the cloudy surface of the Senate hearings, one \n     clear picture has emerged: The post-Watergate campaign \n     finance laws that were passed to restrict the influence of \n     special interests in politics have been shredded.\n\n  Mr. President, Americans know this. Some of my colleagues may not \nwant to face up to these truths, but Americans know it. They know that \nevery Federal Government issue that affects their lives is damaged by \nthe way big money, special interest money has taken over our politics. \nIt is as if there has been a hostile takeover of elections in our \ncountry, a hostile takeover of Government, whether it is health care, \ninsurance rates, taxes, telecommunications, banking, tobacco, \nenvironment, food and agriculture, trade, oil and pharmaceutical \ncompany subsidies. What is on the table and what is not on the table, \nwhat is considered reasonable and realistic, what is not considered \nreasonable and realistic, what is debated, what isn't, what is \ndistorted, what issues are even dealt with in the first place--people \nin the country know that this is dominated by big money. The system has \ncollapsed. The laws that are meant to regulate it have been shredded.\n  What are we doing about it? We have a good bill, S. 25, the McCain-\nFeingold bill. It is the pending amendment. It would, A, prohibit soft \nmoney to the parties. That is maybe the biggest abuse. This might be \nthe most single important reform that we can undertake; and, B, it \nrestricts--restricts; not prohibits--phony ``issue'' ads which are \nreally election ads.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, read a piece \nyesterday on the floor of the Senate about $800,000 of so-called issue \nads poured into one congressional race, one special election, by a \nparty--$800,000 of so-called issue ads in a New York House district \nrace last year to destroy a candidate there.\n  The bill would also expand disclosure requirements. It would \nstrengthen FEC enforcement, and it would discourage wealthy candidates \nfrom spending more than $50,000 of their own money on a race.\n  It is a decent, worthy bill, Mr. President. I hope we can pass it. My \ntwo colleagues have worked extremely hard in order to assure that this \nvote could happen. And I think that the bill will receive a majority of \nthe vote. But it is going to be filibustered. And I fear that most \nMembers of the majority party do not want reform. They are not willing \nto allow an acceptable version of this bill to receive the 60 votes. \nWhy is that?\n  Mr. President, the public is fed up with the current system. \nCongressional Quarterly summarizes this aptly. ``While polls show that \nthe public is fed up with the current system, the public is cynical \nabout politicians' ability to fix it.''\n  Mr. President, my colleague keeps talking about the first amendment. \nNobody is saying you cannot spend money. Nobody is saying you cannot \nspeak out. But what we are talking about is that we now have auctions \nrather than elections. We are talking about the way in which money has \nsubverted this system, systemic corruption, when too few people have \ntoo much wealth, power and say, and too many people are left out.\n  Mr. President, we will also be discussing the Snowe-Jeffords \nproposal. I have said to my colleague from Wisconsin that I am a bit \nskeptical about it. I am a bit skeptical about it. I am not at all sure \nthat I like the idea that this amendment only gets introduced if all 45 \nDemocrats pledge allegiance to it, so that we can pick up two more \nRepublican votes. But I know it certainly is a desirable alternative to \nthe poison pill, the Paycheck Protection Act.\n  But here is what I am worried about. Maybe for tactical reasons we do \nit, but maybe for substantive reasons we do not. I am a little worried \nthat we now have the following argument before us: We are desperately \nafraid that we cannot enact real campaign finance reform this year \nbecause the public is not angry enough and because the public is not \nmobilized; therefore, we should weaken the reform bill in order to \nexcite the public. I do not think that is really going to happen. And I \nthink we need an aroused public behind this worthy effort.\n  Again, I think it is desirable as a substitute for the poison pill \nPaycheck Protection Act, but it is also a retreat from the definitely \nsuperior express-advocacy and issue-ad provisions of the McCain-\nFeingold bill. Let me just remind my colleagues, that those of us who \nhave been the reformers, we have compromised many times over already.\n  As a matter of fact, the provisions of the McCain-Feingold bill that \nwould affect us most are basically out right now. We are not even \ntalking about a piece of legislation that really affects the way we \nourselves raise and spend money in Congressional races. It is an \nimportant effort. I am for it. I want it to pass. But I want to be \nclear, we dropped the voluntary spending limits which would have done \nthe most to assure a more level playing field between incumbents and \nchallengers.\n  In addition, we dropped the free and discounted television time. We \nalso, as a concession, have inserted codification of the Beck \nlanguage. We have gone a long ways toward trimming this down in order \nto try and get something passed that would at least be a positive step \nin the right direction, and the majority party is still stonewalling \nthis.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, let me be clear in dealing with the provision \nthat Senator Jeffords and Senator Snowe have come up with. There is \nsome merit to it tactically, without any doubt. I still\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\nworry that it represents a retreat. I'm not sure we can excite people \nby continuing to strip this bill down to the point where it doesn't \nhave teeth, and it doesn't do the job.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place a piece by Greg \nGordon of the Star Tribune, the largest newspaper in my home State, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the (Minneapolis, MN) Star Tribune, Oct. 29, 1997]\n\n            Turning Nonprofits Into Powerful Political Tools\n\n                            (By Greg Gordon)\n\n (Twin Cities entrepreneur Robert Cummins gave $100,000 to a nonprofit \nthat backed a dozen GOP campaigns, including Gil Gutknecht's, a Senate \n panel has found. The trend, while legal, allows donors to circumvent \n                 federal election laws, observers say)\n\n       Senate investigators have obtained bank records showing \n     that a Twin Cities entrepreneur donated $100,000 to a \n     nonprofit group that ran ``issue ads'' last year backing a \n     dozen Republican congressional candidates, including \n     Minnesota Rep. Gil Gutknecht.\n       With his donation to the Citizens for the Republic \n     Education Fund, Robert Cummins, chairman of Eden Prairie-\n     based Fargo Electronics Inc., joined in a trend by both major \n     parties to turn nonprofit groups into political weapons.\n       Campaign-finance experts say the practice, although legal, \n     offers a way for donors to circumvent federal election laws \n     that require public disclosure of their names and limit the \n     amounts they can give. The loophole also enables corporations \n     that are barred from directly donating to campaigns to play \n     major roles in political races, said Democratic investigators \n     for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.\n       Gutknecht, whose reelection campaign faced an onslaught of \n     attack ads sponsored by labor unions, says that early last \n     year he gave the names of several potential Minnesota donors \n     to Triad Management Service, the Virginia company that ran \n     the Citizens for the Republic Fund. The First District \n     congressman declined last week to say whether Cummins, who \n     with his wife had each already donated the maximum $2,000 to \n     Gutknecht's campaign, was among them. Cummins, a politically \n     active conservative, did not respond to phone calls seeking \n     his comment.\n       Gutknecht said he has never heard of the Citizens for the \n     Republic Education Fund, which spent at least $3,000 boosting \n     his campaign in the Rochester, Minn., media market, and that \n     he never knew about the ad.\n       The organization is one of three conservative-backed \n     nonprofits that were dormant in the summer of 1996 but sprang \n     to life shortly before the election as donations poured into \n     their accounts, people familiar with the investigation said.\n       Together, Citizens for the Republic Education Fund, \n     Citizens for Reform, which also was managed by Triad, and the \n     Coalition for Our Children's Future spent nearly $4 million \n     in October and November 1996 on ads that gave GOP candidates \n     a late boost in at least 34 close House and Senate races, \n     Senate investigators have found. The Coalition for Our \n     Children's Future also send Republican-leaning postcards to \n     tens of thousands of voters in at least nine Minnesota \n     legislative districts.\n       Nonprofit groups are barred from expressly advocating the \n     election or defeat of a candidate. But so-called ``issue \n     ads,'' which stop just short of doing so, have provided \n     political consultants with an effective alternative.\n       The three tax-exempt groups have refused to identify their \n     donors. Democratic investigators said they used subpoenaed \n     bank records to trace the identities of Cummins and several \n     other contributors to Citizens for the Republic Education \n     Fund and Citizens for Reform.\n       Other donations to the three groups were made through \n     secret trusts represented by Gen. Ginsberg, a former general \n     counsel to the Republican National Committee (RNC), according \n     to Senate investigators and a former employee of one of the \n     groups. Ginsberg failed to return phone calls seeking his \n     comment.\n       Senate investigators suspect one of these trusts is \n     shielding the identities of Charles and David Koch, brothers \n     who run oil industry giant Koch Industries, which operates a \n     large refinery in Rosemount, a Democratic committee aide \n     said. Jay Rosser, a spokesman for Wichita, Kan.-based Koch, \n     declined to comment on whether the Kochs or their money were \n     involved. Democrats on the committee sent Charles Koch a \n     letter this month asking to speak with him about their \n     inquiry, but he failed to respond, according to \n     investigators.\n       Thomas Mann, a campaign-finance expert who is director of \n     governmental studies for the Brookings Institution, called \n     the financing of politically active nonprofits ``an utter \n     corruption of the system.''\n       ``There is just no question that this is an effort to \n     circumvent the rules limiting the sources and amounts of \n     contributions to federal campaigns,'' he said. Mann said the \n     effort is proof that ``the whole regulatory regime for \n     campaign finance collapsed in 1996'' amid ``gaming'' by both \n     parties.\n       The Senate committee has previously disclosed that aides to \n     President Clinton and officials at the RNC referred large \n     donors to nonprofit groups so they could avoid the publicity \n     that often accompanies big donations to the parties. The New \n     York Times reported last week that Twin Cities businessman \n     Vance Opperman donated $100,000 to Vote Now '96, a nonprofit \n     organization to which Clinton campaign and White House aides \n     referred a number of large donors. The organization, which \n     promoted voter turnout, apparently did not finance ``issue \n     ads.''\n       Both conservative and liberal nonprofit groups have \n     resisted committee inquiries, and the competing Republican \n     and Democratic investigations have led to deep disagreements. \n     Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and other Democratic members \n     complain that the panel's chairman, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-\n     Tenn., has refused to sign subpoenas that would enable them \n     to fully trace the funding of the conservative groups or \n     to allow the Democrats to hold hearings where they could \n     confront officials of Triad and the nonprofits. A \n     Republican spokesman contended that the Democratic inquiry \n     has been overly broad and burdensome for the nonprofit \n     groups.\n\n\n                           investment adviser\n\n       At the center of the controversy is Triad, whose officers \n     have declined to answer investigators' questions.\n       Mark Braden, a Washington lawyer for Triad, says the \n     company served as ``an investment adviser'' that assisted \n     clients in deciding ``where to make political, charitable and \n     issue-related donations.'' Senate investigators say Triad \n     helped clients who had already donated the legal maximum to a \n     candidate find other ways to help.\n       Triad was formed in 1995 by Carolyn Malenick, a former \n     political fund-raiser for Oliver North, the ex-Marine who was \n     a central figure in the Iran-contra affair and then ran \n     unsuccessful for a Virginia Senate seat.\n       In the spring of 1996, investigators found, Malenick met \n     with Pennsylvania businessman Robert Cone, the former owner \n     of children's products manufacturer Graco Inc., and Sen. Don \n     Nickles, R-Okla. Cone soon sent the firm $600,000 in seed \n     money and later gave substantially more, the investigators \n     said.\n       In a promotional film in which Nickles endorses the group, \n     Malenick talked about Republicans developing a way to quickly \n     infuse $100,000 into a congressional race, countering labor \n     unions' ability to provide ``rapid fire'' to Democratic \n     candidates.\n       Braden said Malenick's firm sent consultants to do \n     ``political audits'' with about 250 GOP campaigns nationwide \n     to identify races where donors could support candidates who \n     shared their ideological views and had ``a viable campaign.''\n       Braden said Triad launched the ``issue ad'' campaign \n     through the nonprofits only to respond to the AFL-CIO's $20 \n     million advertising blitz in the districts of vulnerable \n     Republicans such as Gutknecht.\n       ``The father of these ads is [AFL-CIO President] John \n     Sweeney,'' Braden said. ``If there had been no AFL-CIO \n     campaign, there would have been no Citizens for the \n     Republican Education Fund issue campaign.''\n       Braden denied that any of the donations facilitated by \n     Triad were illegally ``earmarked'' to specific candidates.\n       Another large donor was California farmer Dan Garawan, who \n     has said publicly that he gave $100,000 to Citizens for \n     Reform, which spent heavily on issues ads that attacked Rep. \n     Calvin Dooley, D-Calif.\n       Among donors yet to be identified is a trust that donated a \n     total of $1.3 million to citizens for the Republican \n     Education Fund and to Citizens for Reform. Also still a \n     mystery is the source of a $700,000 check to the Coalition \n     for Our Children's Future, a group unrelated to Triad. \n     Barry Bennett, the coalition's former executive director, \n     says that the donation was arranged in September 1996 by a \n     Houston political consultant and that Ginsberg drew up \n     confidentiality documents.\n       The investigators have information ``that very strongly \n     suggests the Koch family and Koch Industries were a major \n     funding source for the Triad subsidiaries and the Coalition \n     for Our Children's Future,'' one Democratic committee aide \n     said. Koch made one direct donation to Triad of $2,000, \n     investigators found. Triad booster Nickles, a member of the \n     Governmental Affairs Committee, has been a major Senate ally \n     of Koch.\n       Federal Election Commission records show that the Koch \n     brothers and KochPAC donated to more than a dozen of the \n     candidates supported by the three nonprofits, most of them \n     located in Kansas, Oklahoma and other states where Koch has \n     facilities.\n\n\n                          Boost for Gutknecht\n\n       Cummino sent a $100,000 check to the Citizens for the \n     Republic Fund on Oct. 3, 1996, a week after Triad signed a \n     consulting agreement with the nonprofit, investigators found.\n       Meredith O'Rourke, a former Triad employee, told the \n     committee in a recent deposition that Triad officials has \n     discussed key issues in Gutknecht's reelection race with \n     Gutknecht or his campaign, people familiar with the inquiry \n     said. Gutknecht acknowledged that he met with a Triad \n     official early in his campaign, but said he only recalls \n     discussing the ``issues they [Triad representatives] were \n     advancing,'' not his own.\n       The Citizens for the Republic Fund ``issue ad'' that fall \n     mentioned Gutknecht's name five times, without identifying \n     his Democratic challenger, Mary Rieder, and accused\n\n[[Page S873]]\n\n     ``big labor bosses in Washington'' of distorting Gutknecht's \n     record on education.\n       Gutknecht dismissed disclosures about the nonprofit groups' \n     political role as ``a joke'' and ``a desperate'' attempt by \n     Democrats to distract public attention from Clinton's \n     embarrassing campaign activities, such as inviting major \n     donors to stay overnight in the Lincoln Bedroom.\n       ``As far as I know,'' he said, ``any businesspeople who \n     participated with Triad did not get a night in the Lincoln \n     Bedroom. They didn't get any preferential treatment on Asian \n     pipelines, they didn't want to block an Indian casino in \n     Hudson, Wisconsin. All were American citizens. None were \n     Buddhist monks.''\n       In the spring of 1996, three Washington-based nonprofit \n     groups had no offices, no staffs and were inactive. By that \n     fall, the groups had raised nearly $4 million in donations \n     and were pouring much of the money into ``issue ads'' \n     supporting conservative House and Senate candidates.\n\n\n                          Citizens for Reform\n\n       Founded by conservative activist Peter Flaherty, the \n     nonprofit group was incorporated in May 1996 and is now run \n     by Triad Management Services, a political consulting firm in \n     Manassas, Va. Senate investigators say the group spent $1.4 \n     million in October 1996 on ads in 21 House and Senate \n     districts, including one that attacked Democratic \n     congressional candidate Bill Yellowtail of Montana for \n     striking his wife.\n\n\n                Citizens for the Republic Education Fund\n\n       Incorporated in June 1996, the fund later obtained tax-\n     exempt status as a political group. Also run by Triad, it is \n     headed by former Reagan White House aide Lyn Nofziger. In \n     October 1996, investigators say, the fund spent almost $1.5 \n     million on ``issue ads'' in 13 House and Senate races, \n     helping secure victories for Rep. Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn., and \n     Republican Senate candidates Sam Brownback of Kansas and Tim \n     Hutchinson of Arkansas.\n\n\n                  Coalition for OUr Children's Future\n\n       Formed in late 1995 to air ads supporting the Balanced \n     Budget Act, the coalition was only a shell in the fall of \n     1996, operating in offices at the Virginia political fund-\n     raising firm of Odell, Roper and Simms. Then a secret trust \n     reportedly contributed $700,000 to the coalition, which ran \n     ``issue ads'' in Arkansas and Louisiana Senate races and \n     three House races and blitzed voters in at least nine \n     Minnesota legislative districts with postcards favoring GOP \n     candidates.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. He talks about turning nonprofits into powerful \npolitical tools. I'm worried about all of the ways, to quote Thomas \nMann from the article, that this new practice has ``become an utter \ncorruption of the system.'' I don't want to retreat from clear \nstandards here.\n  Mr. President, since I have less than 2 minutes, I hope the McCain-\nFeingold bill will pass intact. I hope we will vote for it today. I \nhope that colleagues will not be able to block it. I hope we will be \nwary of ``deform'' measures, not reform measures. We have to pass \nsomething real. We have to pass something significant. I hope we get a \npositive vote for this piece of legislation today, and I ask people in \nthe country, please be vigilant, please hold all of us accountable. \nDon't let the majority party block a reform that would restore your \nvoice and some real democracy in this country. Don't let the U.S. \nSenate pass a piece of legislation which would have that made-for-\nCongress look, a great acronym, but will not have the enforcement teeth \nand would not do the job and really wouldn't get some of the big money \nout of politics.\n  The McCain-Feingold effort is not all I desire--I proposed the clean \nmoney, clean elections approach which has passed in Maine and that was \nalso passed in Vermont--but it is a worthy piece of legislation and it \nought to pass the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I understand we are under a controlled time situation \nwithout designating a controller, so I ask unanimous consent I control \nthe time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Washington \nsuch time as he may consume.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the first amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States reads in relative part ``Congress shall make no law \nabridging the freedom of speech or of the press.''\n  Today, once again, we are engaged in a debate in which the proponents \npropose to limit the freedom of speech, and most particularly, to limit \nfreedom of speech in political debate about the policy and political \nfuture of the United States.\n  At the time of an identical debate last fall, George Will wrote, and \nI wish to quote him in full:\n\n       Nothing in American history--not the left's recent campus \n     ``speech codes,'' nor the right's depredations during 1950s \n     McCarthyism, or the 1920s ``red scare,'' not the Alien and \n     Sedition Acts of the 1790s--matches the menace to the First \n     Amendment posed by campaign ``reforms'' advancing under the \n     protective coloration of political hygiene.\n\n  Mr. Will concludes by saying:\n\n       As Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, and \n     others filibuster to block enlargement of the Federal speech-\n     rationing machinery, theirs is arguably the most important \n     filibuster in American history.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has just said that fewer \npeople vote because of cynicism about the 1996 campaign and the blatant \nviolations of the present law that took place during the course of that \ncampaign.\n  Mr. President, the cure for the blatant violations of present \ncampaign laws is not a new set of laws. It is the simple enforcement of \nthe laws we already have. Laws, incidentally, that were passed in 1974 \nwith arguments identical to those that are being made here today; laws \nthat themselves seem to have been accompanied by a drop-off in the \nnumber of people who are voting.\n  If we simply look at our history and desire to have more people \nvoting, we would presumably repeal all of those laws and go back to a \npre-1974 situation in which at least we had a greater participation in \nour election process.\n  So what do the proponents today ask us? They ask us to limit severely \nthe right of political parties to raise money and to use that money in \norder to express the ideas that motivate those political parties. In \nother words, they ask us to limit the ability to communicate the \nfreedom of speech of those organized parties that have spanned most of \nthe history of the United States, parties that most academics studying \nour political system say are too weak, not too strong. Most academics \nin this field feel that party discipline ought to be stronger rather \nthan weaker. Yet the heart of McCain-Feingold is the philosophy that \nparties should not be able to communicate their ideas to people during \nelection campaigns in any significant fashion whatever.\n\n  The predecessors of those who make these arguments today successfully \nlimited the ability of political candidates for Congress to raise and \nto spend money and now criticize the very condition that they caused by \nsaying that candidates spend too much time in raising money. It is a \nparadoxical set of arguments to say that the very cause that we \nespoused has caused candidates to spend too much time campaigning or \nraising money for campaigning and therefore we ought to have more laws \nof exactly the same type.\n  Mr. President, whatever the constitutionality of limiting the right \nof people to contribute to political parties and the right of political \nparties to solicit contributions, it can hardly be proposed with a \nstraight face that we can limit the right of third parties, of \nindependent organizations, to express their ideas on matters of \npolitics and on candidates and on incumbents at any time, much less in \nthe 30 or 60 days preceding an election. There is simply no indication \nin any decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that such \nlimitations are appropriate. There is also no indication that such \nlimitations are a good idea.\n  I wonder what the editorial page of the New York Times would say if \nthe proposal before the Senate today said that newspapers would be \nlimited to one or two editorials about election-year politics and none \nat all in the 30 days before an election. Yet, Mr. President, unless \nyou can say in order to make elections fair, in order to give each \ncitizen an equal right to participate, we can and should tell the New \nYork Times, and every other daily newspaper in the country, all \ntelevision networks and television stations, that they should shut up \nin the 30 days before an election takes place and let the election work \nits way out on the basis of whatever individual candidates say--\nunamplified, of course, by any mass media--and that even outside of \nthat period of time they should be strictly limited in the number of \nstatements that they ought to make about politics because, after all, \nthey have a much larger voice than does an individual citizen.\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\n  We know exactly what they would say. They would say that is a blatant \nviolation of the first amendment of the Constitution. They would go to \ncourt and they would get any such statute immediately thrown out. But \nif the New York Times and NBC and an individual television station are \nfree to communicate their ideas about politics and about political \ncandidates without restraint, how, then, can an organization, whether \nit is the Christian Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union, a \nliberal or a conservative organization, be so limited? And why, if an \norganization of that nature can't be limited, should a political party \nbe limited in what it can say and how it raises money in order to make \nany such statement?\n  Mr. President, all we have done is to make political speech less \nresponsible rather than more responsible. We limited the amount of \nmoney candidates can get, and candidates, of course, can be called to \naccount for any misstatement they make in a political campaign or for \nany unfair tactics. We now propose to limit the parties to which those \ncandidates belong, so we force those who are interested in the \npolitical system whose lives are affected by the political system to \noperate entirely independently of parties or of candidates and to make \nwhatever statements they wish for which those candidates and parties \nwill, of course, bear any responsibility whatever.\n  Finally, I find it extraordinarily curious that the proponents of \nthis bill--most recently the Senator from Minnesota--will say that the \noriginal proposal before the Senate by the majority leader, Senator \nLott, is a poison pill. Now, what is that poison pill? It is the \ntotally constitutional and totally valid requirement that a labor \norganization to which people in given bargaining units must belong and \nto which they must contribute can only use the dues and the payments of \ntheir members for political purposes with permission. Now, this is the \none area which is not only obviously constitutional but obviously \ndesirable. Why should any American, why should any American have his or \nher money used by an organization to which he or she is required to \nbelong to promote an idea and candidates with which whom he or she \ndisagrees?\n\n  I do have in this connection, Mr. President, one advantage over, I \nbelieve, every other Member in this body, except for my own colleague \nfrom the State of Washington. In 1992, at a time in which Bill Clinton \nwon the State of Washington in his Presidential campaign, the people of \nmy State passed Initiative No. 134 by a 73-27 percent margin.\n  Initiative 134 simply said that neither an employer nor a labor \norganization could withhold a portion of a worker's wages or salary for \npolitical contributions without receiving written permission from that \nworker each and every year--the so-called ``poison pill,'' which is \nanathema to Members on the other side. Seventy-three percent of the \ncitizens of the State of Washington voted for that proposition, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Now, what happened? Let's take one such organization, the Washington \nEducation Association. Immediately after the passage of that \ninitiative, fewer than 20 percent of the members of the Washington \nEducation Association gave that association permission to use their \nmoney for its political purposes. Where it had 45,000 members who were \nconstrained to contribute to its political action committee previously, \nthe figure, after the election was over, was 8,000. Well, that is why \n45 members on the other side of the aisle feel the Lott bill to be a \n``poison pill,'' because it deprives one of their principal supporters \nof the right to force people to contribute to their campaigns. That is \na ``poison pill,'' Mr. President. It is a ``poison pill'' to restrict \npolitical parties the right to speak and the right to effectively \nparticipate in politics, or even to restrict certain other \norganizations.\n  Mr. President, I understand--and perhaps the Senator from Kentucky \nwill enlighten me on this--that the United Kingdom had similar \nrestrictions to those proposed here with respect to issue advocacy. If \nmy understanding is correct, the court of the European Community has \njust determined that those restrictions were a violation of human \nrights; is that correct? I ask the Senator from Kentucky that question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Washington is entirely correct. Just \nlast Thursday, February 19, the European Court of Human Rights ruled \nthat laws banning ordinary citizens from spending money to promote or \ndenigrate candidates in an election campaign was a breach of human \nrights. That was in response to a group in England that brought the \nsuit with the argument that their voices were essentially quieted, \neliminated, by British law that prohibited them from speaking, in \neffect, in proximity to the election. So the Europeans are heading in \nthe direction of issue advocacy, which is something, I say to my friend \nfrom Washington--and I see my friend and colleague from Utah on his \nfeet as well--that the Supreme Court anticipated in the Buckley case.\n  Mr. GORTON. I was simply going to ask that question of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. Does the Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo not deal \nwith this question of issue advocacy?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Absolutely. The Senator is correct. Our friends on the \nother side of the aisle act as if issue advocacy is a recent invention \nthat has been sort of conjured up and not previously thought of. The \nCourt said in the Buckley case, in laying out the terms for express \nadvocacy, which is the category directly in support of a candidate, \nwhich is in the category of FEC money, so-called hard money--they were \ndefining express advocacy, and by definition pointing out that ``it \nwould naively underestimate the ingenuity and the resourcefulness of \npersons and groups to believe that they would have much difficulty \ndevising expenditures that skirted the restrictions on express advocacy \nof election or defeat, but nevertheless benefited the candidate's \ncampaign.''\n  Just one other quote from that same Buckley case: ``The distinction \nbetween discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or \ndefeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.'' \nThat was the Supreme Court 22 years ago. ``Candidates, especially \nincumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative \nproposals and governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on \nthe basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns \nthemselves generate issues of public interest.''\n  What is the Court saying? They are saying, in effect, that there is \nthis whole category of discussion in this country that, under the first \namendment, citizens are entitled to engage in, whether candidates like \nit or not. I mean, the whole assumption of the argument on the other \nside is that somehow the candidates have a right to control the \nelection, control the discourse, in this selected period right before \nthe election. Well, the Court anticipated that. They have already dealt \nwith it. You clearly can't do it. We don't own these elections. \nBesides, as my friend from Washington pointed out, nobody is suggesting \nthat the newspapers shut up during that period of time. Obviously, this \nwould enhance their power dramatically.\n\n  Now, I will stipulate and concede that all of us candidates don't \nlike all of this discourse that we don't control. Sometimes there are \npeople coming in trying to help us and we think they are botching the \njob. Sometimes people are trying to hurt us, and that is particularly \noffensive. But it is absolutely clear that we cannot, by statute, shut \nall these people up, cleanse the process of all of this discussion, and \ncontrol the campaign.\n  Mr. GORTON. If I may conclude, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nthose comments. In reflecting back on the article from which I read \nexcerpts by George Will, if we had detailed Congressional Records of \nwhat was said in Congress in 1797 and 1798, at the time of the Alien \nand Sedition Act, I think we would see a philosophy quite similar to \nthe philosophy that is being expressed by the proponents of McCain-\nFeingold: People aren't smart enough to know what ought to be said or \nnot said or to sort out the quality of what is being said and not said, \nunless we here in Congress tell them who can say it, when they can say \nit, and how much of it they can say. This bill, under those \ncircumstances, Mr. President, does have distinguished antecedents, the \nmost significant of which is the Alien and Sedition Act.\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, perhaps we have reached a new low in the \ndebate on the McCain-Feingold bill, which has been characterized as a \n``human rights violation'' and the ``Alien and Sedition Act.''\n  Perhaps the Senator from Maine can bring us back to the real \ndiscussion here. I yield her such time as she requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the time has come to strike an important \nblow for our democracy by making some limited, but urgently needed, \nrepairs to our campaign finance laws.\n  Mr. President, the legislation currently pending before this body is \ndramatically different from the original McCain-Feingold bill, which I \ncosponsored and supported. It does not seek to radically alter how we \nfinance our campaigns. Indeed, I submit that it does not alter at all \nthe basic framework that Congress established more than two decades \nago.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, the bill before us today is vitally \nimportant.\n  Before us today is a bill designed to close election law loopholes \nthat undermine the protections the American people were promised in the \naftermath of Watergate. Unlike the prior version of the bill, it will \nnot make new reforms to our campaign finance system. Rather, it will \nmerely restore prior reforms.\n  Let me be more specific, Mr. President. Gone from S. 25 are the \nprovisions intended to create a different system for financing \ncampaigns. Gone are the voluntary limits on campaign spending. Gone is \nthe free TV time. Gone is the discounted TV time. Gone is the reduction \nin PAC limits.\n  Most of these reforms continue to be very important, and they are \nreforms to which I remain personally committed. But in the interest of \nsecuring action on the major abuses in the current system, we, the \nproponents of the McCain-Feingold proposal, have agreed to significant \ncompromises.\n  What, then, is left? The principal purpose of today's bill is to \nclose two immense loopholes that have recently been exploited to evade \nthe restrictions and the requirements of current law. I refer, of \ncourse, to soft-money contributions and bogus issue ads.\n  It is fair to ask whether these are, in fact, loopholes or whether \nthey are practices that were contemplated when our election laws were \nenacted in the 1970s. To be more specific, when Congress put a $1,000 \nlimit on campaign contributions, was it intended that individuals could \nmake unlimited contributions to political parties that, often following \na circuitous route, would wind up financing ads clearly designed to \nhelp or to harm particular candidates? Clearly, Mr. President, the \nanswer is no. Similarly, when Congress established political action \ncommittees as a legitimate and needed mechanism for unions, \ncorporations, and other groups to contribute to campaigns, did it \nintend that these entities could nevertheless also make unlimited \nexpenditures for political attack ads as long as certain words were \navoided and some reference, however flimsy, was made to an issue? \nAgain, the answer to this question is obviously no, and history bears \nout this conclusion.\n  Go back to the early 1980s when soft money was used only for party \noverhead and organization expenses, and you will find that \ncontributions totaled only a few million dollars. By contrast, in the \nlast election cycle, when soft money took on its current role, these \ncontributions exceeded $250 million.\n  Bogus issue ads were such a small element in the past, that it is \nimpossible to find reliable estimates on the amounts expended on them. \nUnfortunately, that is no longer the case, and these expenditures have \nnow become worthy of study. The most prominent of these studies \nestimates that as much as $150 million was spent on bogus issue ads in \n1995 and 1996.\n  Mr. President, simple logic also shows that soft money, as it is \ncurrently used, and bogus issue ads could not have been intended by \nthose who drafted our election laws. There would have been little \npurpose in limiting contributions to candidates if unlimited money \ncould be given to parties to run ads effectively promoting those \ncandidates. There would have been little purpose in placing monetary \nlimits on contributions to and by PACs, as well as subjecting them to \nreporting requirements, if the entities for which they were designed \ncould avoid all of that by simply running issue ads.\n  Mr. President, some may still ask whether any of this matters. Why \nshould we be concerned if the campaign contribution limits have been \nrendered a sham by unlimited soft-money donations? Why should we care \nif the PAC safeguards have been eviscerated by bogus issue ads?\n  Starting with soft money, one need only consider the situation of the \nHudson Band of Chippewa Indians, an impoverished tribe in the State of \nWisconsin. Mr. President, this tribe has every reason to believe and \nevery reason to suspect that the denial of their casino application was \ndriven by the expectation of large soft-money donations by the wealthy \ntribes who opposed them.\n  Allowing such unlimited contributions subverts the proper operation \nof government or at least creates the appearance that it has been \nsubverted. It is a sign of how extensive the corrupting effect has \nbecome that even Native Americans believe they must play the soft money \nto participate in our democracy.\n  The situation with bogus issue ads is not better. That practice \nundermines the two major objectives of our election laws, namely, \nplacing limits on contributions and disclosing the identity of those \nmaking the contributions. Without such disclosure, we lose \naccountability. A recent study found that as accountability in \npolitical communications declines, levels of misinformation and deceit \nrise. Thus, it is no surprise that bogus issue ads almost always carry \na negative message, something which all in this body purport to decry. \nThe question is--are we willing to do something about it?\n  In my view, it is imperative that we do something real about these \nproblems. Mr. President, I spent much of my first year as a Member of \nthis body listening to endless hours of testimony before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee about the campaign finance practices in \nthe 1996 elections. While reasonable people can disagree on the \nsolutions, those hearings demonstrated beyond any doubt that the \ncurrent system is in shambles precisely as a result of the loopholes I \nhave described.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly comment on the argument that S. 25 \nwould violate the first amendment. I personally do not believe that to \nbe the case, but more important, there are scores of constitutional \nscholars who support that conclusion. But the reality is that we can \nplay the game of dueling law professors forever, and it will not \nresolve the issue.\n  We are dealing with an area of great uncertainty. Indeed, in the \nseminal case of Buckley v. Valeo, a majority of the Supreme Court \nJustices could not agree on a single opinion. On the subject of what \nconstitutes issue advocacy, Federal Courts of Appeals have handed down \nconflicting decisions. Thus, no member of this body can say with \ncertainty how the Supreme Court will decide the issue. Our role is to \ncraft election laws that strengthen our democracy, knowing that the \nSupreme Court and the Supreme Court alone will ultimately determine the \nconstitutionality of our actions.\n  It is also essential to eliminate two myths about this bill. It will \nnot stop any American, whether acting as an individual or as part of a \ngroup, from running ads advocating for or against a position on any \nissue. It will also not stop any American, whether acting as an \nindividual or as part of a group, from advocating for or against the \nelection of a candidate, as long as the contribution limits and \nreporting requirements of our election laws are satisfied. Statements \nto the contrary are false, and their constant repetition does not make \nthem true.\n  Let me close, Mr. President, by returning to my original point. When \nI ran for a seat in this body, I advocated a major overhaul in our \ncampaign finance laws. Regrettably, that goal must await another day. \nThe challenge before us today is far more modest. Are we prepared to \nclose loopholes that subvert the intent of the election laws that we \nenacted more than two decades ago? Are we willing to restore to the\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\nAmerican people the campaign finance system that rightfully belongs to \nthem?\n  I sincerely hope, Mr. President, that at the end of this debate, the \nanswer will be yes and that the Senate will take an initial step on the \nroad to restoring public trust in government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky and I \nthank my colleagues for this debate. Let me make a personal point at \nthe beginning of my comments. While I disagree quite heartily with the \nposition taken on behalf of those who support McCain-Feingold, I do not \nchallenge their integrity or their motives. I believe that they are \nacting on the basis of the highest motives, that they honestly believe \nthat this legislation would, in fact, be good for our political system \nand be good for the Republic as a whole. I disagree most heartily with \nthat position and I do my best to try to convince them that the course \nthey are on, however well meaning and well motivated, is, in fact, \ndangerous and threatening of our first amendment rights.\n  I learned today on the floor that in Europe it has been determined \nthat if we went down this road we would be violating basic human \nrights, according to the European court. I am delighted to know that \nthe Europeans have that much common sense. Clearly, the United States \nSupreme Court has made that clear and we in this body should not shirk \nour constitutional responsibility.\n  I was somewhat distressed to hear the comment that the Supreme Court \nand only the Supreme Court can determine what the Constitution has to \nsay about this. I think we have a responsibility to pay attention to \nthe Constitution in this body itself and not burden the Supreme Court \nwith laws that are clearly unconstitutional. There is always the chance \none of them might slip through. A court might not be appropriately \nattentive when a case comes before them, and we get unconstitutional \nlegislation. We are the first line of defense as far as the first \namendment in the Constitution is concerned, and we should take that \nresponsibility very seriously and not say, ``Oh, well, let's pass a law \nbecause it sounds good, let's pass a law because the New York Times \nwill give us a good editorial, and the Supreme Court will bail us out \nby declaring it unconstitutional.'' That is a very dangerous position \nto take and I want to do my best to see to it that the first line of \ndefense of the first amendment is drawn here in this body and \nmaintained here so that the Supreme Court can pay attention to other \nissues.\n  I want to address the two points that my friend from Maine talked \nabout, soft money contributions and bogus issue ads. Let me reverse the \norder and talk about the first one, the bogus issue ads. She suggests, \nand I'm sure sincerely and honestly she believes, that bogus issue ads \nhave come as a result of an attempt to get around the Watergate \nreforms. In fact, bogus issue ads have been with us since the beginning \nof the Republic and they are a free exercise of first amendment rights \nby Americans pre-Watergate, post-Watergate, and frankly post McCain-\nFeingold. Americans will find a way around that even if the Supreme \nCourt were to allow McCain-Feingold to stand, should we pass it.\n  One of the most vivid memories I have in politics is, as a 17-year-\nold high school student, watching my father, who was running for his \nfirst term in this body, standing in the living room of my grandmother, \nhis mother, holding a newspaper and saying, ``I can handle my enemies \nbut, Lord, protect me from my friends''--a newspaper attacking the \nincumbent Senator from Utah, Elbert Thomas, as a Communist. And my \nfather, trying to run his own campaign on other issues, was terribly \ndistressed by this four-page attack on his opponent. There are those \nwho wrote about that election after it was over who blamed my father \nfor that rag. One of the professors from whom I took classes at the \nUniversity of Utah, in the political science department, wrote an \nextensive article in the Western Political Quarterly in which he called \nthe 1950 Senate race the dirtiest in Utah history, and blamed my father \nfor calling his opponent a Communist and smearing him. My father had \nabsolutely nothing to do with that particular publication and had no \ncontrol over it. Mr. President, 1950 was clearly pre-Watergate. It was \nclearly pre- the reforms that the Senator from Maine hopes to \nreestablish here.\n  However distasteful it was, however reprehensible it may have been, \nit was well within the rights of the first amendment guaranteed to the \npeople who put up the money, published the paper, and distributed it. \nAs the Senator from Kentucky indicated, we don't like independent \nexpenditure ads. We want to control them. They make us mad--many times \nfrom our friends, many times from our opponents. But they are part of \nthe price we pay for a free press and free speech in this country and \nI, for one, am not willing, in the name of shutting down that kind of \nan ad, to damage the first amendment right that everyone has, including \nthe first amendment right to be stupid, the first amendment right to be \noutrageous, the first amendment right to say inflammatory kinds of \nthings. I think that right is precious and the line to protect it must \nbe drawn here in the Senate and not let us wait until we get to the \nSupreme Court.\n\n  Now, the second issue, the issue of soft money contributions. Like \nthe Senator from Maine, I sat on the Governmental Affairs Committee. I \nheard the testimony. Maybe I heard some different testimony than that \nwhich she heard, but one of the things that struck me most clearly was \ntestimony from someone not of my party, not of my political persuasion, \nsomeone on the liberal end of the spectrum, who made this point \nhistorically. When Lyndon Johnson was President of the United States \nand prosecuting the war in Vietnam in a way that outraged huge numbers \nof our citizens to the point of protests in the streets, he was \nchallenged in the electoral process within his own party by one brave \nMember of this body, Eugene McCarthy. McCarthy went to New Hampshire \nand took on an incumbent President within his own party, an unheard of \nkind of thing. He didn't win that primary but he came close. He came a \nclose enough second that he shook LBJ to the point that LBJ \nsubsequently left the race. How was the McCarthy campaign financed? It \nwas financed with five wealthy individuals, each one of whom put up \n$100,000 apiece. And in 1968, $100,000 went a lot farther than it does \nin 1998.\n  In a way, he brought the Government down, not because he had $500,000 \nto spend but because he had a message that the people of New Hampshire \nresponded to. Without the $500,000, however, the message could not have \nbeen heard. He and the others who were involved with him, who testified \nbefore our committee, said, ``If we had been limited to $1,000 apiece, \nMcCarthy would never have been able to challenge Lyndon Johnson. If we \nhad been limited to that kind of restriction, history would have been \nchanged.'' And he quoted, I believe it was Senator McCarthy, who said, \n``The Founding Fathers did not say: To this we pledge our lives, our \nfortunes up to $1,000, and our sacred honor.'' They went the whole way \nand the Constitution gives them the opportunity to go the whole way.\n  We have put limitations on. I happen to think that is a mistake, and \nI have talked about that. But we have allowed political parties to \nflourish by unlimited contributions to those parties. That is the \nterrible, awful, debilitating, corrosive soft money that we are talking \nabout: The ability to challenge an incumbent President, the ability to \nexpand political discourse at a time of great national concern over the \ndirection in which an administration is going.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to continue for another 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 2 more minutes to the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized. The \nSenate will suspend until we get order in the Senate.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am not a lawyer. Sometimes that is an advantage, \nsometimes it is a disadvantage. But I happen to have devoted a good \nportion of my life to trying to understand the Constitution and \nunderstand the intentions of the Founding Fathers.\n  I don't know what was fully intended by the passing of the Watergate \nreforms, because, frankly, that was a period of time when I was leaving \nWashington instead of paying attention to what was going on here. But I \ndo know what was intended in the passing of the first amendment. I do \nknow what was intended in the creation of the Constitution.\n  I believe that McCain-Feingold falls on two overwhelmingly \nsignificant points: No. 1, and most important, it is clearly \nunconstitutional; and No. 2, equally crippling, it is totally \nunworkable. On those two bases, I am happy and proud to be part of the \ngroup that is opposing it here today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I want to follow up on some \nobservations by my friend from Utah. The underlying bill seeks to \nabolish what is pejoratively referred to as ``soft money.'' In fact, as \nthe Senator from Utah and I know, soft money should not be a pejorative \nterm. It is, in fact, everything that isn't hard money. Our two great \npolitical parties, of course, are interested in who gets to be Governor \nin Utah; occasionally, they are interested in who gets to be mayor of \nSalt Lake City. They are, in fact, Federal parties.\n  So, in the aftermath of McCain-Feingold, you would have a complete \nfederalization of the American political process, I guess putting the \nFEC in charge of the city council races in Salt Lake City.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I might interrupt.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Salt Lake City has nonpartisan races. There are no \nlimits on contributions and there are no limits on spending, and \nsomehow we have managed to maintain the pattern of decent mayors \nthrough that whole situation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. A good point, I say to my friend from Utah.\n  It has been suggested by some around here that party soft money could \nsimply be abolished, and that is what this underlying bill seeks to do. \nI doubt that, Mr. President.\n  A law professor at Capital University in Columbus, OH, who is an \nexpert in this field, in a recent article in a Notre Dame Law School \nJournal of Legislation was pointing out with regard to the prospects of \neliminating non-Federal money for the parties by Federal legislative \naction and said, in referring to the Colorado case in 1996:\n\n       The precedent makes clear that political parties have the \n     rights to engage in issue advocacy--\n\n  Which is funded by the so-called ``soft money''--\n\n     as other entities. In Colorado Republican Party v. FEC, the \n     Republican Party ran a series of advertisements critical of \n     the Democratic nominee for a U.S. Senate seat from Colorado. \n     At the time the ads ran, the Republican nominee had not been \n     determined, and the three candidates were actively seeking \n     that nomination.\n\n  That was the fact situation in that case.\n\n       The Court rejected the FEC's position that a political \n     party could not make expenditures independently of a \n     candidate's campaign.\n\n  Independent expenditures are hard money; issue advocacy is soft \nmoney. So let's get them divided.\n\n       The Court held that the facts quite clearly showed that the \n     defendant Republican Party expenditures in the race were \n     independent of any candidate's campaign and so could not be \n     limited as contributions to the candidate's campaign \n     directly. If a political party can conduct express advocacy--\n     that is independent and hard money--if a political party can \n     conduct express advocacy campaigns independently of its \n     candidates, surely it can conduct an issue ad campaign \n     independently of its candidates. The Colorado Republican \n     Federal Campaign Committee held that political parties' \n     rights under the first amendment are equal to--equal to--\n     those of other groups and entities: ``The independent \n     expression of a political party's views is `core' First \n     Amendment activity no less than is the independent \n     expression of individuals, candidates or other political \n     committees.'' In reaching this conclusion, the Court was \n     not breaking new ground, but again merely following \n     established law granting parties the right to speak on \n     political issues.\n\n  I cite that, Mr. President, just to make a point in discussion with \nmy friend from Utah that there is virtually no chance the courts would \nsay that the Congress, by legislation, can prevent the parties from \nengaging in issue advocacy. We already know they can engage in \nindependent expenditures which are financed by so-called ``hard \nmoney,'' Federal money. Everybody else in America can engage in issue \nadvocacy. The Senator from Utah can do it by himself. He can do it as \npart of a group. There is no change. The courts are going to say \nparties can engage in issue advocacy.\n  I commend my friend from Utah for his statement. He is absolutely \ncorrect, there is no chance that this bill, were it to be passed, which \nit will not be passed, but if it were to be passed, would be held \nconstitutional. In fact, the courts are going in the opposite \ndirection, in the direction of more and more political speech, more and \nmore discourse, more and more discussion.\n  We do not have a problem in this country because we have too little \npolitical discussion. That is not a problem. Even though, as the \nSenator from Utah wisely pointed out, we frequently do not like the \ncontent, the tone of the campaign, it is not ours to control. Nobody \nsaid we had ownership rights over the campaign. Lots of people are \nentitled to have their say.\n  I thank my friend from Utah for his fine statement. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. President, I have spent so much time on this subject in the last \nyear that I think I can just clear my throat in 5 minutes. But I will \ntry to do more than that, and I hope to have additional opportunities \nto comment as the debate goes on.\n  I want to speak against the underlying proposal, the so-called \nPaycheck Protection Act, and in favor of the substitute McCain-Feingold \nproposal that is before us. The Paycheck Protection Act, very briefly, \nis a very disappointing response to the many problems the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee uncovered in its recently concluded \ninvestigation. In fact, I was very surprised to see my dear friend, the \nmajority leader, say yesterday, ``I have laid down a bill that embodies \nthe most important campaign finance reform of all, paycheck \nprotection.''\n  Frankly, there is not a single problem, with all respect, looked at \nduring our investigation in the Governmental Affairs Committee that \nwould have been solved with the Paycheck Protection Act. ``Paycheck \nProtection'' doesn't touch foreign money, it doesn't touch the use of \npublic buildings for fundraising, it doesn't touch the problem of \nunregulated and undisclosed attack ads, and it doesn't touch the abuse \nof tax-exempt status by tax-exempt organizations.\n  In fact, the underlying bill, the Paycheck Protection Act, is a \nresponse to a problem that doesn't exist. No one is forced to join a \nunion, and under the Beck decision, nonunion members already have an \nabsolute right to ask for a refund of the amount they paid the union in \nagency fees that went to political activities of which they do not \napprove. Union members, for their part, voluntarily join an \norganization, and they express a desire to have their leadership \nrepresent them, both with management and more generally. If they \ndisagree with the way in which the leadership of the union is spending \nthat money for political or legislative purposes, they have the same \nright that shareholders have who are disgruntled with the activities of \nthe leadership of a corporation. Shareholders can launch a proxy fight. \nDisgruntled union members can try to change the leadership of the \nunion. There is a democratic process dramatically, intensely supervised \nby the Federal Government itself.\n\n  In fact, I suggest that the Paycheck Protection Act as before us is \nnot only\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\na solution to a problem that doesn't exist, it is itself a problem \nbecause it is of doubtful constitutionality. This bill says to a union \nthat before it can involve itself in political activities, before it \ncan spend its own general treasury funds, contributed by dues-paying \nmembers, not just on political campaigns but, by definition in the \nunderlying bill, in attempting to influence legislation, the union \nleadership needs the separate prior written voluntary authorization of \neach one of their members.\n  To me, that comes close to being a prior restraint on the exercise by \na labor union of the rights it receives under the First Amendment to \npetition our Government to attempt to influence legislation and to free \nassociation. If that is not the case, it certainly raises questions of \nequal protection, because there is no similar restriction put on any \nother organization that I know of, including particularly corporations. \nTrue, there is language in the paycheck protection bill that deals with \ncorporations, but by not even trying to cover shareholders, it is \nplainly not at all equivalent to the restriction on the expenditure of \nunion dues.\n  On the other side, McCain-Feingold, with appreciation to its two \ncosponsors--a great example of the kind of bipartisanship that should \nexist around here--is a practical response to the problems that came \nbefore the Governmental Affairs Committee. The arguments against it, \nwith all respect, are premised on this strange twist of principle that \nmoney is speech.\n  I think it was my friend, the junior Senator from Georgia, who said \nlast year, if money is speech under the Constitution, that must mean \nthat the more money you have, the greater is your right to free speech. \nIs that what the Framers of the Constitution meant when they said that \nall of us are created equal, we have an equal right, unfettered, to \npetition our Government? I don't think so. Against that specious \nprinciple, money is speech, they have undercut the sacred principle of \nequality of access to our Government.\n  So I say the soft money ban and the other limits in the McCain-\nFeingold proposal are constitutional. In the Buckley decision, the \nCourt made it clear that it is constitutional to limit contributions to \ncampaigns, and this ban on soft money is just another way to do that.\n  The fact is, as Chairman Thompson of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee said during our proceedings, effectively, there is no \ncampaign finance law anymore in the United States of America, and the \nreason why the limits on individual contributions, the prohibitions on \ncorporate and union money that are in the law are no longer effective \nis mostly because of soft money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair for the very gracious way in which \nhe conveyed that message, which is very typical of the occupant of the \nChair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nvery much for his remarks. I note the emergence of a new argument that \nis in effect that the Supreme Court of the United States is \nincompetent, that they will not be able to recognize the constitutional \nproblems in any bill and, therefore, we have to make sure that every \npiece of our bill raises absolutely no constitutional questions. I \nthink that is a somewhat absurd proposition.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, too, join in commending Senator \nFeingold, Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman and the others for their \npersistence and perseverance in advancing sensible and responsible \ncampaign finance reform to the U.S. Congress, and, hopefully, we will \naddress it in a serious way as they have addressed this issue and do so \nin the next few days.\n  I will speak for a few moments about the underlying bill that is \nbeing proposed, and I suggest that this bill really is a sham in terms \nof proposing to protect the interests of American workers.\n  The average American worker earns $12.51 an hour, just over $26,000 a \nyear. These workers want a good retirement, a decent education for \ntheir children, safe neighborhoods and quality health care. But how can \nthey compete on these issues in the political process when the fat cats \nspend far more in one political fundraiser or in one 30-second \npolitical ad than the average worker earns in a year?\n  We must return election campaigns to the people, in which all voters \nare equal, no matter what their income, what job they hold or where \nthey live.\n  The current system is a scandal, and Democrats are ready to reform it \nright now. Every Democratic Senator--every single one--supports the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance bill. The burden now rests squarely \nwith the Republican Party. It is up to Republicans to decide whether \nCongress will reform the broken campaign finance laws or continue the \nunseemly influence of special interests in American politics.\n  So far, all the Republican leadership in Congress proposes is more \nmoney in politics, not less. They want more money from their special \ninterest friends. They want to silence working families and the labor \nunions for speaking up on issues they care about. That is what the \nRepublican leadership calls campaign finance reform.\n  The Republican proposal purports to help working families by \nregulating how labor unions pay for their participation in the \npolitical process. But for working families, this proposal is grossly \nunfair. It is the centerpiece of an agenda by big corporations and the \nright wing of the Republican Party to silence working families, not \nhelp them.\n  The Republican leadership proposal is not reform but revenge--revenge \nfor the role of the labor movement in the 1996 campaign. It imposes a \ngag rule on American workers, and it should be defeated.\n  The bill is a sham. It does not protect the workers. It is designed \nto advance an antiworker, antilabor, antiunion agenda. It does not \nprotect individual rights, as its sponsor claims. It singles out \nunions, but does nothing for corporate shareholders or members of other \norganizations.\n\n  In fact, in the 1996 election, corporations outspent labor unions 11 \nto 1. Under the Republican proposal, big tobacco can still use \ncorporate treasury funds to oppose using cigarette tax revenues to \npromote children's health, even if shareholders object. And the \nNational Rifle Association can oppose a ban on cop-killer bullets even \nif NRA members object. But before labor unions can use union funds to \nspeak up for working families, they would have to obtain written \napproval from every union member first.\n  But it does not stop there. The antiworker Republican proposal before \nus today is only part of a larger, big business, right wing campaign \nconspiracy to deny working families a voice in their own Government. \nAlready, proposals virtually identical to this one have been introduced \nin 19 States as ballot initiatives or as State legislation. The same \npeople who fought the minimum wage and want to abolish labor unions--\nthe same people who lead the charge in the Republican party for tax \nbreaks for the rich--are also part of this coordinated nationwide \ncampaign to block workers and their unions at every turn in Washington \nand State capitals everywhere.\n  A recent editorial in a Nevada paper says it clearly as anyone. \nNevada is one of the States where the right wing is pushing these \ninitiatives. And the Reno Gazette journal spoke out against the \nproposal, saying:\n\n       Beware of GOP Foxes in Labor's House. . . . Its main \n     purpose is not to help workers but to weaken Democrats. . . . \n     This petition is not intended to benefit the common man \n     nearly as much as it is intended to benefit one specific \n     class of politicians. . . . So when someone asks you to sign \n     this Republican petition outside your favorite supermarket or \n     elsewhere, think about what is really going on here. The \n     scent of special interest fills the air like a convention of \n     skunks in the hollow.\n\n  This language applies equally to the Paycheck Protection Act that my \nRepublican friends are advocating in the U.S. Senate. The Republican \nproposal is phony reform, and it should be opposed. Far from protecting \nthe American worker, it is a prescription for disaster for millions of \nAmericans and their families. I oppose it. My colleagues on this side \nof the aisle oppose it. I urge every Senator to oppose it.\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\n  Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have proposed sensible reforms to \nban soft money and to crack down on campaign adds by outside interest \ngroups that are nothing more than thinly veiled appeals to defeat \nparticular candidates. These are responsible reforms. And I urge my \ncolleagues to support them.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his statement, and I strongly agree with his description of what \nthis Paycheck Protection Act is all about. It is a poison pill directed \nat only one group in this country, which I think is clearly unfair.\n  Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding to me.\n  Mr. President, when I try to understand the logic of those who oppose \nthis bipartisan campaign finance reform and try to understand their \nthinking, which concludes that both the rich and the poor in America \nshould have the right to purchase millions of dollars in television \ntime, my mind is drawn to a movie, the movie ``Titanic.''\n  What is the link between the opposition to McCain-Feingold and the \nfate of the Titanic? On the Titanic, only 5 percent of the first-class \nwomen passengers drowned; more than 50 percent of all the women in the \nlowest class cabin drowned.\n\n  Now, in the eyes of those who oppose McCain-Feingold, everyone on the \nTitanic had the right to a lifeboat. Unfortunately, they would have to \nconclude, I guess, that those passengers in first-class cabins were \njust better swimmers. In fact, on the Titanic, they locked the doors of \nthe cabin class until all the lifeboats had been opened for first-class \npassengers.\n  It reminds me too of their logic that the rich need to have their \nopportunity to exercise free speech. It reminds me of the old case in \nlaw school or the old story in law school that said the law, in its \ninfinite wisdom, makes it a crime for the wealthy as well as the \nhomeless to sleep under bridges. That gives us an insight, I think, \ninto the thought processes that guide those who oppose this bipartisan \ncampaign finance reform.\n  We have to understand what the result of the current campaign \nfinancing system is. It is a system without rules and without any moral \ngrounding. It is a system heavily weighted in favor of the insiders, \nthe grifters and those middle-age crazy millionaires who just cannot \nget the melody of ``Hail to the Chief'' out of their minds. The flaw in \ntheir thinking in supporting the current campaign system is their \nconclusion that campaign spending limitations restrain speech.\n  I know the Supreme Court reached that decision over 20 years ago. And \nI guess there is some value that the Supreme Court Justices by and \nlarge have never been political candidates. They have not been sullied \nby this nasty process. But that decision and their conclusion lacked \nany grounding in the real world of campaigns.\n  The campaign system we have today, where wealth buys speech, creates \nin fact, if not in law, a restraint on speech more insidious than any \nfrontal assault on the first amendment. We give the candidates of \nmodest means a throat lozenge and a soap box and give the wealthiest \ncandidates the magic lantern of television and all its proven power of \npersuasion. The opponents to McCain-Feingold are blind to this obvious \ndisparity and its consequences.\n  Now in this debate over changing our campaign system, if you stay \ntuned today, and perhaps later in the week, do not be surprised that \nthe ``haves'' in politics are unwilling to concede any ground to the \n``have-nots.''\n  If Machiavelli did not write this axiom, he should have: ``No party \nin power will ever willingly surrender the means by which they came to \npower.''\n  The Republican party is and always has been more adept at \nfundraising. They seldom lose for lack of money, only for lack of \ntalent or ideas. And now we have a situation where eight Republicans \nhave stood up and said that they are for campaign finance reform. They \ndeserve our praise. It took courage for them to do it.\n  John McCain, who has joined Senator Russ Feingold, deserves that \nrecognition, as well as Senators Chafee, Susan Collins, Tim Hutchinson, \nJim Jeffords, Olympia Snowe, Arlen Specter and Fred Thompson. But I \nhope we can rally some more Republican support to join the 45 Democrats \nwho are on the record for real reform.\n  Step back for a minute and ask yourself this question: Is the current \ncampaign system serving America? Not whether it is good for Democrat or \nRepublican incumbents or challengers. Is it serving America?\n  Let me show you two charts to take a look at. This is an interesting \nchart because it shows on this red line the percentage of eligible \nvoters who are actually registered.\n  Back in 1964, 64 percent of eligible voters actually registered. By \n1996, the number was up to 74.4 percent. That is good news, isn't it? \nMore Americans are signing up to vote. We certainly want to encourage \nthat. But look down here at the bottom line. Look at the turnout of \nvoters for Presidential elections. The high number--61.92 percent over \nhere in 1964--look how high it was in comparison to those eligible to \nvote who actually registered, and then look what happens in 1996, 49.08 \npercent actually turned out to vote for President.\n\n  So, 74.4 percent eligible, 49 percent turned out, the lowest \npercentage turnout of eligible voters since 1924. In 1924, the first \nyear when women were allowed to vote, it was a year when it was an \nextraordinary count. There were more eligible women than actually \nvoted. You have to go back to 1830 to find this low a turnout.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from Illinois such time as he \nrequires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you.\n  This chart really brings home the issue what we are faced with. In \n1960, the total amount of money spent in the United States of America \non all Federal, State and local campaigns--$175 million. Watch it grow. \nWatch it grow dynamically until we get to $4 billion, the estimate of \nthe amount spent in 1996 on all political campaigns.\n  But look what is happening to the voters. When we are spending $175 \nmillion, 63 percent of the voters turned out. As we get up to $4 \nbillion in spending, we are down to 49% of the voters showing up for \nthe Presidential election year.\n  If you were running a company and you said to your marketing \ndivision, ``I want you to double the advertising budget and sell more \nof our product,'' and they come back in the next quarter and said, ``We \ndoubled the advertising budget and we're selling fewer products,'' you \nwould have to reach one of two conclusions: something was wrong with \nyour advertising organization or something is wrong with your product. \nIn politics there is something wrong with both.\n  People are sick of our advertising. It is too negative. It is too \nnasty. These drive-by shooting ads that we have, 30-second ads by issue \ngroups you never heard of, at the last minute of a campaign, and \ncandidates, myself included, spending a lot of time groveling and \nbegging for money, that does not help the process. It does not help our \nimage. It does not encourage people to get involved.\n  What McCain-Feingold is about is not just changing the law but \nchanging the attitude of the public toward the political campaigns. And \nunless and until that happens, we face a very serious problem in this \ncountry. What McCain-Feingold goes after in eliminating soft money is \nsomething that has to happen. Soft money is what is left after all of \nthe restrictions on hard money have been applied.\n  For those who are not well versed in the language of politics and \ncampaigns, ``soft money'' can be corporate money, it can be money that \nis given by a person that exceeds any kind of limitation. It can be \nmoney that is used indirectly to help a campaign. And that sort of \nexpenditure has just mushroomed.\n  I am glad that the legislation of Senator Feingold and Senator McCain \nis going to ban soft money. I also think it is critically important \nthey do something about these issues ads. For goodness sakes, as a \ncandidate for the U.S.\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\nSenate, I have to disclose every penny raised and every penny spent. \nAnd when I put an ad on the air, I have to put an allocation at the \nbottom of each ad as to who paid for it and a little mug shot of myself \nso they can see my face.\n  But these groups that appear out of nowhere come in, in the closing \ndays of a campaign, and absolutely blister candidates in the name of \nissue advocacy groups that do not disclose one single item of fact \nabout how they raise their money and how they spent it. Don't believe \nfor a minute that there is some group called the ``Campaign for Term \nLimits'' that is running around shopping centers with kettles and bells \ncollecting money. This is a special interest group, spending literally \nmillions of dollars in our political process to defeat candidates in \nthe name of an issue, and you do not know a thing about them. You do \nnot know if they are funded by the tobacco companies, you do not know \nif they are funded by foreign money, you do not have a clue. That is \nnot fair.\n  What we have in the McCain-Feingold bill is an effort to finally--\nfinally--bring some reality to this process and some sensibility to it. \nAnd it is long overdue. We have to make sure that we have a bustling, \nfree marketplace of ideas. But the evidence is compelling that \npolitical megamergers of special interest groups like the NRA, Right to \nLife, Americans for Tax Reform, Chamber of Commerce, and even the AFL-\nCIO, which has clearly supported more Democrats than Republicans, all \nof these things are driving individuals with limited means and middle-\nrange incomes out of the political process.\n  To argue passionately as we have in America for ``one man, one vote'' \nas a pillar of democracy and ignore the gross disparity of resources \navailable to pursue that vote is elitist myopia.\n  I rise in support of this bill. And I hope that those who do support \nreal campaign finance reform will not fall for proposals and poison \npill amendments which will basically scuttle this effort. We have a \nrare opportunity to win back the American people and their confidence \nin our process. Defeating McCain-Feingold by procedural tricks and any \nother mechanism that they dream up is really not serving the future of \nthis country and the future of our Republic. So I stand in strong \nsupport of McCain-Feingold, and thank my colleague from Wisconsin for \nyielding this time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Illinois for all his \ntremendous help on this issue, and now yield to the Senator from North \nDakota such time as he requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois said much of \nwhat I would like to say. I appreciate very much the leadership of the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, and the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, on this issue.\n  We had a lot of hearings last year about campaign finance reform: 31 \ndays of hearings, 240 depositions, about 50 public witnesses, $3.5 \nmillion, 87 staff people. We learned about all kinds of abuses with \nsoft money and attack ads thinly disguised as issue advertising.\n  Well, here we have on the floor of the Senate today a piece of \nlegislation that says, ``Let us reform the system we have for financing \ncampaigns.''\n  One of the important pieces of this reform, the centerpole for the \ntent, in my judgment, is the ban on soft money. Now, what is soft \nmoney? People who are not involved in political campaigns may not know \nwhat this term soft money means. It is the political equivalent of a \nSwiss bank account. Soft money is like a Swiss bank account. It is \nwhere somebody takes money that is often secret, from an undisclosed \nsource, with nobody knowing where it comes from, how much is there, how \nit got there, and it is used over here in some other device, ostensibly \nto help the political system and not to be involved in Federal \nelections. But what we now know from the range of campaigns that have \ngone on in recent years is soft money is a legalized form of cheating \nthat has been used to affect Federal campaigns all across this country.\n  The total amount of soft money raised is on the rise. In the first 6 \nmonths of the 1993-1994 political cycle, $13 million; the first 6 \nmonths of the 1997-1998 cycle, $35 million. It is going up, up, way up.\n  Some say there is not a problem of campaign finance and we don't need \na reform. Take a look at this political inflation index. At a time when \nwages have risen 13 percent in 4 years, education spending rose 17 \npercent, the spending on politics in this country rose 73 percent. \nThere is too much money in politics.\n  Some say money is speech and we like free speech. That is the \npolitical golden rule. I guess those who have the gold make the rules.\n  I suppose if I was part of a group that had a lot more money than \nanybody else I suppose there would be an instinct deep inside to try to \npersuade you to say this situation is great. We not only have more \nmoney but we have access to more money than anyone else in the history \nof civilization. Why would we want to change the rules? We ought to \nchange the rules because this system is broken and everybody in this \ncountry knows it and understands it.\n  Let me go through some examples to describe what is happening in this \nsystem. And both political parties have had problems in these areas, \nboth parties. Let me give one example. In 1996, $4.6 million of soft \nmoney went from the Republican National Committee to an organization \ncalled Americans for Tax Reform, $4.6 million. This soft money, then, \ncomes from contributors whose identities are often unknown--they often \ndo not need to be disclosed--contributing money in amounts that would \nbe prohibited under our federal election laws, to influence a Federal \nelection. $4.6 million from a major political party to this \norganization, Americans for Tax Reform. That was four times the total \nbudget of this organization in the previous year.\n  How was the money spent, this soft money raised in large undisclosed \nchunks from sources in many cases prohibited from trying to spend money \nto influence Federal elections? How was it used? To influence Federal \nelections, 150 of them, to be precise--17 million pieces of mail to 150 \ncongressional districts.\n  You say the system isn't broken? Mr. President, $4.6 million? This is \nthe equivalent of a political Swiss bank account. Large chunks of \nmoney, blowing into the system to a group that never has to disclose \nwhat it does with it.\n  And what about the issue ads which Senator Durbin mentioned as well? \nThese issue ads--are they ads that contribute to this political \nprocess? Eighty-one percent of them are negative. They represent the \nslash, burn and tear faction of the political system. Get money, get it \nin large chunks from secret sources and put some issue ads on someplace \nand try to tear somebody down.\n  Let's discuss one group, and one ad in particular. Look at this \nscenario.\n  The Citizens for Republic Education Fund is a tax-exempt organization \nincorporated June 20, 1996, that raised more than $2 million between \nJune and the end of the year in this election year--$1.8 million of \nwhich was raised between October 1 and November 15. They spent $1.7 \nmillion after October 11 and before the election in a matter of a \ncouple of weeks. Remember, these funds are not intended to influence \nFederal elections, but here's all this money being spent in just three \nweeks before the election.\n\n  You be the judge. Consider the following, and then you tell me \nwhether these were intended to influence a Federal election. The vast \nmajority of the money was spent after October 11 in an election year. \nThe group didn't come into existence until June of the election year. \nThe group never had any committees or programs, had no offices, no \nstaff, no chairs, no desks and no telephones. All it had was millions \nof dollars to pump into attack ads.\n  The ads did not advocate on behalf of any one set of issues. Instead, \nthe ads were almost universally tailored to a particular unfavored \ncandidate's perceived flaws, just like any campaign attack ad would be. \nIn fact, you could ask whether they advocate any issues at all.\n  Let me turn to a so-called issue ad.\n\n       Senate [Candidate X] budget as Attorney General increased \n     71 percent. [Candidate X] has taken taxpayer funded junkets \n     to the\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\n     Virgin Islands, Alaska and Arizona, and spent about $100,000 \n     on new furniture. Unfortunately, as the State's top law \n     enforcement official, he's never opposed the parole of a \n     convicted criminal, even rapists and murders. And almost \n     4,000 prisoners have been sent back to prison for crimes \n     committed while they were out on parole. [Candidate X]: \n     Government waste, political junkets, soft on crime. Call \n     [Candidate X] and tell him to give the money back.\n\n  A political ad, paid for with soft money from a political Swiss bank \naccount. It's like a Swiss bank account because it is from a secret \nsource, designed to be used to create attack ads, to be used at \nelection time to influence Federal elections, something that, frankly, \nis supposed to be prohibited by law. But this has now become the \nlegalized form of cheating. In fact, we are not even sure it is legal, \nbut it is being done all across this country and it is being done with \nbig chunks of secret money.\n  In fact, one secret donor put up, I'm told, $700,000 to spend on so-\ncalled issue ads to influence federal campaigns. We don't even know for \ncertain the identity of that person. And that soft money, that big \nchunk of money prohibited from ever affecting Federal races was used in \nthis kind of advertising to directly try and influence Federal \ncampaigns.\n  Now, I just ask the question, is there anyone here who will stand in \nthe Senate with a straight face and say that this isn't cheating? \nAnyone here who will stand with a straight face and say this isn't \ndesigned to affect a Federal election? Anybody think this is fine? Go \nto a friend someplace that has $40 million and say, will you lend us $1 \nmillion, we have these two folks we don't like--one in one State up \nnorth and one in a State down south. We want to put half a million into \neach State and defeat them because they happen to be of a political \npersuasion we don't like, and we don't want them serving in the U.S. \nSenate. If you give us $1 million we will package it in two parts, half \na million into each State. Your name will never be used. No one will \nknow you did it. We will package up these kind of 30-second slash, tear \nand burn political ads and claim they are issue ads and they can be \npaid for with soft money.\n  Does anybody in this body believe this is a process that the American \npeople ought to respect? That this is a process the American people \nthink makes sense? Do we really believe that money is equal to speech \nand that anything that we would do to change the amount and kind of \nmoney spent in the pursuit of any campaign is somehow inhibiting the \npolitical process?\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is that off of your time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The presumption would be we \nwould recess at 12:32.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have 7 minutes, and I do want to reserve \nmy 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do want to make a couple of final points here. We can \ndecide to do one of two things in this Senate on this day or this week. \nWe can decide that campaign finance system in this country is just \nfine, that nothing is wrong with it, that we like the way it works. We \ncan say that we think it has the respect of the American people, that \nwe think this sort of nonsense that goes on is just fine and perfectly \nwithin the rules, that we think that the growth of soft money, the \ngrowth of spending in campaigns in this country is wonderful. We can \nsay we think this explosion in political money reflects the American \npeople's determination to acquire more and more speech, and that we \nthink the American people believe, as some would say, that this system \nworks just fine.\n\n  Or we can decide that something smells in campaign finance, that \nsomething is wrong with campaign financing in this country, that we see \nthe costs of political campaigns are skyrocketing up, up, way up \nbecause we have people who believe they can take secret money and now \nuse it to buy elections. We can decide something is horribly wrong with \nthat, and we can decide that we know the American people know there is \nsomething horribly wrong with that. We can decide that it is in our \nprovince to do something about it, now, today, this week, this month. \nWe in Congress can do something about this. We can do something about \nit without hurting free expression anywhere in this country, and \nanywhere in our political system. No one who supports reform wants to \nrestrict free speech in this country, nor should we do that. But we can \ndecide that this system is out of control, that this system disserves \nour democratic process, and that we must pursue a better way.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have proposed a piece of \nlegislation. Is it perfect? No, it is not. But it is a good piece of \nlegislation. I am a cosponsor. I want this Congress to pass that piece \nof legislation this week, have the House pass it, get to conference and \npass a piece of campaign finance reform that will make the American \npeople proud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. After I use 7 minutes, we go into recess for policy \nluncheons?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Maybe a good place to wrap up the morning discussion, \nwhich I think has been a good one, is to call to the attention of \nMembers of the Senate an NPR morning edition commentary by a woman \nnamed Wendy Kaminer who is a professor at Radcliffe College--not \nexactly a bastion of conservatism. This was NPR's morning edition, \nDecember 3, 1997, on the subject we are debating here today.\n  Professor Kaminer said in her commentary that morning:\n       Protecting the act of spending money as we protect the act \n     of speaking means standing up for the rights of the rich, \n     something not many self-identified progressives are eager to \n     do.\n       But the realization that money controls the exercise of \n     rights is hardly new. Money translates into abortion rights, \n     for example, as well as speech. Indeed, liberals demand \n     Medicaid funding for abortions precisely because they \n     recognize that money insures reproductive choice. Money also \n     insures the right to run for office. Liberal support for \n     reforms that provide minimum public subsidies to candidates \n     is based on an implicit recognition that exercising political \n     speech requires spending money.\n       So proposed public financing schemes are based on the fact \n     that reformers like to deny--the fact that sometimes money \n     effectively equals speech. Reformers who support public \n     financing argue persuasively that candidates with no money \n     have virtually no chance to be heard in the political \n     marketplace. They want to provide more candidates with a \n     financial floor, in order to insure more political speech. It \n     is simply illogical for them to deny that a financial \n     celing--caps on contributions and expenditures--is a ceiling \n     on political speech.\n  It is absurd to deny that that is a cap on political speech. \nProfessor Kaminer went on:\n\n       We need campaign finance reform that respects speech and \n     the democratic process; it would subsidize needy candidates \n     and impose no spending or contribution limits on anyone.\n\n  She says:\n\n       I'm not denying that money sometimes corrupts. It corrupts \n     everything, from politics to religion. But if some clergymen \n     spend the hard-earned money of their followers on fast women \n     and fancy cars, there are others who raise money in order to \n     spend it on the poor. While some politicians seek office for \n     personal gain, others seek to implement ideas, however \n     flawed. Money only corrupts people who are already \n     corruptible. It is terribly naive and misleading for \n     reformers to label their proposals ``clean election laws.'' \n     Dirty politicians who sell access and lie to voters in \n     campaign ads will not suddenly become clean politicians when \n     confronted with limits on contributions and spending.\n       Reformers are guilty of false advertising when they market \n     campaign finance reform as a substitute for integrity. \n     Politicians are corrupted by money when they are \n     unprincipled. Limiting the flow of money to them will not \n     increase their supply of principles. And, in the end, money \n     may be less corrupting than a desire for power, which can \n     engender a willingness to pander rather than lead.\n\n  Finally, she says:\n\n       If I wanted to influence Bill Clinton, I would not write \n     him a check, I'd show him a poll.\n\n  So, Mr. President, it is the denial of the obvious to conclude that \nthe limitation on the financing of campaigns or restrictions on the \nability of individuals or groups to amplify their message is anything \nother than a degrading, a quantification, a limitation of their ability \nto express themselves in our democracy. And the bill that we have \nbefore us essentially seeks to weaken the\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\nparties and make it impossible for outside groups to criticize us in \nproximity to an election.\n  There is no chance the courts would uphold this, but fortunately we \nare not going to give them a chance to rule on this because we are not \ngoing to pass this ill-advised legislation.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  I believe the Senator from Illinois wants to speak on a separate \nsubject. The Senator would need to make a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/24/senate-section/article/S869-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO PENNY SEVERNS OF ILLINOIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Saturday morning, in the early morning \nhours, my wife and I received a telephone call that was a shock to us. \nA dear friend and close political ally of ours, State Senator Penny \nSeverns of Decatur, IL, had succumbed to cancer in the early morning \nhours.\n  I have literally known Penny Severns for over 25 years, since she was \na college student. I followed her political career. We had become close \nand fast friends. The outpouring of genuine warmth and affection for \nPenny that we have heard over the last few days since the announcement \nof her death has been amazing.\n  Penny Severns was 46 years old. A little over 3\\1/2\\ years ago, she \nwas running for Lieutenant Governor in the State of Illinois, and she \ndiscovered during the course of the campaign that she had breast \ncancer. I think most people, upon hearing that they had cancer, would \nstop in their tracks, would not take another day on the job, would head \nfor the hospital and the doctor and say that the rest of this could \nwait. But not Penny Severns. She announced that she was going through \nthe chemotherapy and radiation and then would return to the campaign \ntrail. And she did.\n  I will tell you, in doing that, she inspired so many of us because \nher strength, her caring, her spirit, were just so obvious. She \nfinished that campaign and was reelected to the State Senate and \nannounced last year she was going to run for secretary of state in our \nState of Illinois. She filed her petitions, and within a week or so it \nwas discovered she had another cancerous tumor, and in December she \nwent into the hospital to have it removed. She went through the \nradiation and chemotherapy afterwards and had a very tough time. \nUnfortunately, she succumbed to the cancer in the early morning hours \nlast Saturday.\n\n  It is amazing to me how a young Democratic State Senator like this \ncould attract the kind of friends she did in politics. Penny was not \nwishy-washy; when she believed in something, she stood up for it. Yet, \nif you listened to Republicans and Democrats alike who have come \nforward to praise her for her career, you understand that something \nunique is happening here.\n  There is so much empty praise in politics. We call one another \n``honorable'' when we are not even sure that we are. But in this case, \npeople are coming forward to praise State Senator Penny Severns because \nshe truly was unique, not just because she fought on so many important \npolitical issues and gave all of her strength in doing that, but \nbecause of her last fight, which was her personal fight against cancer, \nand the fact that she just would not give up and would not give in.\n  Breast cancer has taken a toll on her family. She lost a younger \nsister to breast cancer a few years ago, and her twin sister is in \nremission from breast cancer today. Penny dedicated herself, in the \nclosing years of her service, to arguing for more medical research when \nit came to breast cancer--not just for her family, but for everybody. \nThat is part of her legacy. She will be remembered for that good fight \nand so many others.\n  I have to be honest with the Presiding Officer and the other Members. \nI would rather not be here at this moment. I would rather be in \nDecatur, IL, because in just a few hours there will be a memorial \nservice for Penny Severns. My wife will be there, and I wish I could be \nthere, too. But if there is one person in Illinois who would understand \nwhy I had to be here on the campaign finance reform debate, it was \nPenny Severns. I am going to miss her and so will a lot of people in \nIllinois.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Grams, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \ndisappointment as my colleagues waffle on our commitment to allow \nworking Americans to keep a little more of their own money.\n  I rise as well, Mr. President, to make the case for returning any \npotential budget surplus to the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I was shocked to pick up the Washington Times on \nFebruary 18 and find the headline ``Senate GOP leaders give up on tax \ncuts.''\n  Having been elected on a pledge to reduce taxes for the working \nfamilies of my state, the idea that we would so quickly abandon a core \nprinciple of the Republican Party is a folly of considerable \nproportions, one I believe would abandon good public policy.\n  In all the legislative dust that is kicked up in Washington, someone \nhas to consider the impact of high taxes and spending, and speak up for \nthe people who pay the bills: the taxpayers.\n  When the Republican Conference met on February 11 to outline our \nbudget priorities for the coming year, I joined many of my colleagues \nin stressing the need for continued tax relief. I did not leave the \nroom with the belief that we had abandoned the taxpayers.\n  Yet that is precisely what the Conference's ``Outline of Basic \nPrinciples and Objectives'' does, because under the Conference \nguidelines, tax relief for hard-working Americans would be nearly \nimpossible to achieve.\n  Mr. President, since its very beginnings in the 1850s, the Republican \nParty has dedicated itself to the pursuit of individual and states' \nrights and a restricted role of government in economic and social life.\n  In 1856, the slogan of the new party was ``Free Soil, Free Labor, \nFree Speech, Free Man.'' It is still our firm belief that a person owns \nhimself, his labor, and the fruit of his labor, and the right of \nindividuals to achieve the best that is within themselves as long as \nthey respect the rights of others.\n  The fundamental goal of the Republican Party is to keep government \nfrom becoming too big, too intrusive, to keep it from growing too far \nout of control.\n   We constantly strive to make it smaller, waste less, and deliver \nmore, believing that the government cannot do everything for everyone; \nit cannot ensure ``social justice'' through the redistribution of \nprivate income.\n  These two different approaches of governance are indeed a choice of \ntwo futures: A choice between small government and big government; a \nchoice between fiscal discipline and irresponsibility; a choice between \nindividual freedom and servitude; a choice between personal \nresponsibility and dependency; a choice between the preservation of \ntraditional American values versus the intervention of government into \nour family life; a choice of long-term economic prosperity and short-\nterm benefits for special interest groups, at the expense of the \ninsolvency of the nation.\n  I think history has proven that whenever we have stuck to Republican \nprinciples, the people and the nation prosper, freedom and liberty \nflourish; whenever we abandon these principles for short-term political \ngains, it makes matters far worse for both our Party and our country.\n  Here are two examples. Facing a $2 billion deficit and economic \nrecession in 1932, the Hoover Administration approved a plan to \ndrastically raise individual and corporate income taxes.\n  Personal exemptions were sharply reduced and the maximum tax rate \nincreased from 25 percent to 63 percent. The estate tax was doubled, \nand the gift tax was restored. Yet the federal revenue declined and the \nnation was deeply in recession.\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\n  President Reagan took the opposite approach in 1981 when he enacted a \n25 percent across-the-board tax, and again in 1986 when he signed a \nlandmark piece of legislation to reduce the marginal tax rate to a \nsimple, two-rate income tax system: 15 percent and 28 percent.\n  What resulted was nothing short of an economic miracle. Our nation \nexperienced the longest peacetime economic expansion in American \nhistory, the benefits of which we are still enjoying today.\n  Over eight years, real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent and real \nmedian family income grew by $4,000, 20 million new jobs were created, \nunemployment sank to record lows, all classes of people did better, and \nin spite of lower rates, tax revenues increased dramatically.\n  Mr. President, let us not forget the fact that the Republicans gained \ncontrol of Congress in 1994 because we were the champions of the \ntaxpayers--the American people trusted us to carry out our promise when \nwe said, ``Elect a Republican majority and we will work to let you keep \nmore of the money you earned.''\n  The taxpayers elected us with the expectation that Republicans would \nseize every opportunity to lessen the tax burden on America's families.\n  They certainly did not elect Republicans thinking we would be a \ncollaborator of the President's tax-and-spend policies--that we wouldd \nbuild a bigger, more expensive government at the first chance we got \nand completely abandon our promise of tax relief for them.\n  Is this the same Republican majority that arrived in Washington in \nJanuary of 1995, ready to create fundamental change in a government \nthat had enslaved so many working families for so many years?\n  Is this the same Republican majority that promised the American \npeople that there was no turning back to the era of big government and \nhigher taxes? Is this the same Republican majority that I was so proud \nto be part of?\n  It has been tremendously disappointing to me, and I believe the \nmajority of taxpayers, to read the recent comments from those who have \nendorsed the President Clinton's ``save Social Security first'' \ngimmicks and are seeking to eliminate meaningful, achievable tax cuts \nfrom the next fiscal year's budget.\n  As I said before on this floor, if we do not carry out the taxpayers' \nagenda, we may as well pack up our bags and go home, because we will \nhave failed. And the price of that failure will fall on the backs of \nthose we were elected to represent. I believe any retreat from that \npromise would be a terrible mistake.\n  Tax relief is still critical for America for two basic reasons--moral \nand economic.\n  First, there is a moral case to be made for continuing tax cuts.\n  The robust American economy and working Americans, not government \naction, have produced this unprecedented revenue windfall. These \nunexpected dollars have come directly from working Americans--taxes \npaid by consumers, individual labor, and investment income. This money \nbelongs to the American people.\n  Washington should not be allowed to stand first in line to take that \naway from American families, workers, and job creators. It is moral and \nfair that they keep it.\n  We have also heard the argument that we already had a large tax cut \nlast year, so there is no need for more tax cuts. Let me set the record \nstraight.\n  Last year, after spending $225 billion unexpected revenue windfall \nand busting the 1993 budget spending caps to do it, the Republican \nParty delivered tax relief only one-third as large as what we would \npromised in 1994.\n  Those tiny tax cuts--no more than slivers, really--amounted to less \nthan one cent of every dollar the federal government takes from the \ntaxpayers. Is one cent worth of tax relief too much? I do not really \nthink so.\n  And the President today wants to increase spending by $123 billion \nand increase taxes $115 billion, wiping out entirely--and more--the tax \nreduction of 1997.\n  A recent Tax Foundation study shows that 1997's tax cuts came too \nlate to stem the rising tax burden on the American families.\n  The study finds that Federal, State and local taxes claimed an \nastonishing 38.2 percent of the income of a median two-income family \nmaking $55,000--up from 37.3 percent in 1996. That is about a 1 percent \nincrease.\n\n  When we ask the Government to take a small cut of 1 percent across \nthe board they say it's impossible. But nobody asked the taxpayers how \nthey were going to manage to pay another percent more of their income \nin taxes. They either had to reduce their spending or make do without. \nBut the Federal Government doesn't have to do that. Federal taxes under \nPresident Clinton consumed 20 percent of America's entire gross \ndomestic product in 1997. That is the highest level since 1945, when \ntaxes were raised to finance the enormous expenses of the Second World \nWar.\n  The average American family today spends more on taxes than it does \non food, clothing, and housing combined. If the ``hidden taxes'' that \nresult from the high cost of government regulations are factored in, a \nfamily today gives up more than 50 percent of its annual income to the \ngovernment. At a time when the combination of federal income and \npayroll taxes, State and local taxes, and hidden taxes consumes over \nhalf of a working family's budget, the taxpayers are in desperate need \nof relief.\n  Thanks to the Clinton Administration, the Democratic minority, and \nthe Republicans of this Congress, big government is alive and well. In \nfact, the Government is getting bigger, not smaller. Total taxation is \nat an all-time high. So is total Government spending. Annual Government \nspending has grown from just $100 billion in 1962 to $1.73 trillion \ntoday, an increase of more than 17 times. Even after adjustment for \ninflation, Government spending today is still more than three times \nbigger than it was 35 years ago. It will continue to grow to $1.95 \ntrillion by 2003 nearly $2 trillion a year. In the next 5 years, the \ngovernment will spend $9.7 trillion, much of it going toward wasteful \nor unnecessary government programs. Tax relief is the right solution \nbecause it takes power out of the hands of Washington's wasteful \nspenders and puts it back where it can do the most good: with families.\n  There is also an economic case for cutting taxes for working \nAmericans. Lower tax rates increase incentives to work, save, and \ninvest. They help to maximize the increase in family income and \nimprovements in standards of living. Beyond the direct benefits to \nfamilies, tax cuts can have a substantial, positive impact on the \neconomy as a whole. It was John F. Kennedy who observed that:\n\n     an economy hampered with high tax rates will never produce \n     enough revenue to balance the budget just as it will never \n     produce enough output and enough jobs.\n\n  President Kennedy was able to put his theories to work in the early \n1960s, when he enacted significant tax cuts that encouraged one of the \nfew periods of sustained growth we have experienced since the Second \nWorld War. Twenty years later, President Ronald Reagan cut taxes once \nagain. The reinvigorated economy responded enthusiastically.\n  Mr. President, should we save Social Security first or provide tax \ncuts first? My answer is that we must do both in tandem. We had a very \nsimilar debate last year about whether we should balance the budget \nfirst and provide tax cuts later. The truth is we can absolutely do \nboth at the same time, as long as we have the political will to enact \nsound fiscal policies.\n  I agree with the Conference leadership that reforming the Social \nSecurity and Medicare programs to ensure their solvency is vitally \nimportant. Any projected budget surplus should be used partly for that \npurpose. Yet, I believe strongly that the Congress owes it to the \ntaxpayers to dedicate a good share of the surplus for tax relief. After \nall, the Government has no claim on any surplus because the Government \ndid not generate it--it will have been borne of the sweat and hard work \nof the American people, and it therefore should be returned to the \npeople in the form of tax relief.\n  Our Social Security system is in serious financial trouble, a fiscal \ndisaster-in-the-making that is not sustainable in its present form. \nSimply funneling money back into it will not help fix the problem. It \nwill not build the real assets of the funds for current and future\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\nbeneficiaries and it does not address the flaws of the current pay-as-\nyou-go finance mechanism. Without fundamental reform, using the general \nrevenue to pay for Social Security equals a stealth payroll tax \nincrease on American workers. I believe using part of the budget \nsurpluses to build real assets by changing the system from pay-go to \npre-funded is the right way to go.\n  The President is maintaining that not one penny of the surplus would \nbe used for spending increases or tax cuts. To that, I must say Mr. \nClinton is not being at all truthful to the American people. In his FY \n1997 budget, he proposes $150 billion in new spending, which is well \nabove the spending caps he agreed on last year. In the next five years, \nhe will raid over $400 billion from the Social Security trust funds to \npay for his Government programs. If Mr. Clinton is serious about saving \nSocial Security, he should stop looting the Social Security surplus to \nfund general government programs, return the borrowed surplus to the \ntrust funds, and withdraw his new spending initiatives--only then will \nhe be qualified to talk about saving Social Security.\n  Wrapping up, Republicans should not allow Mr. Clinton to hold any \nbudget surplus hostage. We should continue pursuing our ``taxpayers' \nagenda'' and do what is right for working Americans. It is clear to me \nthat returning part of the budget surplus to the taxpayers in the form \nof tax relief is the right thing to do. But how should we do it? In my \nview, the best way is to have an across-the-board marginal tax rate cut \nand eliminate the capital gains and estate taxes. This will help to \nimprove American competitiveness in the global economy and increase \nnational savings.\n  However, tax cuts will not solve the problems once and for all. The \norigin of this evil is the tax code itself. We must end the tax code as \nwe know it and replace it with a simpler, fairer and more taxpayer-\nfriendly tax system.\n  By creating a tax system that is more friendly to working Americans \nand more conducive to economic growth--one based on pro-family, pro-\ngrowth tax relief--Congress and the President can make our economy more \ndynamic, our businesses more competitive, and our families more \nprosperous as we approach the 21st century.\n  Again, to omit tax cuts from this year's budget resolution is totally \nunacceptable to Republicans seeking to deliver on our commitment to \nreturn money to the taxpayers. I will not walk away from our obligation \nto the American taxpayers to pursue a Federal Government that serves \nwith accountability and leaves working families a little more of their \nown money at the end of the day. I intend to make good on my promise to \nthe taxpayers, and I urge my fellow Republicans, especially our \nleadership, in the strongest terms possible, to honor your commitment \nas well by considering meaningful tax relief in the budget resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/24/senate-section/article/S882-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask to yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the bipartisan \ncompromise amendment offered by Senators McCain and Feingold. This \nwould be reasonable but limited reform of our campaign finance system, \nreform that is long overdue.\n  This legislation would effectively change two very important issues \nwith respect to campaign finance reform. First, it would ban soft \nmoney, those unlimited, unregulated gifts by corporations, wealthy \nindividuals, and unions to political parties. The soft money issue has \ncreated a great crisis within the electoral system of the United \nStates.\n  Second, the bill would require those who run broadcasts which \nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate within a \ncertain window, 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election, \nto play by the same rules applying to candidates and others who \nparticipate in political campaigns. Thus, organizations funding such \nbroadcasts would have to disclose the individuals and political action \ncommittees which fund their advertisements.\n  This would curtail what has become an explosion throughout our \nAmerican political system. Phony issue advertisements are \nunconstrained, cropping up suddenly, without attribution, to strike at \ncandidates.\n  These are two very important reforms which must be implemented to \npreserve the integrity of our political system by inspiring within the \nAmerican people confidence that we, in fact, are conducting elections \nand not auctions for public offices. I believe these provisions are \nvery, very important.\n  Again, I commend both Senators McCain and Feingold for their efforts. \nI also commend my colleagues from the States of Vermont and Maine. \nSenator Jeffords and Senator Snowe are proposing another amendment \nwhich would help break the current gridlock we have on this \nlegislation. The Snowe-Jeffords proposal also addresses the issue of \nphony advertising through better disclosure of those who are \nparticipating in campaigns. I think their efforts are commendable.\n  Frankly I prefer a much more robust form of campaign finance reform. \nI believe that at the heart of our problem is the Supreme Court \ndecision of Buckley v. Valeo, which more than 20 years ago held that \npolitical campaign expenditures could not be limited. Frankly, I think \nthe decision is wrong. Justice White, who dissented from that opinion \nand, by the way, was the only Member of that Court with any practical \npolitical experience, declared quite clearly that Congress has not only \nthe ability but the obligation to protect the Republic from two great \nenemies--open violence and insidious corruption.\n  Indeed, the Court in Buckley did accept part of that reasoning by \noutlawing unlimited contributions to political campaigns, but they \nmaintained that unlimited expenditures were constitutionally \npermissible.\n  I believe that we should go further than this bill proposes today. \nIndeed, we have practical examples within the United States of systems \nthat do constrain contributions and expenditures in political \ncampaigns.\n  I was interested to note that in Albuquerque, NM, since 1974, the \nmayor's campaign has been limited to an expenditure of $80,000, \nequivalent to the salary of the mayor. I know as I go around my home \nState of Rhode Island, people often ask why a candidate would spend \nmore money in a campaign than he or she would receive in salary to hold \nthat office. In Albuquerque, they took the rather interesting step of \ncapping expenditures to the pay of the mayor.\n  It turns out that for the last 23 years, the Albuquerque system \nworked well. Unfortunately, last year the Albuquerque law was \nchallenged in court under the Buckley v. Valeo theory. Up until last \nyear, the municipal law was a model of not only good campaign finance \npractice but of also good electoral politics. A former mayor, who held \nthe position during the challenge said, ``No one's speech was \ncurtailed, no candidates were excluded, the system worked well.''\n  I hope we can adopt on another day robust campaign finance reform \nthat would begin to revise the Buckley v. Valeo decision. But today we \nare here\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\nto support McCain-Feingold, to take a limited step forward to ensure \nthat we go after the two most pressing problems currently facing our \npolitical system: the prevalence of soft money and the explosion of \nissue advertising by third parties. These unaccountable groups \nsurreptitiously enter the race, deal their blow and leave.\n  I believe if we support today the McCain-Feingold formula, we can, in \nfact, take a step forward to ensure that our political system is \nrecognized by people as legitimate and positive. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank both the \nSenator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for \ntheir yeoman's work, their perseverance and their energy on behalf of \nthis cause.\n  I am one who, in a very short period of time, has had to raise very \nlarge amounts of money for political campaigns. And I am one who has \nwatched and seen the evolution of soft money and what that soft money \nhas wrought upon the American political system.\n  So I rise today to join with my colleagues in very staunchly \nsupporting the McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  Since the 1996 election, Members of Congress and the public have \nrepeatedly called for reform of what is, without question, a broken \nsystem.\n  Congress had ample opportunity to pass this bill last October, but, \nshamefully, after so much talk, there was still no action to back it \nup. It should be no source of pride for this body to know that the \npublic believes that Congress is all talk and no action on an issue \nthat has dominated the Washington agenda for the last year and a half.\n  Now we have an opportunity to put our votes where our mouths are when \nit comes to campaign spending reform and, if nothing else, vote to ban \nsoft money.\n  It is interesting to read the newspapers where Member of Congress \nafter Member of Congress admits to the vicissitudes and the problems of \nsoft money. For the first 6 months of 1997, the Republican Party raised \n$21.7 million and the Democrats $13.7 million. Both of these figures \nare increases over the 1995-1996 cycle, and both are sure to rise in \nthe coming months.\n  While many in this body would like to see stronger legislation, and \nsome would like to see no legislation at all, it is important to note \nthat McCain-Feingold is essentially a stripped-down bill, pared to \naddress a number of the most pressing issues. The most important aspect \nis soft money.\n  Last fall, we had a healthy debate about the amounts of soft money \nflowing in and out of party coffers, so I am not going to speak at \nlength about that. But without reform, we can expect soft money \nexpenditures to rocket up with no brakes.\n\n  The Court's decision in the Colorado case opens the door to unlimited \nindependent party spending on behalf of candidates running for office \nas long as those expenditures are not coordinated with the candidates.\n  Prior to the Colorado decision, parties long supported their \ncandidates with hard money. Those were the regulated dollars. In our \ncase, limited to $1,000 contribution per election.\n  Increasingly, though, candidate advocacy has fallen to soft money, \nand that is money contributed in unlimited, unregulated amounts from \nseldom-disclosed sources.\n  Increasingly, the form that soft money takes is in scurrilous, \nvituperate ads that are often far different than reality. I believe \nthat goes for both sides of the aisle. I think it is a scourge on our \nAmerican political system.\n  We have an opportunity today to say we ban soft money and to limit \nexpress advocacy to a certain length of time prior to the election so \nthat the opportunity for untrue, false and often defamatory ads is \ngreatly reduced. If this bill were to do nothing else, I think that \nwould be an enormous contribution to the political culture of a \ncampaign.\n  One of the reasons, Mr. President, I did not cast my hat in the \nCalifornia gubernatorial campaign is because of the specific nature of \ncampaigns today. There is very little that is uplifting about them.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill bans soft money and prohibits parties from \nfunneling money to outside groups and would prohibit party officials \nfrom raising money for such groups.\n  Instead, these groups--and there are similar advocacy groups on both \nsides--would have to raise money from individual contributors or from \nPACs to raise money.\n  There is nothing in the bill barring these groups from continuing to \nparticipate in campaigns, but the bill does prohibit these outside \ngroups from serving as de facto party adjuncts funded by the parties.\n  Also, this bill does nothing to prevent individuals from making \nunlimited contributions to advocacy groups, it merely requires them to \nreport their contributions.\n\n\n                          unregulated spending\n\n  This brings me to the critical issue of unregulated spending. This \nis, essentially, unlimited and undisclosed soft money spent outside the \nparty system.\n  A study released last fall by the Annenberg Public Policy Center \nestimated that over two dozen independent groups spent between $135 \nmillion to $150 million on so-called issue advertising during the 1996 \nelection cycle.\n  Of the ads that were reviewed, 87 percent mentioned clearly \nidentified candidates and a majority of those ads were negative.\n  Most of the time we don't know where these ads come from or who pays \nfor them. All we see are vicious personal attack ads which pop up on \ntelevision during a campaign and, occasionally, a follow-up newspaper \narticle or report claiming credit and detailing the particulars of the \nattack.\n  Let me give you some examples of what I am talking about:\n  This is an issue ad that ran in the last Virginia Senate election. It \nwas placed by a group called Americans for Term Limits:\n\n       Announcer: It's a four letter word. It's a terrible thing. \n     It's really a shame it's so widespread. It's here in \n     Virginia. The home of Washington and Jefferson . . . of all \n     places. The word is D-E-F-Y. Defy. That's what Senator X is \n     doing. He's defying the will of the people of Virginia and \n     America. By a five to one margin, the people who pay Warner's \n     salary support Congressional term limits. Yet Warner is \n     defying the people's will on term limits--on important and \n     needed reform. Senator X has refused to sign the U.S. Term \n     Limits Pledge and has promised to fight against enactment of \n     Congressional term limits. An 18-year Congressional \n     incumbent, Senator X, is defying the clearly expressed wishes \n     of the people he's supposed to represent. Call Senator X and \n     ask him to stop defying the will of the people on term \n     limits. Your action can make a difference. Tell Senator X to \n     sign the U.S. Term Limits Pledge.\n\n  The AFL-CIO ran the following ad in its much publicized campaign:\n\n       Announcer: Working families are struggling. But Congressman \n     X voted with Newt Gingrich to cut college loans, while giving \n     tax breaks to the wealthy. He even wants to eliminate the \n     Department of Education. Congress will vote again on the \n     budget. Tell Congressman X, don't write off our children's \n     future.\n\n  Both of these ads are clearly designed to get voters to support one \ncandidate--or in both of these to oppose a specific candidate--and both \nmention candidates by name.\n  Yet, both are artfully crafted to elude campaign disclosure laws \nbecause neither use the ``magic words'' that would make them express \nadvocacy and subject to campaign finance laws. The ``magic words'' \noutlined in a footnote on the Buckley case are ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' \n``support,'' ``cast your ballot for,'' ``Smith for Congress,'' ``vote \nagainst,'' ``defeat,'' and ``reject.''\n  McCain-Feingold modernizes the definition of express advocacy and \nadds to its current definition the criterion of using a candidates name \nin advertisements within 60 days of an election.\n  What this means is that campaign advertisements that use a \ncandidate's name within 60 days of the election would be considered \nexpress advocacy and could not be funded with unregulated and \nundisclosed money.\n  Instead, groups wanting to expressly advocate the election or defeat \nof an identified candidate would have to abide by federal campaign \nfinance laws, raise hard money to fund their attacks and disclose the \ndonors.\n  Will this have a dramatic impact? The answer is unequivocally yes.\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\n  Candidate ads that name names and run within 60 days of the election \nwill be recognized for the express advocacy they are and would be \nsubject to funding limits and reporting requirements. issue ads meant \nto educate voters on the issues will still be permitted as long as they \ndo not cross the line.\n  Last month, a Wisconsin court looked at exactly this issue: if the \nstate can crack down on advertisements clearly designed at influencing \nthe election, but that stop short of requesting voters to support or \noppose candidates.\n  The debate in the Court mirrors exactly what the issue is here. \nWisconsin Attorney General James Doyle said in a Washington Post \narticle:\n\n       The heart of this issue is if you run an ad that any \n     reasonable person who looks at it recognizes to be a \n     political ad, just before an election, in which you call a \n     particular person names, and use phrases like ``send a \n     message'' to that person but do not use the magic words \n     ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' whether you can then avoid \n     all the basic campaign finance laws that we have in the \n     state.\n\n  That is what we're looking at here and that is exactly the issue we \nhave before us.\n\n\n                   Other Noteworthy Areas in the Bill\n\n  There are some other areas of the bill which, I believe, enhance \naccountability for how campaign money is spent.\n  Requiring candidates to attest to the content of ads they fund. I \nwould like to see this go one step further and require candidates to \nattest to the veracity of independent ads that are run on their behalf. \nThe problem lies not with the candidates, but with these anonymous \nattack ads.\n  Leveling the playing field between self-financed candidates and \ncandidates who rely on contributions. This bill prohibits parties from \nmaking coordinated expenditures on behalf of candidates who spend more \nthan $50,000 of their own money. I would like to see a mechanism \nwhereby we would raise individual contribution limits for candidates \nrunning against self-financed candidates.\n  Lowering the disclosure requirement for contributions to candidates \nfrom $200 to $50.\n  Requiring that any person (including political committees, i.e. \nunions, corporations, and banks) making independent expenditures over \n$10,000 (aggregate) prior to 20 days before an election, file a report \nwith the FEC within 48 hours.\n  Requiring that any person (including political committees, i.e. \nunions, corporations, and banks) making independent expenditures over \n$1,000 within 20 days of an election report that expenditure to the FEC \nwithin 24 hours.\n  Requiring individuals making disbursements of over $50,000 annually \n(aggregate) file with the FEC on a monthly basis.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  It is important to note that nothing in this bill prohibits any type \nof speech. We are all aware of the Court's guarantee in Buckley that \nspending is the equivalent of speech. With the exception of banning \nparties receiving soft money, nothing in this bill limits how much can \nbe spent on campaigns.\n  This legislation seeks to hold candidates accountable for what they \nsay, how they say it and, most importantly, how far unregulated special \ninterests are allowed to go in paying to impact elections.\n  This bill gives Congress the opportunity to make a real difference. I \nhope we will have that chance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes allocated to the Senator have \nexpired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding to me. \nLet me, again, tell him how grateful I am for the work he has done on \nthe issue of campaign finance reform and the clarity which he has \nbrought into the debate which I think the American people now \nunderstand.\n  I say that in the context now of the discussion that goes on in this \nChamber, and I also look at the news of the day. The media, I think, \nhas really attempted to work up a bit of a feeding frenzy, showing all \nkinds of angles as to how this issue might have divided Congress, that \nit has divided the members of the same party, that there is a cry of \noutrage across the land as people stand up ready to storm the Capitol \nin protest over this issue. But despite the media's efforts and despite \ntheir hype, the public really does not care about this issue. In the \nmost recent Gallup poll, where people were asked about the most \nimportant problems facing the country, campaign finance reform did not \nappear in the top five items on the list. In fact, in all honesty, Mr. \nPresident, it did not appear at all.\n\n  The same stands true for the latest CBS News poll and the latest \nTime/CNN poll, and even the latest Battleground poll by Ed Goaes and \nCelinda Lake, which is a bipartisan effort to balance out the issues so \nyou cannot question that it might be distorted one way or the other. \nAfter extensive research of all of the major polling groups, the issue \nof campaign finance reform did not show up as a concern amongst almost \nevery American.\n  What is important to the American people are issues like crime, \neconomic health, health care, education, Social Security and the moral \ndecline of our country. What people really care about is whether their \nkid will get to school and back safely and whether the schooling they \nare going to get once they get there is good and of high quality.\n  They care about keeping their jobs and trying to make ends meet while \nthey watch a good portion of their hard-earned money go to Washington \nto support what they think is a wasteful Federal bureaucracy.\n  They care about their future, whether they can save enough money to \nsomeday retire and whether they have affordable health care. What they \ndo not care about is campaign finance reform. It isn't a real issue at \nall. It is an issue created here inside the beltway to try to divide \nand in some instances to conquer.\n  Let us just suppose for a minute that people really did care about \ncampaign finance reform, that they sat around the dinner table at night \nand said, ``Well, dear, how was your day at the office? And, oh, by the \nway, shouldn't we reform campaign finance?'' I doubt that that question \nhas been asked at any dinner table in America since the last election--\nafter hundreds of millions of dollars were spent by some interests only \nto generate a passing question about how the system works.\n  What Americans really do need to know are the details of the campaign \nlaws that are currently on the books. You know, once you begin to \nexplain the laws that are out there today, their eyes glaze over and \nthey say, ``Well, isn't that enough?'' And I think they need to know \nabout some appalling campaign practices that were used by this \nadministration in their reelection.\n  Now, we had a committee spend millions of dollars here searching out \nthese allegations. I use the word ``allegations.'' My guess is the only \nresult from it was that it diverted our attention away from other \nscandals besetting this administration for some period of time.\n  They need to know what Congress wants to do to reform campaign \nfinance laws and to level the playing field so that neither political \nparty has an unfair advantage over the other. They need to know what we \nare going to do to make all political contributions voluntary so that \nno person, union or nonunion worker, is forced to pony up their money \nfor political purposes without their expressed consent or permission.\n  Is it possible that today in America people are forced to contribute \nmoney that goes to political purposes they do not want? Oh, yes, Mr. \nPresident, you bet it is. And that is the issue in an amendment before \nus. I do not care how the other side tries to whitewash it, the bottom \nline is hundreds of thousands of American working men and women who are \nmembers of unions, when given the opportunity to give voluntarily, walk \naway from the forced contribution that goes on currently within their \nunions.\n  Americans need to know what we are going to do to give them complete \nand immediate access to campaign contribution records about who gives \nand to whom. This prompt and full disclosure of so-called ``soft \nmoney'' campaign donations will make the names of the donors \nimmediately public and allow voters to decide if the candidate is \nlooking after their best interests.\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\n  So I have suggested to you today what I think Americans want to know \nand, most importantly, what Americans do not want to know or do not \ncare to know or sense no urgency in knowing.\n  However, under the McCain-Feingold plan, there would be an across-\nthe-board ban of soft money for any Federal election activity, Mr. \nPresident. I feel this is a grave mistake for the political process. \nReport it? You bet. Report it promptly? You bet. Let the American \npeople know they have a right to know. To ban it? Well, let us talk \nabout that for a moment.\n  Let me first recognize my colleagues who have worked hard on this \nissue, and let me also recognize that I think they are people with a \ndeep concern. I have great respect for them. I have respect for their \ntenacity and their diligence as they brought this issue to the floor. \nBut I just flat disagree with them. And I think a good many other of my \ncolleagues disagree with them. And I think there is a substantial basis \nfor that disagreement.\n  As for the ban on soft money, I have several major reservations on \nhow this measure would ultimately impact the current campaign finance \nsystem, not improving it, but creating such a hardship on this \ncountry's State and local political parties that it would force them to \nspend more time concentrating on raising money in order to exist.\n  Under the McCain-Feingold proposal, the ban on soft money, any State \nand local party committees would be prohibited from spending soft money \nfor any Federal election activity.\n  Right now, State and local parties receive so-called ``soft money'' \nfrom their national political parties. Here in Washington, both the \nRepublican National Committee and the Democrat National Committee \nreceive money from donors. Some of that money is then distributed to \nthe respective political parties in counties and locales around this \ncountry. There are thousands of State, county and local party officials \nwho receive this financial aid.\n  Then, under certain conditions--and they are clear within the law--\nthe money is used for activities such as purchasing buttons and bumper \nstickers and posters and yard signs on behalf of a candidate. The money \nis also used for voter registration activities on behalf of the party's \nPresidential and vice Presidential nominees. The money is also used for \nmultiple candidate brochures and even sample ballots.\n  Let us talk about election day. You go down to the local polling \nsite. Maybe it is a school or a church or an American Legion hall. \nSometimes there is a person standing out there who hands you a sample \nballot listing all of the candidates running for office in your party \nand the other party. And it is quite obvious some people at that point \nare not yet informed. They tend to vote their party. This is an \nassistance. No subterfuge about it. It is very up front. It is very \nclear and it is what informing the public and the electorate is all \nabout.\n\n  But under the McCain-Feingold proposal, it would be against the law \nto use soft money to pay for a sample ballot with the name of any \ncandidate who is running for Congress on the same ballot that the State \nand local candidates were on.\n  Under McCain-Feingold, it would be against the law to use soft money \nto pay for buttons, posters, yard signs, and brochures that include the \nname or the picture of a candidate for Federal office on the same item \nthat has the name or the picture of a State or a local candidate office \non it. What you are talking about is setting up a morass of laws to be \nimplemented and to be enforced that becomes nearly impossible to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kentucky yield the \nSenator from Idaho the additional 5 minutes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Under McCain-Feingold, it would be against the law to use \nsoft money to conduct a local voter registration drive for 120 days \nbefore the election. These get-out-the-vote drives, which have proven \nto be effective tools for increasing all of our parties' interests and \nthe public's interests, would simply be banned.\n  Why would we want to ban all that I have mentioned? Because under \nthese new laws in McCain-Feingold's plan State and local officials \nwould have to use hard money instead of soft money. And already by what \nI have said, the public is confused. What is hard money? What is soft \nmoney? How does it get applied? We have the FEC that is out there now \ntrying to make rulings on something that happened 3, 4, 5 years ago. \nWhat we are talking about is timely reporting, not creating greater \nobstacles for the process.\n  Most importantly, what we are talking about, Mr. President, is free \nspeech. It is what the majority leader has called very clearly the \ngreatest scandal in America. Well, the greatest scandal in America is \nnot campaign financing. The greatest scandal in America is trying to \nsuggest that there is a scandal when it does not exist, a scandal that \nunder anyone's measurement just does not meet the muster.\n  Poll America. I have mentioned that polling. And it does not work. \nBack home in my State, when I suggested at town meetings that campaign \nfinance is an issue, they scratch their heads and say, ``Why?'' Most \nimportantly, today, now they are coming out and saying, ``No. And, \nSenator Craig, let me tell you why it wouldn't work. Because I, as an \nindividual, am a member of a small group, and I can contribute \ncollectively and that small group's voice can become louder. And if I \nam able to make my voice louder, then I can affect, under the first \namendment of the Constitution, my constitutional right as a free \ncitizen of this country by the amplification of my voice, my ideas, and \nmy issues in the election process.''\n  Of course, our colleague and leader on this issue, Mitch McConnell, \nhas made it so very clear by repeating constantly what the courts of \nour country have so clearly said--that the right to participate in the \npolitical process, the right to extend one's voice through contribution \nis the right of free speech.\n  So no matter how you look at what is going on here on the floor, no \nmatter how pleading the cries are that major reform is at hand, let me \nsuggest a few simple rules. Abide by the laws we have--and 99 percent \nof those who enter the political process do--abide by those laws, and \nyou do not walk on the Constitution and you guarantee the right of \nevery citizen in this country, whether by individual power or by the \ncollective power of individuals coming together, the insurance of free \nspeech.\n  Why has the Senate rejected this issue in the past? And why will they \nreject it Thursday when we finally vote on this once again? Because we \nwill not trample on free speech. We recognize what Americans across the \nboard have said to us: Provide limited instruction, which we already \nhave in major campaign finance reform over the last several decades, \nand then we trust that we will be able to extend our voice in the \npolitical process, and through that our freedoms, our constitutional \nfreedoms, will be guaranteed, and the political process will not be \nobstructed by the bureaucracy that is trying to be created here today \nby McCain-Feingold.\n  Let us look at the reality of this situation. Because of these new \nrestrictions, local party officials--say like the Republican party \nchairman in Custer County, ID,--will be forced to seek out hard money \ndonations from local businesses and individuals to fund these political \nactivities.\n  In a county of a little better than 4,000 people, this party \nofficial--who is more than likely a volunteer--now has to spend more of \nhis or her time fund-raising, not to mention the fact that those with \nmore money stand a better chance of winning an election.\n  Party affiliation will become insignificant.\n  In other words, raising hard money will become a bigger concern for \nthese State and local officials than ever before. And, whomever raises \nthe most money can then fund more political activities.\n  Mr. President, what kind of campaign finance reform is this? What are \nwe trying to accomplish? We've just added more laws to a system that is \nalready heavily burdened with regulations, forced thousands of State \nand local party officials to go out and raise money, and created more \nconfusion for the voters. If the point of the McCain-\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\nFeingold plan is to reform the campaign finance system, the last thing \nyou want to do is ban soft money.\n  Instead, full and immediate public disclosure of campaign donations \nwould be a much more logical approach.\n  With the help of the latest technology, we could post this \ninformation on the Internet within 24-hours. Let us open the records \nfor everyone to see.\n  Anyone interested in researching the integrity of a campaign, or in \nfinding out the identity of the donors, or in looking for signs of \nundue influence or corruption would only have to have access to a \ncomputer. They could track a campaign--dollar for dollar--to see first \nhand where the money is coming from.\n  But Mr. President, what bothers me the most about the McCain-Feingold \nproposal is not what is in the bill, but what has been left out.\n  As I said, it is--what the majority leader once called--``the great \nscandal in American politics * * * and the worst campaign abuse of \nall.'' That is the forced collection and expenditure of union dues for \npolitical purposes.\n  Mr. President, this is nothing short of extortion.\n  Let me make myself clear, I fully support the right of unions and \nunion workers to participate in the political process. Union workers \nshould and must be encouraged to become involved and active in the \nelectoral process. It is no only their right but their civic \nresponsibility.\n  Back in my home state of Idaho, I meet with union workers in union \nhalls, on the streets, and in their homes. And I hear their complaints, \ntheir anger and their outrage over how their dues are being spent and \nmishandled by national union officers.\n  They say to me ``Senator Craig, every month I am forced to pay dues \nthat are used for political purposes I don't agree with. But what can I \ndo? If I speak out, they'll call me a trouble maker!''\n  During the 1996 elections alone, union bosses tacked on an extra \nsurcharge on dues to their members in order to raise $35 million to \ndefeat Republican candidates around the country. It is likely they used \nmuch more of the worker's money than they reported, but I am sure we \nwill never find out the truth.\n  But under the Paycheck Protection Act, union workers will have new \nand exapanded rights and the final say on how their money is being \nspent. The legislation not only protects the rights of union workers, \nbut also makes it clear that corporations adhere to the same measure.\n  Unions and corporations would have to get the permission in writing \nfrom each employee prior to using any portion of dues or fees to \nsupport political activities. And, workers will have the right to \nrevoke their authorization at any time.\n  Finally, employees would be guaranteed the protection that if their \nmoney was used for purposes against their will, it would be a violation \nof Federal campaign law. Mr. President, this is commonsense legislation \nand it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky for his leadership \non this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Just briefly, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \noutstanding contribution to this debate. We are grateful for his \nknowledgeable presentation. I thank him very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 10 minutes, the first 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom California and the following 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Others have spoken to the merits of the McCain-Feingold bill. They \nhave done so quite eloquently. And I want to share in that praise. \nReining in special-interest money is absolutely necessary. Why do I say \nthat? Because this is a Government of, by, and for the people. We \nlearned that in school. It is one of the first things we learned, that \nGovernment is of, by, and for the people--not a Government of, by, and \nfor the special interests and the people who are very wealthy and the \npeople who could put on pin-striped suits and come up here and lobby \nus. It is a Government of, by and for the people. It is not for sale. \nIt must not be for sale. We have an obligation to make sure that it is \nnot. We have an obligation to make sure that there isn't even a \nperception that it is for sale.\n\n  Now, for those who say they don't see the difference between a $5 \ncheck, a $25 check, even a $1,000 check versus a $50,000 corporate \ncheck or a $100,000 check and even a $1 million check which is allowed \nunder the current system, for those who don't see the difference, I say \nto them that to me, to this Senator, you are simply not credible. You \nare not credible. Even if there isn't one bit of a desire on the part \nof someone giving a $1 million check, it sure looks that way. So we \nhave to have rules in place so that we are not perceived as being a \nGovernment that is for sale. That is the soft money. Those are the huge \ndollars that Senators McCain and Feingold are trying to stop.\n  By the way, those are the huge dollars that play a big role in \ncampaigns today. Right now in Santa Barbara, CA, there is a very \nimportant race going on. Congressman Walter Capps died while in office \nand there is a spirited race to replace him, two good candidates \nfighting it out on the issues. Mr. President, money is flowing in from \noutside California into this race. Money is flowing in from people \noutside my State to influence an election in my State and it is flowing \nin huge amounts, and it is flowing into negative advertising. Mr. \nPresident, that does not lift the debate.\n  We heard from the senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, \nabout the need to raise enormous sums of money. She talked about her \nown decision not to run for Governor because of that. Let me tell you \nsomething I have said on this floor before. To raise the amount of \nmoney that she would have needed, or I need today to run for the U.S. \nSenate, would come to $10,000 a day for 6 years including Saturday and \nSunday. Now, for 3 years when I got here I couldn't bear to ask anyone \nfor a penny because I had just come from a very tough race and I didn't \nwant to ask anybody for any money, so I didn't get started for 3 years. \nThat means I have to raise $20,000 a day for 3 years to make this \nbudget. It takes time. It takes effort. It is hard. It takes you away \nfrom the things you want to do, not to mention the time to think about \ncreative ways to solve the problems that matter to real people.\n  Now I agree with Senator Craig that when you ask people what they \ncare about the most, they don't list campaign finance reform. They list \neducation, crime, sensible gun control, Social Security, the \nenvironment, HMO bill of rights, pensions. But if you ask them, do you \nwant your Senator to be free of conflicts or potential conflicts when \nhe or she votes on the economy, votes on HMO reform, votes on the \nminimum wage, votes on sensible gun control, they will say, of course, \nI want my Senator to do what is in his or her heart; I don't want my \nSenator to be conflicted in this either in fact or in perception.\n  We have a job here to do. My constituents do care. My constituents do \nwrite me about this. My constituents do show up at my community \nmeetings and they want me to be strong for campaign finance reform. I \nget sick, Mr. President, when I hear people come on this floor or on \ntelevision and say huge money in politics is the American way. They \nhave actually said that--it is the American way. I don't think that is \nthe American way. I don't think it is right to say that huge money in \npolitics is the American way. I think our founders would roll over in \ntheir graves. They didn't write a Constitution so that the privileged \nfew could get access or the perception of access. They founded this \nNation based on a Government of, by and for the people. I feel sick \nwhen I hear free speech equated with money. Yes, I know the Supreme \nCourt said that. But I disagree vehemently with that decision. If \nsomeone wealthy has more free speech than someone who is of modest \nincome or poor, there is something wrong.\n  So I want to say to my friend, Russ Feingold, and my friend, John \nMcCain, thank you for your persistence. I say to Senators Snowe, \nJeffords, and Chafee, thank you for\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\nworking with us. I think we will have a victory here.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, 5 minutes was \nyielded to the Senator from Michigan.\n  It is the understanding of the Chair that the time was yielded to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. The time was yielded to the Senator from Michigan, but the \nSenator from Massachusetts wanted to inquire if we could lock in a \nsequence if possible. Would it be possible to ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to proceed for 5 minutes following the Senator from \nMichigan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nMassachusetts sought consent to follow the 5 minutes allocated to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, this is off the other \nside's time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Unless the Senator wants to be good enough to give it to \nme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It appears that is the case.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are under divided time from now until the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have no problem, provided it is coming off Senator \nFeingold's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The time will be so charged.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. McCain-Feingold takes direct aim at closing the loopholes \nthat swallowed up the election laws. In particular, it takes aim at \nclosing the soft money loophole which is the 800-pound gorilla in this \ndebate.\n  As much as some want to point the finger of blame at those who took \nadvantage of the campaign finance laws during the last election, there \nis no one to blame but ourselves for the sorry state of the law. The \nsoft money loophole exists because we in Congress allow it to exist. \nThe issue advocacy loophole exists because we in Congress allow it to \nexist. Tax-exempt organizations spend millions televising candidate \nattack ads before an election without disclosing who they are or where \nthey got their funds because we in Congress allow it.\n  It is time to stop pointing fingers at others and take responsibility \nfor our share of the blame. We alone write the laws. We alone can shut \ndown the loopholes and reinvigorate the Federal election laws.\n  When we enacted the Federal Election Campaign Act 20 years ago in \nresponse to campaign abuses in connection with the Watergate scandal, \nwe had a comprehensive set of limits on campaign contributions. \nIndividuals aren't supposed to give more than $1,000 to a candidate per \nelection or $20,000 to a political party. Corporations and unions are \nbarred from contributing to any candidate without going through a \npolitical action committee.\n  At the time that they were enacted, many people fought against those \nlaws, claiming that those laws--the $1,000, the $2,000 restrictions and \nthe other ones--were an unconstitutional restriction of the first \namendment rights to free speech and free association. The people who \nopposed the current limits on laws which are supposed to be there but \nwhich have been evaded through the loopholes, the people who opposed \nthe law's limits, took their case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme \nCourt ruled in Buckley that the campaign contribution limits were \nconstitutional. I repeat that, because there has been a lot of talk on \nthe floor about limits on campaign contributions being violations of \nfree speech. The Supreme Court in Buckley specifically held that limits \non campaign contributions were constitutional.\n\n       It is unnecessary to look beyond the act's primary \n     purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption \n     resulting from large individual, financial contributions--in \n     order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for \n     the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of \n     private financing of elections, a candidate lacking \n     immense personal or family wealth must depend on financial \n     contributions from others to provide the resources \n     necessary to conduct a successful campaign . . . To the \n     extent that large contributions are given to security \n     political quid pro quo's from current and potential office \n     holders, the integrity of our system of representative \n     democracy is undermined . . . Of almost equal concern is . \n     . . the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming \n     from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse \n     inherent in a regime of large individual financial \n     contributions. . .\n\n  That is the Supreme Court speaking on limiting contributions and \nsaying that Congress has a right to stem the appearance of corruption \nwhich results from the opportunities for abuse which are inherent in a \nregime of large individual financial contributions.\n  Then the court said:\n\n       Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of \n     the appearance of improper influence ``is also critical . . . \n     if confidence in the system of representative government is \n     not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.''\n\n  Now the question is, what are we going to do about it? What are we \ngoing to do about the unlimited money? Now the test is us. It is time \nto quit shedding the crocodile tears, quit pointing the fingers. It is \ntime for us to act. It is our responsibility legislatively and it is a \ncivic responsibility.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his \nleadership, along with Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the rising cost of seeking political office \nis nothing less than outrageous. Last year (1996), House and Senate \ncandidates spent more than $765 million --a 76 percent increase since \n1990 and a six-fold increase since 1976. In the same time frame, the \nmore telling figure for our purposes, the average cost for a winning \nSenate race went from a little more than $600,000 to $3.3 million. And \nsome of us involved in 1996 races raised and spent a great deal more.\n  And over the last 3 election cycles ``soft money,'' which is money \nnot regulated by federal election contribution laws, and which largely \nfuels the barrage of negative attack ads, has increased exponentially. \nIn the 1988 cycle, the major parties alone raised a combined $45 \nmillion in soft money. In 1992 that amount doubled--and in the 1995-96 \ncycle that figure tripled again, to a staggering $262 million. Initial \nFEC reports show this sorry trend continues in the current cycle.\n  And if Congressional Quarterly and other sources are correct, the \nMajority's draft of the campaign fundraising investigation of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee report, due out later this week, will \nbluntly declare that in 1996 the federal campaign finance system \n``collapsed.''\n  The draft of the Minority's portion of that report, according to the \nsame sources, apparently continues that theme, stating that our \ndependence on large contributions from wealthy persons and \norganizations is so great that ``the democratic principles underlying \nour government are at risk.'' It goes on to state, as reported by \nCongressional Quarterly:\n\n       ``We face the danger of becoming a government not of the \n     people, but of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. . . . \n     Activities surrounding the 1996 election exposed the dark \n     side of our political system and the critical need for \n     campaign finance reform.''\n\n  Is it any wonder, Mr. President, that Americans believe that their \ngovernment has been hijacked by special interests--that the political \nsystem responds to the needs of the wealthy, not the needs of ordinary, \nhard-working citizens--and that those of us elected may be more \naccountable to those who financed our campaigns than to average \nAmericans? Many of them sense that Congress no longer belongs to the \npeople. We are witnessing a growing sense of powerlessness, a corrosive \ncynicism. The reasons for this cynicism and disconnect are clear. More \nthan anything, Mr. President, they are the exorbitant cost of campaigns \nand the power of special interest money in politics--the special \ninterest money used to campaign for elective office. Special interest \nmoney is moving and dictating and governing the process of American \npolitics, and most Americans understand that.\n  An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll finds that by a margin of 77 percent \nto 18 percent the public wants campaign finance reform, because ``there \nis too much money being spent on political campaigns, which leads to \nexcessive influence by special interests and wealthy individuals at the \nexpense of average people.'' Last spring a New York Times poll found \nthat an astonishing 91 percent favor a fundamental\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\ntransformation of the existing system. The evidence of public \ndiscontent could not be more compelling.\n  In the 1996 Presidential and Congressional elections we witnessed an \nappalling no-holds-barred pursuit of stunning amounts of money by both \nparties and their candidates. And I must admit that in my own re-\nelection campaign, despite an agreement between my opponent and me to \nlimit expenditures, the amounts raised and spent were staggering.\n  The American people believe--with considerable justification--that \nthe scores of millions of dollars flowing from the well-to-do and from \nspecial interest organizations are not donated out of disinterested \npatriotism, admiration for the candidates, or support for our electoral \nsystem. They have seen repeatedly that public policy decisions made by \nthe Congress and the Executive Branch appear to be influenced by those \nwho make the contributions.\n  Who can blame them, Mr. President, for believing either that those \ncontributions directly affect the decision-making process, or, at the \nleast, purchase the kind of access for large donors that enables them \nto make their case in ways ordinary Americans seldom can?\n  It is no surprise that those who profit from the current system--\nspecial interests who know how to play the game and politicians who \nknow how to game the system--continue to try to block genuine reform. \nIf we want to regain the respect and confidence of the American people, \nif we want to reconnect people to their democracy, we must get special \ninterest money out of politics. That process begins here with the bill \nbefore us.\n  One reason the results of the Governmental Affairs Committee's work \nmay have less impact than it should is the perhaps unavoidable need of \neach party to highlight the sins of the other. But I am not interested \ntoday in assigning blame, Mr. President. As our distinguished \ncolleague, the ranking minority Member of the Committee, Senator Glenn \nhas said, ``There is wrong on both sides.'' Indeed, the minority draft, \nagain as reported by Congressional Quarterly, says the investigation \nshowed that:\n\n       Both parties have become slaves to the raising of soft \n     money. Both parties have been lax in screening out illegal \n     and improper contributions. Both parties have openly sold \n     access for contributions.\n\n  Mr. President, the creative minds of campaign managers and candidates \nalike have found ways to undermine every reform over the years. To \nattack the problem by a piecemeal approach will not work. One man who \nknew all about abuse of the campaign finance system, Richard Nixon, \nonce said that campaign finance reform cannot work if it ``plugs only \none hole in a sieve.''\n  Thanks to a unanimous consent agreement last fall, we are here today, \nfinally, to have the first real debate and meaningful action in this \nCongress on a proposal for campaign finance reform advanced by my good \nfriends, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Russell Feingold of \nWisconsin. I supported their original bill, because it assembled a \npackage of meaningful reforms that seemed to Bridge the party divide \nthat has too often poisoned this debate and prevented any real change. \nAnd, although its scope is now reduced, I continue to support this \nversion of the bill, because it does move us forward. Throughout my \nyears in this body my goal has been the same as John McCain's and Russ \nFeingold's: to get special interest money and special interest access \nout of politics.\n  As we begin this debate, most of the pundits tell us that true reform \nagain has no chance. My friend, the junior Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nMcConnell) has assured us all repeatedly that McCain-Feingold is dead. \nYesterday, however, The Washington Post, said that ``the success of \nthis venture depends on the stubbornness of the advocates.'' I am proud \nto count myself among this group which is determined to see that real \nreform begins now. And that means continuing to work in the coming days \nwith all those on both sides of the aisle with the fortitude to keep \nreform alive.\n  In a recent speech, Bill Moyers quoted a distinguished Republican, \nformer Senator Barry Goldwater, who said some ten years ago that the \nFounding Fathers knew that ``liberty depended on honest elections,'' \nand that ``corruption destroyed the prime requisite of constitutional \nliberty, an independent legislature free from any influence other than \nthat of the people.'' The Senator continued:\n\n       To be successful, representative government assumes that \n     elections will be controlled by the citizenry at large, not \n     by those who give the most money. Electors must believe their \n     vote counts. Elected officials must owe their allegiance to \n     the people, not to their own wealth or to the wealth of \n     interest groups who speak only for the selfish fringes of the \n     whole community.\n\n   Those who join John McCain and his hardy band could do no better \nthan to follow Barry Goldwater's advice today.\n  Today's version of McCain/Feingold still correctly identifies a \nnumber of glaring deficiencies in the current campaign finance system \nand seeks to remedy them. This bill should pass, Mr. President. The \nAmerican people want these reforms.\n  Mr. President, because it so fascinates those on the other side of \nthis issue, I'd like to take a moment to explain briefly why the so-\ncalled First Amendment objections to a soft money ban do not hold \nwater. Simply put, as a distinguished group of 124 law professors from \nacross the country has pointed out, there is nothing in Buckley v. \nValeo that even suggests a problem in restricting, or even banning, \nsoft money contributions. Last September, those distinguished \nconstitutional scholars, led by New York University Law School \nProfessors Ronald Dworkin and Burt Neuborne, joined in a letter to the \nsponsors of this amendment.\n  We need to remember that this 1976 Supreme Court decision expressly \nreaffirmed the right to ban all hard money, corporate and union \npolitical contributions in federal elections, stating that Congress had \na basis for finding a ``primary governmental interest in the prevention \nof actual corruption or the appearance of corruption in the political \nprocess.'' And the Court recognized the potential for corruption \ninherent in the large campaign contributions that corporations and \nlabor organizations could generate.\n  These esteemed scholars point out that the most vital statement of \nthe Supreme Court came in 1990, in Austin vs. Michigan Chamber of \nCommerce. The scholars tell us, and I quote,\n\n     the Court found that corporations can be walled off from the \n     electoral process by forbidding both contributions and \n     independent expenditures from general corporate treasuries. \n     Surely the law can not be that Congress has the power to \n     prevent corporations from giving money directly to a \n     candidate, or from expending money on behalf of a candidate, \n     but lacks the power to prevent them from pouring unlimited \n     funds into a candidate's political party in order to buy \n     preferred access to him after the election.\n\n  Accordingly, these professors continue--and again, I am quoting--\n``closing the loophole for soft money contributions is in line with the \nlongstanding and constitutional ban on corporate and union \ncontributions in federal elections and with limits on the size of \nindividual's contributions that are not corrupting.''\n  There have also been a number of references in this debate to the \n1996 Supreme Court case of Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \nCommittee vs. FEC. These same scholars have said that\n\n     any suggestion that [the Colorado Republican case] cast doubt \n     on the constitutionality of a soft money ban is flatly wrong. \n     [The Colorado Republican case] did not address the \n     constitutionality of banning soft money contributions, but \n     rather expenditures by political parties of hard money, that \n     is, money raised in accordance with FECA's limits. Indeed, \n     the Court noted that it ``could understand how Congress, were \n     it to conclude that the potential for evasion of the \n     individual contribution limits was a serious matter, might \n     decide to change the statute's limitations on contributions \n     to political parties.''\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest to you that these definitive findings on the \nFirst Amendment issue have settled the argument. We can now move \nforward to a healthy and productive debate within the boundaries our \nConstitution sets before us.\n  I will acknowledge that, in my judgment, this amendment does not go \nfar enough. Its useful reforms are by no means all we need. That is \nwhy, Mr. President, I, along with Senators Wellstone, Glenn, Biden and \nLeahy, introduced S. 918, the ``Clean Money, Clean Elections Act'' last \nJune.\n  Like the bill before us, S. 918 also bans soft money and takes \nsteps--stronger steps than we can take today--truly to rein in those \nphony issue ads that are only thinly veiled,\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\nelection-oriented advocacy ads, many of which are purely negative \nattacks. It would also strengthen the Federal Election Commission, \nreduce the costs of campaigning in many ways, such as by requiring free \nair time for candidates--and it would effectively reduce the length of \ncampaigns. Our bill contains nearly all the other solid reforms \nincluded in the original McCain-Feingold bill.\n  But fundamentally, the Clean Money bill creates a totally new, \nvoluntary, alternative campaign finance system that removes virtually \nall private money--and all large private contributions--from federal \nelection campaigns for those who choose to participate.\n  Let me briefly summarize our proposal: Any Senate candidate who \ndemonstrates sufficient citizen support by collecting a set number of \n$5 qualifying contributions from voters in his or her state is eligible \nfor a fixed amount of campaign funding from a Senate ``Clean Election \nFund.'' To receive public funds, a Clean Money candidate must forego \nall private contributions (including self-financing) except for a small \namount of ``seed money'' (to be used to secure the qualifying \ncontributions raised in amounts of $100 or less), and he or she must \nlimit campaign spending to the allotted amount of ``clean money'' \nfunds. Additional matching funds, up to a certain limit, will be \nprovided if a participating candidate is outspent by a private money \ncandidate or is the target of independent expenditures.\n  ``By placing a premium on organizing rather than fundraising,'' as \nEllen Miller of Public Campaign has pointed out, Clean Money Campaign \nReform shifts ``the priorities of electoral work back toward those that \nought to matter most in a representative democracy: issue development \nand advocacy, canvassing, and get-out-the-vote drives.''\n  And most important, once elected, Clean Money office holders are free \nto spend full-time on the jobs they were elected to do. The days of \ndialing for dollars would truly be over.\n  This reform effort began in the State of Maine where in November \n1996, a statewide Clean Money, Clean Elections initiative passed by a \nmargin of 56 to 44 percent. Last June Vermont's state legislature \nadopted a similar measure by a two-thirds margin in the Senate and by \nbetter than six to one in the House. Other efforts are underway across \nthe nation. In my home State of Massachusetts, 2,000 volunteers \ncollected 100,000 signatures for a Clean Money initiative--well over \nthe number needed to place it on the ballot this fall. In thirteen \nother states, from John McCain's Arizona to Connecticut, from Georgia \nto Oregon, coalitions of effective grassroots advocates are all working \nhard for Clean Money reform.\n  I believe the day is coming, Mr. President, when the Congress will \nhave no choice but to approve this fundamentally simple reform. It will \nfinally put an end to the senseless money chase and totally eliminate \nthe influence of private money in our campaigns--and thereby let the \npeople buy back their politicians.\n  That day is not yet here. I am a realist. Although the grassroots \nwork in the vineyards of state legislatures and state initiative \ncampaigns is on the march, we are not close enough to reach that goal \nin this chamber today. But today we can make a down payment on the debt \nwe owe the people who sent us here by supporting McCain-Feingold. I \nsupport it without reservation.\n  I congratulate and thank both sponsors of this bill for their efforts \nin putting together this bill and fighting for it. It is good \nlegislation. It is needed legislation. It heads us in the right \ndirection.\n  I commend Senator Feingold for his hard work, his determined \nbipartisanship, and his commitment to making our political process a \ncleaner, better and more democratic system. The junior Senator from \nWisconsin, who joined this body after a race in which he was outspent \nthree to one, has worked tirelessly to make real progress possible.\n  And I especially commend the work of Senator McCain. All of us \nunderstand the stamina it takes to assume a mission of this kind, and \nto stick with one's convictions despite opposition from friends. John \nMcCain has always excelled as a patriot, and with this legislation, he \nhas done so again. He courageously pursues a just cause. I am proud, \nonce again, to stand with John McCain and support his amendment.\n  Mr. President, one reason the nay-sayers are again predicting defeat \nfor reform is their reliance on smokescreens like the so-called \n``paycheck protection'' proposal that is clearly designed as a poison \npill to sink this reform. We cannot let that effort deter us. Nor can \nwe ignore the plain fact that it is being pressed by the big business \nlobbyists whom my friend Russ Feingold has called ``the Washington \nGatekeepers,'' the ones who in many cases decide who get the largest \ncontributions. These folks, as the Senator points out, are the ones \n``who transfer the money to the politicians and produce the legislative \nvotes that go with it.''\n  The American people must not--and I believe they will not--be fooled \nby these attempts at sabotage. This is not a complex issue. All of us \nface a stark, but simple choice--a choice between the disgraceful \nstatus quo and an important step forward. Despite the efforts to muddy \nthe waters, we can and should prevail--especially if all those hearing \nand reading about this debate will let their voices be heard now by \ncontacting their own Senators.\n  Mr. President, I want to strongly emphasize one point--the single \nmost important point today, in fact the only important point today--as \nwe approach this vote on this amendment. Do not be deceived by this \ncomplicated explanation or that complex rationale. Do not be misled by \ndiversions and red herrings. Understand this vote for what it is. This \nis the most important vote the 105th Congress will have cast to date on \ncampaign finance.\n  It is, in essence, stunningly simple. Because this vote will show \nwhich Senators are for real campaign finance reform and which Senators \nare against real campaign finance reform.\n  There is no place to run, and no place to hide. If a Senator is for \nreal campaign finance reform--for reducing the influence of special \ninterest money on the key decisions of our democracy--he or she will \nvote for the McCain-Feingold amendment. If a Senator votes against this \namendment, no one will need further evidence that, despite all the \nlofty rhetoric about constitutionality, about freedom of speech, about \npersonal rights, and all the rest, that Senator is not committed to \nreal campaign finance reform. If McCain-Feingold prevails on this vote, \nthe effort goes on. If the opponents of reform defeat this amendment, \nthey have prevailed for the 105th Congress.\n  Perhaps yesterday's New York Times said it best:\n\n       It is too early to predict how this fight will turn out. \n     But when it ends, Americans will know where each Senator \n     stands on protecting his or her own integrity and the \n     integrity of government decision-making from money delivered \n     with the intention to corrupt.\n\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the McCain-Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is without any question the most important vote \nwe will have had in this Congress and no one should mistake that this \nvote is about the First Amendment or that this vote is about one \ngenuine alternative versus another. It is really a choice between those \nwho want to keep campaign finance reform alive, those who really want \nto vote for campaign finance reform, and those who don't.\n  Every conversation on the Hill reflects that. There are countless \nquotes that have appeared from individuals on the other side of the \naisle in the House or Senate, talking to their colleagues about how \nthis is really a vote about institutional power and the capacity to \nstay in power and be elected. The simple reality is that all Americans \nare coming to understand is that Republicans have a stronger finance \nbase, they have raised more money, more easily, they pour more money \ninto campaigns, and money is what is deciding who represents people in \nthe United States of America.\n  Last year, the House and Senate candidates spent $765 million, a 76 \npercent increase over 1990 and a sixfold increase from 1976. We have \nseen voting in America go down from 63 percent in 1960 to 49 percent in \nthe last election because increasingly Americans are separated from a \nGovernment that they know is controlled by the money.\n  The fact is that in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where I ran for \nre-election last year I spent $12 million to run for the U.S. Senate. I \nhad\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\nnever spent more than $2.5 or $3 million on media alone in a previous \nrace. That is a measure of the escalating costs of campaigning under \nthe system in place today.\n  In a recent speech, Bill Moyers quoted Barry Goldwater, a leader of \nthe conservative movement in this country, who reminded us 10 years ago \nthat the Founding Fathers knew that ``liberty depended on honest \nelections'' and that ``corruption destroyed the prime requisite of \nconstitutional liberty, an independent legislature free from any \ninfluence other than that of the people'' to be successful.\n  Senator Goldwater also said ``. . . Representative government assumes \nthat elections will be controlled by the citizenry at large, not by \nthose who give the most money. Electors must believe their vote counts. \nElected officials must owe their allegiance to the people, not to their \nown wealth or to the wealth of interest groups who speak only for the \nselfish fringes of the whole community.''\n  So that is what this vote is about today.\n  Mr. President, to those who hide behind the First Amendment, let me \nmake it clear that there is nothing in the First Amendment that \nprohibits a ban on soft money or prohibits what we seek to do in this \nlegislation.\n  Simply put, a very distinguished group of 124 law professors from \nacross the country has pointed out that there is nothing in the 1976 \nSupreme Court decision of Buckley v. Valeo that even suggests a problem \nin restricting or banning soft money contributions. Last September, \nthose distinguished constitutional scholars sent a letter to the \nsponsors of this amendment and they said we need to remember that the \nBuckley decision expressly reaffirmed the right to ban all hard money, \ncorporate and union political contributions in Federal elections. And \nit stated that Congress specifically has a basis for finding a \n``primary governmental interest in the prevention of actual corruption \nor the appearance of corruption in the political process.'' More than \ntwenty years ago, Mr. President, the High Court recognized the \npotential for corruption inherent in the large campaign contributions \nthat corporations and labor organizations could generate.\n  In the more recent 1990 Supreme Court case of Austin v. Michigan \nChamber of Commerce, these scholars pointed out, ``the Court found that \ncorporations can be walled off from the electoral process by forbidding \nboth contributions and independent expenditures from general corporate \ntreasuries.''\n  Mr. President, it is clear not only in that language, but in the \nlanguage of Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC--\nwhich the other side often tries to cite to the contrary --there is a \ncertainly a legitimate basis for banning soft money consistent with the \nother restraints that the Court has already found permissible with \nrespect to hard money. The Supreme Court said there that it could \nindeed understand how Congress might ``conclude that the potential for \nevasion of the individual contribution limits was a serious matter,'' \nand might indeed ``decide to change the statute's limitations on \ncontributions to political parties.'' And it's absolutely inconsistent \nthat we should be allowed to set limits on campaign contributions, \nwhich we are allowed to--that we are allowed to have Federal limits on \nthe total amount of contributions somebody can make--$25,000--and not \nbe able to restrict in the context of soft money, the same kinds of \ncontributions.\n\n  So, Mr. President, this is about power and money. And most people in \nAmerica understand precisely what is going on here. Our colleagues have \nan opportunity to vote for reform, and I hope they will embrace that \ntoday. If they don't, it will be clear who stands in the way of that \nreform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this has been a great debate. I think \nabout the abilities of those of us in this body to participate in \nunlimited debate, and I think it is a great thing. Great and free \ndebate is a characteristic of American society. Unfortunately, people \nuse the freedom and the money they raise sometimes to run negative ads. \nI certainly see nothing in McCain-Feingold that would stop that kind of \nactivity from happening. But this is an important vote. As a matter of \nfact, I consider it a very fundamental and crucial vote for America.\n  In my 1996 campaign, just over a year ago, in the primary, I faced \nseven Republican candidates. Two of them were multimillionaires, and \ntwo of those individuals spent $1 million-plus out of their own pockets \nto further their dream of being elected to this great body. They used \nmost of it to attack me. I was attorney general, I was leading in the \npolls, and I took most of the brunt of that. Two other individuals in \nthat race raised or spent themselves over a half-million dollars to \nattempt to put their message out to the Alabama people. I spent \napproximately a million dollars during that primary. I was outspent $5 \nmillion to $1 million in that primary. And then in the general \nelection, there was also a very vigorous and contested general \nelection. My opponent spent approximately $3 million, as I recall, in \nthat race.\n  One of the key parts of that race and one of the things that was most \ninteresting and painful to me was that I was attacked and received a \nvolume of attack ads from money that really was raised by the Alabama \nTrial Lawyers Association. You see, in Alabama, there is a contested, \nbitter fight over the attempt by many in the Alabama legislature to \nreduce the aberrationally high verdicts in plaintiff litigation in the \nState. It embarrassed the State and there was a bitter fight over it.\n  The Trial Lawyers Association, which wanted to continue to file those \nlawsuits and receive those big verdicts opposed that legislation. It \nwas bitterly fought over. Tort reform passed the house of \nrepresentatives twice but twice it failed in the Alabama State Senate. \nMy opponent was the chairman of the senate judiciary committee, where \nmost of those bills died. He was also, himself personally, a plaintiff \ntrial lawyer. He had a plaintiff trial lawyer lawsuit filed during the \nelection. He was suing somebody for fraud during the election. That was \nan important issue. It was an issue that the people of Alabama needed \nto discuss and know about. The Trial Lawyers Association raised, I \nguess, what you would call ``soft money'' in the amount of around a \nmillion dollars to express their views and to oppose me because I took \na different view.\n  Earlier today, I saw somebody with a chart that had an ad similar to \nthe ad that was run against me. It complained about an attorney \ngeneral--obviously, in a different State--and it said, ``if you don't \nlike what he did, call his office and complain.'' This was their \nattempt to get around some of the campaign expenditure rules and laws \nthat existed in our country. We faced those ads and were frustrated by \nthem.\n  When I came here to this body, I was prepared to consider what we \ncould do to fix that situation. Frankly, I was not happy with having \nsuch a sum of money being raised and used against me in my campaign. I \nhave given it a lot of thought. I talked to the manager, the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, and others. I \nhave done some research. I have considered the Constitution and what I \nbelieve is fair and just and consistent with the great American \ndemocracy of which we are a part. Based on that, I have concluded that \nwe must fundamentally recognize the primacy of the first amendment, \nwhich provides to all Americans the right of free speech. That includes \nthe right to spend money to project your views, as the Supreme Court \nhas said. To limit that is a historic event and an unhealthy event, in \nmy opinion.\n  They say, ``Jeff, we are not trying to limit people's free speech; we \njust want to limit your speech during a campaign, just during an \nelection cycle.'' When do people want to speak out most if it is not \nduring a campaign? Isn't it then that people are most focused on the \nissues and have the greatest opportunity to change the direction of \ntheir country? Isn't that when they want to speak out? It certainly is. \nIf you want to limit free speech, I say to you that the last place you \nwant to limit it, is during a campaign cycle. That would be terribly \ndisruptive of freedom in America.\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\n  Now, they say, ``Well, it really doesn't interfere with the first \namendment.'' But I was on this floor, Mr. President, early last year--\nin March of last year, as I recall--when the Democratic leader and \nother Members of this body proposed--and people have forgotten this--a \nconstitutional amendment to amend the first amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, to justify their attempt to control free debate in \nAmerica during an election cycle. It was an attempt to reduce the \nexpenditures during that election cycle and give this Congress, \nincumbent politicians, the right to restrict their opponents' ability \nto campaign against them. I thought that was a thunderous event.\n\n  I said at the time that I considered that a retreat from the \nprinciples of the great democracy of which we are a part--as a matter \nof fact, the largest retreat in my lifetime, maybe the largest retreat \nin the history of this country. And, amazingly, 38 Senators voted for \nit. You have to have two-thirds, and that was not nearly enough to pass \nthis body. But I was astounded that we would have that. But at least \nthose people who favored the amending of the first amendment were \nhonest about it. They knew what they were attempting to do with \nelection campaign finance reform, and that is to affect the ability of \npeople to raise money to articulate their views during an election \ncycle and that a constitutional change was needed to effect such a \nchange.\n  So, Mr. President, I have a lot of issues that could be discussed \nhere. I am not going to go into any others. I simply say that I believe \nthis is a historic vote. I think it does, in fact, reflect our \ncontemporary view of the importance of the right of free speech. We \nhave had the American Civil Liberties Union and other free speech \ngroups opposing McCain-Feingold because they are principled in that \nregard. But others who have, in the past, been champions of free speech \ncuriously are now attempting to pass this legislation, which I think \nwould restrict the ability of Americans to speak out aggressively and \ncriticize incumbent officeholders and attempt to remove them from \noffice and express their views in a way they feel is important.\n  So, Mr. President, those are my thoughts on the matter. I will be \nopposing this legislation. As to the question of union contributions, \ndues being used against the will of the members, against their own \nviews on political issues, I think that is something we could legislate \non. Somebody said such a change would be a ``poison pill'' for campaign \nfinance reform. Well, it is a poison pill to me. I am not going to \nsupport any campaign reform that is going to allow somebody's money to \nbe taken and spent on political issues they may oppose.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nhis important contribution. It seems to me that it shows real \nprinciple. When you have been through a campaign and you have had \nindependent expenditures or issue advocacy--either one--used against \nyou and you didn't like it, but you fully recognize that it is \nconstitutionally protected speech, that is commendable. So I thank the \nSenator from Alabama for his important contribution to this debate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin. Mr. \nPresident, I think the previous speakers have demonstrated--speaking of \nthe Senator from Alabama--that this debate is more than just about \nmoney. It really is about our core values and what kind of people we \nare in this country.\n  The argument made on this floor that money is equal to speech is to \nsuggest then that the poor can't speak as loudly as the rich. The \nreality check is that money magnifies speech, particularly in these \ntimes when money can buy technology and access to the mass media in \nways that were not available, of course, when the Constitution was \nwritten. To suggest that money is equal to speech is the same thing as \nsaying that the rich and the poor have equal rights to sleep under \nbridges. We have heard that analogy before. We know that is abject \nnonsense. So it is, in my opinion, abject nonsense to suggest that in a \ncontext in which money buys elections the poor have the same rights as \nthe rich. That does not comport with reality.\n  The reality check is--and the people know that to be the case; they \nknow that right now--money plays such a role as to buy elections and \nthat elections dictate the direction of our democracy. And so this \ndebate really is about a crisis of inestimable proportion going to the \ncore of what kind of democracy we are going to enjoy in this country.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate is again turning its attention to \nS. 25. It is certainly not a perfect bill. It does not solve all of the \nproblems created by the current state of the law. However, it at least \nbrings us a little bit closer to the sort of comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform that I believe we all desperately need. We have, in my \nopinion, a responsibility to restore the faith of the American people \nin the political process that our democracy is as equally open to the \npoor as it is to the wealthy, that every citizen has the same and equal \nright to participate in the process of elections and, therefore, the \nsame and equal rights to dictate the direction of our Government.\n  At the present time, too many people feel removed from the decisions \nthat affect them in their lives. Many do not believe they are capable \nof influencing their Government's policies. A League of Women Voters' \nstudy found that one of the top three reasons that people fail to vote \nis the belief that their vote will not make a difference. We saw an \nexpression of the cynicism during the 1994 elections when just 38 \npercent of all registered voters cast their ballots. We saw it again in \n1996 when only 49 percent of the voting age population turned out to \nvote--the lowest proportion in some 72 years.\n  I have noticed in my own State of Illinois a falloff in voter \nparticipation and turnout. In 1992, Mr. President, I won my election \nfor the Senate with 2.6 million votes, which represented 53 percent of \nthe total vote. By 1996, when Senator Durbin ran, he won with 2.3 \nmillion votes, which was 55 percent of the total votes. Senator Durbin, \nin other words, won by a greater margin but with fewer votes cast. And \nif our citizens continue to participate in the electoral process in \nfewer and fewer numbers, the United States runs the risk of \njeopardizing its standing as the greatest democracy on Earth.\n\n  Now, campaign finance is diminishing our democracy. Consider for a \nmoment the fact that 59 percent of the respondents in the Gallup/USA \nToday poll agreed with the statement ``Elections are for sale to \nwhoever can raise the most money'' while only 37 percent agreed with \nthe statement ``Elections are won on the basis of who's the best \ncandidate.'' What is causing this perception? The people are aware that \nwe are spending more on congressional campaigns than we ever have \nbefore. The Federal Election Commission has reported that congressional \ncandidates spent a record-setting total of $765.3 million in the 1996 \nelections. That represents an incredible 71 percent increase over the \n1990 level of $446.3 million. And those numbers do not even take into \naccount the massive expenditures of ``soft money'' by political parties \non behalf of House and Senate candidates.\n  The average winning campaign for the House cost over $673,000 in \n1996. That's a 30 percent increase over 1994, when the average House \nseat cost its occupant $516,000. In 1996, 94 candidates for the House \nspent more than a million dollars to get elected. Winning Senate \ncandidates spent an average of $4.7 million in 1996. In that year, 92 \npercent of House races and 88 percent of Senate races were won by the \ncandidate who spent the most money. Forty-three of the 53 open-seat \nHouse races and 12 of the 14 open-seat Senate races were won by the \ncandidate who spent the most money.\n  One of the major factors responsible for these huge costs increases \nin the avalanche of negative advertising that has muddied the political \nlandscape in recent years. Political figures have come to rightly \nexpect that they will be attacked from every imaginable angle come \nelection time and are raising more and more money to fend off charges \nthat often have nothing to do with the people's business. Moreover, \npolitics has become so vicious and negative over the last few years \nthat able public officials are leaving public service and potentially \noutstanding candidates are choosing not to run at all.\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\n These individuals know that politicians today have to spend a large \nportion of their time raising money, and that is simply not an \nattractive job description for many people capable of making \noutstanding contributions to our government. For example, in explaining \nhis retirement from government service, former Senator Paul Simon, one \nof the most able individuals ever to sit in this chamber, cited \nfundraising responsibilities as a burden that he no longer wished to \nbear.\n  All of the problems associated with the immense role that money plays \nin the electoral system have been exacerbated in recent years by an \nincrease in the number of wealthy candidates contributing outlandish \nsums to their own campaigns. In 1994, for example, one candidate for \nthe Senate spent a record $29 million, 94 percent of which was his own \nmoney. During the 1996 election cycle, candidates for federal office \ncontributed $161 million to their own campaigns. One presidential \ncandidate helped finance his campaign with $37.4 million of his own \nmoney. Fifty-four Senate candidates and 91 House candidates put \n$100,000 or more of their own money into their campaigns, either \nthrough contributions or loans. It is true that in 1996 only 19 of \nthose candidates won their elections, but the fact remains that the \ncurrent system allows such candidates to drive up the costs of \ncampaigns and make it more difficult for average citizens to contend \nfor political office. If we allow this trend to continue, it won't be \nlong before only the wealthiest Americans will be able to fully \nparticipate in the political process.\n  The time has come to reduce the role that money plays in our \nelectoral system. Besides providing elected officials with more time to \ntend to the people's business, doing so will result in fewer negative \nads, for if a candidate has less money to spend or faces a spending \nlimit, he or she will have to be more careful about how expenditures \nare made. The capacity to run fewer ads would help ensure that \ncandidates focus on establishing a connection with the voters by using \ntelevision and radio time to discuss their stands on the issues, \ninstead of running negative ads.\n  S. 25 and an amendment to the bill that I understand its \ndistinguished authors plan to introduce takes significant steps in the \nright direction. The bill would ban ``soft money\" contributions to \nnational political parties and would bar political parties from making \n``coordinated expenditures'' on behalf of Senate candidates who do not \nagree to limit their personal spending to $50,000 per election. The \nproposed amendment would create a voluntary system to provide Senate \ncandidates with a 50 percent discount on television costs if they agree \nto raise a majority of their campaign funds from their home states, to \naccept no more than 25 percent of their campaign funds in aggregate PAC \ncontributions, and to limit their personal spending to $50,000 per \nelection.\n  Ideally, S. 25 would place an absolute limit on the ability of \ncandidates to fund their own campaigns. In Buckley v. Valeo, the \nSupreme Court ruled that limitations on candidate expenditures from \npersonal funds place direct and substantial restrictions on their \nability to exercise their First Amendment rights. It may be time to \nrevisit the Buckley decision by passing legislation tailored closely \naround what the Court said. Putting the issue back in front of the \nCourt would give it the opportunity to clarify how the position it took \nin 1976 is supposed to govern campaign finance law in the very \ndifferent era in which we now live.\n  In Buckley, the Court struck down a provision of the 1971 Federal \nElection Campaign Act that barred presidential candidates from spending \nmore than $50,000 out of personal resources. As three distinguished law \nprofessors at the University of Chicago have stated, it is possible \nthat, with a new set of legislative findings, the Court might uphold a \nstatute that imposed significantly more generous limits. . . [T]he \nCourt might find that with a much more generous (though not unlimited) \nopportunity for candidates to spend their own money, the infringement \nof individual freedom is less severe--perhaps not ``substantial,'' in \nthe Court's language.\n  One argument for such a provision is that an important element of the \ndemocratic process is requiring that candidates demonstrate support \nfrom a broad range of individuals. Legislation of this type would be \nsimilar in intent to laws requiring candidates to obtain a minimum \nnumber of petition signatures in order to secure a place on the ballot. \nSuch legislation would arguably be consistent with Buckley, for in that \ncase the Court recognized that the government has ``important interests \nin limiting places on the ballot to those candidates who demonstrate \nsubstantial popular support.'' Given the crucial role that money plays \nin today's elections, it is not unreasonable to ask the Court to extend \nits interpretation of what constitutes ``substantial popular support'' \ninto the realm of campaign financing.\n  The most effective approach to comprehensive campaign finance reform \nwould be legislation establishing overall campaign spending limits. If \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Buckley is regarded as prohibiting the \nenactment of mandatory caps on overall campaign spending, then we \nshould at least create a system that offers candidates cost-reducing \nbenefits in exchange for their voluntary compliance with such caps. The \nCourt has made clear that such a voluntary system would be \nconstitutional. Overall spending limits would not only open up our \nsystem to greater competition, they would help to shift the focus of \nelections from advertising to issues. Until we cap runaway campaign \nspending, we will only be working at the margins of a problem that is \nturning our electoral system--one of the pillars of our cherished \ndemocracy--into a grotesque circus of saturation (and frequently \nnegative) advertising and round-the-clock fundraising.\n  S. 25 may not effect the type of far-reaching reforms that I would \nlike to see, but I strongly approve of its goals and spirit. The time \nhas come for us to send a signal that we share our fellow citizens' \nconcerns regarding the enormous role that money has come to play in our \npolitical system. Passing S. 25 would send that signal and would place \nus on the road toward creating a system in which the people's \npriorities would be our own. I therefore urge my colleagues to support \nthe bill.\n  I commend my colleagues, the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator \nfrom Arizona, for their perseverance in this important area and say to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona, this may be \none stage in the battle. But it seems to me that we have an absolute \nresponsibility to cure this corrupt system. And it is a corrupt system. \nIt is full of mousetraps. It favors people who are wealthy over people \nwho are working class, ordinary citizens, and it is having a \ndiminishing effect on our democracy and the people's faith in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the last 5 years we have been \ndebating the issue of campaign finance reform and for the last 5 years \nwe have failed to fix the system that most Americans agree is broken. I \nhave voted for campaign reform legislation several times now, and each \ntime it has been killed off by filibuster. Today we are once again \npresented with the opportunity to do what is right and stop the rising \ntide of special interest money that is drowning the democratic process.\n  We last debated the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill in \nOctober. Since that time the bipartisan group of Senators committed to \nreform has continued to work together to build a coalition and to craft \na measure that is fair and offers meaningful change. I have been proud \nto support that effort.\n  Changing the status quo has been an uphill battle. The opponents of \nreform cleverly disguise their argument. They wrap themselves in the \nflag and posture as protectors of ``free speech.'' They make \ncomplicated and convoluted arguments about ``threats to the \nConstitution.'' but here's what they are really saying: if you have \nmore money, you are entitled to more influence over campaigns and \nelections. People out there find this argument to be a cynical charade \nand it's time to stop playing games.\n  The opponents of reform are just not listening. The American people \nhave been calling for reform for years, and now the call is louder than \never.\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\nEighty-nine percent of the American people believe fundamental changes \nare needed in the way campaigns are funded. We were elected to \nrepresent the American people. We cannot continue to ignore their \nwishes.\n  The campaign system is clogged with money, and there is no room left \nfor the average voter. The last time we debated reform, I told a story \nof a woman who sent my campaign a small contribution of fifteen \ndollars. With her check she enclosed a note that said, ``please make \nsure my voice means as much as those who give thousands.'' With all due \nrespect, this woman is typical of the people who deserve our best \nrepresentation. Sadly, under the current campaign system, they rarely \ndo.\n  In 1996, $2.4 billion was raised by parties and candidates. Let me \nsay that again: $2.4 billion flowed into campaigns all across the \ncountry and dictated the terms of our elections. And as if that weren't \nenough, hundreds of millions more were spent on so-called ``issue \nadvocacy''. Nobody knows exactly how much more because these ads, even \nthough they are political, are unregulated.\n  Currently there is no disclosure requirement for these expenditures, \nthere is no ban on corporate or union money, and there is no limit on \nhow much can be spent. ``Issue ads'' frequently take the form of \nnegative attacks made against candidates by groups that no one has ever \nheard of. Because of the current weak laws, the American people don't \nknow who are making these charges, what their agenda is and who is \npaying for it. The bill we are considering today would change that by \nstrengthening the definition of political advertising to include these \nsorts of expenditures. We need more accountability, not less.\n  My first Senate campaign was a grassroots effort. I was out spent \nnearly three-to-one by a congressional incumbent. But because I had a \nstrong, people-based effort, I was able to win. I am proud of the \ncontributions I have received for my campaign.\n  And I am willing to put my money where my mouth is. I hope to offer \nan amendment to implement full disclosure of campaign contributions. \nUnder current law, the names and addresses of contributors who give \nmore than $50 at a time or $200 in aggregate must be disclosed. My \namendment would drop those numbers down to zero. Under my amendment \nevery contribution to a PAC or a campaign must be disclosed.\n  Having full disclosure for campaign contributions is like listing the \nnutritional facts on a candy bar: the public deserves to know what it's \nmade of.\n  But I also want to make a pledge. Whether or not my amendment passes, \nI still intend to tell my constituents everything about who is \ncontributing to my campaign. I will make full disclosure of all my \ncontributions, no matter how big or how small. This is my commitment, \nthis is my pledge. I challenge all of my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of reform miss the point. In America, \nmoney does not equal speech. More money does not entitle one to more \nspeech. The powerful are not entitled to a greater voice in politics \nthan average people. In America, everyone has an equal say in our \nGovernment. That is why our Declaration of Independence starts with, \n``We, the people.''\n  Mr. President, I believe we have made this debate way too \ncomplicated. This issue boils down to one basic question: Are you for \nreform, or against is? Are you with the people, or against them on the \nneed for a more healthy democracy? The votes we are taking today will \nshow the answers to these questions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 27 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank Senator McConnell for his \nleadership on this issue. I also thank Senator Feingold and Senator \nMcCain.\n  I would like to point out to the American people, this is not a \ndebate between good people and bad people. I note, however, that many \nwho are for this bill have stated that those who are against it are \nhiding behind the first amendment. I don't propose to hide behind it. I \npropose to stand up today and defend it. Let me read to you, for the \nRecord, what the first amendment to the Constitution says:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition \n     the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  We are talking about the whole second half of this amendment, about \nhow people petition Government for the redress of grievances, how they \nspeak about Government. It is amazing to me that some of those who are \nfor this bill point out how money is buying offices. My friend, the \nSenator from Washington, pointed out how she was outspent 3 to 1, but \nshe is here! I notice Senator Feinstein is here. She had an opponent \nwho spent, I think, nearly $30 million of his own money! I do not yet \nknow of a President Ross Perot, though he's one of the biggest \nadvocates of this and spent millions of his own trying to make his \ncase.\n  The point is, this is a legitimate issue for the people to decide. \nThen the attack is made on soft money, and PACs have become a very bad \nword. Do people remember that PACs were created as an outgrowth of \nWatergate, to clean up campaign finance? This is a product of \nWatergate. If you break down what it is a PAC is--some of them I don't \nreally like because they stand for things I don't like. But some of \nthem I do like; for example, the National Right to Life PAC. They talk \nabout wealthy people? I look at that organization and I see humble \nfolks who are defending a principle that is sacred to them. These are \nnot wealthy people, but they are enjoying their right to speak.\n  I want to make one other candid admission to the American people. \nRepublicans spend an awful lot of time attacking the Democrat use of \nunion money, compulsory union dues that are used in attacks on \nRepublicans. We attack their major asset. The Democrats attack the \nRepublicans' major asset, which is in some cases the use of PACs, or \nsoft money. Any campaign finance reform that does not include both of \nthese elements will disserve the American people and I will not vote \nfor those things, because at the end of the day what will happen to \nAmerica is what happened to Oregon in a recent election cycle.\n  We had a well-meaning public interest group that, through our \ninitiative system, instituted a campaign finance law not unlike McCain-\nFeingold. It applied to State candidates. Let me tell you what \nhappened. Contributions to candidates directly, were severely \nrestricted and, in a nutshell, candidates could not raise enough money \nto communicate with the people whose attention they were trying to get. \nBut the money wasn't taken out of politics; it simply left direct \ndemocracy, which is disclosable to the public, and it went back into \nthe smoke-filled rooms. Then various groups colluded and figured out \nhow they could influence elections, not with a candidate, but about a \ncandidate. And they did it with the luxury of knowing that they were \nnot accountable to the American people, they could not be held \naccountable, so they could say or do anything they wanted.\n\n  So what we went through in Oregon, before our State supreme court \ndeclared it all a violation of the first amendment, was a cycle whereby \ncandidates, were terribly frustrated, and so were our citizens. In the \nend, I have to say, what we should be encouraging is not a return to \nthe smoke-filled rooms; we should be encouraging people to contribute \ndirectly to candidates and to fully disclose it.\n  I have to say that I have experienced this also on a personal level; \nI have run for the U.S. Senate twice. The first time I ran, I put a lot \nof my own money into the race. And, folks, I didn't win. And then I ran \nagain, and I did win, and I won with the contributions of perhaps more \nindividual contributions than have ever been raised by an Oregon \ncandidate for Federal office in our history. So you cannot buy \nelections.\n  During my first election I had one conservative PAC director tell me \nthat\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\nduring January of 1996 it was the best time he could remember in \nWashington because there were no liberals here. They were all in \nOregon, beating the stuffings out of me. They said horrible things \nabout me. I didn't like it. It wasn't fun. But you know what, I am \nstanding here today defending their right to say it. But don't tie my \nhands and say I can't respond to it, because you, the people of this \ncountry, will then be the ones disserved by all of this.\n  So, if you really have concluded that we have too much political \nspeech in this country, insist that this Chamber disenfranchise soft \nmoney and unions, and then you are talking about something. But before \nyou do that, ask yourself the question, do we talk too much about \npolitics in this country? Is it a bad thing that we are doing? I \nbelieve the answer to that is no. And if you want the proof of it, open \nup Newsweek or Time or U.S. News & World Report on any given day in any \nweek and you will see the bodies of people in other countries in the \ngutters of their streets, because they have not learned how to fight \nwith words and not with bullets.\n  So, let's be careful as we talk about amending the most important \ndocument that we have. Don't fall for the easy way out, that somehow we \nare not affecting speech. We are. I have seen it in Oregon and we will \nsee it in this country if this passes in this form. So I stand today \nproudly, not to hide behind the first amendment but to defend it, and \nthank the leader for this time, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment in its current form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his extremely \nvaluable contribution to this debate. He understands this issue very \nwell and has experienced both the heartbreak of defeat and the \nexhilaration of victory. I certainly share his view that we do not \nsuffer from too little political discussion in this country. We ought \nto be encouraging more of it, not less. I thank the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me start by recognizing the amount of work and effort that \nSenator McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky, has done on this issue. \nAt a time early on, I can recall in this debate when it seemed like \nthis thing may take off across America, and Senator McConnell, even in \nthe face of his own tough reelection, stood firm and led us, all of us \nin this body, on this issue. He is knowledgeable, to say the least, and \nhas been a great leader not only leading us on this issue but, more \nimportant, leading the fight to protect and defend the first amendment \nto the Constitution of the United States.\n  I say with great respect for my friend--I know I embarrass him a \nlittle bit--this has been one of the major debates in this Congress \nsince I have been here, with the possible exception perhaps of the \nPersian Gulf war in 1991, but this goes to the heart of the first \namendment. And the Senator from Kentucky stood strong day after day, \nsometimes by himself, I remember, leading a filibuster. I remember \nbeing here at 5 o'clock in the morning, to the marching orders of my \nleader to be out here in a filibuster. The Senator was right, and \nhistory will prove that he was right. So there is a great debt of \ngratitude that I think--he may not realize it at the moment, but it \nwill come his way.\n  I want to add a few remarks to the debate. Much has been said and \nthere is not too much more to add. I was somewhat taken by some of the \nremarks of my colleagues on the other side about special interests. We \nhear a lot about that. I think you can pretty well come to the \nconclusion that if you don't like somebody's views, they are special \ninterests. But if you do like their views, they are probably \nresponsible policy advocates.\n  This is where the whole debate gets kinds of silly. There are a lot \nof people who have special interests. The Breast Cancer Institute is a \nspecial interest. Social Security recipients are special interests. But \nI don't get the impression that some of our folks over there would be \nlabeling them special interests in the context of what has been \ndefined.\n  There are many reasons why McCain-Feingold is the wrong approach, but \nI just want to focus on a couple and specifically title II.\n  Under title II of McCain-Feingold, it purports to draw a new bright \nline between issue ads and independent expenditures. As so many have \nsaid before, I had expenditures against me. I would have loved to have \nseen them off the air, but I had the opportunity to respond to them. As \nmany have said before me, however close, I made it back because I did \nhave the opportunity to respond, thanks to thousands of people who were \nthere to help me with contributions so that I could respond.\n  Many citizen organizations have expressed strong opposition to these \nissue-advocacy provisions. The Christian Coalition, for example, in a \nletter dated January 28 of this year urged the Senate to defeat McCain-\nFeingold because ``this legislation essentially requires that if a \ncitizen or group plans to advocate a position or report on votes \ncandidates have cast, they must operate a PAC and comply with all the \nregulatory burdens that go with it. More Government control over what \nis said and how it is said is not what campaign finance reform should \nbe about.''\n  They are correct in that assessment.\n  The National Right to Life Committee sent letters to Senators on \nFebruary 17 of this year saying:\n\n       Title II of McCain-Feingold would radically expand the \n     definition of the key legal terms expenditure, contribution \n     and coordination, so as to effectively ban citizen groups \n     from engaging in many constitutionally protected issue \n     advocacy activities.\n\n  Lest you think I am singling out groups that may be more inclined to \nbe Republican, we can also take a letter dated February 19 from the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union--certainly one of the leading \norganizations, I would say, not exactly ideologically with the right--\nthey characterize title II as ``a 2-month blackout on all radio and \ntelevision advertising before primary and general elections.''\n  The ACLU continues by noting:\n\n       Under McCain-Feingold, the only individuals and groups that \n     will be able to characterize a candidate's record on radio \n     and TV during the 60-day period would be the candidate, the \n     PACs and the media.\n\n  That last point made by the ACLU is very interesting, Mr. President, \nbecause by limiting what issue groups can say during the 60 days before \nan election, McCain-Feingold would increase the power of the media, \nwhich may be the reason why they have been so silent in this debate.\n  We are picking and choosing what part of the first amendment we want \nto protect, and of all people, the media should understand that. I \nthink they do understand it and they are being very silent. I was \nparticularly taken by the Senator from California a few moments ago \nwhen she said more money by candidates who have access to more money is \nnot fair. I think that is pretty much what she said. I think I \ncharacterized it correctly. It is not fair or it is not right to have \npeople with more money or access to more money.\n  What about newspapers that have more money than other newspapers, is \nthat fair? Should we restrict the New York Times and the Washington \nPost 60 days out so that they can be as fair as some small paper in \nLouisville, KY, or Wolfeboro, NH? Maybe we ought to even that out. \nThere seems to be a lot of silence in regard to that. It is ironic that \nso much of the media supports these restrictions on free speech of \npolitical candidates and groups, and even more ironic is the silence. \nIt is deafening.\n  I can just imagine the cry if the Government tried to restrict the \nfreedom of the press or say how many words, as the Senator said this \nmorning, that Dan Rather can speak. I hear him speak so much I get sick \nof it, but it is his right to speak, and I would certainly protect that \nright, as we are doing today with our votes on the Senate floor. I hope \nMr. Rather is taking note that we are protecting his rights to speak. \nBut I hope that they will speak to protect our rights and to protect \nthe rights of others to participate\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\nin the political process who don't have access to the national media to \nspeak every day to the listeners. There are thousands of people out \nthere, and they do it by contributing to a political campaign.\n  Beyond the very serious issues raised by the specific issue-advocacy \nprovisions in title II of McCain-Feingold, I have a more general \nconcern, and this is something, Mr. President, that I think has not \nreally been stated firmly in this debate.\n  There is a premise, and I think it is an erroneous premise, and I say \nthis to the Senator from Kentucky because I think this is something \nthat may not have been brought out quite as much, that money is the \ncorrupting factor here, that money in and of itself corrupts. I say to \nthe Senator, does money corrupt when we do research for cancer? Does \nmoney corrupt when we give to charity and help millions of people? Does \nmoney corrupt when we ask for more money for education, indeed, higher \neducation to allow kids to go to college, does that corrupt? I don't \nthink so.\n  Let me say it in another way. If I am in a store or any American \ncitizen is in a store somewhere, and as I am walking down the aisle \nlooking for something to purchase, I see a wallet on the floor. I reach \ndown and pick up the wallet and there is $5,000 in the wallet and a \nname. I have two options: I can put the wallet in my pocket and walk \nout of the store, or I can take the wallet up to the counter and give \nit back to the clerk and say, ``Somebody lost their wallet. Here is the \nname. There is $5,000 in it and you can return it.''\n  If you use the logic that money corrupts, everybody keeps the wallet. \nBut everybody doesn't keep the wallet, and the majority of Americans \ndon't keep the wallet. That is the issue here. If the shoe fits, wear \nit; if money corrupts you, maybe you shouldn't be here. I have never \nbeen asked for anything for the money. Nobody has ever asked me for a \nvote, and I wouldn't give it to them and I would be insulted if \nsomebody thought I would, and if somebody thought I would then they \nought not elect me and vote for me. That is how strongly I feel about \nit.\n  Fundamentally, McCain-Feingold is unconstitutional. That is the \nbottom line, as the Supreme Court said in Buckley versus Valeo, 9 to 0, \nliberals and conservatives on the Court.\n  We also hear a lot about how we give special access to those who give \nus money. It is never reported in any of the stories, but yes, sure, \npeople give money and they might see me or Senator McConnell or Senator \nKempthorne or Senator Feingold, sure. But how about the other people \nwho we help get their Social Security checks, who we meet with every \nday or we speak to from this group or that group who we never ask for \nanything, they never give us anything; we just help them every day, day \nin and day out, hundreds of letters we answer, hundreds of people we \nhelp in our constituent offices in our States. Nobody talks about them. \nNobody asks them for money. They can't give money, in most cases. They \njust want good Government and some help. We don't hear about that. If \nyou put it out there and balance it out, you find there is heck of a \nlot more people with access to us who don't have money than people who \ndo.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for an observation? I say to my \nfriend, you know who has the most access to us is the press.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The most access to us. I never heard of an editorial \nwriter complain about access of the press. Have you heard that?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I have not. As I promised you I would \nspeak on this at 2:15 today, it took me until 2:30 to get here because \nI had four minipress conferences coming over on a number of issues, \nfrom Iraq to this and a couple of other issues as well.\n  I, again, commend my leader and proudly, as the Senator from Oregon \nsaid a few moments ago, proudly support the first amendment. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me take a moment and thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for his contribution to this debate. He has very skillfully \npresented the analogy. The wallet story, I think, is a very, very \nimportant addition to the debate and really says a lot about what this \nis all about. In fact, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, \nif you are going to have much of an impact on the political dialog in a \ncountry of 270 million people, you have to be able to amplify your \nvoice, you have to be able to project your voice to large numbers of \ncitizens or your voice isn't very much.\n  Of course, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, Dan Rather, \nTom Brokaw and the rest certainly have more speech than we do. Nobody \nis suggesting that we rein them in. But there are many of us who think \ntheir speech is not very helpful, occasionally, to the political \nprocess. So I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for a very important \nspeech.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If I can respond, on election night, Dan \nRather called my election the other way, and he was wrong. I would not \nhave minded restricting his speech that night, but I still support his \nright to say it and glad he was wrong.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator for his answer. How much time \nremaining do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, once again, I rise to discuss an issue that \nin the recent past has generated lots of talk and not much action--\ncampaign finance reform. But thanks to the hard work of my colleagues--\non both sides of the aisle--we are once again at the brink of doing \nsomething to address the many problems we have with our system for \nfinancing election campaigns.\n  Thanks to the tireless efforts of our colleagues, Senators McCain and \nFeingold, we now know that the question is not whether a bill will come \nto the floor, but whether we will pass the bill that they have brought \nus. Keeping that in mind, I want to speak a bit today on why I support \nthe measure before us.\n  As an original co-sponsor of McCain-Feingold, I agree that what is \nnecessary is a comprehensive overhaul of the way we conduct our \ncampaign business. If we have learned anything from our experiences in \nthe last few elections, it is that money has become too important in \nour campaigns. Mr. President, in the last election federal candidates \nand their allies spent over $2 billion--$2 billion--in support of their \ncampaigns. The McCain-Feingold bill currently before us, I believe, is \nthe sort of sweeping reform that we must pass if we are to restore \npublic trust and return a measure of sanity to the way we finance \nelections.\n  Now each of us has his or her own perspective on what's wrong with \nthe system. For me, Mr. President, it's the explosive cost of \ncampaigning. When I announced in March 1997 that I would not seek \nreelection, I said: ``Democracy as we know it will be lost if we \ncontinue to allow government to become one bought by the highest \nbidder, for the highest bidder. Candidates will simply become bit \nplayers and pawns in a campaign managed and manipulated by paid \nconsultants and hired guns.'' The problem becomes clearer when you look \nat specifics. In my case, when I first was elected to the Senate, I \nspent less than $450,000--actually, $437,482--on my campaign. Back \nthen, I thought that was a lot of money. If only I'd known. Mr. \nPresident, if I hadn't decided to retire, for next year's election I \nwould have had to raise $4.5 million. Now, I know all about inflation \nbut that's not inflation--that's madness. What's worse, I understand \nthat if we continue on this path, by the year 2025 it will cost $145 \nmillion to run for a single Senate seat. Can any of us imagine what our \ncountry will look like when the only people who can afford public \nservice are people who have--or can raise--tens of millions of dollars \nfor their campaigns? I can't imagine such a future, Mr. President--and \nthe time is now to make sure things never get that bad. McCain-Feingold \nwon't cure everything that ails the current system, but I support it \nbecause it represents a real, meaningful first step toward restoring a \nsense of balance in our campaigns by ensuring that people and ideas--\nnot money--are what matters. Specifically, I support McCain-Feingold \nbecause it deals with a series of disturbing issues that have grown in \nimportance in recent years.\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\n  I also agree that a primary problem with the current system is the \nflood of ``soft money.'' But when I speak of soft money, Mr. President, \nI want to make it clear that we are talking about more than just the \nfundraising of the national parties. True--in 1996, the parties raised \nover a quarter billion dollars in soft money, which they then used in \nvarious ways to support their candidates at every level of the ballot. \nThat's a lot of money, but it's only a small part of the total so-\ncalled ``soft money'' picture. That's because soft money is any money \nthat is not regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act. That \nincludes national party money, of course, but it also includes millions \nof dollars raised and spent by independent groups on so-called ``issue \nads.'' Thanks to the excellent work of our colleagues on the Government \nAffairs Committee, we now know that many of these so-called independent \norganizations, many claiming tax-exempt status, are established, \noperated, and financed by parties and candidates themselves--and their \nfinances are totally unregulated. Therefore, McCain-Feingold is \nmeaningful reform because it recognizes that the problem is not just \n``soft'' money, it is ``unregulated'' money.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill is also valuable because it recognizes that \nclosing the party soft money loophole is not enough. The bill also \naddresses the problem of so-called ``issue advocacy'' advertising. \nThese so-called issue ads have developed as a new--and sometimes \ndevious--way that unregulated money is issued to affect elections. \nLawyers might call it ``issue advocacy'', but I'm not a lawyer so I \ncall it what it really is, ``handoff funding''. ``Handoff funding'' is \nwhere a candidate ``hands off'' spending, usually on hard-hitting \nnegative ads, to a supposedly neutral third party whose finances are \ncompletely unregulated and not disclosed. Now I know there are those \nwho call these ads free speech. But this isn't free speech, it's paid \nspeech. Of course we need to respect the Constitution, but we can't let \npeople hide behind the Constitution for their own personal or partisan \ngain. McCain-Feingold draws this paid speech into the light where not \nthe lawyers but the jury--the American people--can decide which issues \nand which candidates they will support.\n  Mr. President, I want to respond just a moment to the claim of many \nof my Republican colleagues that McCain-Feingold's issue advocacy \nreform somehow limits free speech. That simply is not true. When this \nbill passes, not one ad that ran in the last election--not one, not \neven the worst attack ad--will be illegal. What McCain-Feingold would \ndo is say to those candidates and groups who have been using ``handoff \nfunding'' to puff themselves up or tear down their opponents--all the \nwhile claiming that they were simply, quote, ``advocating issues''--is \nthat within 60 days of the election they must take credit for their \nwork, dirty or otherwise. The only people whose speech will be \nprevented by this law are people who are afraid to step into the light \nand be seen for who they are. That, Mr. President, is what I call \nreform--and I think the American people would agree.\n  Another critical issue addressed in McCain-Feingold--and this is one \narea, I think, where we all are in nearly unanimous agreement--is the \nquestion of disclosure. Currently there is too much campaign activity--\ncontributions and spending--that is not disclosed to the public on a \nregular, timely basis. We must commit ourselves, as does McCain-\nFeingold, to providing the American people with timely and full \ndisclosure to information about political spending, and the means by \nwhich they can access that information. Like many colleagues, I believe \nthat the Internet and electronic filing is the way to make this happen; \nbut I hope we will make it clear that all campaign finances--including \nthird-party issue advocacy--are to be disclosed before we get too \nworried about how such disclosure would take place.\n  Mr. President, all these reforms will be meaningless unless we are \nwilling to do right by the Federal Election Commission. If the FEC \nreally is the toothless tiger that many people said it is, we must take \nat least some of the blame for removing its teeth. Any bill that makes \nchanges to the campaign finance laws without restoring the FEC's \nfunding and improving its ability to publicize, investigate, and punish \nviolations cannot truly claim the title of ``reform.''\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I know that we will not have an easy \nroad to passage of campaign finance reform legislation. In this body \nthere are a number of colleagues who are opposed to reform and aren't \nafraid to speak their minds about the quote, ``danger,'' of reform. Mr. \nPresident, I can't blame them. If I had the advantage of millions of \ndollars from wealthy folks and millions more from corporations and \nspecial interests, I would think reform was dangerous, too, and I would \nhave to think twice before supporting a bill that took away that \nadvantage. Their opposition--whether in the public interest or their \nself-interest--means that the debate on this issue will get more than a \nfew of us into a real lather. I'll take that challenge, Mr. President. \nJust because campaign finance reform will be difficult, and might \nrequire each party to give up things it cares about or simply has \ngotten used to, is no reason not to pass McCain-Feingold, and soon.\n  All we need to do is to roll up our selves and remember the wisdom of \nthat great Kentuckian Henry Clay, who called compromise ``mutual \nsacrifice.'' Our way is clear, if not easy, but I have confidence that \nwe will do what is right to restore public confidence in the way we \nfund our campaigns. I look forward to the continuing debate, and to \ndemonstrate to the American people that we are serious about cleaning \nup the system by voting for comprehensive campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. This debate is one of the \nmost important that the Senate will conduct in this session of \nCongress, and I desperately hope it will result in passage of \nmeaningful campaign finance reform.\n  We are beginning another mid-term election year, and the American \npublic is again bracing for the barrage of money, special interest TV \nads, and rhetorical hyperbole that accompany modern campaigns. There is \nnear universal belief in this nation that Congress should do something \nabout our campaign finance laws. We hold weeks of hearings on abuses in \nrecent elections; we document loophole after loophole in the fabric of \nour laws whereby special interest influence campaigns to the detriment \nof our national interests; and we see meaningful, genuine reform \nproposals twisted and maligned by those same groups who are terrified \nat their potential loss of power.\n  This is an old-fashioned debate in Washington, because it's about who \nhas the power and how that power will be used. The McCain-Feingold bill \nseeks to diffuse that power; to level the playing field a little bit in \nfederal campaigns and reduce the amount of special interest money in \nelections. Senators McCain and Feingold have developed a genuine \ncompromise plan. It is not exactly as I would have drafted--or any of \nus, if we had that chance. It is, however, the best chance we have to \nrepair the broken campaign finance system.\n  The modified version of the bill addresses one of the fundamental \nproblems in the system--soft money contributions. By banning these huge \nsums from federal campaigns, we correct many of the problems which were \nexposed last year in hearings before the Senate Government Affairs \nCommittee.\n  The bill also tries to deal with the growing and disturbing impact of \nindependent expenditures. I believe the sponsors of the bill have \nachieved a delicate balance in this area--curtailing the use of this \npractice, while still conforming to constitutional boundaries.\n  Mr. President, there is an extraordinary need for reform of our \nelection laws. Despite the apparent problems--problems that have gotten \nworse with every election--Congress has not passed reform. Our failure \nto act has contributed to a loss of confidence, not only in our \nelectoral system, but in our democracy.\n  The American public has lost faith in government and its \ninstitutions. Americans feel they don't control government because they \nbelieve they don't control elections.\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\n  If you ask people who runs Washington, most will say ``special \ninterests.'' People watch state officials, Members of Congress, and \npresidential candidates chase money, and believe that's the only way to \nget your voice heard in Washington. They see televised campaign finance \nhearings, allegations of trading contributions for access, and they \nthink, ``how could my voice be heard over all that cash.''\n  Certainly, Congress is not alone to blame for the current system. \nVoters themselves share some responsibility. People routinely decry the \nuse of negative political ads, yet continually respond to the content \nof those ads. The media, especially television stations and networks, \nhave failed to adequately inform the public of important policy \nquestions. Instead of covering significant issues, broadcasters often \nfall back on covering the ``horserace'' aspect of the campaign, or \n``sideshow'' disagreements among candidates.\n  But the ultimate responsibility rests in this chamber, with Congress. \nFor more than 30 years the growing crisis has been ignored. Year after \nyear, speeches are given, bills are introduced, but no action is taken.\n  We now have a rare opportunity, with public attention focused on this \ndebate and this bill, to pass real campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, we have never had a time in our nation's history when \nsuch a pervasive problem went unanswered by the Congress. America has \nmet challenges such as this before, and adopted policies which \nstrengthened our democracy. We have that opportunity with the bill \nbefore us.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill will help restore the American public's \nfaith in this institution and in all the institutions of government.\n  As some of my colleagues know, Senator Brownback and I have \nintroduced legislation to establish an independent commission to reform \nour campaign finance laws. This commission would be similar to the Base \nClosure Commission, which proposed a series of recommendations to \nCongress for an up-or-down vote of approval.\n  But I do not believe that we should take such an approach at this \ntime. It would be much better if Congress acted on its own, without the \nhelp of an outside body, to reform our election laws. It would \ndemonstrate to the American public that Congress is serious about \nchanging the way our democracy functions.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, I just want to take a moment to \nonce again commend my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. Last \nyear, when we debated this bill, I said that Senator Feingold truly \nfollows in the tradition of the great progressive movement in \nWisconsin. That's more even true today than it was last year. I'm proud \nto serve with him, and I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to \npass this vital legislation.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I believe we need campaign finance \nreform, but the McCain-Feingold amendment is not the right approach at \nthis time. I will say that I am disappointed that many of the people \nadvocating reform are defending people who couldn't live under the laws \nwe already have. Perhaps the best reform that we can make immediately \nwould be for candidates to live within the laws we have now. Clearly \nthis Administration did not do this in 1996.\n  I am disturbed by two provisions. First, the naked attempt to muzzle \nthe free speech of citizens who want to advocate on behalf of a \ncandidate. This ``reform'' would limit the free speech of all American \ncitizens. I hardly see that as being ``reform.'' We put too many limits \non our citizens now, we cannot restrict their right to participate in \nthe political process.\n  Second, this bill does nothing to stop the loophole that unions have \nexploited for years to advocate their political positions. It does \nnothing to stop the practice of labor unions taking the dues from hard \nworking citizens and spending millions of dollars on ads to defeat \ncandidates. Why is it that the people who advocate reform will not \npermit union members to keep their well-earned money and spend it as \nthey wish? Why do they oppose a separate, voluntary means for using the \ndues of union members? Regrettably, the answer is that the so-called \nreform advocates want to keep the liberal ads coming in waves, and cut \noff the political speech of others. I cannot support that under any \ncircumstances.\n  And what happens when we make reforms? Look at the results of the \n1974 law. The reforms limited personal contributions from individuals, \nyet it spawned PAC's and soft money. On public financing, the taxpayers \nwere to pay for the campaigns of those running for President--so that \nthey would be beyond reproach. Yet by 1996, the President and the Vice \nPresident spent untold hours raising soft money by the millions. From \nappearing at Buddhist Temples to renting out the Lincoln Bedroom, to \nmaking phone calls from the Oval Office, the 1974 reforms became a \nmockery at the hands of this Administration. For them to be calling for \ncampaign finance reform is like a horse thief galloping down the street \nwarning citizens to lock their barns. It simply doesn't pass the \nstraight face test.\n  III conceived, reforms can make the system worse and that is why I \ncannot support McCain-Feingold. If we want real reforms, we will do the \nfollowing: limit soft money; equalize PAC and individual contribution \nat $2500; speed disclosure to the public; tighten the ban on \ncontributions by non-citizens; and, stop the abuses by unions taking \ndues for political purposes. Finally, we should pass the ultimate \nreform: term limits.\n  These kinds of reforms would improve the system, empower the \nindividual, stop some of the most flagrant abuses taking place now and \nexpand more opportunities for citizen legislators to serve. This is the \nkind of approach we need.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the McCain-\nFeingold bill, which will provide this country with much needed \ncampaign finance reform.\n  The Constitution lays out the requirements for someone wanting to run \nfor office. In order to run for Senate, the Constitution tells us that \nthere are 3 requirements: First, you need to be a U.S. Citizen for 9 \nyears. Second, you need to be at least 30 years old. Third, you need to \nlive in the state whose office you're running for.\n  Three simple requirements, right? Wrong.\n  What the Constitution doesn't tell you is that there is a fourth \nrequirement. You must have an awful lot of money, or at least know how \nto raise a lot of money.\n  The Constitution doesn't tell you this because when the framers sat \ndown to draft the Constitution, they could not possibly have imagined \nthe ridiculously large amounts of time and money one must spend today \nif a person wants to be elected to office.\n  For example, if you want to run for Senate in my home state of \nNebraska, population 1.6 million, it will cost you several million \ndollars. This means that candidates must raise over $10,000 every week \nfor 6 years to cover the cost of the average Senate campaign.\n  We need to stop using partisan procedural stalling tactics and get \nserious about fixing our campaign financing laws. We need to change the \nlaw to give power back to working families, restore their faith in the \nprocess, and make democracy work again. That's why I rise in support of \nthe bipartisan bill offered by Senators McCain and Feingold.\n  This bill would be a strong first step toward making democracy work. \nIt seeks to solve the problem of soft money (money raised in an \nelection, but is outside of federal campaign finance rules), not just \nwith the political parties, but with the special interest groups who \nrun attack ads, who are completely unregulated by the system, and whose \ncontributors are undisclosed. It would require better disclosure, and \ngive more power to the F.E.C. It would create incentives to keep \nwealthy individuals from trying to buy a Senate seat.\n  This is not a perfect bill, especially in the stripped-down form in \nwhich it has ultimately reached the floor. I feel that it could be \nimproved in ways which would make it easier for average Americans to \nrun, win and serve, and which would make incumbent senators a lot less \ncomfortable. I feel especially strong about the need to toughen our \nsystem of election law enforcement, so that the politicians who break \nthe law end up paying the price.\n  But my colleagues and I can't make an effort to improve this bill if \nthe\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\nother party continues with their stalling tactics and prevent us from \ndebating it.\n  Mr. President, Americans are frustrated. It is time to get serious \nabout this debate. I know it, you know it, and the American people want \nit.\n  As I've said before, in a Harris Poll last March, 83 percent of \nAmericans said they thought that special interest groups had more power \nthan the voters. Seventy-six percent said that Congress is largely \nowned by special interest groups.\n  Our lack of action on this issue reinforces the view that Americans \nhave of their Government.\n  The American people are frustrated by our delay. They are frustrated \nwith the political process that appears to respond to those with \neconomic power and which, all too often, ignores the needs of working \nmen and women.\n  They are frustrated with the rising cost of campaigns, with a \npolitical system which closes the door to people of average means who \nalso want to serve their country in the U.S. Congress.\n  They are frustrated with the millions of dollars they see go into our \ncampaigns. They are frustrated with our tendency to talk instead of \nact.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to show the American people, not \nwith words but with action. With a single vote today, Senators can act \nto allow this issue to move front and center on the political stage. \nWith this bipartisan bill, we can show the American people that we mean \nwhat se say when we talk.\n  Last week in the Omaha World Herald, there was an op-ed piece written \nby Deanna Frisk, the President of Nebraska's League of Women Voters. In \nlaying out her reasons why all Americans would benefit from fixing our \ncampaign finance laws, Ms. Frisk said:\n\n       Campaign finance reform is about creating the kind of \n     democracy we want to have: a democracy where citizens come \n     first, a democracy that is open to new faces, a democracy \n     that can respond with fresh ideas to the problems confronting \n     our country.\n\n  Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. As members of the Senate, we \nare in a unique position to make our government work better for the \nAmerican people.\n  Let's give every 30 year old, U.S. Citizen who wants to serve his \nstate as a Member of the Senate a fighting chance. Let's get rid of \nthat unofficial requirement that says don't bother running for office \nif you don't have lots of time and money to invest. Let's make the \nwealthy candidate who can afford to dump loads of his own money into a \ncampaign the exception, not the norm like it is today.\n  Let's give the American people what they want. Let's end this \npartisan bickering and pass the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the important \ncampaign finance reform legislation that is before us today.\n  Today very wealthy special interest groups can pump unlimited amounts \nof money into a political campaign. In fact, one individual or group \ncan attempt to buy an election. After this bill passes, that will not \nlonger be true. This is the one reform that will do the most to give an \nordinary person an equal say in who they send to Congress.\n  I support this legislation because I believe it represents the right \nkind of change. While not a perfect solution, it will help put our \npolitical process back where it belongs: with the people. And it will \ntake power away from the wealthy special interests that all too often \ncall the shots in our political system.\n  Let's be clear of our goal today: we must ensure that political \ncampaigns are a contest of ideas, not a contest of money. We need to \nreturn elections to the citizens of states like Montana and allow them \nto make their own decisions, rather than letting rich Washington, DC \ngroups run attack campaigns designed to do nothing but drag down a \ncandidate.\n  Yet, ironically, by failing to act; by failing to pass this \nlegislation; we will also be opening the door to change--the wrong kind \nof change. Our political system will continue to drift in the dangerous \ndirection of special interests.\n  Since the 1970s, when Congress last enacted campaign finance reform, \nspecial interest groups supporting both political parties have found \ncreative new ways, some of questionable legality, to get around the \nintent of our campaign finance laws. Things like soft money, \nindependent expenditures, and political action committees all came \nabout as a consequence of well-intended campaign finance reforms.\n\n\n                         montanans want reform\n\n  During my last campaign, I walked across Montana--over 800 miles \nacross the Big Sky State. One of the benefits to walking across \nMontana, in addition to the beautiful scenery, is that I hear what real \npeople in Montana think. Average folks who don't get paid to fly to \nWashington and tell elected officials what they think. Folks who work \nhard, play by the rules, and are still struggling to get by.\n  People are becoming more and more cynical about government. Over and \nover, people tell me they think that Congress cares more about ``fat \ncat special interests in Washington'' than the concerns of middle class \nfamilies like theirs. Or they tell me that they think the political \nsystem is corrupt.\n\n\n                      effect on working montanans\n\n  Middle-class families are working longer and harder for less. They \nhave seen jobs go overseas. Health care expenses rise. The possibility \nof a college education for their kids diminished. Their hope for a \nsecure retirement evaporate.\n  Today, many believe that to make the American Dream a reality, you \nhave to be born rich or win the lottery. Part of restoring that dream \nis restoring confidence that the political system works on their \nbehalf, not just on behalf of wealthy special interests.\n  Now it is time for use to take a real step to win-back the public \ntrust--it is time for us to pass a tough, fair, and comprehensive \nCampaign Finance Reform bill. That bill must accomplish three things.\n  First, it must be strong enough to encourage the majority if not all \ncandidates for federal office to participate.\n  Second, it must contain the spiraling cost of campaign spending in \nthis country. finally, and most importantly, it must control the \nincreasing flow of undisclosed and unreported ``soft-money'' that is \npolluting our electoral system.\n\n\n                 reform must reduce costs of campaigns\n\n  Under the current campaign system, the average cost of running for a \nSenate seat in this country is $4 million. I had to raise a little more \nthan that during my 1996 race. That is an average of almost $2000 a \nday.\n  When a candidate is faced with the daunting task of raising $12,000 a \nweek--every week--for six years to meet the cost of an average \ncampaign, qualified people are driven away from the process. If we \nallow ideas to take a back seat to a candidates ability to raise \nmoney--surely our democracy is in danger.\n  The numbers are proof enough. As campaign costs have risen, voter \nturnout has drastically fallen. Think about that. People are spending \nmore and more, while fewer people are voting. Since 1992, money spent \non campaigns has risen by $700 million dollars. In the same time \nperiod, turnout has dropped from 55% to an all time low of 48%.\n\n  Mr. President, less than half the country now votes in elections. \nWhat does this say about our political system? It says, quite simply, \nthat people no longer believe that their vote counts, that they can \nmake a difference. They believe that big corporations and million \ndollar PACs have more of a say in government than the average citizen. \nThat perception is the most dangerous threat facing our country today.\n  Let me be clear--my first choice would simply be to control campaign \ncosts by enacting campaign spending limits. However, the Supreme Court, \nin Buckley v. Valeo, made what I believe was a critical mistake.\n  They equated money with free speech--preventing Congress from setting \nreasonable state-by-state spending limits that everyone would have to \nabide by.\n\n\n                       what's right with the bill\n\n  While I must admit this bill is not perfect, it will take several \ncrucial actions to reign in campaign spending. First, this is the first \nbi-partisan approach to campaign finance reform in more than a decade.\n  Second, the bill establishes a system that does not rely on taxpayers \ndollars to work effectively.\n  The McCain-Feingold substitute would prohibit all soft money \ncontributions to the national political parties\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\nfrom corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals.\n  The bill offers real, workable enforcement and accountability \nstandards. Like lowering the reporting threshold for campaign \ncontributions from $200 to $50. It increases penalties for knowing and \nwillful violations of FEC law. And the bill requires political \nadvertisements to carry a disclaimer, identifying who is responsible \nfor the content of the campaign ad.\n  Every election year, in addition to the millions of dollars in \ndisclosed contributions, there are the hundreds of millions in \nunreported, undisclosed contributions spent by ``independent \nexpenditure'' campaigns and ``issue advocacy'' advertisements. These \nads are funded by soft-money contributions to national political \nparties.\n  Out-of-state special interest groups can spend any amount of money \nthey choose, none of which is disclosed, all in the name of \n``educating'' voters--when in fact their only purpose is to influence \nthe outcome of a election. More times than not, the see-sawing 30 \nsecond bites do more to confuse than to educate.\n  This lack of accountability is dangerous to our democracy. These \nindependent expenditure campaigns can say whatever they wish for or \nagainst a candidate, and there is little that candidates can do--short \nof spending an equal or greater amount of money to refute what are \noften gross distortions and character assassinations.\n  To close, Mr. President, America needs and wants campaign finance \nreform. The Senate should pass comprehensive legislation right now. \nThat legislation should accomplish one clear goal: we must ensure that \npolitical campaigns are a contest of ideas, not a contest of money.\n  An oft-quoted American put it this way: ``Politics has got so \nexpensive that it takes lots of money to even get beat with.'' That \nstatement wasn't made this year or last year, or even during our \npolitical lifetimes. Will Rogers said that in 1931. He was right then, \nand he's even more right today.\n  I remain committed to this cause and will do everything in my power \nto ensure that the Congress passes meaningful Campaign Finance Reform, \nthis year.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the American political system is profoundly \nbroken. I experienced this in my recent campaign for this office, which \nwas why I made it my first official act, fifteen minutes after being \nsworn in to the Senate, to cosponsor the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  We have all seen the phenomenon, in our own campaigns and in others, \nwhere they hold the election on Tuesday, you sleep in on Wednesday, and \nby Thursday afternoon it has started all over again. There is no \ninterval in which to focus exclusively on the public's business.\n  I don't think that anyone in this body likes that situation. I have \nnever heard a group of Senators talking among themselves about how \nwonderful the seemingly permanent campaign is. Well today we have a \nchance to do something about it. The McCain-Feingold bill won't fix \neverything, but it will be the most significant step in the right \ndirection in a long, long time.\n  This bill also takes on one of the greatest threats that has \ndeveloped in recent years to the quality of our nation's public \ndialogue, the recent rash of so-called ``independent expenditure \ncampaigns.''\n  Political campaigns ought to be an opportunity for people who want to \nserve in public office to not only explain themselves, but to listen \nand learn. I have tried when running for office to spend as much time \nas possible listening to what the people I meet at shopping centers and \nbus stops and ice cream socials have to say. I want to hear what they \nthink and I want to talk to them in a serious way about the fights that \nI want to wage on their behalf, the issues that I feel passionately \nabout, and the direction I think our country ought to be headed.\n  But in the past few years, new tactics have been developed by a \nvariety of groups on both the left and the right who seek to insert \nthemselves in between candidates and the public they seek to serve. In \nthese races, the candidates at times become mere pawns in some larger \nbattle for influence.\n  In the race that my colleague from Oregon and I ran against each \nother, there were ads that were run that were probably meant to help \nme, and ads that were run that were meant to hurt me. I think that \nSenator Smith and I would both agree that we both would have preferred \nif all of these ads had never been aired. The McCain-Feingold bill is \nthe best solution available at this time to clean up the excess of \nthese independent expenditures.\n  Democracy is a precious and fragile gift that has been left to us by \nprevious generations, Mr. President. I don't expect that the republic \nwill collapse tomorrow if we fail to pass this bill, but make no \nmistake about it, the steady erosion of the public's confidence in \ntheir leaders is a dangerous trend. We can make a real beginning today. \nThe American people want this system fixed, and they have a right to \nexpect that it will be. Let's not disappoint them again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself such time as I require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, conversations today have been including \nthe notion that the American people don't care about campaign finance \nreform, and occasionally people do ask why is it important to reform \nour system of financing campaigns. I think it is pretty clear that \npeople do care about this issue. Just talk to them about it. Trying to \nget it to show up on a poll is one thing, but if you talk to them, you \nwill find a different story.\n  That is particularly true when Americans are told the facts or learn \nthe facts about our current system that it actually affects average \nAmericans who may not even care a great deal about being involved in \nthe political process.\n  I heard today on the floor a number of opponents of our bill assert \nthis issue has no impact on the average citizen. Although I recognize \nmany Americans do not think this issue is the No. 1 issue in America, \nAmericans do care about this issue because it does affect their daily \nlives in real ways.\n  Why should Americans care about campaign finance reform? One very \ngood reason to care is that as consumers, they are affected. We all pay \nfor the current system of campaign financing through higher prices, \nhigher prices in the pharmacy, in the supermarket, on our cable bills, \nwhen we fill our cars with gas and in many other ways.\n  Mr. President, in support of this, I have two items I would like to \nhave printed in the Record which explain that our current system of \nfinancing political campaigns has a very real and direct effect on \nconsumers and provides further support for the need to pass meaningful \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Today, Common Cause released a report entitled ``Pocketbook \nPolitics.'' Common Cause reveals how special interest money hurts the \nAmerican consumer. This report examines the campaign contributions of \nspecial interest groups which have benefited from Federal programs and \npolicies that have had a costly effect on American consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe executive summary from this new Common Cause report, ``Pocketbook \nPolitics.''\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n    [From the Common Cause Follow the Dollar Report, February 1998]\n\n  Pocketbook Politics: How Special-Interest Money Hurts the American \n                                Consumer\n\n       In 1996 and 1997, powerful special interests--with the help \n     of generous campaign contributions--won victories in \n     Washington that resulted in higher prices in our day-to-day \n     lives and have taken a substantial bite out of the \n     pocketbooks of typical American families.\n       Special-interest victories in just six areas denied the \n     American public access to cheaper, generic versions of many \n     popular brand-name drugs; halted improvements in the fuel \n     efficiency of their minivans and cars; pushed up their cable \n     bills; made them pay more to make a call from a pay phone; \n     and kept the prices of peanuts and sugar artificially high.\n       Since 1991, the special interests represented in just these \n     six examples gave more than $61.3 million in political \n     contributions, including $24.6 million in unlimited soft \n     money donations to the political parties.\n\n[[Page S902]]\n\n       The policies these special interests supported not only \n     harm consumers, they often hurt the environment as well. \n     Environmentalists charge that the peanut price-support \n     program whose benefits go to large peanut producers and a \n     small number of landowners, has encouraged farming practices \n     that exhaust the land and result in an increased use of \n     agricultural pesticides. Sugar policies encouraged the growth \n     of sugar plantations near the environmentally sensitive \n     Florida Everglades. A stalemate on fuel efficiency standards \n     increased air pollution and aggravated global warming.\n       ``Our report documents six government programs and policies \n     and their costly effect on the American family,'' Common \n     Cause President Ann McBride said. ``But what we show is just \n     a drop in the bucket. These examples don't begin to explore \n     all the agendas of all special-interest political \n     contributors, their victories on Capitol Hill and at the \n     White House, and their overall impact on the American public.\n       ``But it's clear that a campaign finance system that \n     rewards deep pocket corporations and wealthy individuals \n     directly affects all Americans, robbing them of their hard-\n     earned dollars and threatening to degrade the earth's \n     environment--our legacy to our children. In the insider's \n     game that determines public policy in Washington, special \n     interests and politicians hit the jackpot. But too much of \n     that jackpot comes out of the pocketbook of the American \n     consumer.''\n\n\n                 pocketbook politics: executive summary\n\n       In 1996 and 1997, powerful special interests--with the help \n     of generous campaign contributions--won victories in \n     Washington that resulted in higher prices in our day-to-day \n     lives and have taken a substantial bite out of the \n     pocketbooks of typical American families. This study examines \n     just a handful of examples where special interests won \n     victories at the expense of the American consumer.\n       Bad Medicine: Since 1991, the companies belonging to the \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), \n     the trade group for brand-name drug makers, have given more \n     than $18.6 million in political contributions, including $8.4 \n     million in soft money donations to the political parties. \n     With the help of that influence, brand-name drug companies \n     have kept their bottom lines healthy by successfully \n     convincing Congress to let them hold on to their drug patents \n     longer. Loss of access to generic drugs costs consumers, as \n     much as $550 million a year.\n       Car Fare: The American auto, iron, and steel industries \n     gave $5.7 million ion political contributions since 1991, \n     including more than $1.7 million in soft money donations to \n     the political parties. For the past three years, Congress has \n     voted for a freeze on Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) \n     standards, thereby sparing these special interests the burden \n     of making cars and trucks more fuel efficient, which they \n     fear might eat into their bottom lines. Supporters of higher \n     CAFE standards claim that it is possible to produce safe, \n     fuel-efficient cars that can save consumers money at the gas \n     pump. Being deprived of this fuel efficiency costs consumers \n     about $59 billion annually.\n       Party Lines: Together cable and local phone companies have \n     given $22.8 million in political contributions since 1991, \n     including $8.7 million in soft money donations to the \n     political parties. The groundbreaking Telecommunications Act \n     of 1996, which was supposed to make the industries more \n     competitive and responsive to consumer needs, has actually \n     worked to shrink competition. The resulting jump in cable TV \n     bills and pay phone rates costs consumers about $2.8 billion \n     annually.\n       The $1 Billion PB Sandwich: Together peanut and sugar \n     interests have given $14.2 million in political contributions \n     since 1991, including $5.7 million in soft money donations to \n     the political parties. In 1996, they fought to ensure that a \n     historic overhaul of domestic farm policy left their programs \n     virtually untouched. They also rebuffed congressional \n     proposals in 1997 to phase out or eliminate their programs. \n     These legislative victories have upped the price of peanuts \n     and sugar substantially, costing consumers about $1.6 billion \n     annually.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Also, Money magazine published an article in December \nmaking much the same point, with additional examples of how consumers \nhave been hurt by decisions made by this Congress under the influence \nof campaign donations from affected industries.\n  Our decisions on everything from the airline tax to sugar subsidies \nto securities laws reform to electricity deregulation are potentially \ncompromised by the money chase. Anyone who cares about public \nconfidence in this institution should be concerned about these examples \nof industries and individuals with a great economic stake in our \ndeliberations being able to and actually, in fact, making large and \nstrategically focused campaign contributions.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an excerpt from \nthe Money magazine article entitled ``Look Who's Cashing in on \nCongress.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Money Magazine, December 1997]\n\nLook Who's Cashing in on Congress; Tales From the Money Trail: Here Are \nSome of the Reasons You'll Pay Nearly $1,600 This Year For Legislation \n              That Benefits Corporations and the Wealthy.\n\n                          (By Ann Reilly Dowd)\n\n       Ordinary Americans are prohibited from climbing Mount \n     Rushmore, where the faces of four great Presidents are carved \n     in granite. But this September, just before the Senate began \n     debating campaign finance reform, Senate Minority Leader Tom \n     Daschle (D-S.D.) led a group of supporters, including 21 \n     representatives of industries as diverse as airlines, \n     financial services, telecommunications and tobacco, up the \n     mountain that's been called the ``Shrine of Democracy.'' \n     Taking Washington's traditional brie-and-Chablis fund raiser \n     to unusual heights, Daschle pulled in $105,000 for his re-\n     election campaign and for his party during that weekend trip \n     to his state's Black Hills. In return, the contributors not \n     only got to perch at the top of a monument off limits to most \n     mortals, but they also won access to the second most powerful \n     politician in the Senate, a man who wields enormous influence \n     over their industries' futures and their own fortunes.\n       That cash-driven coziness was not exactly what our \n     forefathers had in mind when they spoke of a government of, \n     by and for the people. Increasingly, however, the soaring \n     cost of congressional races, weak campaign finance laws and \n     potentially fat returns on contributors' donations have \n     conspired to give big-spending corporations and wealthy \n     individuals unprecedented access to Washington lawmakers, \n     putting the givers in a prime position to influence the laws \n     the politicians make. ``The founding fathers must be spinning \n     in their graves,'' says Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), co-\n     sponsor with Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.) of the leading \n     campaign finance reform bill.\n       Yet after weeks of high-profile hearings on presidential \n     campaign finance abuses before a panel chaired by Sen. Fred \n     Thompson (R-Tenn.) and heated debate on the Senate floor, the \n     nation's legislators remain deadlocked over whether to fix \n     the system--let alone how to do so. Worse, public interest in \n     the subject is practically nil. For example, a recent poll \n     found only 8% of Americans have been paying close attention \n     to news about the Democrats' 1996 fund raising.\n       So why should you care about the way both parties finance \n     their congressional campaigns? Because the subject isn't only \n     about politics, it's about your money. Here are two examples \n     of this year's tab:\n       U.S. taxpayers will pay $47.7 billion for corporate tax \n     breaks and subsidies. That's the conclusion of an exhaustive \n     study by economist Robert Shapiro, vice president of the \n     Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington think tank \n     affiliated with the moderate Democratic Leadership Council. \n     The total cost to the average American household in 1997: \n     $483.\n       Import quotas for sugar, textiles and other goods will \n     raise consumer prices $110 billion, according to economist \n     Gary Hufbauer of the nonprofit Council on Foreign Relations. \n     total cost per household: $1,114.\n       All of this comes amid rising public cynicism and apathy \n     about politics. In a recent poll by the Center for Responsive \n     Politics, a nonpartisan group that studies how money \n     influences politics, nearly four in five Americans said major \n     contributors from outside U.S. representatives' districts \n     have more access to the lawmakers than their constituents do. \n     Also, about half of those polled believe that money has ``a \n     lot of influence on policies and legislation.'' Says Ann \n     McBride, president of Common Cause, a political watchdog \n     group: ``It's no accident that last year's extraordinarily \n     low voter turnout coincided with the highest-priced election \n     in history.''\n       During the 1995-96 election cycle, the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC) reports, candidates running for the House \n     and Senate raised $791 million, 68% more than a decade \n     earlier. Of the total, a quarter, or $201 million, came from \n     political action committees (PACs) run by corporations, labor \n     unions and other interest groups. Of the $444 million from \n     individuals, only 36%, or $158 million, was given in amounts \n     of less than $200.\n       Even more startling, the political parties collected an \n     additional $264 million in so-called soft money in 1995-96, \n     triple the amount they raised during the last presidential \n     election campaign. While the law limits so-called hard-money \n     contributions to candidates to $1,000 per election from \n     individuals and $5,000 from PACs, there are no caps on soft \n     money, which flows from corporations, unions and individuals \n     in huge chunks. For example, according to Common Cause, in \n     the last election cycle tobacco giant Philip Morris and its \n     executives gave $2.5 million in soft money to the G.O.P., \n     while the Communications Workers of America contributed $1.1 \n     million to the Democratic Party. The FEC says soft money is \n     supposed to be spent on ``party building.'' But much of the \n     cash finds its way into congressional and presidential \n     races. Says McBride: ``Soft money is clearly the most \n     corrupting money in politics today.''\n       Indeed, campaigning has mostly turned into a money chase. \n     Last year, winning a Senate seat cost an average of $4.7 \n     million, up 53% since 1986. Snagging a House seat ran \n     $673,739, up 89%. Some veteran senators, including Paul Simon \n     (D-Ill.) and Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), have cited their distaste \n     for endlessly dialing for dollars as one reason they\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\n     dropped out of politics. As for the current Capitol gang, \n     says Charles Lewis, president of the Center for Public \n     Integrity, a nonpartisan research group: ``It's a \n     misimpression to think all new members are innocents. Either \n     they are millionaires or they are willing to sell their \n     souls, or at least lease them, before they even set foot in \n     Washington.''\n       Of course, lawmakers often take positions out of principle. \n     Other times, constituent or broader public interests dictate \n     their votes. But the question remains: What role does money \n     play in shaping legislation?\n       MONEY has found five instances where big money and bad \n     bills collided, resulting in legislation that has--or may \n     soon--cost taxpaying consumers like you dearly. (For more \n     examples, see the table on page 132). We'll tell the tales \n     and let you judge whether it's time for campaign finance \n     reform.\n\n\n                             fear of flying\n\n       Why you may pay more for air travel: Early this year, Herb \n     Kelleher, the tough-talking chief executive of Southwest \n     Airlines, dropped to his knees in the office of U.S. Rep. \n     Charles Rangel of New York City, the top Democrat on the \n     powerful House Ways and Means Committee. ``If you'll support \n     the little guy against this measure,'' begged Kelleher, \n     referring to a proposed new flight tax that would hurt \n     discount carriers like his, ``I'll give up Wild Turkey and \n     cigarettes.''\n       Though only half in jest, Kelleher's theatrics weren't \n     enough to overcome the clout of the Big Seven airlines--\n     American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA, United and US \n     Airways--who stood to gain from the new tax. The Center for \n     Responsive Politics estimates that during the 1995-96 \n     election period, the Big Seven contributed $2.5 million in \n     PAC money to candidates and soft money to both parties, \n     almost three times what the airlines had given during the \n     last election cycle. Among their biggest recipients was House \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, where Delta is based, who \n     took in $12,000 for his congressional campaign. Then in the \n     first six months of this year, while Congress was debating \n     the airline-tax bill, the big carriers kicked in another \n     $640,000, including $6,000 more to the Speaker. By contrast, \n     Texas-based Southwest and its small airline allies have \n     contributed nothing to Gingrich and only $95,000 to \n     congressional campaigns and the parties since 1995.\n       After a bruising Capitol Hill battle, the major carriers \n     emerged with much of what they wanted, tucked into the 1997 \n     tax act: a gradual reduction in the airline ticket tax from \n     10% to 7.5% plus a new $1 levy, rising to $3 in 2002, on each \n     leg of a flight between takeoff and final landing. Many \n     passengers who fly on regional carriers and discounters like \n     Southwest emerged as losers, since those airlines tend to \n     make more stops. For example, after the ticket-tax reduction \n     and new segment fee are fully phased in, a family of four \n     that flies on Southwest for $225 per person from Houston to \n     Disney World, with a stop in New Orleans, will pay $25.50 in \n     additional taxes.\n       For that, opponents say, the family can thank Gingrich, who \n     broke a deadlock in the Ways and Means Committee over two \n     warring proposals. One, backed by Southwest and Republican \n     Jennifer Dunn of Washington, would have preserved the flat \n     10% ticket tax. The other, supported by the Big Seven and \n     sponsored by Republican Michael (``Mac'') Collins of Georgia, \n     reduced the tax and imposed a segment fee.\n       ``Let's settle this like adults and compromise in [the \n     House-Senate] conference,'' Gingrich told Dunn, who agreed to \n     shelve her proposal. The Senate sided with Southwest. But a \n     House provision favorable to the big airlines won in the \n     closed door negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Trent \n     Lott (R-Miss.) and Gingrich. Says a congressional aide whose \n     boss backed Southwest: ``We left it to Trent and Newt, and \n     Newt fought harder.'' Campaign money was not a factor, \n     insists the Speaker's press secretary, Christina Martin. \n     Instead, she says, Gingrich was guided ``by his experience, \n     his vision and the will of his constituents and the \n     Republican conference.''\n\n\n                     dance of the sugarplum barons\n\n       Why you pay 25% too much for sugar: The next time you buy a \n     bag of sugar, consider this: You are paying 40[cents] a \n     pound, 10[cents] more than you should, because a handful of \n     generous U.S. sugar magnates have managed to preserve their \n     sweet deals for 16 years. Says Rep. Dan Miller (R-Fla.), who \n     led the bitter losing battle last year to dismantle the \n     program of import quotas and guaranteed loans that props up \n     domestic sugar prices, costing U.S. consumers $1.4 billion a \n     year: ``This is the poster child for why we need campaign \n     finance reform.''\n       The sultans of sugar are Alfonso (``Alfy'') and Jose \n     (``Pepe'') Fanjul, Cuban emigre brothers whose Flo-Sun \n     company, with headquarters in South Florida, produces much of \n     the sugarcane in the U.S. The Fanjuls sprinkle more money \n     over Washington than any other U.S. sugar grower. According \n     to the Center for Responsive Politics, during the 1995-96 \n     election cycle, when the sugar program was up for another \n     five-year reauthorization, the Fanjul family, the companies \n     they own and their employees gave $709,000 to federal \n     election campaigns. Alfy served on President Clinton's \n     Florida fund-raising operation, while Pepe co-chaired \n     Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole's campaign \n     finance committee. Overall during the past election cycle, \n     the Center reports, U.S. sugar producers poured $2.7 \n     million into federal campaign coffers, nearly 60% more \n     than the $1.7 million given by industrial sugar users, \n     including candy and cereal companies, who oppose price \n     supports.\n       The sugar industry's investment appears to have paid off \n     handsomely. At first, two conservative firebrands, Rep. Dan \n     Miller (R-Fla.) and Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), seemed to have \n     enough votes to kill the price-support program. In the \n     Senate, however, then-Majority Leader Dole, determined that \n     nothing would hold up the 1996 farm bill, took a machete to \n     amendments that threatened to topple it, including Gregg's, \n     which died by 61 votes to 35.\n       In the House, the sugar program was saved after six \n     original co-sponsors of the Miller amendment switched sides, \n     killing it by 217 votes to 208. One defector, Texas \n     Republican Steve Stockman, who was locked in a tight re-\n     election race that he ultimately lost, received $7,500 in \n     sugar contributions during 1995 and '96, including $1,000 on \n     the day of the vote. Stockman did not return Money's phone \n     calls. Another voting for big sugar, Robert Torricelli (D-\n     N.J.), now a U.S. senator, received $19,000 from sugar \n     producers. New Jersey grows no sugar, but it is home to \n     870,000 Cuban Americans, whose votes Torricelli wanted for \n     his Senate campaign. On the House floor, he argued that \n     eliminating the program would drive up world prices, hurting \n     domestic growers and helping foreign producers like Cuba. \n     Said Torricelli: ``We will lose the jobs and the money, and \n     Fidel Castro's Cuba will reap the benefits.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                         washington power play\n\n       How politically charged utilities are short-circuiting \n     federal deregulation efforts that could cut your electric \n     bill: If you could shop around for power instead of buying it \n     from a single local utility, you could cut as much as 24% off \n     your monthly electric bill, according to the Department of \n     Energy. For a family whose monthly electric bills average \n     $100, that would mean yearly savings of $288, nearly three \n     months of free power. But while states from California to New \n     Hampshire are moving to increase competition among utilities, \n     two deep-pocketed and determined adversaries have thus far \n     stymied federal deregulation efforts.\n       Those fighting for rapid deregulation include large \n     commercial electricity users, such as Anheuser-Busch, General \n     Motors, Texaco and major retailers, as well as low-cost power \n     producers and marketers like Houston's Enron. The Center for \n     Responsive Politics estimates that during the 1995-96 \n     election cycle, as Congress began considering deregulation, \n     the major commercial power users contributed $7.8 million to \n     congressional candidates and the parties, while Enron and its \n     employees gave another $1.2 million.\n       On the other side of the power war are old-line, \n     monopolistic utilities led by the Edison Electric Institute \n     (EEI), their major Washington lobby. Their big fear: that so-\n     called stranded costs for investments in nuclear power plants \n     and other projects they pass on to consumers in the rates \n     they pay will make it difficult to compete with low-cost \n     energy producers under deregulation. During the 1995-96 \n     election period, the old-line utilities contributed $7.7 \n     million to the candidates and the parties. In addition, the \n     Institute assessed its members $3 million to pay for a \n     lobbying campaign against rapid federal deregulation.\n       So far, that effort seems to be working. After 14 hearings \n     on deregulation, Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska), chairman of the \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has still not \n     introduced a comprehensive bill. Instead he is backing a \n     narrower measure sponsored by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) \n     that would help the old-line utilities by letting them \n     compete in any nonutility business, without allowing other \n     power companies to enter the older firms' local electricity \n     markets.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       What will these power plays mean to you? Says, Charlie \n     Higley, a senior policy analyst at Public Citizen, a consumer \n     rights group: ``Generally we are concerned that legislators \n     will strike a deal where the utilities will get the taxpayer \n     to foot the bill for their stranded costs, the big industrial \n     users will get all the breaks, and residential and small \n     business customers will get no relief or, worse yet, higher \n     costs.''\n\n\n                       a midsummer's night scheme\n\n       How Wall Street and Silicon Valley could undercut investor \n     rights: In the summer of 1995, a coalition of accounting, \n     securities and high-tech firms persuaded Congress to pass \n     sweeping legislation limiting securities litigation that \n     MONEY had warned could severely restrict investors' abilities \n     to bring successful class-action suits for securities fraud. \n     Though the Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded \n     that it is too early to tell whether the Securities \n     Litigation Reform Act has seriously eroded investors' \n     rights, the same group of industries is now promoting \n     legislation that would virtually ban investors from \n     bringing class-action suites in state courts involving \n     nationally traded securities. Warns Barbara Roper, the \n     Consumer Federation of America's securities law expert: \n     ``The big risk for investors is that the federal law will \n     end up restricting meritorious cases and that we'll lose \n     the states as an alternative venue for them.'' The \n     possible result: Wronged investors not\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\n     only could find such cases harder to win, but they also \n     may be prevented from filing suits in the first place.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In 1995 and '96, securities and accounting firms, as well \n     as high-tech companies, which frequently are the targets of \n     securities fraud lawsuits, flooded Congress and both parties \n     with $29.6 million in campaign money, according to the Center \n     for Responsive Politics. By contrast, the Center estimates \n     the trial lawyers association, the biggest critic of the \n     legislation, gave $3.1 million. (The total from all trial \n     lawyers is unknown.) Says one top Democratic congressional \n     aide: ``This is completely money-driven, special-interest \n     legislation that we would never even be looking at if there \n     were campaign finance reform. Most congressmen are not being \n     bombarded with requests from local constituents to pre-empt \n     state securities laws.''\n\n\n                        what congress should do\n\n       Here are six changes recommended by advocates of campaign \n     finance reform:\n       Ban soft money. This is the heart of the McCain-Feingold \n     bill to improve the way campaigns are funded. The prohibition \n     would shut down the easiest way corporations, unions and the \n     wealthy have to buy access to Congress and influence \n     legislation.\n       Limit PAC contributions. Congress ought to ban PACs from \n     giving money to the campaigns of members of committees that \n     govern the PACs' industries or their interests.\n       Offer cut-rate TV time. Candidates who agree to reject PAC \n     money might get free or discounted TV time.\n       Reward small contributors. Tax credits for donations of \n     $200 or less might stimulate more people to give. Says Kent \n     Cooper, executive director of the Center for Responsive \n     Politics: ``It's critical that we build a wider base of small \n     contributors.''\n       Streamline disclosure. Candidates should be required to \n     file their campaign receipts and expenditures electronically \n     to the Federal Election Commission. That would enable it to \n     post the data to its Website (www.fec.gov) more quickly.\n       Toughen election laws and enforcement. Congress must make \n     the six-member Federal Election Commission, typically half \n     Republican and half Democrat, more effective. The panel needs \n     authority to impose civil penalties, a bigger enforcement \n     budget (now only $31.7 million) and a seventh member to break \n     ties.\n       What can you do? Write to congressional leaders Gingrich, \n     Lott and McCain, as well as your own U.S. representative, \n     senators and President Clinton. Tell them you want campaign \n     finance reform that will restore accountability and integrity \n     to federal elections and the government. And while you're at \n     it, tell them you'd like the right to climb Mount Rushmore--\n     without giving Tom Daschle $5,000 of your hard-earned money.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with \nthe time being charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, at this time I yield such time as he \nrequires to the leader on this issue, the senior Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  May I ask, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 8 minutes 48 \nseconds; the Senator from Kentucky controls 7 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Since it is the McCain-Feingold amendment, I ask the \nSenator from Kentucky if we could close the debate with our comments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry; I did not hear the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Since the vote would be on our amendment, it is customary \nthat we, the sponsors of the amendment, be allowed to close the debate. \nI ask if the Senator from Kentucky would agree that I could have the \nlast 5 minutes before the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have absolutely no problem with that. That is \nperfectly acceptable.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Kentucky want to proceed now?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. Would you like me to go on to wrap up?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to accommodate the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I think we have had a very important and useful \ndebate. In many ways it has gone on for the last 10 years in various \nforms. Prior to 1995, it was the Mitchell-Boren bill. There have been \nseveral changes over the years, but fundamentally the issue is this: Do \nwe think we have too much political discourse in this country?\n  I would argue, Mr. President, that we do not have any problems in \nthis country related to too much political discussion. The Supreme \nCourt has made it quite clear that in order to effectively discuss \nissues in this country, one must have access to money, and, frankly, \nthat should not be a shocking concept to anyone going all the way back \nto the beginning of our country when anonymous pamphlets were passed \nout supporting the American Revolution. Somebody paid for those.\n  Virtually any undertaking, whether it is raising money for Common \nCause so that they can get their message out or raising money for a \ncampaign so that it can get its message out or raising money for a \npolitical party so it can get its message out or by some group that \nwants to be critical of any of us up to and including the time just \nprior to an election, the Supreme Court has appropriately recognized \nthat in order to have effective speech you have to be able to amplify \nyour voice. That is not a new concept. It has been around since the \nbeginning of the country.\n\n  So the fundamental issue, Mr. President, is this: Do we have too much \npolitical discourse in this country? I would argue that we clearly do \nnot. The political discussion has increased in recent years for several \nreasons. No. 1, the effective means of communication costs more--nobody \nhas capped inflation in the broadcast industry--and, No. 2, the stakes \nhave been large.\n  The Congress was for many years sort of a wholly owned subsidiary of \nthe folks on the other side of the aisle. But since 1994 it has been a \ngood deal more competitive, so the voices have been louder. We had a \nrobust election in 1996 about the future of the country, and a good \ndeal of discussion occurred. But even then, Mr. President, that \ndiscussion, converted to money and compared to other forms of consumer \nconsumption, if you will, in this country, was minuscule. One percent \nof all the commercials in America in 1996 were about politics. So it \nseems to me, Mr. President, by any standard, we are not discussing \nthese issues too much.\n  The other side of the issue that must be addressed is, assuming it \nwere desirable to restrict this discussion, is that a good idea? In \norder to do that, Mr. President, you have to have a Federal agency \nessentially trying to control not only the quantity but the quality of \ndiscourse in our country.\n  The Supreme Court has already made it quite clear that it is \nimpermissible for the Government to control either the quantity or the \nquality of our political discussion in this country.\n  So this kind of regulatory approach to speech is clearly something \nthe courts are not going to uphold. Nor should the Senate uphold that \napproach. Fundamentally that is the difference between the two sides on \nthis issue.\n  Do we think there is too much speech? Or do we think there is too \nlittle? Do we think it is appropriate for the Government to regulate \nthis speech? Or do we think it is constitutionally impermissible? That \nis the core debate here, Mr. President.\n  McCain-Feingold, in its most recent form, upon which we will be \nvoting on a motion to table here shortly, in my view, clearly goes in \nthe regulatory direction. It is based on the notion that there is too \nmuch political discussion in this country by parties and by groups.\n  Mr. President, the political parties do not exist for any other \nreason than to engage in political discussion. They financed issue \nadvocacy ads with non-Federal money. The pejorative term for that is \n``soft money,'' but it should not be a pejorative thing. The national \npolitical parties get involved in State elections, local elections. \nThey need to be there to protect their candidates if they are attacked \nby the issue ads of someone else.\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\n  All of this is constitutionally protected speech. Obviously, we do \nnot like it when they are saying something against us. We applaud it \nwhen somebody is trying to help us. But the problem is not too much \ndiscussion, Mr. President. America is not going to get in trouble \nbecause of too much discussion.\n  In fact, we have killed this kind of proposal now for 10 years. It is \nunrelated to the popularity of Congress. Congress is currently sitting \non a 55 to 60 percent approval rating, the highest approval rating in \nthe last 25 years. It achieved that approval rating in spite of the \nfact that this issue was not approved last year, nor the year before, \nand, Mr. President, I am confident will not be approved this afternoon.\n  So when a motion to table is made, I hope that the majority of the \nSenate will support a motion to table McCain-Feingold.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In a moment, I will yield to the senior Senator from \nArizona. But before I do, let me make clear what we are tabling here \ntoday if we table the McCain-Feingold amendment.\n  The other side would have us believe it is one narrow aspect of a \nbill that has to do with certain aspects of express advocacy and \nindependent advocacy. Surely, that is part of the bill. But what they \ndon't talk about very much is what else would be tabled. It would \ninvolve the tabling of a complete ban on soft money. It would be wiping \nout the opportunity for this Congress to have a ban on soft money. What \nthat means is they are also tabling a concept that has been endorsed by \nover 100 former Members of Congress who signed a letter to ban soft \nmoney.\n\n  It is also a denial and tabling of an effort to ban soft money that \nhas been endorsed by people like former Presidents George Bush and \nJimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. In addition, if this tabling motion \nprevails, you will be wiping out provisions that actually lower the \nprovisions that require candidates to report contributions of $50 and \nover, not just the ones of $200 and over. It would be wiping out \nprovisions that double the penalties for the knowing and willful \nviolations of Federal elections law and tabling the provisions that \nrequire full electronic disclosure of campaign contributions to the \nFEC.\n  You will be wiping out provisions that require the Federal Elections \nCommission to make those campaign finance records available on the \nInternet within 24 hours. You will be wiping out provisions that would \nstop the practice of Members of Congress using their franking \nprivileges, their mass mailing franking privileges in an election year. \nOur bill would ban that.\n  The tabling motion would wipe out the provisions that require a \ncandidate to clearly identify himself or herself on one of these \nnegative ads.\n  So the fact is this bill has many important provisions. A tabling \nmotion denies the chance to do all of these things. What the opposition \nhas chosen to focus on is merely a few aspects, which I think we are \nright about, but they completely ignore the many important items of \nenforcement and disclosure and the banning of soft money the McCain-\nFeingold bill would achieve.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to extend thanks, as \nis customary at the end of debates such as these, to the majority \nleader for agreeing to schedule this vote and to the minority leader \nfor all of his help in this effort, Senator Daschle, the Democratic \nleader. I would like to thank Senator McConnell of Kentucky for again \nconducting the debate, which is distinguished by its lack of rancor and \nby its adherence to an honest and open difference of opinion, a \nfundamental difference but one that I believe is strongly held by both \nSenator McConnell and myself.\n  As always, I want to thank my dear friend, Senator Feingold, who, in \nmy view, represents the very best in public service. As he and I differ \non a broad variety of issues, we have always agreed on the principle of \nthe importance, the integrity, and the honor associated with public \nservice.\n  Mr. President, since last year, a number of things have been \nhappening since we had votes last September. A very good manifestation \nof how this system is out of control was contained in the January 17 \nCongressional Quarterly about the California House race that is taking \nplace.\n  I will not go into all the details. This was January 17. On March 10 \nthere is an election. It lists noncandidate spending in the California \nspecial: Campaign for Working Families, $100,000; Americans for Limited \nTerms, $90,000; Foundation for Responsible Government, $50,000; Planned \nParenthood Action Fund, $40,000; Catholic Alliance, $40,000; California \nRepublican Assembly, $16,000; and the list goes on and on and on.\n  Millions of dollars are being spent in a House race in California. \nAnd you know what, Mr. President? Those funds and those campaigns are \nnot being conducted by the candidates. They are being conducted by \norganizations that enter into these races that sometimes have no \nconnection with the candidate themselves. And you know they all have \none thing in common. They are all negative, Mr. President, they are all \nnegative.\n\n  One of the radio ads says, ``Call Bordonaro and tell him you're not \nbuying Planned Parenthood. Tom Bordonaro is the definition of a \nreligious political extremist.'' That came from Planned Parenthood.\n  The same thing on both sides. You will never see one of these, Mr. \nPresident, in a so-called independent campaign that says, ``Vote for \nour guy or woman. They're very decent and wonderful people.'' Then we \nwonder why there is the cynicism and the lack of respect for those of \nus who engage in public service.\n  Mr. President, since last year there have been several indictments \nthat have come down. One thing I can predict to you with absolute \ncertainty on this floor; there will be more indictments, Mr. President, \nand there will be more scandals and more indictments and more scandals \nand more indictments and more people going to prison until we clean up \nthis system. There is too much money washing around. This money makes \ngood people do bad things and bad people do worse things.\n  I guarantee you, Mr. President, this system is so debasing as it is \ntoday that we will see lots of indictments, prison sentences and, \nfrankly, these investigations reaching levels which many of us had \nnever anticipated in the past.\n  We have also, thanks to our tenacity, gotten a vote. For the first \ntime, Members of the Senate will be on record on campaign finance \nreform. I have no doubt about what this vote is about. It is on \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Later, hopefully, we will have a vote on the Snowe amendment, which I \nthink is a compromise which is carefully crafted and one that deserves \nthe support of all of us. I believe that we are closer to the point \nthat I have long espoused and advocated to my friends and colleagues \nfrom both sides of this issue. We are closer to the point where all 100 \nof us agree that the system is broken and needs to be fixed and we need \nto sit down together and work out the resolution to this terrible \nproblem which is afflicting America, which we can work out in a \nbipartisan fashion that favors neither one party nor the other.\n  The American people are demanding it, the American people deserve it, \nand the American people will get it. Mr. President, we will never give \nup on this issue because we know we are right in the pursuit of an \nissue that affects the very fiber of American life and American \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to table the McCain-Feingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 1646\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the McCain-Feingold amendment numbered 1646.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

ELECTIONEERING COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available to the Federal Communications \n     Commission may be expended to impose or enforce any \n     requirement or obligation with respect to the provision of \n     free or discounted television broadcast time for campaign \n     advertising unless such requirement or obligation is \n     specifically and expressly authorized by title III of the \n     Communications Act of 1934.\n       (b) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect two \n     days after enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate is now in a posture where the tree is filled with respect to the \npending campaign finance legislation. Senator McCain has offered his \nsubstitute amendment and we have had a very good discussion about the \nissue prior to the motion to table, and the time for the vote was \nagreed to and that occurred, of course, at 4 o'clock. The motion to \ntable did fail, although I think we should note that it was the \nidentical vote that we had on this same issue last year.\n  Now our colleague, Senator Snowe, has offered her version of paycheck \nprotection to the McCain-Feingold amendment, and I intend to file a \ncloture motion on that today. However, it is my hope that cloture votes \non the Snowe amendment could occur Thursday morning, but after we have \nhad debate tonight. She is prepared, I believe, to talk about her \namendment.\n  There also are a number of Senators who are very interested in \ntalking about the second-degree amendment, or the amendment I offered \nto her amendment. I know Senator McCain feels very strongly that the \nFCC should not impose the requirement of free broadcast time. Senator \nBurns had indicated he wanted to speak on this. We had been hoping he \nwould be here momentarily, and I am sure he will be, and he will want \nto speak on that issue, too.\n  So, after a debate on this issue, we expect to have a time set for a \nvote. But I will consult with the minority leader and also with the \nsponsor of the amendment and the second-degree amendment before we \nannounce a time on that.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 1647.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? So ordered.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the majority leader yield for a second?\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 1646.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to do that. Is \nthere objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, what is the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To be able to order the yeas and nays on \namendment No. 1646.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Did the majority leader ask unanimous consent to do \nthat? In that case, we will be compelled to object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question? My \nunderstanding of the majority leader's amendment is it would bar the \nFCC from allocating free television time to candidates. As the majority \nleader pointed out, that is a position that I share because I believe \nonly the legislative and executive branch should be responsible for \nwhat basically changes the entire electoral system in this country.\n  But my question to the majority leader is that, following disposition \nof his amendment, either through tabling or up-or-down vote, would the \nmajority leader be amenable to a unanimous consent request that Senator \nSnowe's amendment be taken up without amendment, so that the Senate can \nvote on this issue?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me discuss this with you, Senator McCain, and with \nSenator Snowe. I want to make sure we had considered all of the \nramifications to that. I think probably the answer may be yes, but I \nwould like to make sure we have had a chance to talk it through. I am \nnot making a commitment at this point.\n  I think it is important that we have a full discussion on the FCC \neffort and we have a full discussion on our amendment. That will give \nus time. I presume she is not interested in having a vote this \nafternoon, so we will have some time tonight to talk about that and \nthen tomorrow, after the funeral services for Senator Ribicoff, and \nthen after the vote on the military construction appropriations bill, \nwe will come back to this issue around, I guess, 3:30. Then, hopefully, \nwe will have a vote sometime tomorrow afternoon, probably around this \ntime or a little earlier. We will talk about what order that would be \nin prior to that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the majority leader will further yield, I thank him \nfor that consideration. I do believe, obviously, that we should have a \nvote on the Snowe amendment, and I appreciate his consideration of it. \nOf course, whether we were going to have a vote on the Snowe amendment \nwould obviously dictate my vote and, I think, that of some of my \ncolleagues, including those on the other side of the aisle who may \nshare our view concerning whether the FCC should be deciding these \nthings or not. Because, if it serves just to kill our ability to vote \non the Snowe amendment, then obviously that may not be something that I \nwould want to support. But I appreciate the majority leader's \nconsideration.\n  Mr. LOTT. I agree with the chairman of the committee. I feel very \nstrongly the FCC should not be doing this. I would like to inquire, \ndoes the chairman of the committee intend to have some hearings on this \nand maybe move this as an amendment or as a part of another bill at \nsome point? Perhaps this year?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would hope so. As you know, the majority leader knows I \nam loath--loath--to determine policy issues on appropriations bills. \nBut on occasion there might be some exception made to my absolute \nopposition to any authorization on appropriations bills, because I feel \nthis is a very important issue. I thank the majority leader.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I file two cloture motions, one on the McCain-Feingold \namendment and then on the Snowe--first on Snowe and then on McCain.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Snowe \n     amendment:\n       Edward M.

Kerrey, Ernest F. \n     Hollings, Daniel Moynihan, Patty Murray, Carol Moseley-Braun, \n     and Max Cleland.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, here we go again. I thought that we had \nan understanding about the opportunity that we would be presented to \nhave a good debate. In fact, I am going to go back to the Record and \ncheck, but I am quite sure that there was some understanding that there \nwould not be any need to fill trees and to prevent open and free \ndebate, because we saw what happened the last time we tried this. It \nlocked up the Senate for weeks on end with absolutely no result.\n  I would ask my colleagues, what are you afraid of here? Why are our \ncolleagues on the other side not willing to allow this body to work its \nwill? Why is the majority party filibustering legislation that the \nmajority of Senators supports?\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed and frustrated. I am prepared to \ntake this to whatever length is required to bring it to a successful \nresolution this week, next week, at some point in the future. We have a \nlot of work to do here, and I want to work with the majority leader to \nfind a way to accomplish all that must be done. But I can't think of a \nbetter way to slow progress, to stop progress, to preclude us from \ngetting our work done than to deny this body the opportunity to have a \ngood debate and some votes on this important issue.\n  I must say, it is, again, a reminder to the Democratic caucus that \nwhen we enter into these agreements, we better check the writing, we \nbetter check the specifics, we better ensure we have a clear \nunderstanding of what the agreement is.\n  There was a colloquy just a moment ago about whether or not we could \nhave an up-or-down vote on the Snowe amendment. Clearly, with this \nscenario, there is no way you can have an up-or-down vote on the Snowe \namendment. This is a tree so loaded that the branches are breaking. And \nso I suppose I could dream someday of drafting a scenario that would \nallow us to get to the amendment of the Senator from Maine. It ain't \ngoing to happen. With the tree as filled as it is right now, there is \nno way there will be a vote on the Snowe amendment.\n  I note, and the majority leader even noted, that there is maybe \nanother option, another route, another bill, maybe, as the Senator from \nArizona suggested, an appropriations bill. I suspect that this loaded \ntree will provide both sides with ample opportunity to offer amendments \nand bills to other amendments, and with a limited period of time, we \nall know what that means. But if those are the cards we are dealt, I am \nprepared to accept that as the circumstance and deal with it.\n  It is really amazing to me that there are those in the Senate who \nprofess to support a process by which we can accomplish all of our \nlegislative goals, but then continue to put obstacles in the path of \nresolution to the objectives in reaching those goals.\n  So, I am disappointed and, frankly, somewhat amazed that we have not \nlearned our lessons of the past. But so be it, the tree is filled, the \nopportunities will be there, either this week, next week, the week \nafter, but they will be there, just as they were last fall.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the minority leader for yielding for a question. \nSo that those who watch these proceedings and listen to these \nproceedings understand, is it not the case that a procedure, a rarely \nused procedure until recently, has been used today that is designed to \nblock legislation, that creates shackles and handcuffs designed in a \nway to lock the legislation up so it can't move?\n  We were, as I recall, promised some long while ago that we would be \nable to consider campaign finance reform legislation on the floor of \nthe Senate. So, a date was set, a time for a vote was set, and the \nlegislation came to the floor of the Senate, at which time we discover \nthat, although we have a first vote on a tabling motion, following that \nvote, this procedure, throughout its history always used to block \nlegislation, is immediately employed.\n  The implication of that, I guess, is that there is not a desire to \nproceed to consider, fully consider campaign finance reform. Many in \nthis Chamber have other amendments they wish to offer, have considered \nand have votes on. It appears to me that the procedure now employed by \nthe majority leader is to say, ``Yes, I brought it to the floor; yes, \nyou had one tabling vote, and from now on we will do it the way I want \nto do it.'' As the Senator from South Dakota said, the majority leader \nexpressed, ``I filled up the tree and we will allow only amendments \nthat I will allow in the future.'' It seems to me that is not an \napproach that is designed to allow consideration of campaign finance \nreform.\n\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota, was it your understanding when \nwe had an agreement on this issue that campaign finance reform would be \nbrought to the floor of the Senate for a debate and for the opportunity \nto offer amendments and to consider fully and have votes on issues \nrelated to that subject?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely correct. I \nthink we can all go back and look through the Record and, again, as I \nsay, we have to look at the meaning of each word in these agreements \nwith perhaps greater skepticism. This idea of filling the tree is great \nshort-term strategy. It has a horrible long-term effect, long-term \neffect on the comity of the of the Senate, long-term effect on getting \nlegislation accomplished.\n  So we are compelled, once again, to use the techniques and methods we \nhave used in the past. It is very likely that we will be relegated to \nusing them again in the future.\n  The Senator is right, clearly we had an understanding that we would \nhave an opportunity to debate issues, to offer amendments and \nultimately to resolve this issue. We have been denied that as a result \nof the actions taken just now, and I deeply regret it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the minority leader yield for one moment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It will take me only a few seconds. Since this is an \neffort to basically choke off debate and deny us an opportunity to \npresent amendments--many of us worked on this for years and care \nfiercely about it and many of the people in the country do. The \nminority leader understands and certainly realizes that on any bill \nthat comes up forthwith, it would be our right to come back with these \namendments, is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Minnesota is absolutely right. We will \nhave the opportunity on countless occasions over the course of the next \n10 months to revisit this issue, which obviously we will be in a \nposition to do and be prepared to begin at some point either this week \nor next week. But we will certainly pursue this in other ways.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the leader, because I very much want to do \nthat. We have a right to continue to do this and if we are serious \nabout it, we will fight for it, and we can bring amendments out over \nand over and over again, is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask the leader, referring back to the October 30, 1997, \nCongressional Record, reading from the language of the leader himself, \nhe said:\n\n\n[[Page S910]]\n\n\n       This is not better--\n\n  Referring to the agreement--\n\n       This is not better necessarily for Democrats or \n     Republicans. But in our view, this is a very big victory for \n     the country. This will give us an opportunity to have a good \n     debate as we have discussed.\n\n  And then going on further, the minority leader said:\n\n       I expect a full-fledged debate with plenty of opportunity \n     to offer amendments. Given this agreement, now I have every \n     assurance and confidence that will happen.\n\n  I recall, having been part of the discussion and referring back to \nSenator Lott's request, Senator Lott said:\n\n       I further ask that if the amendment--\n\n  Referring to Senator McCain's amendment--\n\n     is not tabled . . . the underlying bill will be open to \n     further amendments, debates and motions.\n\n  There was a clear understanding, if I am correct, and I ask the \nleader if there was not a clear understanding, that while the \nRepublicans retained the right to filibuster, they would not fill up \nthe tree and they would not deny the Senate the right to have the \nopportunity to debate and have a series of votes on the substantive \nissues, but that there would be a distinct opportunity for both sides \nto be able to amend and follow this debate? Is that the minority \nleader's understanding, and is that a correct reference to the language \nthat he relied on at that time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There is no doubt about it. Again, Senator Lott, and I \nquote a comment he made to reporters that very day, said: ``As far as I \ncan tell at this point, amendments would certainly be in order, would \nbe considered, they might be second-degreed and they certainly would be \ngiven a third degree.''\n  There is no question that we had the clear understanding that there \nwould be an opportunity to have a good debate, offer amendments, have \nthem voted upon and ultimately dispose of this issue.\n  So I am really disappointed we have not been able to reach that point \nin this debate to date, and this, in my view, is not what we had agreed \nto last fall.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the minority leader. I simply express on behalf of \nall of us I think who had an anticipation of an opportunity to bring a \nnumber of amendments that this is a setback for the Senate and it is \nclearly a setback for all those in the country who thought the Senate \ncould approach the issue of reform responsibly.\n  When we talk about filling the tree here, for a lot of people who \nlisten to these debates and don't know what that means, under the rules \nof the Senate, we are given an opportunity to be able to bring up an \namendment according to the rules. But according to the rules, the \nmajority leader has the opportunity of right of recognition to take up \nall of the options that the rules allow in order to bring up \namendments. By doing that, he can choose to deny any other opportunity \nfor an amendment.\n  That is precisely what the majority leader has chosen to do here. \nWhen we say he has filled up the tree, he has denied the Senate the \nopportunity to be able to bring amendments in order to be able to work \nthe legislative process as people sent us here to do.\n  I think what he has asked for is a long process of delay. He has \ninitiated gridlock in the U.S. Senate again, solely to protect a \ncertain group of narrow vested interests represented in this campaign \nfinance debate. It is very, very clear as of today, there are a \nmajority of the U.S. Senate prepared to vote for campaign finance \nreform. There is a minority that is trying to stop it. They have that \nright, but they also, I hope, will be subject to the judgment of the \nAmerican people who will recognize who is for campaign finance reform \nand who is against it. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. For one additional question. I mentioned in my initial \nquestion to the Senator from South Dakota, this is a rarely used \napproach. It is true that this approach has been used by the majority \nleader a couple of times last year, but in history, it has been rarely \nused in the Senate. And the reason is, it is almost exclusively used to \nblock legislation, but it is never successful, because you can block \nsomeone by tying legislation up in chains and shackles now and \npreventing anybody from offering an amendment, but you can't prevent \nthat forever. You have to bring legislation to the floor of the Senate \nat some point which, according to the rules of the Senate, will allow \nanother Senator to stand up and offer an amendment to such legislation.\n  In my judgment, this is very counterproductive. Some in this Chamber \nwant to dig their heels in and say, ``Notwithstanding what the majority \nwants to do in this Chamber, we intend to block campaign finance \nreform.'' You can block the right of Members to offer amendments now if \nyou use this rarely used procedure, but you can't block people here \nforever from doing what we want to do, and that is have a full and good \ndebate on campaign finance reform, offer amendments and have votes on \nthose amendments.\n  I don't think the American people are going to be denied on this \nissue. The American people know this system is broken, it needs fixing, \nand they want this Congress and this Senate to do something about it. \nWe can temporarily tie it up in these legislative chains, but that is \nnot going to last forever, and I think that simply delays the final \nconsideration of this issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I listened with great \ninterest to the comments of the Democratic leader and others on that \nside of the aisle. Point No. 1 should be crystal clear to everyone who \nhas followed this debate. Forty-eight Senators are not in favor of this \nmeasure.\n  In the Senate, as we know in recent years, every issue of any \ncontroversy requires 60 votes. So it is not at all unusual when an \nissue cannot achieve 60 votes for it not to go forward. That is the \nnorm around here.\n  Point 2. It does not make any difference in what context the issue \ncomes up. There are 48 people in the Senate who are not willing to vote \nfor this measure either on cloture or on a motion to table. So it isn't \ngoing to pass. It is not going to pass today, not tomorrow, not 3 \nmonths from now, not 5 months from now. We can decide whether we want \nto waste the Senate's time on an issue that is not going to pass. But \nit is clearly a waste of time.\n  With regard to how unusual it is to fill up the tree, let me just \nmention that when Senator Mitchell was majority leader in the 103d \nCongress, he filled up the tree on February 4, 1993; February 24, 1993; \nJanuary 31, 1994; May 10, 1994; May 18, 1994; June 9, 1994; June 14, \n1994; June 14, 1994; and August 18, 1994. Those are nine occasions, Mr. \nPresident, when Senator Mitchell, during the 103d Congress, nine \noccasions in which Senator Mitchell filled up the tree. This is not \nexactly uncommon. It is not a routine everyday activity, but it \ncertainly is not uncommon.\n  In 1977, Jimmy Carter's energy deregulation bill, Senator Byrd was \nthe leader and he filled up the amendment tree.\n  In 1984, in the Grove City case, Senator Byrd was in the minority, \nand he filled up the tree.\n  In 1985, the budget resolution, Senator Dole was the majority leader, \nand he filled up the tree.\n  In 1988, campaign finance--it has been around for a while--Senator \nByrd filled up the tree, and there were eight cloture votes.\n  In 1993, there was an emergency supplemental appropriations bill, the \nso-called stimulus bill. Senator Byrd filled up the tree.\n  Let me say that it is not an everyday action but it is not uncommon \nfor majority leaders to fill up the tree. What is fairly unusual is for \nthe minorities to file cloture motions. Not common, typically done by \nthe majority. And the only cloture motions we have at the desk at the \nmoment are by the minority.\n  But the fundamental point is this, Mr. President. There are not \nenough votes in the Senate to pass this kind of measure. Consequently, \nit isn't going to happen. That is the way the process works around \nhere. And we can waste a whole lot of time having repetitive\n\n[[Page S911]]\n\nvotes. The 48 votes that were cast in favor of the motion to table were \nthe same 48 votes that were cast against cloture in October. And it \nwill be the same 48 votes that will be cast whether it is a motion to \ntable or a motion to invoke cloture no matter how many times it is \noffered. So who is wasting the people's time here? It is certainly not \nthe majority.\n  The majority leader sets the agenda. He is anxious to move on to \nissues that people care about that will make a difference to this \ncountry. And clearly, any way you interpret what had happened last \nOctober and here in February, there are not enough votes to pass this \nkind of campaign finance reform.\n  So, Mr. President, I just wanted to set the record straight with \nregard to how unusual it is for a majority leader to fill up the tree \nand to make the point that the 48 votes that were cast in favor of the \nmotion to table today were the same 48 votes cast against the cloture \nmotion back in October. This is a high water mark in the 10 years I \nhave handled this debate. And 48 votes is the best we have ever done. \nThis measure simply isn't going to pass.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Kentucky, \nlet me say the point still stands. I ask the Senator from Kentucky to \ndo a little research and tell me whether in all of those instances, \nwhere he described the so-called filling of the tree, whether someone \ncame to the floor of the Senate and tried to fill the legislative tree \nor create a set of chains beyond which the Senate could not work before \nfiling a cloture motion and allowing the votes on amendments on an \nissue. I do not think he will find that circumstance existed.\n\n  He pointed out a number of occasions when the legislative approach \nwas used. I said it is rarely used. I stand by that. But it is almost \nnever used in a circumstance where prior to a cloture vote and prior to \nallowing amendments to be offered and voted, someone comes out here and \nties the legislative system up with these chains and shackles. That has \nnot been the case. And so we ought not to suggest this is some normal \nprocedure that has been used on occasion over the years by both sides.\n  The point I make is this. This is not a partisan issue. There are \nRepublicans that support campaign finance reform and Democrats who \nsupport campaign finance reform. In fact, there is a majority of the \nMembers of this body that support campaign finance reform and if we can \nhave a vote up or down on final passage in some reasonable form on \ncampaign finance reform, it is going to pass. It is what the American \npeople want and it is what this Congress ought to do.\n  The Senator from Kentucky appropriately said that there is a 60-vote \nissue in the Senate. And I understand that. That is what the rules \nprovide. But it is extraordinary and it is unusual before a vote on \ncloture or vote on amendments with the exception of one for somebody to \ncome out and say we are going to tie this whole system up and we are \ngoing to use a procedure that is always used to block legislation.\n  I say, we ought to let the American people have their day on the \nfloor of the Senate. And their day is a day in which the Senate \nrecognizes that this system needs reforming, this system needs \nchanging. And if we debate between Republicans and Democrats and find a \nset of proposals, starting with McCain-Feingold, which I support, \nconcluding perhaps with Snowe-Jeffords, which I also will support, and \nperhaps with some additional amendments, we will, I think, find an \napproach for campaign finance reform that, while not perfect, certainly \ndoes improve campaign finance in this country.\n  You cannot, in my judgment, stand here today and say, ``Gee, the \ncurrent system works really well. This is really a good system.'' The \ngenesis of this system starts in 1974, with the campaign finance reform \nlegislation in 1974. The system has been changed somewhat over the \nyears by virtue of court decisions and rule changes, and also by some \nof the smartest legal minds in our country trying to figure out how you \nget campaign money under the door and over the transom and into the \ncampaign finance system. The rules have now been mangled and distorted \nso badly that the system just does not work.\n  And if you have a system that is not working, it seems to me our \nresponsibility is to say: Let's fix it. And, by the way, despite many \nattempts to muddy the waters on this, we are not saying: Let's fix it \nin a way that denies anyone a voice in this system or attempts to shut \nanyone down or any group down.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill, in my judgment, is a very reasonable \napproach to addressing the abuses and the problems in the current \ncampaign finance system.\n  The Snowe-Jeffords proposal, which I will support, is one that falls \nshort of what I would like--I would like to expand its reach, and \nprefer the issue advocacy approach in the original McCain-Feingold.\n  Senator Snowe is on the floor and prepared to speak to that \namendment. Will her proposal advance us towards a better system? Yes, \nit will. So let us decide that we can be more than just roadblocks. I \nmean, the easiest thing in the world is to be a roadblock to something. \nI think it was Mark Twain who once said, when he was asked if he would \nbe willing to debate an issue, ``Of course, providing I'm on the \nnegative side.''\n  They said, ``You don't even know the subject.''\n  He said, ``It doesn't matter. It doesn't take any time to prepare for \nthe negative side.''\n  It is always easy to be against something.\n  So I hope, as we go along, the majority leader and others will think \nbetter of a strategy that says we allowed you to bring it to the floor, \nbut we are not going to allow a full and free debate and votes on \namendments. I hope he will think better of that, because there isn't a \nway, in the long run, to shut off our opportunity to thoughtfully \nconsider this legislation, and to prevent our ability to offer \namendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1647\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Jeffords, along with a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues--Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, Senator Levin, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Chafee, Senator Collins, Senator Thompson, which I \nbelieve represents a commonsense middle-ground approach to reforming \nour campaign financing system in America.\n  As I think our colleagues know, I have long been a proponent of fair, \nmeaningful changes in the way campaigns are financed in this country. \nThat is why, when this issue came to the floor last year, I worked with \nSenators McCain, Jeffords, Feingold, Senator Daschle, and others, to \ntry to forge a compromise that would address the concerns of both sides \nand move the debate forward. I said then on the Senate floor, and say \nagain today, that we should be putting our heads together, not building \nwalls between us with intractable rhetoric and all-or-nothing \npropositions.\n  While that effort was not successful, I am pleased that we are again \nhaving the opportunity to address campaign reform, and I thank the \ndistinguished majority leader for making this possible. I also want to \nthank the bill's sponsors--Senators McCain and Feingold--for their \ncontinued leadership and determination on this issue, and their support \nof the efforts that are being done here today with Senator Jeffords and \nmyself.\n  I want to acknowledge the hard work of my colleagues who are \ncommitting themselves to this compromise amendment and have committed \nthemselves to moving campaign finance reform forward: Senators Levin, \nChafee, Lieberman, Thompson, Collins, Breaux, and Specter have worked \nvery hard with us on crafting this amendment. They have made clear \ntheir support for meaningful reform this year.\n  Last year, this body became stuck in the mire of all-or-nothing \npropositions and intransigence. We missed an opportunity to coalesce \naround a middle\n\n[[Page S912]]\n\nground--any middle ground--and the result was that the status quo \nremained alive and well. Despite the efforts of some of us who tried to \nwork to forge a compromise that would have moved the debate forward, \ncampaign finance reform died a quiet and ignoble death here in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  The reasons are many but the central issue then, as now, centered on \nthe objection of Republicans to a package that does not address the \nissue of protecting union members from having their dues used without \ntheir permission for political purposes with which they may disagree, \nand the objection of Democrats to singling out unions while not \nproviding similar protections for corporation shareholders.\n  Let me say that I am among those Republicans who have had a concern \nabout the use of union dues for political purposes and, in fact, the \ncampaign finance reform bill that I introduced last year included \nlanguage similar to the Paycheck Protection Act. I happen to think it \nis not a bad idea, and in a perfect world where I could get my way on \nthis and still pass meaningful reform, I would support it.\n  But the fact is, I believe we can still have fair and meaningful \nreform at the same time we take a step back from this incredibly \ndivisive issue. In fact, it is probably the only way we can have such \nreform. The bottom line is, we will never pass campaign finance \nlegislation--at least in the foreseeable future--if we take an all-or-\nnothing approach on this facet of reform. And I believe that we can and \nmust make significant changes that may not be perfect, that may not \nmake everyone happy, but which will be a great improvement over the \ncurrent morass we find ourselves in.\n\n  If we do nothing, we will see a repeat--or likely an even worse \nscenario--of what we saw in 1996, which confirmed all the reasons why \nit is imperative to be strong proponents of campaign finance reform. We \nsaw over $223.4 million in soft money raised by the two national \nparties--three times more than in the last Presidential election. We \nsaw more than $150 million--we do not know the precise amount because \nit is not disclosed--spent on attack ads paid with unlimited funds by \nthird-party groups that made candidates largely incidental to their own \ncampaigns.\n  We saw an electorate that was, to put it bluntly, disgusted by the \nspectacle. And the 1996 elections were barely over when allegations \nwere made of illegal and improper activities, centered around the \nissues of so-called ``soft money'' and foreign influence peddling \nthrough campaign contributions, all egregious abuses highlighted by the \nSenate Governmental Affairs hearings.\n  All of this has only served to further undermine public confidence \nand underscore the importance of enacting meaningful and achievable \ncampaign finance reform this year.\n  I believe that S. 25 is a good start, and I commend Senators McCain \nand Feingold for their tenacity in getting this bill to the Senate \nfloor once again. One of the most important aspects of this scaled-back \nversion of the original bill is its ban on soft money. We all know that \nsoft money is becoming a major issue, and for good reason. It is money \nthat circumvents the intent of the law--unaccounted for money which \ninfluences Federal campaigns above and beyond the intended limits.\n  S. 25 takes a tremendous step forward by putting an end to national \nparty soft money, as well as codifying the so-called Beck decision, \nmaking prudent disclosure reforms, tightening coordinating definitions, \nand working to level the playing field for candidates facing opponents \nwith vast personal wealth to spend in their own campaigns.\n  Do I think this is a perfect bill? No. Are there other things I would \nlike included? Of course. Do I think it can be improved? Certainly. \nThat is why I have again teamed up with my colleague from Vermont, \nSenator Jeffords, to work with the sponsors of this legislation, \nSenators McCain and Feingold and others, in a fresh approach developed \nby noted experts and reformers, including Norm Ornstein, Dan Ortiz of \nthe University of Virginia School of Law, Josh Rosenkranz at the \nBrennan Center for Justice at NYU, as well as others. They developed a \nproposal to address the exploding use of unregulated and undisclosed \nadvertising that affects Federal elections and the concerns of many \nthat the intent of S. 25 to address this issue would not withstand or \nsurvive court scrutiny.\n  Therefore, the amendment that my colleague from Vermont and I are \noffering will fundamentally change the way in which the underlying bill \naddresses this issue. It strikes section 201 of title II, which \nredefines express advocacy and replaces it with the language that we \nhave offered in our amendment that makes a clearly defined distinction \nbetween issue advocacy and influencing a Federal election. In other \nwords, we are making a distinction between candidate advocacy and issue \nadvocacy. This is important because, if the courts rule the efforts of \nS. 25 to address this distinction as unconstitutional, then essentially \nall that will remain from S. 25 is a ban on soft money. If that \nhappens, we will be left with only one-half of the equation. I share \nthe concerns of those who want to see balanced reform and who want to \nimprove the system.\n  Our amendment applies to advertisements that constitute the most \nblatant form of electioneering. The chart to my left shows what the \nSnowe-Jeffords amendment does. It is a straightforward, two-tier \napproach that only applies to ads run on television or radio--those are \nthe only ads that this amendment addresses--near an election, 60 days \nbefore a general election, 30 days before a primary, that identify a \nFederal candidate, that mentions a Federal candidate in that radio ad \nor that television ad, and only if the group spends more than $10,000 \non such ads in a year. What we require is the sponsors' disclosure and \nalso the donors on such ads because we think it is important that \ndonors who contribute more than $500 to such ads should be disclosed by \nthese organizations.\n  The amendment also prohibits direct or indirect use of corporation or \nunion money to fund the ads in the 60 days before the general election \nand 30 days before the primary. We call this new category \n``electioneering'' ads--again, making the distinction between issue \nadvocacy and candidate advocacy designed to influence the outcome of a \nFederal election.\n  They are the only communications that we address in our amendment, \nand we define them very narrowly and very clearly. If the ad is not run \non television or radio, if the ad is not aired within 30 days of a \nprimary and 60 days before a general election, if the ad doesn't \nmention a candidate's name or otherwise identify either he or she \nclearly, if it isn't targeted at the candidate's electorate, or if a \ngroup hasn't spent more than $10,000 in that year on these ads, then it \nis not an electioneering ad. If an item appears in a news story, \neditorial, commentary, distributed through a broadcast station, it is \nalso not an electioneering ad, plain and simple.\n  If one does run one of these electioneering ads, two things happen. \nFirst, the sponsor must disclose the amount spent and the identity of \nthe contributors who donated more than $500 to the group since January \n1 of the previous year. Right now, candidates, as we all well know \nsince we have been candidates, have to disclose campaign contributions \nover $200. So the threshold and the requirement in this amendment is \nmuch higher.\n  Second, the ad cannot be paid for by funds from a business \ncorporation or labor union in the nonvoluntary contributions such as \nunion dues or corporate treasury funds.\n  Again, I just want to repeat, these are basically the provisions on \nwhat this amendment would do. We have heard a lot of things about what \nit would do, and I want to make sure that everybody understands. It is \nvery simple, very direct, it is very narrow. The clear and narrow \nwording of this amendment is important because it passes two critical \nfirst amendment doctrines that were at the heart of the Supreme Court's \nlandmark Buckley v. Valeo decision--vagueness and overbreadth.\n  Vagueness could chill free speech if someone who would otherwise \nspeak chooses not to because the rules aren't clear and they fear \nrunning afoul of the law. We agree that free speech should not be \nchilled, and that is why our rules are clear. Any sponsor will know \nwith certainty if their ad is an electioneering ad. That, again, gets \nback to when the ad is run and whether or not it mentions a candidate \nby name.\n\n[[Page S913]]\n\n  Overbreadth can unintentionally sweep in a substantial amount of \nconstitutionally protected speech. But our amendment is so narrow that \nit easily satisfies the Supreme Court's overbreadth concerns. We \nstrictly limit our requirement to ads near an election that identify a \ncandidate or ads that plainly intend to convince voters to vote for or \nagainst a particular candidate.\n\n  Nothing in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment restricts the right of any \nadvocacy group, labor union, or business corporation from engaging in \nissue advocacy or urging grassroots communications. If a group were \ntruly interested in only the issues, all they would have to do to avoid \nour requirements is to run an ad talking about the issues and \nencouraging people to call their Senators rather than naming them. \nIndeed, nothing in our amendment prohibits groups like the National \nRight-to-Life Committee, the Sierra Club, and a host of groups that \nexist in America from running electioneering ads, either. We just \nrequire them to disclose how much they are spending on electioneering \nads, who contributes more than $500, and we prohibit them from using \nunion and corporation money during that 60-day period before the \ngeneral election and 30 days before a primary.\n  So we create a very narrow standard. Even if the threshold of \ndisclosure is $500, it is not like what it was in the Buckley v. Valeo \ndecision where it was $10. That was broad and it was sweeping, drawing \neverybody in, and it raised questions in the Court. That is why they \nstruck it down. We are raising a threshold of $500--$300 more than we \nare required in terms of disclosing our donors.\n  Both of the basic principles, disclosure and a prohibition on union \nand corporation treasury funds, not only make sense, they are also on \nsolid, legal footing. As detailed in a letter recently circulated by \nlegal experts Burt Neuborne, professor of law at NYU School of Law; \nNorm Ornstein; Dan Ortiz; and Josh Rosenkranz, executive director of \nthe Brennan Center, the Supreme Court has made clear that, for \nconstitutional purposes, electioneering is different from other forms \nof speech. Congress is permitted to demand the sponsor of an \nelectioneering message to disclose the amount spent on the message and \nthe source of funds. Congress may prohibit corporation and labor unions \nfrom spending money on electioneering. These legal scholars further \nstate that in Buckley the court declared that the governmental \ninterests that justify disclosure of election-related spending are \nconsiderably broader and more palatable than those justifying \nprohibitions or restrictions on election-related spending.\n  Disclosure rules, the Court said, enhance the information available \nto the voting public. That is why we disclose; that is why we are \nrequired to disclose; that is why the Congress can require us to \ndisclose; and that is why the Supreme Court has upheld it. Disclosure \nrules, according to the Supreme Court, are the least restrictive means \nof curbing the evils of campaign ignorance and of corruption. Our \ndisclosure rules are eminently reasonable.\n  Second, the Congress has had a long record, which has been upheld, of \nimposing more strenuous spending restrictions on corporations and labor \nunions. Corporations have been banned from electioneering since 1907, \nunions since 1947. As the Supreme Court pointed out in the United \nStates v. UAW, Congress banned corporate and union contributions in \norder ``to avoid the deleterious influences on Federal elections \nresulting from the use of money by those who exercise control over \nlarge aggregations of capital.'' In 1990 the Supreme Court upheld that \nrationale, as well.\n  If anything, we have increased first amendment rights for union \nmembers and shareholders, while we maintain the right of labor and \ncorporate management to speak through PACs and raising hard money like \nother political action committees.\n  As these legal experts further state, ``The Snowe-Jeffords amendment \nbuilds on these bedrock principles, extending current regulations \ncautiously and only in the areas in which the first amendment \nprotection is at its lowest ebb. It works within the framework of the \ntwo contexts--disclosure rules and corporate and union spending--'' \nwhich the Supreme Court allows and says we have the broadest discretion \nwhen it comes to governmental interest and governmental regulations, as \nwell as corporate and union spending because we have had a century of \nrulings by the Supreme Court, not to mention Congress, in this issue, \n``in which the Supreme Court, as well, has been most tolerant of \ncampaign finance regulations.''\n  Hearing the debate here today, there have already been misconceptions \nout there. I think it is important to make very clear what this \namendment does not do. I have a chart here to my right that talks about \nwhat the Snowe-Jeffords amendment would not do. I think it is important \nto restate this because there is a lot of information that has been \ncirculated here in the Congress about saying what it would do, from a \nvariety of groups, saying they would not be able to disseminate \nelectioneering communications.\n  That is not true. It would not prohibit groups like the Sierra Club \nor the right-to-life or any other group from disseminating \nelectioneering communications. They can send out whatever they want.\n\n  It would not prohibit these groups, again, from accepting corporate \nor labor funds.\n  It would not require groups like the Sierra Club or right-to-life to \ncreate a PAC or other separate entities.\n  It would not bar or require disclosure of communications by print \nmedia, direct mail, voter guides or any other nonbroadcast media \nbecause, again, it only applies to TV and radio broadcast 60 days \nbefore the election.\n  It would not affect the ability of any organization to urge \ngrassroots contacts with lawmakers on upcoming votes. They could say, \n``Call your Senator.'' They could say, ``Call your Senator on the 1-800 \nnumber'' which is a very popular means of advertising today. But if \nthey use the Senator's name 60 days before the election, they have to \ndisclose their donors who donate more than $500.\n  It does not require invasive disclosure of all donors, because some \nhave said it will require them to release their donors list. Well, we \nall have to release donors at a certain threshold. We are not requiring \neverybody to release donors lists. We are saying in a very narrow \nperiod, right before the election, those groups who identify candidates \nin their ads or use a likeness are required to disclose their donors \nwho donate more than $500. That is not invasive. It is not intrusive.\n  It would not require advance disclosure of full contents of ads. Some \nhave said in some of the material circulated here in Congress that \nsomehow these groups will be required to disclose in advance the \ncontents of their ad. That is not true.\n  So, it is important to understand what this amendment does as much as \nin terms of what it does not do. It is a very limiting amendment. That \nis why it will withstand constitutional scrutiny. That is why it is \nimportant for everybody to understand that. So every group can \nadvertise, they can communicate, they can accept money. But in that \nnarrow period of time before the general election, if they target a \ncandidate by identifying them by name--because if they are doing that, \nit is designed to influence the outcome of the election--that will be \nupheld by the courts.\n  We are not saying they can't engage in grassroots activities and \ncommunications with their lawmakers who come and vote in Congress. They \ncan urge their Senator or urge their Congressman to vote for or against \nsuch and such a bill. It is not affected by this amendment. All we are \ndoing is requiring disclosure. Now that is for a very good reason, as \nto why we require disclosure, as we will see in the next chart of how \nmuch money is being placed in these elections by groups that don't have \nto disclose $1.\n  Mr. President, this is a sensitive and reasonable approach to \naddressing a burgeoning segment of electioneering that is making a \nmockery of our campaign finance system. That is why it is important to \nuse the 1996 election. It is certainly the one that reflects the most \nsignificant changes in campaigns. As is indicated by the two charts \nbehind me--and I am going to describe this because I think it is \ninteresting to show the problem we are facing in elections today, and \nit will only get worse.\n\n[[Page S914]]\n\n It will only get worse. We haven't seen a declining amount of money in \neach subsequent election. In fact, the opposite is true, as we well \nknow.\n  According to the Annenberg Public Policy Center, it shows that $130 \nmillion to $150 million was spent on issue ads in the 1996 election. \nBut that is just a guesstimate because they don't disclose. We don't \nknow. It could be far more than that. It could be more than $150 \nmillion. That is the best guess, the best estimate anybody can make. \nMoney spent by all candidates, including the President, U.S. Senate and \nU.S. House, was $400 million. So a third of the ad spending was done on \nissue ads. A third of all the money that was spent by candidate \nadvertising was spent on issue ads, and they didn't even have to \ndisclose a dime.\n  Now, something is wrong. Something is wrong with a system where a \nthird of all the money was spent on candidate advertising and not one \ndime was disclosed in the last election. Do you think this number is \ngoing to get worse, or is it going to get better? It is going to get \nworse.\n  The chart represents the so-called issue ads in the 1996 elections. \nAgain, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania survey--and it is important to look at this \nbecause when you see so-called issue ads, many of them are designed to \ninfluence the outcome of an election. It is not talking about \nlegislative outcome. And no one wants to affect issue ads in which a \ngroup has a legitimate right and is entitled to discuss issues and run \nan ad that tells a Senator or a Member of Congress how to vote without \nidentifying them. You must disclose it if their name is mentioned, if \nyou do it 60 days before the election. Interestingly enough, on these \nso-called issue ads, almost 87 percent referred to an official or a \ncandidate; 87 percent of the so-called issue ads referred to an \nofficial or a candidate. Instead of saying, ``Call your Senator,'' or, \n``Call your Congressman,'' they identified that official or that \ncandidate by name. That is the big distinction between issue advocacy \nand candidate advocacy. We do not want to infringe upon the rights of \nthose groups who want to conduct grassroots communications through \ntheir membership or through Members of Congress and their elected \nofficials on the issues of true issue advocacy. But now it is becoming \ncandidate advocacy, designed to influence the outcome of a Federal \nelection.\n\n  Pure attack in 1996 issue ads. According to the Annenberg survey, 41 \npercent of those issue ads were ``pure attack''--41 percent; 24 \npercent, Presidential ads; debates, 15 percent; free time, 8.9 percent; \nand 36 percent from the news organizations. But 41 percent of the \nattacks came from what were so-called issue ads. That is the problem \nthat we are facing in the system today.\n  Now, that is why this amendment Senator Jeffords and I are offering \nrequires disclosure. We are not even saying they can't do it. We are \nsaying that 60 days before the election, if they mention a candidate by \nname, they have to disclose their donors of $500 or more. Now, I know \nthere are some in this body who object to disclosure. But can anyone, \nwith a straight face, tell me that when ads like these clearly cross \nthe line into electioneering--which is a different category--there \nshould not even be disclosure? Candidates, as I said earlier, have to \ndisclose, and as candidates, I could not believe we would not want more \ndisclosure in other areas that affect candidates in elections \nthroughout this country.\n  So can somebody honestly say that groups that spend millions of \ndollars in ads near elections that mention specific candidates don't \nhave to disclose anything? Are we prepared to say that we don't even \nhave the right to know who is spending vast sums of money to influence \nFederal elections? It is interesting to me we had $150 million--it \ncould be more--spent in the last election cycle and we don't even know \nwho donated that money. Yet, 87 percent of those so-called issue ads \nidentified the candidate.\n  As the letter from the legal scholars that I referenced earlier \nstates:\n\n       The Supreme Court has never held that there is only a \n     single constitutionally permissible route a legislature may \n     take when it defines ``electioneering'' to be regulated or \n     reported. Congress has the power to enact a statute that \n     defines electioneering in a more nuanced manner, as long as \n     its definition adequately addresses the vagueness and \n     overbreadth concerns expressed by the Court.\n\n  The letter from these distinguished scholars also says:\n\n       The Supreme Court has made clear that, for constitutional \n     purposes, electioneering is different from other speech (FEC \n     v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life). Congress has the power \n     to enact campaign finance laws that constrain the spending of \n     money on electioneering in a variety of ways . . . (Buckley \n     v. Valeo). Congress is permitted to demand that the sponsor \n     of an electioneering message disclosure the amount spent on \n     the message and the sources of funds. And Congress may \n     prohibit corporations and labor unions from spending money on \n     electioneering. This is black letter constitutional law about \n     which there can be no serious dispute.\n\n  Again, these are their words, and these are constitutional experts. \nThese are the words of experts who have made a life of studying these \nissues.\n  Mr. President, we have the power and the obligation to put elections \nand specifically electioneering ads--because that is what this \namendment is all about--back into the hands of voluntary, individual \ncontributors. The question before us now is, will we stand foursquare \nbehind reform? Will we support this incremental, reasonable, \nconstitutional approach that gets at some of the core abuses that we \nhave seen in previous elections?\n  Maybe the question is better stated this way: How can we not support \nsuch a reasonable approach? How can we go home and face our \nconstituents, our electorate, and explain that we didn't even want to \nvote for a measure that would give them the information they need to be \ninformed voters? How can we go home without having voted for a measure \nthat addresses at least some aspect of campaign reform that Americans \nview as out of control in a sensible and reasonable way?\n  Let's make no mistake about it; we will pay the price. To those who \nhide behind the mistaken notion--the doorkeepers of the status quo--\nthat people don't really care, I say that you are making a grave \nmistake. Yes, some of you may point to studies such as the January poll \nconducted by the Pew Research Center, which ranked campaign reform 13th \non a list of 14 major issues. But let's look at the reason. The report \nalso said that the public's confidence in Congress to write an \neffective and fair campaign law had declined.\n  That is a sad commentary. Many Americans have taken campaign finance \noff of their radar screens simply because they have given up on us. \nFrankly, it is an embarrassment, Mr. President. That this great body \nhas not come together on some reasonable, incremental reform to move \nthe issue forward is unacceptable. That is why Senator Jeffords and I \nhave worked, with a bipartisan group, to change the dynamic in this \ndebate, to address what were some legitimate concerns about some of the \nissue advocacy provisions of the McCain-Feingold amendment, on some of \ntheir restrictions. So this takes a different approach, based on what \nlegal and constitutional experts have said would withstand judicial \nscrutiny.\n\n  We have a chance to remedy this abrogation of our responsibility and, \nso far, we have failed to address some of the serious inequities and \nabuses in our campaign finance system. Our amendment would deal \nsimultaneously and in a realistic way with broadcast electioneering \nmessages at the time they have the most impact--which is right before \nan election, and, as we all know, that is where most of the money is \nspent in the final analysis--and a clear campaign context. It would \nprovide the electorate with information as to who is running the ads. \nIsn't that something that everybody is entitled to know when we are \nseeing $150 million and we don't know who spends that money? Not one \npenny. In fact, it is probably much more.\n  Our amendment would reinforce the traditional rules, limiting the \nrole of unions and corporations in elections. I believe that this \namendment would move us forward, again, because the courts, as well as \nCongress, have been able to draw a line on imposing restrictions on \ncertain groups, and it can do so when it comes to unions and \ncorporations because of the preferential benefits that have been \naccorded to them through the U.S. Congress and by statute in law.\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\n  Typical of any compromise, both sides of the aisle have identified \naspects of the measure they might not like. But I think that always \nmeans that we are on the right track. It is my hope, Mr. President, \nthat this commonsense, incremental approach can be the impetus to \npassing an improved, balanced and fair S. 25. I sincerely believe that \nwe can and must take a first step toward restoring public confidence \nand public faith in our campaign finance system. We are the stewards of \nthis great democracy that has been handed down from our forefathers--\nwho would be aghast if they saw the state of campaigning in this \ncountry today, I might add--and it is our responsibility to see that it \ndoes not disintegrate under the weight of public cynicism and mistrust.\n  As I said last year, it is the duty of leaders to lead and that means \nmaking some difficult choices and doing the right thing. I had hoped \nthat our leaders would have been able to have come together and I had \nurged last fall that we have a bipartisan group to work out a plan, \nthrough the leaders, to come to the floor. That didn't happen. But many \nof us in the rank and file are working together on a bipartisan basis \nbecause we think this issue is important. Not to say that all we are \ndoing is right and perfect; it is not. But it advances the process \nforward, the issue forward, and it makes substantial improvements on \nthose areas which we have identified to be the most problematic in our \ncampaign finance system today.\n  I hope that we would not entrench ourselves in the rhetoric of \nabsolutism. Let us not shun progress in the name of perfection. The \nfact is, improved S. 25 would be a good bill and it would be a good \nstart down the road to putting our elections back into the hands of the \nAmerican people. I urge my colleagues to join my colleague Senator \nJeffords and others in bringing this bill out of the shadows of \nobfuscation and into the light of honest discussion and debate. The \nAmerican people expect as much and they certainly deserve as much.\n  Mr. President, I know we will have further discussions on this issue \ntomorrow before we have a vote on the motion to table. But I urge that \neach and every Senator give consideration to this amendment--that has \nbeen offered by a bipartisan group--that Senator Jeffords and I have \nbeen working on with others in hopes of moving this debate forward, to \nchange the debate discussion and to show there is an earnestness and \nwillingness to approach this very serious issue; not to set it aside, \nnot to deflect it, not to ignore it, saying it will go away and people \nwill not notice. I happen to think that people will notice. They will \nnotice.\n  They will be quickly reminded when they see the next election, \nbecause more money will be spent, as we see in this $150 million. This \nnumber is going to go up and people will be reminded how much they care \nabout this issue. But more important, they will be reminded, if we fail \nto take action here, of our unwillingness and our failure to take \naction on this issue.\n  I suggest to Members that we are embarking on a high-risk strategy by \nsuggesting that somehow we can get away with not addressing this issue. \nI think that is a very high-risk strategy and I think it is dead wrong.\n  I hope Members of this Senate will look very carefully at this \namendment. There is nothing tricky about it. It is pretty \nstraightforward, in accordance with the decisions that have been \nrendered by the Court in the past. It is very narrowly drawn, very \nprecisely drawn, requiring disclosure. Because that is where the Court \nhas granted a greater prerogative to the Congress and to the public's \nright to know, and restrictions only in those areas in which the Court \nand Congress has ruled in the last century, because we have a right to \ndraw that line when it comes to unions and corporations.\n  So, I hope that each Member of the Senate will have a chance, over \nthe next 24 hours, to look at this amendment very carefully and to see \nthat it does move in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The distinguished Senator from Maine asks rhetorically \nwho would be opposed to disclosure of group contributions? I would say \nto my friend from Maine, the Supreme Court would be opposed to it. In \nthe 1958 case of NAACP v. Alabama, the Court ruled definitively on the \nissue of whether a group could be required to disclose its membership \nor donor list as a precondition for criticism or discussion of public \nissues. So the Supreme Court very much is opposed to requiring groups, \nas a condition of engaging in issue advocacy, constitutionally-\nprotected speech, that they have to disclose their list.\n  Interestingly enough, two groups that certainly have not been aligned \nwith this Senator on this issue over the years had something to say \nabout that. Public Citizen and the Sierra Club, on the question of \ndisclosure of issue advocacy:\n\n       Top officials in Public Citizen and the Sierra Club \n     Foundation, a separate tax-exempt offshoot of the \n     environmental organization, argued that divulging their donor \n     lists would either give an unfair advantage to competitors or \n     unfairly expose identities of their members.\n       ``As I am sure you are aware, citizens have a First \n     Amendment right to form organizations to advance their common \n     goals without fear of investigation or harassment.''\n\n  That was Joan Claybrook, with whom I have dueled on this issue for a \ndecade, in response to questions about whether or not Public Citizen \nwould be willing to disclose their donor list. Claybrook goes on:\n\n       We respect our members' right to freely and privately \n     associate with others who share their beliefs, and we do not \n     reveal their identities. We will not violate their trust \n     simply to satisfy the curiosity of Congress or the press.\n       Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director for the \n     Sierra Club Foundation, said [of] donors to the separate \n     Sierra Club's political action committee . . .\n\n  Of course they are required to disclose, because they engage in \nexpress advocacy. That is part of hard money, part of the Federal \ncampaign system. What Senator Snowe's amendment is about is issue \nadvocacy, which is an entirely different subject under Supreme Court \ninterpretations; an entirely different subject.\n  Now, the Sierra Club said with regard to compelling them to disclose \ntheir membership as a precondition for engaging in issue advocacy--\nHamilton said:\n\n       That is basically saying, ``Turn around and give us your \n     membership . . . . We want public disclosure of the 650,000 \n     members of the Sierra Club, which is a valuable resource, \n     coveted by others, because they can turn around and make \n     their own list.''\n\n  The last thing he had to say I find particularly interesting, and \nknowing the occupant of the Chair is from out West, he might appreciate \nthis. He said:\n\n       It can also be turned around and used against them. We have \n     members in small towns in Wyoming and Alaska (who could by \n     hurt) if word got out that they belong to the Sierra Club.\n\n  So I say to my friend from Maine, this is not in a gray area. The \nSupreme Court has opined on the question of the Government requiring a \ndonor list of groups as a precondition for expressing themselves at any \ntime--close to an election or any other time.\n  My good friend from Maine also cited a 1990 case, commonly referred \nto as the Austin case, in support of the notion that, somehow, the \nCourt would sanction this new category of electioneering. The Austin \ncase, I am sure my good friend from Maine knows, had to do with express \nadvocacy, not issue advocacy. In the Austin case, they banned express \nadvocacy by corporate treasurers. That of course has been the law since \n1907. That is not anything new. You can't use corporate treasury money \nto engage in express advocacy of a candidate.\n  But the definitive case on the issue the Senator from Maine is really \ntalking about, because her amendment deals with issue advocacy, is \nFirst National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti in 1978, where the Court held \nthat corporations could fund out of their treasuries--out of their \ntreasuries, issue advocacy.\n  So, with all due respect to my good friend from Maine, the courts \nhave already ruled on the kind of issues that she is discussing here. \nNo. 1, you can't compel the production of membership lists as a \ncondition to criticize all of us. And, No. 2, issue advocacy cannot be \nredefined by Congress. The courts have defined what issue advocacy is.\n  Now, with regard to the opinion of various scholars, let me just say \nAmerica's expert on the first amendment is\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\nthe American Civil Liberties Union, and they wrote me just yesterday, \ngiving their view on the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. Let me read a \npertinent part.\n\n       We are writing today, however, to set forth our views on an \n     amendment to that bill dealing with controls on issue \n     advocacy which is being sponsored by Senators Snowe and \n     Jeffords. Although that proposal has been characterized as a \n     compromise measure which would replace certain of the more \n     egregious features of the comparable provisions of McCain-\n     Feingold, the Snowe-Jeffords amendment still embodies the \n     kind of unprecedented restraint on issue advocacy that \n     violates bedrock First Amendment principles.\n       Those time-honored principles were set forth with great \n     clarity in Buckley v. Valeo.\n\n  Which we frequently refer to. The ACLU goes on:\n\n       First, ``issue advocacy'' is at the core of democracy. In \n     rejecting the claim that issue-oriented speech about \n     incumbent politicians had to be regulated because it might \n     influence public opinion and affect the outcome of elections, \n     the Supreme Court reminded us of the critical relationship \n     between unfettered issue advocacy and healthy democracy. \n     ``Discussion of public issues and debate on the \n     qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of \n     the system of government established by our Constitution.''\n\n  Further, the ACLU said:\n\n       . . . in an election season, citizens and groups cannot \n     effectively discuss issues if they are barred from discussing \n     candidates who take stands on those issues. ``For the \n     distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and \n     advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often \n     dissolve in practical application. Candidates, especially \n     incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving \n     legislative proposals and governmental actions. Not only do \n     candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on \n     various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate \n     issues of public interest.'' 424 U.S. at 43. If any reference \n     to a candidate in the context of advocacy on an issue \n     rendered the speaker or the speech subject to campaign \n     finance controls, the consequences for First Amendment rights \n     would be intolerable.\n       Third [the ACLU says] to guard against that, the Court \n     fashioned the critical express advocacy doctrine.\n\n  The Court fashioned it. They didn't say, Congress, you can make up \nsomething called electioneering. This is not our prerogative. The Court \nfashioned the critical express advocacy doctrine, which holds that:\n\n       Only express advocacy of electoral outcomes may be subject \n     to any form of restraint. Thus, only ``communications that in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate'' can be subject to any campaign finance \n     controls.\n\n  Express advocacy: Within the Federal Election Campaign Act. Issue \nadvocacy: Outside the Federal Election Campaign Act. That just didn't \nhappen last year. This has been the law since Buckley. Issue advocacy \nhas been around since the beginning of the country.\n\n       Finally, and most importantly, all speech which does not in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate is totally immune from any regulation;\n\n  The ACLU continued:\n\n       The Court fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to \n     safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even \n     though such advocacy might influence the outcome of an \n     election. The doctrine provides a bright-line, objective test \n     that protects political speech and association by focusing \n     solely on the content of the speaker's words, not the motive \n     in the speaker's mind or the impact on the speaker's \n     audience, or the proximity to an election.\n       Nor does it matter whether the issue advocacy is \n     communicated on radio or television, in newspapers or \n     magazines, through direct mail or printed pamphlets. What \n     counts for constitutional purposes is not the medium, but the \n     message.\n\n  My understanding of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is that these \nrestrictions only apply to television and radio. But there is no \nconstitutional basis for sort of segmenting out television and radio \nand saying those kinds of expenditures require the triggering of \ndisclosure, but it's OK to go on and engage in direct mail or \npresumably telephones or anything other than the broadcast medium. That \nis in a somehow different category.\n  By the same token, it is constitutionally irrelevant whether the \nmessage costs $100 or $1,000 or $100,000. It is content, not amount, \nthat marks the constitutional boundary for allowable regulation and \nfrees issue advocacy from any impermissible restraint. The control of \nissue advocacy is simply beyond the pale of legislative authority.\n  So the Snowe-Jeffords amendment violates these cardinal principles. \nFirst, the amendment's new category, which we have not heard before, of \nelectioneering communication is simply old wine in old bottles with a \nnew label. The provision would reach, regulate and control any person, \ngroup or organization which spent more than $10,000 in an entire \ncalendar year for any electioneering communications.\n  The ACLU says that critical term is defined solely as any broadcast \ncommunication which refers to any Federal candidate at any time within \n60 days before a general or 30 days before a primary election and is \nprimarily intended to be broadcast to the electorate for that election, \nwhatever that means.\n  The unprecedented provision is an impermissible effort to regulate \nissue speech which contains not a whisper of express advocacy simply \nbecause it refers to a Federal candidate who is more often than not a \ncongressional incumbent during an election season.\n  The ACLU says the first amendment disables Congress from enacting \nsuch a measure regardless of whether the provision includes a monetary \nthreshold, covers only broadcast media, applies only to speech during \nan election season and employs prohibition or disclosure as its primary \nregulatory device. It would still cast a pall over grassroots lobbying \nand advocacy communication by nonpartisan, issue-oriented groups like \nthe ACLU, for example.\n  It would do so by imposing burdensome, destructive and unprecedented \ndisclosure and organizational requirements and barring use of any \norganizational funding for such communications if any corporations or \nunions made any donations to the organization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entire letter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                             ACLU,\n\n\n                                   Washington National Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: We have shared with you our grave concerns \n     about the different versions of the McCain-Feingold campaign \n     finance bill that have been before the Senate. (See ``Dear \n     Senator'' letter dated February 19, 1998 and enclosure.) For \n     the reasons we have stated previously, the most recent \n     ``pared down'' reincarnation of that bill remains \n     fundamentally flawed, and we continue fully to oppose it.\n       We are writing today, however, to set forth our views on an \n     amendment to that bill dealing with controls on issue \n     advocacy which is being sponsored by Senators Snowe and \n     Jeffords. Although that proposal has been characterized as a \n     compromise measure which would replace certain of the more \n     egregious features of the comparable provisions of McCain-\n     Feingold, the Snow-Jeffords amendment still embodies the kind \n     of unprecedented restraint on issue advocacy that violates \n     bedrock First Amendment principles.\n       Those time-honored principles were set forth with great \n     clarity in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) and reaffirmed \n     by numerous Supreme Court and lower court rulings ever since.\n       First, ``issue advocacy'' is at the core of democracy. In \n     rejecting the claim that issue-oriented speech about \n     incumbent politicians had to be regulated because it might \n     influence public opinion and affect the outcome of elections, \n     the Supreme Court reminded us of the critical relationship \n     between unfettered issue advocacy and healthy democracy. \n     ``Discussion of public issues and debate on the \n     qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of \n     the system of government established by our Constitution.'' \n     424 U.S. at 14.\n       Second, in an election season, citizens and groups cannot \n     effectively discuss issues if they are barred from discussing \n     candidates who take stands on those issues. ``For the \n     distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and \n     advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often \n     dissolve in practical application. Candidates, especially \n     incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving \n     legislative proposals and governmental actions. Not only do \n     candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on \n     various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate \n     issues of public interest.'' 424 U.S. at 43. If any reference \n     to a candidate in the context of advocacy on an issue \n     rendered the speaker or the speech subject to campaign \n     finance controls, the consequences for First Amendment rights \n     would be intolerable.\n       Third, to guard against that, the Court fashioned the \n     critical express advocacy doctrine, which holds that only \n     express advocacy of electoral outcomes may be subject to any \n     form of restraint. Thus, only ``communications that in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate'' can be subject to any campaign finance \n     controls.\n       Finally, and most importantly, all speech which does not in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate is totally immune from any regulations; \n     ``So long as persons and groups eschew\n\n[[Page S917]]\n\n     expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to \n     spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his \n     views.'' 424 U.S. at 45.\n       The Court fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to \n     safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even \n     though such advocacy might influence the outcome of an \n     election. The doctrine provides a bright-line, objective test \n     that protects political speech and association by focusing \n     solely on the content of the speaker's words, not the motive \n     in the speaker's mind or the impact on the speaker's \n     audience, or the proximity to an election.\n       Nor does it matter whether the issue advocacy is \n     communicated on radio or television, in newspapers or \n     magazines, through direct mail or printed pamphlets. What \n     counts for constitutional purposes is not the medium, but the \n     message. By the same token, it is constitutionally irrelevant \n     whether the message costs $100 or $1,000 or $100,000. It is \n     content, not amount, that marks the constitutional boundary \n     of allowable regulation and frees issue advocacy from any \n     impermissible restraint. The control of issue advocacy is \n     simply beyond the pale of legislative authority.\n       The Snowe-Jeffords amendment violates these cardinal \n     principles.\n       First, the amendment's new category of ``electioneering \n     communication'' is simply old wine in old bottles with a new \n     label. The provision would reach, regulate and control any \n     person, group or organization which spent more than $10,000, \n     in an entire calendar year, for any ``electioneering \n     communications.'' That critical term is defined solely as \n     any broadcast communication which ``refers to'' any \n     federal candidate, at any time within 60 days before a \n     general or 30 days before a primary election, and ``is \n     primarily intended to be broadcast to the electorate'' for \n     that election, whatever that may mean.\n       This unprecedented provision is an impermissible effort to \n     regulate issue speech which contains not a whisper of express \n     advocacy, simply because it ``refers to'' a federal \n     candidate--who is more often than not a Congressional \n     incumbent--during an election season. The First Amendment \n     disables Congress from enacting such a measure regardless of \n     whether the provision includes a monetary threshold, covers \n     only broadcast media, applies only to speech during an \n     election season and employs prohibition or disclosure as its \n     primary regulatory device. It would still cast a pall over \n     grass-roots lobbying and advocacy communication by non-\n     partisan issue-oriented groups like the ACLU. It would do so \n     by imposing burdensome, destructive and unprecedented \n     disclosure and organizational requirements, and barring use \n     of any organizational funding for such communications if any \n     corporations or unions made any donations to the \n     organization. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment would force such \n     groups to choose between abandoning their issue advocacy or \n     dramatically changing their organizational structure and \n     sacrificing their speech and associational rights.\n       Beyond this new feature, the Snowe-Jeffords amendment \n     simply leaves in place many of the objectionable features of \n     McCain-Feingold that we have criticized previously. One is \n     the unprecedented generic expansion of the definition of \n     ``express advocacy'' applicable to all forms of political \n     communication going forward in all media and occurring all \n     year long. Another are the intrusive new ``coordination'' \n     rules which will be so destructive of the ability of issue \n     organizations to communicate with elected officials on such \n     issues and later communicate to the public in any manner on \n     such issues. And the radically expanded activities \n     encompassed within the new category of ``electioneering \n     communications'' would be subject to those radically expanded \n     coordination restrictions as well. The net result will be to \n     make it virtually impossible for any issue organization to \n     communicate, directly or indirectly, with any politician on \n     any issue and then communicate on that same issue to the \n     public.\n       All of this will have an exceptionally chilling effect on \n     organized issue advocacy in America by the hundreds and \n     thousands of groups that enormously enrich political debate. \n     The bill flies in the face of well-settled Supreme Court \n     doctrine which is designed to keep campaign finance \n     regulations from ensnaring and overwhelming all political and \n     public speech. And the bill will chill issue discussion of \n     the actions of incumbent officeholders standing for re-\n     election at the very time when it is most vital in a \n     democracy: during an election season. It may be inconvenient \n     for incumbent politicians when groups of citizens spend money \n     to inform the voters about a politician's public stands on \n     controversial issues, like abortion, but it is the essence of \n     free speech and democracy.\n       In conclusion, the ACLU remains thoroughly opposed to \n     McCain-Feingold. The ACLU continues to believe that the most \n     effective and least constitutionally problematic route to \n     genuine reform is a system of equitable and adequate public \n     financing. While reasonable people may disagree about the \n     proper approaches to campaign finance reform, McCain-\n     Feingold's restraints on issue advocacy raise profound \n     constitutional problems, and nothing in the Snowe-Jeffords \n     amendment cures those fatal First Amendment flaws.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laura W. Murphy,\n       Director, ACLU Washington Office.\n     Joel Gora,\n       Dean & Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School and Counsel to \n     the ACLU.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we will discuss this issue further \ntomorrow. Let me sum it up by saying the courts are clear. The \ndefinition of express advocacy has been written into the laws of this \ncountry through court decisions. It is clear what issue advocacy is. It \nis clear that under previous Supreme Court decisions that you cannot \ncompel a group to disclose its donors or membership lists as a \ncondition for expressing themselves on issues in proximity to an \nelection or any other time for that matter.\n  Mr. President, I will be happy to discuss these issues further \ntomorrow. With that, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I understand what my good friend from \nKentucky is saying, but I remind everyone what the real issue is, and \nthat is elections. We are talking about a system which has developed \nover the past couple of years which has seriously imposed upon us \nunfairness as far as candidates are concerned who find themselves faced \nwith ads, and other areas of expression, to change the election. Why \nwould they spend $135 million to $200 million unless it was successful?\n  Let us get a real-life situation of what we are talking about. I have \nbeen in the election process for many, many years, and I know from my \nown analysis--and I think it probably is carried forward everywhere--\nthat the critical time in an election to make a change in people's \nminds is the last couple of weeks.\n  Basically, I find that probably of the electorate, only about 50 \npercent care enough about elections to even go. That is the average \nacross the country. Of that 50 percent, probably half of them will make \nup their minds during the last 2 weeks.\n  So you are out and have a well-planned campaign and everything is \ncoming down to the end. You can go and find out what your opponent has \nto spend, and you can try to be ready to match that. And then whammo, \nout of the blue comes all these ads that are supposedly issue ads, but \nthey are obviously pointed at positions that are taken by you saying \nhow horrible they are. So these are within the Snowe-Jeffords \namendment.\n  What can you do about it? You cannot do anything. You cannot even \nfind out who is running them, unless you are lucky and have an inside \nsource in the TV and radio stations to tell you who it is. You cannot \nfind out. There is no disclosure.\n  The most important part of our amendment is just plain disclosure. If \nit is far enough in advance, 30 days before a primary and 60 days \nbefore a general election, at least you have time to get ready for it. \nIf you know you are going to get all these ads coming, then you can \nreorder your priorities of spending. You can say, ``Oh, my God, we have \nall this coming,'' and you never know until it is all over. You are \ngone. You lose the election and you didn't know. The opposition comes \nforth with this barrage and you are totally helpless.\n  What we do is not anywhere near what we would like to do in the sense \nof protection against this kind of thing, because I am sure they will \nfind ways to get around it and feel they do not have to disclose. But \nit is so simple.\n  What is wrong with disclosure? What is wrong, if somebody is going to \nspend a couple of million bucks in the election against you, with at \nleast knowing what is coming and who it is coming from? That is all we \nare asking for. We don't say you can't do it. Another thing we do, as \nexplained very well by Senator Snowe, is deal in a constitutional way \nwith the money coming from the treasuries of corporations or money \ncoming from the treasuries of unions by restricting that even more so \nthey cannot even intervene within that last 30 to 60 days. But there \nare other ways, through PACs and other ways the money can be brought \ninto the\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\nelection process, but it would be disclosed to the FEC and you have the \nability to understand what you are going to be facing.\n  I cannot understand why anybody would be against this amendment. It \nmakes such common sense. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't create \nanything except it requires people to disclose their intentions and \nalso prohibits the use of the treasuries of the corporations and \nunions. There is nothing very dramatic about that as a change in the \nlaw. I really take serious issue with my good friend, the Senator from \nKentucky, on the questions he raised.\n\n  Are these ads effective? Yes, I have talked with consultants, and I \nknow one consultant who ran a lot of these ads. Obviously, what they \nwere trying to do was win an election for their person who they were \ntrying to help. No evidence of connection, but the people who wanted \nthe ads sent the money for this purpose to defeat a candidate, and they \nfelt those ads turned around at least five elections that would not \nhave been turned around if it were not for use of these funds with no \nway for the poor candidate who is facing it to understand who it is, \nhow much money is going to be spent and where it goes.\n  I want to give real-world situations we are involved with. What is so \nunfair about being fair and getting full disclosure?\n  I commend my good friend from Maine with whom I have worked very \nclosely. I must say, this amendment is weaker than I would like to see, \nbut I think we have done all we can do under the Constitution. I \ncommend her for the presentation she has given and for her effort to \nraise the visibility to the Nation of the serious problems we have with \nthese so-called advocacy or issue ads.\n  It has been my pleasure to work with her on this important endeavor, \nand today the Senate has the opportunity to enact real campaign finance \nreform.\n  The amendment we offer succeeds where others have failed in bringing \nthe two sides closer to a workable solution. Combined with the \nunderlying McCain-Feingold legislation, this amendment will ensure that \nall parties are treated equally in the reformed campaign finance \nstructure.\n  As my record has shown, I have long been a supporter of campaign \nfinance reform. I have sponsored a number of initiatives in the past \nand have worked actively to enact campaign finance reform. I have been \nreluctant to cosponsor the McCain-Feingold bill this time around \nbecause of my concerns in two areas which I have just been discussing. \nFirst, issue ads that have turned into blatant electioneering with no \nmeaningful disclosure of the source of the attack; second, the \nunfettered spending by unions and corporations to influence the outcome \nof an election, especially close to elections, without the ability to \nidentify the source.\n  Disclosure--how in the world can you be against disclosure?\n  The amendment Senator Snowe and I are proposing strengthens the \nMcCain-Feingold bill in a fair manner. Maybe too fair. That is the only \ncriticism I can find of it.\n  Mr. President, the work that Senator Snowe and I, as well as many \nother Senators, have done to develop an acceptable compromise is \nsquarely within the goals of those calling for full campaign finance \nreform. We have been brought to this point by the disillusionment of \nthe electorate. People across this Nation have grown wary of the tenor \nof campaigns in recent years. This disappointment is reflected in low \nvoter participation and the diminished role of individuals in electing \ntheir representatives.\n  Our efforts to reform the financing of campaigns should begin to \nreinvigorate people to further participate in our democracy. I am \nashamed at the voter turnouts across the Nation. I am a little bit less \nashamed of Vermont which has one of the highest, but we all should be \nworking to get fuller participation, closer to 60, 70, 80, 90 percent.\n  The 1996 election cycle reinforces the desperate situation we face. \nDuring this campaign, more than $135 million was spent by outside \ngroups not associated with the candidates' campaigns. These \nexpenditures indicated to the public that our election laws were not \nbeing enforced and the system was out of control. Additionally, recent \nhearings in both the Senate and the House point to the need for serious \nreform.\n  Senator Snowe has clearly outlined the content of our amendment. Our \nproposal boosts disclosure requirements and tightens expenditures of \ncertain funds in the weeks preceding a primary and general election. \nThe amendment provides disclosure of the funding sources for \nelectioneering communications broadcast within 30 days of a primary or \n60 days of a general election.\n\n  The measure prohibits labor union or corporation treasury funds from \nbeing used for these electioneering broadcast ads 30 days before a \nprimary or 60 days before a general election. These two main provisions \nshould strengthen the efforts put forward by the proponents of reform.\n  Of equal importance is what this amendment will not do, and that was \ngone into in very great detail. In fact, we have so many things we will \nnot do that it sometimes concerns me if we have done enough. The \namendment will not restrict printed material nor require the text or a \ncopy of a campaign advertisement to be disclosed.\n  The amendment does not restrict how much money can be spent on ads, \nnor restrict how much money a group raises. In fact, our amendment \nclearly protects the constitutional prerogatives while promoting reform \nin a system badly in need of change. We have taken great care not to \nviolate the important principles of free speech.\n  In developing the amendment, we have reviewed the seminal cases in \nthis area, particularly the Buckley case. The Supreme Court has been \nmost tolerant in the area of limiting corporate and union spending and \nenhancing disclosure rules. We also worked to make the requirements \nsufficiently clear and narrow to overcome unconstitutional claims of \nvagueness and overbreadth.\n  I have long believed in Justice Brandeis' statement that ``Sunlight \nis said to be the best of disinfectants.'' That is what we are looking \nfor here, just a little sunlight on some of the very, very devious \ntypes of procedures that are utilized to influence elections.\n  Discloser of electioneering campaign spending will provide the \nelectorate with information to aid voters in evaluating candidates for \nFederal office. As we have seen in the last few campaign cycles, ads \nappear on local stations paid for by groups unknown to the public. \nThese ads reference an identified candidate with the result of \ninfluencing the voters. Giving the electorate the information required \nin our amendment will give the public the facts they need to better \nevaluate the candidates but, more importantly, evaluate what \ninformation they are receiving and whether it is biased or where it \ncame from, to be able to at least check where it came from and make \nsure it did not come from Indonesia or China or some other place.\n  Additionally, this disclosure, or disinfectant, as Justice Brandeis \nputs it, will also help deter actual corruption and help avoid the \nappearance of corruption that many feel pervades our campaign finance \nsystem.\n  Delivering this information into the public purview will enable \ncandidates, the press, the FEC and interest groups to ensure that \nFederal campaign finance laws are being obeyed. Our amendment will \nexpose any corruption and help reassure the public that our campaign \nlaws will be followed and enforced.\n  The amendment will also prohibit corporations and unions from using \ngeneral treasury funds to pay for electioneering communications in a \ndefined period close to an election.\n  By treating both corporations and unions similarly, we extend current \nregulation cautiously and fairly. This prohibition, coupled with the \ndisclosure requirements, will address many of the concerns my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle have raised on campaign finance \nreform proposals. This provision will help satisfy our goal of creating \na fair and equitable campaign finance system.\n  The amendment I am asking my colleagues to support will, hopefully, \nprovide the additional momentum to bring this issue to closure. \nAlthough I am optimistic, I am not blind to the uphill battle we face \nin enacting appropriate change. I am encouraged by the fair and \ninformative and productive debate we have had on campaign reform today. \nThe proposal Senator Snowe and I are offering, built upon the McCain-\nFeingold legislation, should become law.\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\n  I cannot conceive of how any legitimate objection can be made to the \nSnowe-Jeffords amendment. It is a step forward to making sure that \nelections are fair, that the public knows who it is trying to influence \nthe elections, and that they have the right to find out that \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments about \nat least one amendment that has been offered here this afternoon.\n  As we work our way through the debate on campaign finance reform and \nyou listen to Senators express themselves in the legal areas, the more \none thinks that maybe we have got enough laws in place, maybe it is a \nmatter of enforcing them.\n  I remind Senators that it was in 1996 when one major party failed to \nfile their FEC report on the date it was supposed to be filed. In fact, \nit never was filed until after the election was over.\n  So I would argue that law enforcement probably has as much to do with \nthe problems we see in political campaigns more than anything else. All \nthrough this process, we try to pass legislation that would maybe bring \npolitical campaigns into the light of public scrutiny. We would try to \ncap contributions, how much an individual or an organization can \ncontribute to a particular campaign. We would try to cap spending. We \nwould try to establish and make permanent filing dates.\n\n  Yet all of them would be to no purpose if we do not enforce them. In \nfact, we have gone into some approach of asking for free advertising \nfrom radio and television based on a faulty assumption, an assumption, \nif we do something, get something for nothing, we can limit the \nexpenses, thus making it easier for everybody to run for political \noffice.\n  I would ask those who would advocate such a regulation to offer free \ntelevision and free radio time, I would ask them, the newspapers and \npublications, will they be made to offer free space? Will printers lay \nout people, graphic artists? Will they donate their labor for direct \nmail and fliers and stickers and, yes, those things that we mail direct \nto our constituency?\n  While we are talking about that, would we also write into the same \nregulation that they may be sent postage free? Should the laborers of \nthe post office, or whoever, be made to do it for nothing? And my \nanswer to that is, of course not.\n  Radio and television is a unique medium. Some would say it operates \non the public airwaves. How public are they? If a radio station or a \ntelevision station owns a chunk of frequency, do they not own it? They \nare only given so many hours in a day--like 24--that they can sell \ntime. Once that time has passed, it cannot be recovered or made up \nlater on. Are we asking them to give away their inventory? Are we \nasking them to pay their production people to dub and to produce? Why \nare not their expenses the same as any other segment of the American \nmedia?\n  The amendment is nothing more than that the FCC should not advocate \nor use funds to regulate radio and television stations for free time or \nfree access. It just does not make a lot of sense, especially when \nbroadcasters lead this country in public service, in news and weather \nand services to a community. Yes, they get paid for the advertising for \nsome of those programs, but basically they are there 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week, 52 weeks a year.\n  Of course, they are being asked to do something for nothing. So I \nhope in any kind of reform that passes this body, that this amendment \nto prevent the FCC from requiring radio and television stations to give \nfree advertising space would be a part of that reform.\n  But bottom line--and I am not a lawyer; never been hinged with that \nhandle--as I listen to the argument, it boils down to, bottom line, the \nintegrity of the folks that are supporting an issue or an individual \nfor political office. It all comes down to that. For if lawyers write \nthis law, it will be lawyers that will figure a way around it. It is a \nmatter merely of enforcing the law.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

A bill to restructure the Internal Revenue Service and \nimprove taxpayer rights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               the putting the taxpayer first act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill --Putting \nTaxpayers First. In the next few weeks the Senate will have a historic \nopportunity to make far-reaching changes to the operation of the \nInternal Revenue Service and to strengthen taxpayers' rights. For too \nlong, taxpayers have had to put up with poor service when dealing with \nthe IRS--often to the tune of larger tax bills because of interest and \npenalties that accrue during the lengthy delays in resolving disputes. \nWhile our ultimate goal must be a simpler and less burdensome tax law, \ntaxpayers need help today when dealing with the IRS. We must put \ntaxpayers first.\n  For my part, I have asked the people of Missouri for their \nsuggestions on how to fix the IRS and better protect taxpayers' rights. \nIn addition, as chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have \nasked small businesses across the country for their recommendations on \nthis issue. I am pleased to say that a great many people have taken the \ntime to call or write with their suggestions for improving this \ncountry's tax administration system.\n  Over the last several months, the Finance Committee has focused \nextensively on abuse of taxpayers and the need to reform our tax \nadministration system. In addition, my committee has held hearings on \nthis issue and the importance of reform for entrepreneurs and small \nbusiness owners throughout the country. The House has also completed \nits package of reform measures. That legislation provides a good start, \nbut I believe we can make it even stronger.\n  With the input and recommendations from all these sources in mind, \ntoday I am introducing the Putting Taxpayers First Act. This bill will \nprovide critical relief for a broad spectrum of taxpayers from single \nmoms and married couples to small business owners and farmers. It is \nbased on two fundamental principles. We must create an IRS and a tax \nsystem that are based on top-quality service for all taxpayers, and we \nmust act swiftly to restore citizen confidence in that system.\n  My bill tackles these goals in three ways: by improving taxpayer \nrights and protections, restructuring the management and operation of \nthe IRS, and using electronic filing technology to help taxpayers, not \ncomplicate their lives.\n  For more than 200 years, Americans have had the right, guaranteed by \nthe fourth amendment, ``to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, \nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,'' and have \nenjoyed the constitutional protections against being ``deprived of * * \n* property, without due process of law'' under the fifth amendment.\n  My bill will make the IRS fully respect these rights by requiring, as \npart of the Tax Code, that the IRS must obtain the approval by a judge \nor magistrate with notice and a hearing for the taxpayer before seizing \na taxpayer's property. The Government ought to be required to treat \nordinary taxpayers at least as well as they treat common criminals. It \nis way past time to level the playing field and preserve the \nconstitutional rights of all taxpayers.\n  My bill also stops the runaway freight train of excessive penalties \nand interest in two ways. First, the interest on a penalty will only \nbegin after the taxpayer fails to pay his tax bill. Today, interest on \nmost penalties is applied retroactively to the date that the tax return \nwas due, which may be as much as 2 to 3 years back. That is just not \nfair. Second, my bill eliminates multiple penalties that apply to the \nsame error. Penalties should punish bad behavior, not honest errors \nthat even well-intentioned people are bound to make now and then.\n  Next, with respect to restructuring the IRS, the second part of my \nbill addresses the need for structural changes within the IRS. I \nbelieve that the operations and staffing of the IRS should be based \nalong customer lines, an idea supported by the National Commission on \nRestructuring the IRS. The IRS' current one-size-fits-all approach no \nlonger meets the needs of taxpayers and is inefficient for the IRS as \nwell.\n  By restructuring the IRS along customer lines, the agency could \nprovide one-stop service for taxpayers with similar characteristics and \nneeds, such as individuals, small businesses and large companies. As a \nresult of these changes, a married couple could go to an IRS service \ncenter designed for individuals and get help on the issues they care \nabout, like the new child tax credit and the Roth IRA. Similarly, a \nsmall business owner could resolve questions about the depreciation \ndeductions for her business equipment with IRS employees specifically \ntrained in these areas.\n  I was extremely pleased to hear IRS Commissioner Rossotti embrace \nthis one-stop-service proposal early this month. While the Commissioner \nhas signaled his interest in a customer-based IRS, I want to make sure \nthat it does not become one of the many reorganization ideas that lose \nfavor after a few short years.\n  To protect against this risk, my bill that I introduce today will \nmake this structure a permanent part of the Tax Code. But reorganizing \nthe IRS front lines, however, is only part of the task. The top-level \nmanagement of the IRS here in Washington must make taxpayer service a \nreality throughout the agency. My bill takes that step by creating a \nfull-time board of governors, which will have full responsibility, \nauthority and accountability for IRS operations.\n\n  This board composed of four individuals drawn from the private sector \nplus the IRS Commissioner will have the authority and information \nnecessary to ensure that the agency's examinations and enforcement \nactivities are conducted in a manner that treats taxpayers fairly and \nwith respect.\n  The board will also oversee the service provided by the taxpayer \nadvocate and will ensure that the IRS appeals process is handled in an \nimpartial manner.\n  An independent, full-time board of governors will protect the IRS \nfrom being used for political purposes. Any efforts to instill \nconfidence in our tax administration system are severely undercut when \nthere are allegations that the IRS is being used for politically \nmotivated audits. Regrettably, there have been recent reports \nsuggesting the IRS has undertaken these types of audits with regard to \ncertain individuals and nonprofit organizations like the Christian \nCoalition and the Heritage Foundation. An IRS board of governors with \nrepresentatives of both political parties will help ensure that the \nagency is used for one purpose and one purpose alone: helping taxpayers \nto comply with the tax laws in the least burdensome manner possible.\n  Mr. President, in addition to redesigning the agency, my bill also \ncreates a commonsense approach for redesigning IRS communications. Too \noften we have heard from constituents, especially small business \nowners, that the notice they receive from the IRS is incomprehensible. \nAs a result, one of two things usually happens: The taxpayer pays the \nbill without question just to make the IRS go away, even if they are \nnot sure they owe taxes; or the taxpayer has to hire a professional to \ntell\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\nhim or her what the notice means and then spend vast amounts of time \nand money getting the matter straightened out. This no-win situation \nhas to end now.\n  My bill creates a panel of individual taxpayers, small entrepreneurs, \nlarge business managers and other types of taxpayers who will review \nall standardized IRS documents to make sure they are clear and \nunderstandable to the taxpayers who must read them. Any notice, letter \nor form that does not meet this minimum standard will be sent back to \nthe IRS with a recommendation that it be rewritten before it is sent to \nthe taxpayer. And clear communications, I believe, are essential for \ngood customer service. America's taxpayers deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, as I said, in the next few weeks the Senate will have \nan historic opportunity to make far-reaching changes to the operation \nof the Internal Revenue Service and to strengthen taxpayers' rights. \nFor too long, taxpayers have had to put up with poor service when \ndealing with the IRS--often to the tune of larger tax bills because of \ninterest and penalties that accrue during the lengthy delays in \nresolving disputes. While our ultimate goal must be a simpler and less \nburdensome tax law, taxpayers need help today when dealing with the \nIRS. We must put taxpayers first.\n  For my part, I have asked people across Missouri for their \nsuggestions on how to fix the IRS and better protect taxpayers' rights. \nIn addition, as the Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have \nasked small businesses across the country for their recommendations on \nthis issue. And I am pleased to say that a great many people have taken \nthe time to call or write with their suggestions for improving this \ncountry's tax-administration system.\n  Over the last several months, the Finance Committee has focused \nextensively on abuse of taxpayers and the need to reform our tax-\nadministration system. In addition, my Committee has held hearings on \nthis issue and the importance of reform for entrepreneurs and small \nbusiness owners throughout the country. The House has also completed \nits package of reform measures. That legislation provides a good start, \nbut I believe we can make it even stronger.\n  With the input and recommendations from all of these sources in mind, \ntoday I am introducing the Putting the Taxpayer First Act. This bill \nwill provide critical relief for a broad spectrum of taxpayers, from \nsingle moms and married couples to small business owners and farmers. \nAnd it is based on two fundamental principles. We must create an IRS \nand a tax system that are based on top quality service for all \ntaxpayers, and we must act swiftly to restore citizen confidence in \nthat system. My bill tackles these goals in three ways: by improving \ntaxpayer rights and protections, restructuring the management and \noperation of the IRS, and using electronic filing technology to help \ntaxpayers, not complicate their lives.\n\n\n                       Improving Taxpayer Rights\n\n  While our ultimate goal should be the wholesale reform or substantial \nreplacement of the tax laws, much additional progress can be made now \nby strengthening taxpayers' rights in order to restore faith in the \nfairness of our tax system. My bill includes several improvements to \ntaxpayers' rights, and I will stress just a few of them today.\n  Recent reports of excessive seizures by the IRS have alarmed all of \nus. These inexcusable practices were highlighted by Senator Nickles in \na hearing he held last December in Oklahoma City. Imagine the \ndevastation to an individual who finds himself in trouble with the IRS \nover back taxes, and the next thing he knows, the IRS has seized his \nbank account or his car--or worse yet, his home. In the case of an \nunfortunate small business, an abrupt seizure can mean shutting the \nbusiness down, ending the livelihoods of all the employees and their \nfamilies.\n  While some will say that seizures are a last resort and do not happen \nthat often, the IRS has disclosed that during Fiscal Year 1996, the \nagency made about 10,000 seizures of taxpayers' property. That is still \na sizeable number, and what is truly alarming is that these seizures \ncan be done on the IRS' own initiative, without judicial approval.\n  For more than 200 years, Americans have had the right, guaranteed by \nthe Fourth Amendment, ``to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, \nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,'' and have \nenjoyed the Constitutional protections against being ``deprived of . . \n. property, without due process of law'' under the Fifth Amendment. My \nbill will make the IRS more fully respect these rights by requiring, as \npart of the tax code, that the IRS must obtain the approval by a judge \nor magistrate, with notice and a hearing for the taxpayer, before \nseizing a taxpayer's property. The government ought to be required to \ntreat ordinary taxpayers at least as well as they treat common \ncriminals. It is way past time to level the playing field and preserve \nthe Constitutional rights of all taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, taxpayers, and especially small enterprises, often \nneed help when it comes to tax planning and examining alternatives to \nminimize their tax liability within the law. With the enormous \ncomplexity of the tax code today, taxpayers frequently have to make \ngood faith judgment calls about whether a particular deduction or \ncredit applies.\n  Today, there is an inequity in the law that results in unequal \ntreatment of taxpayers based on their choice of tax professional or \nfinancial ability to afford a lawyer. Under the current law, a taxpayer \nwho goes to an accountant to obtain advice for tax planning or \nassistance in a controversy to make sure he is not paying more tax than \nthe law requires, does so at his peril. In fact, he may as well invite \nthe IRS to that meeting because there is no privilege of \nconfidentiality between a taxpayer and his accountant.\n  For a taxpayer to gain the confidentiality protection that is \navailable, he must engage an attorney. Oddly enough, in many cases, the \nattorney may hire an accountant to gain accounting expertise, and then \nthe work of the accountant would be protected from disclosure to the \nIRS. Now the taxpayer has assumed enormous additional costs, and for \nwhat? Just to prevent the IRS from having an even greater upper hand \nagainst taxpayers who already have to prove their innocence?\n  My bill ends this disparity. It permits a taxpayer, in non-criminal \nmatters, to hire any individual authorized to practice before the IRS, \nsuch as an accountant, an enrolled agent, or an attorney, and be able \nto have conversations with that tax professional, which can remain \nprivate from the IRS. This taxpayer confidentiality provision will \nensure that all taxpayers receive equal treatment from the IRS in a way \nthat can save them money. In addition, it gives all taxpayers a wider \nchoice of tax advisors without giving up their right to \nconfidentiality. This is a common-sense protection for the millions of \nindividuals and businesses that seek professional tax advice each year.\n\n  Penalties, too, have become an enormous burden for taxpayers who make \nmistakes, which is not uncommon with today's complex tax laws. Far too \noften, a minor tax bill grows into an unmanageable liability because of \nthe interest on the tax owed, the penalties for negligence and late \npayment, and the interest on the penalties. Frequently, these penalties \ncan prevent a taxpayer from settling his account and getting back into \ngood standing.\n  Penalties were included in the tax code to encourage taxpayers to \ncomply with our voluntary assessment system. But the multiplicity of \npenalties and hidden punishments disguised as interest on those \npenalties seriously undermines Americans' confidence that our system is \nfair.\n  My bill stops the runaway freight train of excessive penalties and \ninterest in two ways. First, interest on a penalty will only begin \nafter the taxpayer has failed to pay his tax bill. Today, interest on \nmost penalties is applied retroactively to the date that the tax return \nwas due, which may be as much as two to three years back. That's just \nnot fair. Second, my bill eliminates multiple penalties that apply to \nthe same error. Penalties should punish bad behavior, not honest errors \nthat even well-intentioned people are bound to make now and then.\n  Mr. President, another issue of enormous importance to many \nentrepreneurs in this country is the status\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\nof independent contractors. Over the past several years, I have worked \nhard for the adoption of a clear legislative safe-harbor for the \nclassification of workers and protections against retroactive \nreclassification of independent contractors. I included these \nprovisions as part of the Home-Based Business Fairness Act, S. 460, \nwhich I introduced last March. And I intend to pursue these important \nchanges to the tax code through that bill as the Senate debates \nlegislation to restructure the IRS and improve taxpayers' rights.\n\n\n                         Restructuring the IRS\n\n  The second part of my bill addresses the need for structural changes \nwithin the IRS. Over the past century, the IRS has evolved into a \nbureaucratic web of functions, regions, and district offices, all aimed \nat making the collection of taxes easy for the government. What has \nbeen overlooked is that those tax dollars come from citizens whom the \ngovernment is supposed to serve and represent. With roughly 140 million \nindividuals, alone, filing tax returns every year, the system must be \nmade convenient for the taxpayer, not just for the government.\n  I believe that the operations and staffing of the IRS should be based \nalong customer lines, an idea supported by the National Commission on \nRestructuring the IRS. The IRS' current ``one size fits all'' approach \nno longer meets the needs of taxpayers and is inefficient for the IRS \nas well. By restructuring the IRS along customer lines, the agency \ncould provide one-stop service for taxpayers with similar \ncharacteristics and needs, such as individuals, small businesses, and \nlarge companies. As a result, a married couple could go to an IRS \nservice center designed for individuals and get help on the issues that \nthey care about like the new child tax credit and the Roth IRA. \nSimilarly, a small business owner could resolve questions about the \ndepreciation deductions for her business equipment with IRS employees \nspecifically trained in these areas.\n  I was extremely pleased to hear IRS Commissioner Rossotti embrace \nthis one-stop-service proposal earlier this month. And I look forward \nto working with the agency to make it a reality for taxpayers at the \nearliest possible date. While the Commissioner has signaled his \ninterest in a customer-based IRS, I want to make sure that it does not \nbecome one of the many reorganization ideas that lose favor after a few \nshort years. To protect against that risk, my bill will make this \nstructure a permanent part of the tax code.\n  Reorganizing the IRS at the front-lines, however, is only part of the \ntask. The top-level management of the IRS here in Washington must make \ntaxpayer service a reality throughout the agency. My bill takes that \nstep by creating a full-time Board of Governors, which will have full \nresponsibility, authority, and accountability for IRS operations. This \nBoard, composed of four individuals drawn from the private sector plus \nthe IRS Commissioner, will have the authority and information necessary \nto ensure that the agency's examination and enforcement activities are \nconducted in a manner that treats taxpayers fairly and with respect. \nThe Board will also oversee the service provided by the Taxpayer \nAdvocate and will ensure that the IRS' appeals process is handled in an \nimpartial manner.\n  An independent, full-time Board of Governors will also protect the \nIRS from being used for political purposes. Any efforts to instill \nconfidence in our tax-administration system are severely undercut by \nallegations that the IRS is being used for politically-motivated \naudits. Regrettably, there have been recent reports suggesting that the \nIRS has undertaken these types of audits with regard to certain \nindividuals and non-profit organizations like the Christian Coalition \nand the Heritage Foundation. An IRS Board of Governors with \nrepresentatives of both political parties will help ensure that the \nagency is used for one purpose, and one purpose alone: helping \ntaxpayers to comply with the tax laws in the least burdensome manner \npossible.\n  Mr. President, in addition to redesigning the agency, my bill also \ncreates a common sense approach for redesigning IRS communications. Too \noften I have heard from constituents, especially small business owners, \nthat a notice they received from the IRS is incomprehensible. As a \nresult, one of two things usually happens. The taxpayer pays the bill \nwithout question just to make the IRS go away, even if they are not \nsure they owe any taxes. Or the taxpayer has to hire a professional to \ntell him what the notice means and then spend vast amounts of time and \nmoney getting the matter straightened out. This no-win situation has to \nend now.\n  My bill creates a panel of individual taxpayers, small entrepreneurs, \nlarge business managers, and other types of taxpayers, who will review \nall standardized IRS documents to make sure they are clear and \nunderstandable to the taxpayers who must read them. Any notice, letter \nor form that does not meet this minimum standard, will be sent back to \nthe IRS with a recommendation that it be rewritten before it is sent to \nany taxpayer. Clear communications are essential for good customer \nservice, and America's taxpayers deserve no less.\n\n\n                  Fair and Efficient Use of Technology\n\n  The third part of my bill concerns the fair and efficient use of \ntechnology in our tax-administration system. With the continuing \nadvances in technology, we have an enormous opportunity to make all \ntaxpayers' lives easier. In fact, the IRS has already made good \nprogress in this area with programs like TeleFile, which enables many \ntaxpayers to file their tax returns through a brief telephone call.\n  But with technological advances comes the risk of imposing even more \nburdens on taxpayers, and Congress must make sure that these \nimprovements are not implemented at the expense of the taxpayers, and \nespecially the small businesses, who are expected to comply with them. \nTo prevent that result, my bill makes clear that expanded electronic \nfiling of tax and information returns should be a goal, not a mandate \nimposed on American taxpayers.\n  In addition, my bill ensures that in making electronic filing a \nreality, the IRS will involve representatives of all taxpayer groups--\nindividuals, small business, large companies, and the tax-preparation \ncommunity--to ensure that electronic filing does not complicate \neveryone's lives in the name of modernization and simplification.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of the Putting the Taxpayer First Act \nwill make the IRS a better public servant and help restore confidence \nin our tax system. Taxpayers face enormous difficulties today just to \ncomply with the tax law, and they have waited far too long for good \nservice and fair treatment in a timely manner. I urge my colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee to include the provisions of this bill when they \nmarkup IRS-reform legislation next month. Our efforts must focus on \nputting the taxpayer first if we are to make positive and lasting \nchanges to the IRS and not keep America's taxpayers waiting any longer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Cochran, Snowe \nand Shelby be shown as original cosponsors. And I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the bill and a description of its provisions be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Court approval for seizure of taxpayer's property\n\n       In response to recent concerns raised about the IRS' \n     unchecked authority to seize a taxpayer's property, the bill \n     requires that before the IRS may seize property the agency \n     must obtain court approval with notice to the taxpayer and an \n     opportunity for a hearing. This requirement will protect a \n     taxpayer's right against unreasonable search and seizure \n     under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and ensure the \n     taxpayer's right to due process under the Fifth Amendment.\n       The bill includes an exception when a taxpayer tries to \n     hide, damage, or destroy property to evade paying his or her \n     taxes. In such a case, if the IRS demonstrates that the \n     property is likely to be lost or damaged, the court may \n     provide immediate relief, without involving the taxpayer, to \n     protect the property. To obtain such relief, the IRS must \n     demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that without relief, \n     the government's ultimate ability to collect the tax due from \n     the property will be lost. The IRS must also demonstrate that \n     the taxpayer has been given notice that tax is due, the \n     taxpayer has failed to pay, and the IRS has a reasonable \n     probability of success on the merits of the case.\n\n          Section 102. Improved offers-in-compromise procedure\n\n       The bill strengthens the IRS' current administrative \n     program for taxpayers who have no chance of paying their tax \n     liability in full. The program is intended to be a last \n     resort, and the bill requires the IRS to accept offers in \n     compromise when it is unlikely that the tax can be collected \n     in full and the offer represents the taxpayer's ability to \n     pay. The bill requires the IRS to accept, reject, or make a \n     counteroffer to a taxpayer's offer-in-compromise within 120 \n     days from the date that the taxpayer filed the offer and \n     submitted reasonable documentation concerning his or her \n     ability to pay. The bill suspends interest on the taxpayer's \n     tax liability if the IRS fails to meet the 120-day deadline \n     (with exceptions for frivolous offers made by taxpayers \n     merely to buy time). In addition, if the IRS does not accept \n     an offer (e.g., rejects it or returns it as unprocessable), \n     the IRS will be required to provide a complete explanation to \n     the taxpayer as to the reasons that the offer was not \n     accepted, and the taxpayer may appeal the rejection to the \n     Office of Appeals.\n       This section also requires the Treasury Department to issue \n     regulations that establish the standard for an acceptable \n     offer. The regulations will require that an acceptable offer \n     be based on the economic reality of the taxpayer's ability to \n     pay, and establish specific provisions addressing cases \n     involving small businesses and the self-employed.\n\n    Section 103. Expansion of attorney's fees to cover unauthorized-\n                     disclosure and browsing cases\n\n       The bill clarifies that a court may award attorney's fees \n     in cases involving unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer \n     information and browsing of taxpayer records by IRS \n     employees. This provision is intended to overrule McLarty v. \n     United States, 6 F.3d 545 (8th Cir. 1993), which denied \n     attorney's fees in a case involving unauthorized disclosure, \n     and adopt the ruling in Huckaby v. United States Department \n     of Treasury, 804 F.2d 297 (5th Cir. 1986), which permitted \n     such fees. The bill is also intended to prevent the \n     interpretation in McLarty from being applied to browsing \n     cases.\n\n   Section 104. Uniform application of confidentiality privilege for \n    taxpayer communications with Federally authorized practitioners\n\n       The bill expands the privilege of confidentiality that \n     exists currently between a taxpayer and an attorney with \n     respect to tax advice to any tax practitioner who is \n     currently authorized to practice before the IRS, such as \n     accountants and enrolled agents. Such confidentiality may be \n     asserted only in non-criminal tax cases before the IRS and \n     Federal courts, including Tax Court.\n\nSection 105. Taxpayer's right to have an IRS examination take place at \n                              another site\n\n       The bill provides that the IRS must accept a taxpayer's \n     request that an audit be moved away from his or her home or \n     business premises if the off-site location is accessible to \n     the auditor and the taxpayer's books and records are \n     available at such a location. This provision will enable the \n     IRS to conduct an audit but without the fear and disruption \n     resulting from the auditor being present in a family home and \n     among a business' employees and customers for days or weeks.\n\n   Section 106. Prohibition on IRS contact of third parties without \n                       taxpayer pre-notification\n\n       In many audit cases, especially employment tax audits, the \n     IRS uses its summons authority to verify information from a \n     business' customers, employees, suppliers, and others who do \n     business with the taxpayer, but without notifying the \n     taxpayer. Such inquiries often chill business relationships \n     and can lead a third party to cease doing business with the \n     taxpayer for fear of becoming ``involved'' in the audit \n     themselves. To reduce the economic harm of such contacts, the \n     bill requires pre-notification to a business taxpayer in \n     advance of the IRS issuing a summons to the business' \n     customers, employees, suppliers, and other third parties. An \n     exception is provided for cases in which the IRS can \n     demonstrate a specific bona fide reason that such notice \n     would jeopardize the collection of tax (e.g., the business \n     has threatened to fire any employee who talks to the IRS) or \n     a criminal investigation.\n\n  Section 107. Expansion of taxpayer's rights in administrative appeal\n\n       In some cases, when an audit is completed, the IRS does not \n     issue a notice of proposed\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\n     deficiency (i.e., 30-day letter) to the taxpayer, and instead \n     the taxpayer receives a notice of deficiency (i.e., 90-day \n     letter). As a result, the taxpayer loses the opportunity \n     to resolve his or her tax dispute through an \n     administrative appeal, and the taxpayer's only recourse is \n     to pay the tax or file suit in the Tax Court. To prevent \n     this situation, the bill requires the IRS to issue a \n     notice of proposed deficiency and permits the taxpayer to \n     appeal any proposed adjustments to the Office of Appeals. \n     This section is intended to encourage disputes to be \n     resolved at the agency level without the enormous costs to \n     the taxpayer of litigation.\n\n\n                        Title II--Penalty Reform\n\n     Section 201. Imposition of interest on penalties only after a \n                       taxpayer's failure to pay\n\n       Currently, interest on most penalties imposed by the IRS is \n     retroactively applied back to the due date for the taxpayer's \n     return. As a result, such interest amounts to an additional \n     hidden penalty, which can increase a taxpayer's tax bill \n     enormously. The bill provides that interest on a penalty \n     begins to run only after the time has expired for the \n     taxpayer to pay the bill.\n\n Section 202. Repeal of the penalty for substantial understatement of \n                               income tax\n\n       To simplify the penalty rules, the bill repeals the penalty \n     for substantial understatement of income tax. In most cases \n     involving a substantial understatement, the existing \n     negligence penalty will also apply. As a result, there will \n     still be a deterrent against taxpayers who attempt to cheat \n     on their taxes. However, with the growing complexity of the \n     tax code, it is possible for an innocent mistake to lead to a \n     substantial understatement, and the bill will protect \n     taxpayers in such cases.\n\n           Section 203. Repeal of the failure-to-pay penalty\n\n       The failure-to-pay penalties were originally enacted in the \n     1960s to compensate for the low rate of interest applied to \n     an individual's tax liability, and for the fact that such \n     interest was not compounded. Today, with interest compounded \n     daily and adjusted for changes in the interest rate, these \n     penalties are no longer needed and serve only as another \n     hidden, second penalty. In addition, these penalties are \n     often applied on top of accuracy-related penalties, resulting \n     in total punishment of as much as 45 percent in non-criminal \n     cases. To reduce the multiplicity of punishment on taxpayers \n     who make mistakes, the bill repeals the failure-to-pay \n     penalties.\n\n\n           Title III--Internal Revenue Service Restructuring\n\n     Section 301. Internal Revenue Service Board of Governors and \n                    Commissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n       The bill creates an independent, full-time Board of \n     Governors for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which will \n     exercise top-level administrative management over the agency. \n     The Board of Governors will have full responsibility, \n     authority, and accountability for the IRS' enforcement \n     activities, such as examinations and collections, which are \n     often at the heart of taxpayer complaints about the IRS. In \n     addition, the Board will oversee the Office of the Taxpayer \n     Advocate and the Office of Appeals. While the bill keeps the \n     formulation of tax policy within the purview of the Treasury \n     Department, the Board of Governors will have a significant \n     consultative role in such policy decisions.\n       The Board will consist of five members appointed by the \n     President and confirmed by the Senate, and the members will \n     have staggered five-year terms (i.e., one member will be \n     appointed each year). Two of the members will be affiliated \n     with the Republican party and two with the Democratic party. \n     The fifth member will be the Commissioner of Internal \n     Revenue, who will continue to be appointed by the President \n     with Senate confirmation, subject to a 5-year term. The \n     Commissioner will also serve as the Chairperson of the Board. \n     Collectively, the members of the Board will represent \n     experience and expertise in the needs and concerns of \n     taxpayers, organization development, customer service, the \n     operation of small businesses, the management of large \n     businesses, information technology, and compliance.\n\n   Section 302. Restructuring of IRS operations along customer lines\n\n       The bill reorganizes the IRS' operations according to \n     customer groups to provide ``one stop service'' for taxpayers \n     with similar characteristics and needs. This structure will \n     replace the current functional or ``one size fits all'' \n     approach under which an IRS function, such as taxpayer \n     services, examinations, or collections, handles all \n     taxpayers. The new IRS under this section of the bill will \n     have the following customer groups:\n       Individual taxpayers (subject to wage withholding).\n       Small business and self-employed individuals.\n       Large business.\n       Exempt organizations and pension plans.\n       Trusts and estates.\n       Other division deemed necessary by the Board of Governors.\n       Each customer group will be headed by an Assistant \n     Commissioner and will have existing IRS functions such as \n     taxpayer service, examinations, collections, and counsel \n     operations dedicated to the specific needs of the individuals \n     or businesses within the division. This structure will be \n     required by law in order to make it permanent and prevent it \n     from becoming just one of the many reorganization plans that \n     the IRS has undertaken over the past several decades.\n\n       Section 303. Greater independence of the Taxpayer Advocate\n\n       The bill requires that the Taxpayer Advocate be appointed \n     by and report directly to the Board of Governors. The Office \n     of the Taxpayer Advocate will also be independent of all \n     other functions of the IRS. Currently, the Taxpayer Advocate \n     is appointed by and reports only to the Commissioner of \n     Internal Revenue.\n\n       Section 304. Greater independence of the Office of Appeals\n\n       The section establishes a statutory Office of Appeals \n     within the IRS, which will be independent of all other IRS \n     functions. The Office of Appeals will be managed by a \n     National Appeals Officer, who will be appointed by and report \n     to the Board of Governors.\n       In order to ensure that the Office of Appeals is an \n     impartial arbiter, the bill prohibits two practices that \n     currently occur in the IRS' appeals process. Under the bill, \n     an appeals officer will be precluded from addressing issues \n     and arguments outside of those identified by the auditor. In \n     addition, this section prohibits communications between an \n     appeals officer and the auditor handling the case without the \n     presence of the taxpayer or his or her representative.\n\n Section 305. Improved IRS written communications to taxpayers and tax \n                                 forms\n\n       The bill directs the Board of Governors to create a \n     taxpayer-communications advisory group to provide a common-\n     sense review process for all new and existing IRS written \n     communications to taxpayers, such as standardized letters, \n     notices and bills as well as forms and instructions. The \n     advisory group's goal will be to ensure that all written \n     communications are clear and easy to understand by the \n     taxpayer to whom it is directed. If a document does not meet \n     this minimum standard, the advisory group will recommend to \n     the Board of Governors that the letter, notice, etc. be \n     rewritten before it is used.\n       The members of the advisory group will be volunteers with \n     at least one representative of individual taxpayers, small \n     businesses and the self-employed, large businesses, trusts \n     and estates, tax-exempt organizations, tax compliance \n     professionals and other constituencies deemed necessary by \n     the Board of Governors.\n\n\n                      Title IV--Electronic Filing\n\n  Section 401. Goals for electronic filing and the electronic-filing \n                             advisory group\n\n       This section establishes a goal, but not a mandate, that \n     paperless filing should be the preferred and most convenient \n     means of filing tax and information returns in 80 percent of \n     cases by the year 2007. In addition, this section calls on \n     the Treasury Secretary to create an electronic-filing \n     advisory group to ensure that the private sector has a role \n     in the implementation of that goal. The advisory group will \n     include representatives of individual taxpayers, small \n     businesses and the self-employed, large businesses, trusts \n     and estates, tax-exempt organizations, and the tax \n     preparation and filing industries.\n       This section requires the Treasury Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Board of Governors and the advisory \n     group, to develop a strategic plan for implementing the \n     electronic-filing goal. The plan will be subject to public \n     notice and comment and to the requirements of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act to ensure that the costs and burdens on \n     taxpayers who decide to file electronically are minimized.\n       This section also provides authority for the IRS to promote \n     the benefits of electronic filing and to provide appropriate \n     incentives to encourage taxpayers to file electronically.\n\n   Section 402. Report on electronic filing and its effect on small \n                               businesses\n\n       The bill requires the IRS Board of Governors, the Treasury \n     Secretary, and the electronic-filing advisory group to issue \n     an annual report to Congress through 2008 that specifically \n     addresses the effects of electronic filing on small business \n     and its feasibility. In particular, the report will include a \n     detailed description of the forms to be filed electronically, \n     the equipment and technology required for compliance, cost of \n     filing electronically, implementation plans, and efforts \n     undertaken to coordinate Federal, state and local filing \n     requirements including the possibility of one-stop filing.\n\n\n                       Title V--Regulatory Reform\n\n  Section 501. Congressional review of Internal Revenue Service rules \n                         that increase revenue\n\n       The bill includes the provisions of the Stealth Tax \n     Prevention Act of 1997 (S. 831), which will provide Congress \n     with a 60-day window to review any final IRS rule that raises \n     revenue.\n       Under the bill, Congress will have expedited procedures to \n     enact a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule the IRS \n     rule before it takes effect. The primary example of this \n     situation is the IRS' 1997 proposed regulations defining who \n     is a limited partner for self-employment tax purposes (now \n     known as the ``stealth tax regulations''), which is currently \n     subject to a Congressionally imposed moratorium.\n\n        Section 502. Small Business Advocacy Panels for the IRS\n\n       The bill requires the IRS to increase small business \n     participation in agency rulemaking\n\n[[Page S929]]\n\n     activities by convening a Small Business Advocacy Review \n     Panel for a proposed rule with a significant economic impact \n     on small entities. For such rules, the IRS will have to \n     notify SBA's Chief Counsel of Advocacy that the rule is under \n     development and provide sufficient information so that the \n     Chief Counsel can identify affected small entities and gather \n     advice and comments on the effects of the proposed rule. A \n     Small Business Advocacy Review Panel, comprising Federal \n     government employees from the IRS, the Office of Advocacy, \n     and OMB, must be convened to review the proposed rule and to \n     collect comments from small businesses. Within 60 days, the \n     panel will have to issue a report of the comments received \n     from small entities and the panel's findings, which will \n     become part of the public record. As appropriate, the IRS may \n     modify the rule or the initial Reg Flex analysis (or its \n     decision on whether a Reg Flex analysis is required) based on \n     the panel's report.\n       Currently, the requirement for Small Business Advisory \n     Panels applies to the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA). By expanding it to the IRS, the bill will ensure that \n     the views of small businesses are taken into account early in \n     the process of developing new rules and regulations and that \n     the IRS will take action to reduce the burdens of such rules \n     on these small enterprises.\n\nSection 503. Taxpayer's election with respect to recovery of costs and \n                              certain fees\n\n       Under the Internal Revenue Code, a taxpayer may recover \n     costs and fees, including attorney's fees, against the IRS if \n     he or she prevails and the IRS' litigation position was not \n     substantially justified. The Equal Access to Justice Act \n     (EAJA) permits a small business to recover such costs when an \n     unreasonable agency demand for fines or civil penalties is \n     not sustained in court or in an administrative proceeding. In \n     addition, a small business may also recover such costs and \n     fees under the EAJA when it is the prevailing party and the \n     agency enforcement action is not substantially justified. \n     Currently, the EAJA prohibits a taxpayer seeking to recover \n     costs and fees in an IRS enforcement action from doing so \n     under the EAJA if the fees and costs can be recovered under \n     the Internal Revenue Code.\n       The bill permits taxpayers to elect whether to pursue \n     recovery of attorney's fees and expenses under the Equal \n     Access to Justice Act (``EAJA'') or the Internal Revenue \n     Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1670. A bill to amend the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act to \nprovide for selection of lands by certain veterans of the Vietnam era; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  the alaska native vietnam veterans allotment open season act of 1998\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \non behalf of myself and Senator Stevens, legislation that will provide \nAlaska Native Veterans of the Vietnam era, from 1964-75, a chance to \napply for Native Allotments. Because these brave men and women were \noutside of the country, serving America with distinction, they missed \nthe opportunity to apply for these allotments. Our bill will create a \nyear-long open season for these veterans and their heirs to apply for \nand select allotment parcels.\n  The Alaska Native Allotment Act, in effect from 1906-71, allowed \nAlaska Natives who had continuous use of either vacant land or certain \nmineral lands set aside for federal use, the opportunity to apply for, \nselect, and ultimately be granted conveyance of these lands. Alaska \nNative Vietnam Veterans did not receive the outreach and assistance in \napplying that other Alaska Natives received during the time the act was \nin effect, and were effectively denied the opportunity to apply for \nallotments when they were serving their country. Our legislation calls \nfor the same standards that were in effect under the Allotment Act be \nused to evaluate these new applications. It calls for DOI to develop \nrules to implement this bill, in consultation with Alaska Native \ngroups. Congressman Young has introduced a companion measure in the \nHouse, and our respective committees plan to hold hearings this winter \non these pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that my 1995 authorizing legislation, \nPublic Law 104-2, that required the Department of the Interior to \nproduce a report on the possible impacts of allotment legislation, has \nled to this day. The time has come to give these veterans the \nopportunity to join their fellow Alaska Natives in reaping the benefits \nof the historic Alaska Native Allotment Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1671. A bill to address the Year 2000 computer problems with \nregard to financial institutions, to extend examination parity to the \nDirector of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit \nUnion Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     THE EXAMINATION PARITY AND YEAR 2000 READINESS FOR FINANCIAL \n                            INSTITUTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today, with my esteemed colleague \nSenator Dodd, to address an issue of significant import. Almost all of \nour nation's commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions are regulated \nand insured. This brings great peace of mind to the American public. We \nall rest easier knowing that our funds, held by our insured and \nregulated financial institutions, are protected by (a) an insurance \nfund, (b) a safety and soundness regulator, and (c) the full faith and \ncredit of the US Treasury. In order to continue this tradition of safe \nand sound banking practice, we need to ensure that banking law stays \nabreast of current practices in the market place and that our banks \nhave the most up-to-date information available on upcoming issues \naffecting the safety and soundness of their operations.\n  The Bill we introduce today has a two-fold purpose. It grants the \nOffice of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and the National Credit Union \nAdministration (NCUA) the authority to examine third party service \norganizations which have assumed more of the traditional bank \nfunctions. This bill will make OTS and NCUA comparable to the Office of \nthe Controller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation in their ability to ensure safe and sound banking practices \nas they relate to third party service organizations. This Bill also \nrequires federal financial regulatory agencies to hold seminars for \nfinancial institutions on the implications of the Year 2000 (Y2K) \nproblem for safe and sound operations, and to provide model approaches \nfor solving common Y2K problems.\n  The authorities proposed for the NCUA and OTS have been requested by \nboth regulatory agencies. NCUA ``strongly supports [this proposal] and \nurges its quick enactment.'' OTS, in separate letters to Senator Dodd \nand myself, refers to the current situation as an ``obstacle'' to their \nsupervisory efforts and a ``statutory deficiency''. OTS Director \nSeidman further states ``I support your efforts. . . . I have asked my \nstaff to cooperate fully with Senate Banking Committee staff to address \nany concerns you may have regarding this provision.''\n  OTS staff has been very helpful in this effort and I want to take \nthis opportunity to thank OTS Director Seidman for her assistance as \nwell as Ms Deborah Dakins. I also want to express appreciation to the \nSenate Banking Committee staff, especially Mr. Andrew Lowenthal, and my \nown Subcommittee staff for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1671\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President. I am very pleased to join with Senator \nBennett to introduce the ``Examination Parity and Year 2000 Readiness \nFor Financial Institutions Act.'' This legislation, while technical in \nnature, will provide badly needed authority and guidance to Federal \nfinancial regulators to help their supervised institutions cope with \nthe Year 2000 computer problem.\n  The Year 2000--or Y2K--computer problem is caused by the inability of \nmost of the major financial systems to process the year 2000 as the one \nthat follows the year 1999. This is caused by the fact that basic \ncomputer code, much of it written as many as thirty years ago, reads \ndates as two-digits, ``98'' or ``99,'' instead of four digits ``1999'' \nor ``2000.'' If left untreated, computers will read the year 2000 as \nthe years 1900, 1980 or some other default date. The result is not only \nerroneous calculations, but the total crash of many critical financial \nsystems.\n  Federal financial regulators have been very active, of late, in \nhelping their supervised institutions prepare for this extremely \ndangerous problem. However, both the Office of Thrift Supervision and \nthe National Credit Union Administration have notified Senator Bennett \nand I that they lack the authority to examine the Year 2000 \npreparations of service providers to thrifts and credit unions. \nCurrently, other federal financial regulators--the Federal Reserve, \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation--have this authority.\n  These service providers perform many of the key transaction and data \nprocessing for federally-insured thrifts and credit unions, \nparticularly smaller institutions for whom it is not cost-effective to \nestablish their own computer systems. As a result, it is imperative to \nthe safety and soundness of these institutions for the regulators to be \nable to establish that their service providers will be Year 2000 \ncompliant.\n  The legislation also contains provisions that require all financial \nregulators to hold seminars to educate their respective supervised \ninstitutions and, to the maximum extent possible, provide model \nsolutions for fixing the problem. The beneficial impact of such \noutreach and education efforts for federally-insured institutions is \nself-evident.\n  Mr. President, the Year 2000 problem is one that we will have to \nconfront in many more ways than this legislation. The extent of the \nproblem goes well beyond the financial services industry to affect \nvirtually every segment of our nation's economy. But this sensible bill \nis a good first step to ensuring that Federal financial regulators have \nthe tools necessary to address the problem in their area of \njurisdiction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1672. A bill to expand the authority of the Secretary of the Army \nto improve the control of erosion on the Missouri River; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             the missouri river erosion control act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to introduce the \nMissouri River Erosion Control Act of 1998, a bill to provide much-\nneeded assistance to homeowners who live along the Missouri River. Over \nthe past several years, many South Dakotans have seen property values \ndrop and homes nearly destroyed by shoreline erosion. This legislation \nwill help these families to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nto take responsible steps to prevent these problems. My colleague, \nSenator Johnson, is joining me as an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  While erosion occurs naturally on any river, shorelines on the \nMissouri are particularly vulnerable to it. Releases from the \nhydroelectric dams that span the river in South Dakota cause its depth \nand speed to fluctuate drastically, sometimes with dangerous \nconsequences. Following last year's flooding disaster, the rapid, \nswirling current caused by sustained high releases from the dams swept \naway half an acre of land near Burbank, South Dakota, in just 3 hours. \nA subsequent release destroyed an additional 40 feet of land, bringing \nthe river's edge to the foundation of the home of Neil and Eileen \nHelvig. Thanks to last minute work by the Corps of Engineers to \nstabilize the shoreline, the Helvig's home, and several others nearby, \nwere saved. However, this is not the only case when bank erosion has \nposed a threat to residential homes and without a comprehensive program \nin place to provide help to others in need, we may not be so lucky in \nthe future.\n  Over the last several years, Mrs. Lois Hyde of rural Lake Andes has \nwatched the river work its way to within a stone's throw of her home--\nan original homestead first settled by her family over 100 years ago. \nWithout additional help, it is likely that she may be forced to abandon \nher farm. I believe it is our responsibility to give individuals like \nher the help they need to protect their homes.\n  The Missouri River Erosion Control Act of 1998 will give homeowners \nthe opportunity to take responsible steps to protect their property. \nThe bill amends current law to permit homeowners to work in partnership \nwith the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take steps to stabilize their \nshoreline. Under the my bill, the Corps of Engineers will accept \napplications from private property owners along the Missouri River and \nrank those applications in order of need. The most vulnerable stretches \nof the shoreline would then be targeted for assistance. Like other \nerosion control programs, the bill requires a 35 percent non-federal \ncost share, while the federal government will provide the other 65 \npercent of the cost.\n  For many years the Corps of Engineers has been reluctant to work with \nprivate property owners to prevent damage to private property from \nerosion. Nevertheless, new circumstances require new thinking. \nParticularly in the wake of last year's disaster in South Dakota, \ncircumstances have made it clear that we must help families take the \nsteps they need to protect their homes. Homeowners want to take \nresponsible measures to protect their property. We must give them that \nopportunity. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1672\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill --Putting \nTaxpayers First. In the next few weeks the Senate will have a historic \nopportunity to make far-reaching changes to the operation of the \nInternal Revenue Service and to strengthen taxpayers' rights. For too \nlong, taxpayers have had to put up with poor service when dealing with \nthe IRS--often to the tune of larger tax bills because of interest and \npenalties that accrue during the lengthy delays in resolving disputes. \nWhile our ultimate goal must be a simpler and less burdensome tax law, \ntaxpayers need help today when dealing with the IRS. We must put \ntaxpayers first.\n  For my part, I have asked the people of Missouri for their \nsuggestions on how to fix the IRS and better protect taxpayers' rights. \nIn addition, as chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have \nasked small businesses across the country for their recommendations on \nthis issue. I am pleased to say that a great many people have taken the \ntime to call or write with their suggestions for improving this \ncountry's tax administration system.\n  Over the last several months, the Finance Committee has focused \nextensively on abuse of taxpayers and the need to reform our tax \nadministration system. In addition, my committee has held hearings on \nthis issue and the importance of reform for entrepreneurs and small \nbusiness owners throughout the country. The House has also completed \nits package of reform measures. That legislation provides a good start, \nbut I believe we can make it even stronger.\n  With the input and recommendations from all these sources in mind, \ntoday I am introducing the Putting Taxpayers First Act. This bill will \nprovide critical relief for a broad spectrum of taxpayers from single \nmoms and married couples to small business owners and farmers. It is \nbased on two fundamental principles. We must create an IRS and a tax \nsystem that are based on top-quality service for all taxpayers, and we \nmust act swiftly to restore citizen confidence in that system.\n  My bill tackles these goals in three ways: by improving taxpayer \nrights and protections, restructuring the management and operation of \nthe IRS, and using electronic filing technology to help taxpayers, not \ncomplicate their lives.\n  For more than 200 years, Americans have had the right, guaranteed by \nthe fourth amendment, ``to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, \nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,'' and have \nenjoyed the constitutional protections against being ``deprived of * * \n* property, without due process of law'' under the fifth amendment.\n  My bill will make the IRS fully respect these rights by requiring, as \npart of the Tax Code, that the IRS must obtain the approval by a judge \nor magistrate with notice and a hearing for the taxpayer before seizing \na taxpayer's property. The Government ought to be required to treat \nordinary taxpayers at least as well as they treat common criminals. It \nis way past time to level the playing field and preserve the \nconstitutional rights of all taxpayers.\n  My bill also stops the runaway freight train of excessive penalties \nand interest in two ways. First, the interest on a penalty will only \nbegin after the taxpayer fails to pay his tax bill. Today, interest on \nmost penalties is applied retroactively to the date that the tax return \nwas due, which may be as much as 2 to 3 years back. That is just not \nfair. Second, my bill eliminates multiple penalties that apply to the \nsame error. Penalties should punish bad behavior, not honest errors \nthat even well-intentioned people are bound to make now and then.\n  Next, with respect to restructuring the IRS, the second part of my \nbill addresses the need for structural changes within the IRS. I \nbelieve that the operations and staffing of the IRS should be based \nalong customer lines, an idea supported by the National Commission on \nRestructuring the IRS. The IRS' current one-size-fits-all approach no \nlonger meets the needs of taxpayers and is inefficient for the IRS as \nwell.\n  By restructuring the IRS along customer lines, the agency could \nprovide one-stop service for taxpayers with similar characteristics and \nneeds, such as individuals, small businesses and large companies. As a \nresult of these changes, a married couple could go to an IRS service \ncenter designed for individuals and get help on the issues they care \nabout, like the new child tax credit and the Roth IRA. Similarly, a \nsmall business owner could resolve questions about the depreciation \ndeductions for her business equipment with IRS employees specifically \ntrained in these areas.\n  I was extremely pleased to hear IRS Commissioner Rossotti embrace \nthis one-stop-service proposal early this month. While the Commissioner \nhas signaled his interest in a customer-based IRS, I want to make sure \nthat it does not become one of the many reorganization ideas that lose \nfavor after a few short years.\n  To protect against this risk, my bill that I introduce today will \nmake this structure a permanent part of the Tax Code. But reorganizing \nthe IRS front lines, however, is only part of the task. The top-level \nmanagement of the IRS here in Washington must make taxpayer service a \nreality throughout the agency. My bill takes that step by creating a \nfull-time board of governors, which will have full responsibility, \nauthority and accountability for IRS operations.\n\n  This board composed of four individuals drawn from the private sector \nplus the IRS Commissioner will have the authority and information \nnecessary to ensure that the agency's examinations and enforcement \nactivities are conducted in a manner that treats taxpayers fairly and \nwith respect.\n  The board will also oversee the service provided by the taxpayer \nadvocate and will ensure that the IRS appeals process is handled in an \nimpartial manner.\n  An independent, full-time board of governors will protect the IRS \nfrom being used for political purposes. Any efforts to instill \nconfidence in our tax administration system are severely undercut when \nthere are allegations that the IRS is being used for politically \nmotivated audits. Regrettably, there have been recent reports \nsuggesting the IRS has undertaken these types of audits with regard to \ncertain individuals and nonprofit organizations like the Christian \nCoalition and the Heritage Foundation. An IRS board of governors with \nrepresentatives of both political parties will help ensure that the \nagency is used for one purpose and one purpose alone: helping taxpayers \nto comply with the tax laws in the least burdensome manner possible.\n  Mr. President, in addition to redesigning the agency, my bill also \ncreates a commonsense approach for redesigning IRS communications. Too \noften we have heard from constituents, especially small business \nowners, that the notice they receive from the IRS is incomprehensible. \nAs a result, one of two things usually happens: The taxpayer pays the \nbill without question just to make the IRS go away, even if they are \nnot sure they owe taxes; or the taxpayer has to hire a professional to \ntell\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\nhim or her what the notice means and then spend vast amounts of time \nand money getting the matter straightened out. This no-win situation \nhas to end now.\n  My bill creates a panel of individual taxpayers, small entrepreneurs, \nlarge business managers and other types of taxpayers who will review \nall standardized IRS documents to make sure they are clear and \nunderstandable to the taxpayers who must read them. Any notice, letter \nor form that does not meet this minimum standard will be sent back to \nthe IRS with a recommendation that it be rewritten before it is sent to \nthe taxpayer. And clear communications, I believe, are essential for \ngood customer service. America's taxpayers deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, as I said, in the next few weeks the Senate will have \nan historic opportunity to make far-reaching changes to the operation \nof the Internal Revenue Service and to strengthen taxpayers' rights. \nFor too long, taxpayers have had to put up with poor service when \ndealing with the IRS--often to the tune of larger tax bills because of \ninterest and penalties that accrue during the lengthy delays in \nresolving disputes. While our ultimate goal must be a simpler and less \nburdensome tax law, taxpayers need help today when dealing with the \nIRS. We must put taxpayers first.\n  For my part, I have asked people across Missouri for their \nsuggestions on how to fix the IRS and better protect taxpayers' rights. \nIn addition, as the Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have \nasked small businesses across the country for their recommendations on \nthis issue. And I am pleased to say that a great many people have taken \nthe time to call or write with their suggestions for improving this \ncountry's tax-administration system.\n  Over the last several months, the Finance Committee has focused \nextensively on abuse of taxpayers and the need to reform our tax-\nadministration system. In addition, my Committee has held hearings on \nthis issue and the importance of reform for entrepreneurs and small \nbusiness owners throughout the country. The House has also completed \nits package of reform measures. That legislation provides a good start, \nbut I believe we can make it even stronger.\n  With the input and recommendations from all of these sources in mind, \ntoday I am introducing the Putting the Taxpayer First Act. This bill \nwill provide critical relief for a broad spectrum of taxpayers, from \nsingle moms and married couples to small business owners and farmers. \nAnd it is based on two fundamental principles. We must create an IRS \nand a tax system that are based on top quality service for all \ntaxpayers, and we must act swiftly to restore citizen confidence in \nthat system. My bill tackles these goals in three ways: by improving \ntaxpayer rights and protections, restructuring the management and \noperation of the IRS, and using electronic filing technology to help \ntaxpayers, not complicate their lives.\n\n\n                       Improving Taxpayer Rights\n\n  While our ultimate goal should be the wholesale reform or substantial \nreplacement of the tax laws, much additional progress can be made now \nby strengthening taxpayers' rights in order to restore faith in the \nfairness of our tax system. My bill includes several improvements to \ntaxpayers' rights, and I will stress just a few of them today.\n  Recent reports of excessive seizures by the IRS have alarmed all of \nus. These inexcusable practices were highlighted by Senator Nickles in \na hearing he held last December in Oklahoma City. Imagine the \ndevastation to an individual who finds himself in trouble with the IRS \nover back taxes, and the next thing he knows, the IRS has seized his \nbank account or his car--or worse yet, his home. In the case of an \nunfortunate small business, an abrupt seizure can mean shutting the \nbusiness down, ending the livelihoods of all the employees and their \nfamilies.\n  While some will say that seizures are a last resort and do not happen \nthat often, the IRS has disclosed that during Fiscal Year 1996, the \nagency made about 10,000 seizures of taxpayers' property. That is still \na sizeable number, and what is truly alarming is that these seizures \ncan be done on the IRS' own initiative, without judicial approval.\n  For more than 200 years, Americans have had the right, guaranteed by \nthe Fourth Amendment, ``to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, \nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,'' and have \nenjoyed the Constitutional protections against being ``deprived of . . \n. property, without due process of law'' under the Fifth Amendment. My \nbill will make the IRS more fully respect these rights by requiring, as \npart of the tax code, that the IRS must obtain the approval by a judge \nor magistrate, with notice and a hearing for the taxpayer, before \nseizing a taxpayer's property. The government ought to be required to \ntreat ordinary taxpayers at least as well as they treat common \ncriminals. It is way past time to level the playing field and preserve \nthe Constitutional rights of all taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, taxpayers, and especially small enterprises, often \nneed help when it comes to tax planning and examining alternatives to \nminimize their tax liability within the law. With the enormous \ncomplexity of the tax code today, taxpayers frequently have to make \ngood faith judgment calls about whether a particular deduction or \ncredit applies.\n  Today, there is an inequity in the law that results in unequal \ntreatment of taxpayers based on their choice of tax professional or \nfinancial ability to afford a lawyer. Under the current law, a taxpayer \nwho goes to an accountant to obtain advice for tax planning or \nassistance in a controversy to make sure he is not paying more tax than \nthe law requires, does so at his peril. In fact, he may as well invite \nthe IRS to that meeting because there is no privilege of \nconfidentiality between a taxpayer and his accountant.\n  For a taxpayer to gain the confidentiality protection that is \navailable, he must engage an attorney. Oddly enough, in many cases, the \nattorney may hire an accountant to gain accounting expertise, and then \nthe work of the accountant would be protected from disclosure to the \nIRS. Now the taxpayer has assumed enormous additional costs, and for \nwhat? Just to prevent the IRS from having an even greater upper hand \nagainst taxpayers who already have to prove their innocence?\n  My bill ends this disparity. It permits a taxpayer, in non-criminal \nmatters, to hire any individual authorized to practice before the IRS, \nsuch as an accountant, an enrolled agent, or an attorney, and be able \nto have conversations with that tax professional, which can remain \nprivate from the IRS. This taxpayer confidentiality provision will \nensure that all taxpayers receive equal treatment from the IRS in a way \nthat can save them money. In addition, it gives all taxpayers a wider \nchoice of tax advisors without giving up their right to \nconfidentiality. This is a common-sense protection for the millions of \nindividuals and businesses that seek professional tax advice each year.\n\n  Penalties, too, have become an enormous burden for taxpayers who make \nmistakes, which is not uncommon with today's complex tax laws. Far too \noften, a minor tax bill grows into an unmanageable liability because of \nthe interest on the tax owed, the penalties for negligence and late \npayment, and the interest on the penalties. Frequently, these penalties \ncan prevent a taxpayer from settling his account and getting back into \ngood standing.\n  Penalties were included in the tax code to encourage taxpayers to \ncomply with our voluntary assessment system. But the multiplicity of \npenalties and hidden punishments disguised as interest on those \npenalties seriously undermines Americans' confidence that our system is \nfair.\n  My bill stops the runaway freight train of excessive penalties and \ninterest in two ways. First, interest on a penalty will only begin \nafter the taxpayer has failed to pay his tax bill. Today, interest on \nmost penalties is applied retroactively to the date that the tax return \nwas due, which may be as much as two to three years back. That's just \nnot fair. Second, my bill eliminates multiple penalties that apply to \nthe same error. Penalties should punish bad behavior, not honest errors \nthat even well-intentioned people are bound to make now and then.\n  Mr. President, another issue of enormous importance to many \nentrepreneurs in this country is the status\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\nof independent contractors. Over the past several years, I have worked \nhard for the adoption of a clear legislative safe-harbor for the \nclassification of workers and protections against retroactive \nreclassification of independent contractors. I included these \nprovisions as part of the Home-Based Business Fairness Act, S. 460, \nwhich I introduced last March. And I intend to pursue these important \nchanges to the tax code through that bill as the Senate debates \nlegislation to restructure the IRS and improve taxpayers' rights.\n\n\n                         Restructuring the IRS\n\n  The second part of my bill addresses the need for structural changes \nwithin the IRS. Over the past century, the IRS has evolved into a \nbureaucratic web of functions, regions, and district offices, all aimed \nat making the collection of taxes easy for the government. What has \nbeen overlooked is that those tax dollars come from citizens whom the \ngovernment is supposed to serve and represent. With roughly 140 million \nindividuals, alone, filing tax returns every year, the system must be \nmade convenient for the taxpayer, not just for the government.\n  I believe that the operations and staffing of the IRS should be based \nalong customer lines, an idea supported by the National Commission on \nRestructuring the IRS. The IRS' current ``one size fits all'' approach \nno longer meets the needs of taxpayers and is inefficient for the IRS \nas well. By restructuring the IRS along customer lines, the agency \ncould provide one-stop service for taxpayers with similar \ncharacteristics and needs, such as individuals, small businesses, and \nlarge companies. As a result, a married couple could go to an IRS \nservice center designed for individuals and get help on the issues that \nthey care about like the new child tax credit and the Roth IRA. \nSimilarly, a small business owner could resolve questions about the \ndepreciation deductions for her business equipment with IRS employees \nspecifically trained in these areas.\n  I was extremely pleased to hear IRS Commissioner Rossotti embrace \nthis one-stop-service proposal earlier this month. And I look forward \nto working with the agency to make it a reality for taxpayers at the \nearliest possible date. While the Commissioner has signaled his \ninterest in a customer-based IRS, I want to make sure that it does not \nbecome one of the many reorganization ideas that lose favor after a few \nshort years. To protect against that risk, my bill will make this \nstructure a permanent part of the tax code.\n  Reorganizing the IRS at the front-lines, however, is only part of the \ntask. The top-level management of the IRS here in Washington must make \ntaxpayer service a reality throughout the agency. My bill takes that \nstep by creating a full-time Board of Governors, which will have full \nresponsibility, authority, and accountability for IRS operations. This \nBoard, composed of four individuals drawn from the private sector plus \nthe IRS Commissioner, will have the authority and information necessary \nto ensure that the agency's examination and enforcement activities are \nconducted in a manner that treats taxpayers fairly and with respect. \nThe Board will also oversee the service provided by the Taxpayer \nAdvocate and will ensure that the IRS' appeals process is handled in an \nimpartial manner.\n  An independent, full-time Board of Governors will also protect the \nIRS from being used for political purposes. Any efforts to instill \nconfidence in our tax-administration system are severely undercut by \nallegations that the IRS is being used for politically-motivated \naudits. Regrettably, there have been recent reports suggesting that the \nIRS has undertaken these types of audits with regard to certain \nindividuals and non-profit organizations like the Christian Coalition \nand the Heritage Foundation. An IRS Board of Governors with \nrepresentatives of both political parties will help ensure that the \nagency is used for one purpose, and one purpose alone: helping \ntaxpayers to comply with the tax laws in the least burdensome manner \npossible.\n  Mr. President, in addition to redesigning the agency, my bill also \ncreates a common sense approach for redesigning IRS communications. Too \noften I have heard from constituents, especially small business owners, \nthat a notice they received from the IRS is incomprehensible. As a \nresult, one of two things usually happens. The taxpayer pays the bill \nwithout question just to make the IRS go away, even if they are not \nsure they owe any taxes. Or the taxpayer has to hire a professional to \ntell him what the notice means and then spend vast amounts of time and \nmoney getting the matter straightened out. This no-win situation has to \nend now.\n  My bill creates a panel of individual taxpayers, small entrepreneurs, \nlarge business managers, and other types of taxpayers, who will review \nall standardized IRS documents to make sure they are clear and \nunderstandable to the taxpayers who must read them. Any notice, letter \nor form that does not meet this minimum standard, will be sent back to \nthe IRS with a recommendation that it be rewritten before it is sent to \nany taxpayer. Clear communications are essential for good customer \nservice, and America's taxpayers deserve no less.\n\n\n                  Fair and Efficient Use of Technology\n\n  The third part of my bill concerns the fair and efficient use of \ntechnology in our tax-administration system. With the continuing \nadvances in technology, we have an enormous opportunity to make all \ntaxpayers' lives easier. In fact, the IRS has already made good \nprogress in this area with programs like TeleFile, which enables many \ntaxpayers to file their tax returns through a brief telephone call.\n  But with technological advances comes the risk of imposing even more \nburdens on taxpayers, and Congress must make sure that these \nimprovements are not implemented at the expense of the taxpayers, and \nespecially the small businesses, who are expected to comply with them. \nTo prevent that result, my bill makes clear that expanded electronic \nfiling of tax and information returns should be a goal, not a mandate \nimposed on American taxpayers.\n  In addition, my bill ensures that in making electronic filing a \nreality, the IRS will involve representatives of all taxpayer groups--\nindividuals, small business, large companies, and the tax-preparation \ncommunity--to ensure that electronic filing does not complicate \neveryone's lives in the name of modernization and simplification.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of the Putting the Taxpayer First Act \nwill make the IRS a better public servant and help restore confidence \nin our tax system. Taxpayers face enormous difficulties today just to \ncomply with the tax law, and they have waited far too long for good \nservice and fair treatment in a timely manner. I urge my colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee to include the provisions of this bill when they \nmarkup IRS-reform legislation next month. Our efforts must focus on \nputting the taxpayer first if we are to make positive and lasting \nchanges to the IRS and not keep America's taxpayers waiting any longer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Cochran, Snowe \nand Shelby be shown as original cosponsors. And I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the bill and a description of its provisions be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Court approval for seizure of taxpayer's property\n\n       In response to recent concerns raised about the IRS' \n     unchecked authority to seize a taxpayer's property, the bill \n     requires that before the IRS may seize property the agency \n     must obtain court approval with notice to the taxpayer and an \n     opportunity for a hearing. This requirement will protect a \n     taxpayer's right against unreasonable search and seizure \n     under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and ensure the \n     taxpayer's right to due process under the Fifth Amendment.\n       The bill includes an exception when a taxpayer tries to \n     hide, damage, or destroy property to evade paying his or her \n     taxes. In such a case, if the IRS demonstrates that the \n     property is likely to be lost or damaged, the court may \n     provide immediate relief, without involving the taxpayer, to \n     protect the property. To obtain such relief, the IRS must \n     demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that without relief, \n     the government's ultimate ability to collect the tax due from \n     the property will be lost. The IRS must also demonstrate that \n     the taxpayer has been given notice that tax is due, the \n     taxpayer has failed to pay, and the IRS has a reasonable \n     probability of success on the merits of the case.\n\n          Section 102. Improved offers-in-compromise procedure\n\n       The bill strengthens the IRS' current administrative \n     program for taxpayers who have no chance of paying their tax \n     liability in full. The program is intended to be a last \n     resort, and the bill requires the IRS to accept offers in \n     compromise when it is unlikely that the tax can be collected \n     in full and the offer represents the taxpayer's ability to \n     pay. The bill requires the IRS to accept, reject, or make a \n     counteroffer to a taxpayer's offer-in-compromise within 120 \n     days from the date that the taxpayer filed the offer and \n     submitted reasonable documentation concerning his or her \n     ability to pay. The bill suspends interest on the taxpayer's \n     tax liability if the IRS fails to meet the 120-day deadline \n     (with exceptions for frivolous offers made by taxpayers \n     merely to buy time). In addition, if the IRS does not accept \n     an offer (e.g., rejects it or returns it as unprocessable), \n     the IRS will be required to provide a complete explanation to \n     the taxpayer as to the reasons that the offer was not \n     accepted, and the taxpayer may appeal the rejection to the \n     Office of Appeals.\n       This section also requires the Treasury Department to issue \n     regulations that establish the standard for an acceptable \n     offer. The regulations will require that an acceptable offer \n     be based on the economic reality of the taxpayer's ability to \n     pay, and establish specific provisions addressing cases \n     involving small businesses and the self-employed.\n\n    Section 103. Expansion of attorney's fees to cover unauthorized-\n                     disclosure and browsing cases\n\n       The bill clarifies that a court may award attorney's fees \n     in cases involving unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer \n     information and browsing of taxpayer records by IRS \n     employees. This provision is intended to overrule McLarty v. \n     United States, 6 F.3d 545 (8th Cir. 1993), which denied \n     attorney's fees in a case involving unauthorized disclosure, \n     and adopt the ruling in Huckaby v. United States Department \n     of Treasury, 804 F.2d 297 (5th Cir. 1986), which permitted \n     such fees. The bill is also intended to prevent the \n     interpretation in McLarty from being applied to browsing \n     cases.\n\n   Section 104. Uniform application of confidentiality privilege for \n    taxpayer communications with Federally authorized practitioners\n\n       The bill expands the privilege of confidentiality that \n     exists currently between a taxpayer and an attorney with \n     respect to tax advice to any tax practitioner who is \n     currently authorized to practice before the IRS, such as \n     accountants and enrolled agents. Such confidentiality may be \n     asserted only in non-criminal tax cases before the IRS and \n     Federal courts, including Tax Court.\n\nSection 105. Taxpayer's right to have an IRS examination take place at \n                              another site\n\n       The bill provides that the IRS must accept a taxpayer's \n     request that an audit be moved away from his or her home or \n     business premises if the off-site location is accessible to \n     the auditor and the taxpayer's books and records are \n     available at such a location. This provision will enable the \n     IRS to conduct an audit but without the fear and disruption \n     resulting from the auditor being present in a family home and \n     among a business' employees and customers for days or weeks.\n\n   Section 106. Prohibition on IRS contact of third parties without \n                       taxpayer pre-notification\n\n       In many audit cases, especially employment tax audits, the \n     IRS uses its summons authority to verify information from a \n     business' customers, employees, suppliers, and others who do \n     business with the taxpayer, but without notifying the \n     taxpayer. Such inquiries often chill business relationships \n     and can lead a third party to cease doing business with the \n     taxpayer for fear of becoming ``involved'' in the audit \n     themselves. To reduce the economic harm of such contacts, the \n     bill requires pre-notification to a business taxpayer in \n     advance of the IRS issuing a summons to the business' \n     customers, employees, suppliers, and other third parties. An \n     exception is provided for cases in which the IRS can \n     demonstrate a specific bona fide reason that such notice \n     would jeopardize the collection of tax (e.g., the business \n     has threatened to fire any employee who talks to the IRS) or \n     a criminal investigation.\n\n  Section 107. Expansion of taxpayer's rights in administrative appeal\n\n       In some cases, when an audit is completed, the IRS does not \n     issue a notice of proposed\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\n     deficiency (i.e., 30-day letter) to the taxpayer, and instead \n     the taxpayer receives a notice of deficiency (i.e., 90-day \n     letter). As a result, the taxpayer loses the opportunity \n     to resolve his or her tax dispute through an \n     administrative appeal, and the taxpayer's only recourse is \n     to pay the tax or file suit in the Tax Court. To prevent \n     this situation, the bill requires the IRS to issue a \n     notice of proposed deficiency and permits the taxpayer to \n     appeal any proposed adjustments to the Office of Appeals. \n     This section is intended to encourage disputes to be \n     resolved at the agency level without the enormous costs to \n     the taxpayer of litigation.\n\n\n                        Title II--Penalty Reform\n\n     Section 201. Imposition of interest on penalties only after a \n                       taxpayer's failure to pay\n\n       Currently, interest on most penalties imposed by the IRS is \n     retroactively applied back to the due date for the taxpayer's \n     return. As a result, such interest amounts to an additional \n     hidden penalty, which can increase a taxpayer's tax bill \n     enormously. The bill provides that interest on a penalty \n     begins to run only after the time has expired for the \n     taxpayer to pay the bill.\n\n Section 202. Repeal of the penalty for substantial understatement of \n                               income tax\n\n       To simplify the penalty rules, the bill repeals the penalty \n     for substantial understatement of income tax. In most cases \n     involving a substantial understatement, the existing \n     negligence penalty will also apply. As a result, there will \n     still be a deterrent against taxpayers who attempt to cheat \n     on their taxes. However, with the growing complexity of the \n     tax code, it is possible for an innocent mistake to lead to a \n     substantial understatement, and the bill will protect \n     taxpayers in such cases.\n\n           Section 203. Repeal of the failure-to-pay penalty\n\n       The failure-to-pay penalties were originally enacted in the \n     1960s to compensate for the low rate of interest applied to \n     an individual's tax liability, and for the fact that such \n     interest was not compounded. Today, with interest compounded \n     daily and adjusted for changes in the interest rate, these \n     penalties are no longer needed and serve only as another \n     hidden, second penalty. In addition, these penalties are \n     often applied on top of accuracy-related penalties, resulting \n     in total punishment of as much as 45 percent in non-criminal \n     cases. To reduce the multiplicity of punishment on taxpayers \n     who make mistakes, the bill repeals the failure-to-pay \n     penalties.\n\n\n           Title III--Internal Revenue Service Restructuring\n\n     Section 301. Internal Revenue Service Board of Governors and \n                    Commissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n       The bill creates an independent, full-time Board of \n     Governors for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which will \n     exercise top-level administrative management over the agency. \n     The Board of Governors will have full responsibility, \n     authority, and accountability for the IRS' enforcement \n     activities, such as examinations and collections, which are \n     often at the heart of taxpayer complaints about the IRS. In \n     addition, the Board will oversee the Office of the Taxpayer \n     Advocate and the Office of Appeals. While the bill keeps the \n     formulation of tax policy within the purview of the Treasury \n     Department, the Board of Governors will have a significant \n     consultative role in such policy decisions.\n       The Board will consist of five members appointed by the \n     President and confirmed by the Senate, and the members will \n     have staggered five-year terms (i.e., one member will be \n     appointed each year). Two of the members will be affiliated \n     with the Republican party and two with the Democratic party. \n     The fifth member will be the Commissioner of Internal \n     Revenue, who will continue to be appointed by the President \n     with Senate confirmation, subject to a 5-year term. The \n     Commissioner will also serve as the Chairperson of the Board. \n     Collectively, the members of the Board will represent \n     experience and expertise in the needs and concerns of \n     taxpayers, organization development, customer service, the \n     operation of small businesses, the management of large \n     businesses, information technology, and compliance.\n\n   Section 302. Restructuring of IRS operations along customer lines\n\n       The bill reorganizes the IRS' operations according to \n     customer groups to provide ``one stop service'' for taxpayers \n     with similar characteristics and needs. This structure will \n     replace the current functional or ``one size fits all'' \n     approach under which an IRS function, such as taxpayer \n     services, examinations, or collections, handles all \n     taxpayers. The new IRS under this section of the bill will \n     have the following customer groups:\n       Individual taxpayers (subject to wage withholding).\n       Small business and self-employed individuals.\n       Large business.\n       Exempt organizations and pension plans.\n       Trusts and estates.\n       Other division deemed necessary by the Board of Governors.\n       Each customer group will be headed by an Assistant \n     Commissioner and will have existing IRS functions such as \n     taxpayer service, examinations, collections, and counsel \n     operations dedicated to the specific needs of the individuals \n     or businesses within the division. This structure will be \n     required by law in order to make it permanent and prevent it \n     from becoming just one of the many reorganization plans that \n     the IRS has undertaken over the past several decades.\n\n       Section 303. Greater independence of the Taxpayer Advocate\n\n       The bill requires that the Taxpayer Advocate be appointed \n     by and report directly to the Board of Governors. The Office \n     of the Taxpayer Advocate will also be independent of all \n     other functions of the IRS. Currently, the Taxpayer Advocate \n     is appointed by and reports only to the Commissioner of \n     Internal Revenue.\n\n       Section 304. Greater independence of the Office of Appeals\n\n       The section establishes a statutory Office of Appeals \n     within the IRS, which will be independent of all other IRS \n     functions. The Office of Appeals will be managed by a \n     National Appeals Officer, who will be appointed by and report \n     to the Board of Governors.\n       In order to ensure that the Office of Appeals is an \n     impartial arbiter, the bill prohibits two practices that \n     currently occur in the IRS' appeals process. Under the bill, \n     an appeals officer will be precluded from addressing issues \n     and arguments outside of those identified by the auditor. In \n     addition, this section prohibits communications between an \n     appeals officer and the auditor handling the case without the \n     presence of the taxpayer or his or her representative.\n\n Section 305. Improved IRS written communications to taxpayers and tax \n                                 forms\n\n       The bill directs the Board of Governors to create a \n     taxpayer-communications advisory group to provide a common-\n     sense review process for all new and existing IRS written \n     communications to taxpayers, such as standardized letters, \n     notices and bills as well as forms and instructions. The \n     advisory group's goal will be to ensure that all written \n     communications are clear and easy to understand by the \n     taxpayer to whom it is directed. If a document does not meet \n     this minimum standard, the advisory group will recommend to \n     the Board of Governors that the letter, notice, etc. be \n     rewritten before it is used.\n       The members of the advisory group will be volunteers with \n     at least one representative of individual taxpayers, small \n     businesses and the self-employed, large businesses, trusts \n     and estates, tax-exempt organizations, tax compliance \n     professionals and other constituencies deemed necessary by \n     the Board of Governors.\n\n\n                      Title IV--Electronic Filing\n\n  Section 401. Goals for electronic filing and the electronic-filing \n                             advisory group\n\n       This section establishes a goal, but not a mandate, that \n     paperless filing should be the preferred and most convenient \n     means of filing tax and information returns in 80 percent of \n     cases by the year 2007. In addition, this section calls on \n     the Treasury Secretary to create an electronic-filing \n     advisory group to ensure that the private sector has a role \n     in the implementation of that goal. The advisory group will \n     include representatives of individual taxpayers, small \n     businesses and the self-employed, large businesses, trusts \n     and estates, tax-exempt organizations, and the tax \n     preparation and filing industries.\n       This section requires the Treasury Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Board of Governors and the advisory \n     group, to develop a strategic plan for implementing the \n     electronic-filing goal. The plan will be subject to public \n     notice and comment and to the requirements of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act to ensure that the costs and burdens on \n     taxpayers who decide to file electronically are minimized.\n       This section also provides authority for the IRS to promote \n     the benefits of electronic filing and to provide appropriate \n     incentives to encourage taxpayers to file electronically.\n\n   Section 402. Report on electronic filing and its effect on small \n                               businesses\n\n       The bill requires the IRS Board of Governors, the Treasury \n     Secretary, and the electronic-filing advisory group to issue \n     an annual report to Congress through 2008 that specifically \n     addresses the effects of electronic filing on small business \n     and its feasibility. In particular, the report will include a \n     detailed description of the forms to be filed electronically, \n     the equipment and technology required for compliance, cost of \n     filing electronically, implementation plans, and efforts \n     undertaken to coordinate Federal, state and local filing \n     requirements including the possibility of one-stop filing.\n\n\n                       Title V--Regulatory Reform\n\n  Section 501. Congressional review of Internal Revenue Service rules \n                         that increase revenue\n\n       The bill includes the provisions of the Stealth Tax \n     Prevention Act of 1997 (S. 831), which will provide Congress \n     with a 60-day window to review any final IRS rule that raises \n     revenue.\n       Under the bill, Congress will have expedited procedures to \n     enact a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule the IRS \n     rule before it takes effect. The primary example of this \n     situation is the IRS' 1997 proposed regulations defining who \n     is a limited partner for self-employment tax purposes (now \n     known as the ``stealth tax regulations''), which is currently \n     subject to a Congressionally imposed moratorium.\n\n        Section 502. Small Business Advocacy Panels for the IRS\n\n       The bill requires the IRS to increase small business \n     participation in agency rulemaking\n\n[[Page S929]]\n\n     activities by convening a Small Business Advocacy Review \n     Panel for a proposed rule with a significant economic impact \n     on small entities. For such rules, the IRS will have to \n     notify SBA's Chief Counsel of Advocacy that the rule is under \n     development and provide sufficient information so that the \n     Chief Counsel can identify affected small entities and gather \n     advice and comments on the effects of the proposed rule. A \n     Small Business Advocacy Review Panel, comprising Federal \n     government employees from the IRS, the Office of Advocacy, \n     and OMB, must be convened to review the proposed rule and to \n     collect comments from small businesses. Within 60 days, the \n     panel will have to issue a report of the comments received \n     from small entities and the panel's findings, which will \n     become part of the public record. As appropriate, the IRS may \n     modify the rule or the initial Reg Flex analysis (or its \n     decision on whether a Reg Flex analysis is required) based on \n     the panel's report.\n       Currently, the requirement for Small Business Advisory \n     Panels applies to the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA). By expanding it to the IRS, the bill will ensure that \n     the views of small businesses are taken into account early in \n     the process of developing new rules and regulations and that \n     the IRS will take action to reduce the burdens of such rules \n     on these small enterprises.\n\nSection 503. Taxpayer's election with respect to recovery of costs and \n                              certain fees\n\n       Under the Internal Revenue Code, a taxpayer may recover \n     costs and fees, including attorney's fees, against the IRS if \n     he or she prevails and the IRS' litigation position was not \n     substantially justified. The Equal Access to Justice Act \n     (EAJA) permits a small business to recover such costs when an \n     unreasonable agency demand for fines or civil penalties is \n     not sustained in court or in an administrative proceeding. In \n     addition, a small business may also recover such costs and \n     fees under the EAJA when it is the prevailing party and the \n     agency enforcement action is not substantially justified. \n     Currently, the EAJA prohibits a taxpayer seeking to recover \n     costs and fees in an IRS enforcement action from doing so \n     under the EAJA if the fees and costs can be recovered under \n     the Internal Revenue Code.\n       The bill permits taxpayers to elect whether to pursue \n     recovery of attorney's fees and expenses under the Equal \n     Access to Justice Act (``EAJA'') or the Internal Revenue \n     Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1670. A bill to amend the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act to \nprovide for selection of lands by certain veterans of the Vietnam era; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  the alaska native vietnam veterans allotment open season act of 1998\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \non behalf of myself and Senator Stevens, legislation that will provide \nAlaska Native Veterans of the Vietnam era, from 1964-75, a chance to \napply for Native Allotments. Because these brave men and women were \noutside of the country, serving America with distinction, they missed \nthe opportunity to apply for these allotments. Our bill will create a \nyear-long open season for these veterans and their heirs to apply for \nand select allotment parcels.\n  The Alaska Native Allotment Act, in effect from 1906-71, allowed \nAlaska Natives who had continuous use of either vacant land or certain \nmineral lands set aside for federal use, the opportunity to apply for, \nselect, and ultimately be granted conveyance of these lands. Alaska \nNative Vietnam Veterans did not receive the outreach and assistance in \napplying that other Alaska Natives received during the time the act was \nin effect, and were effectively denied the opportunity to apply for \nallotments when they were serving their country. Our legislation calls \nfor the same standards that were in effect under the Allotment Act be \nused to evaluate these new applications. It calls for DOI to develop \nrules to implement this bill, in consultation with Alaska Native \ngroups. Congressman Young has introduced a companion measure in the \nHouse, and our respective committees plan to hold hearings this winter \non these pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that my 1995 authorizing legislation, \nPublic Law 104-2, that required the Department of the Interior to \nproduce a report on the possible impacts of allotment legislation, has \nled to this day. The time has come to give these veterans the \nopportunity to join their fellow Alaska Natives in reaping the benefits \nof the historic Alaska Native Allotment Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1671. A bill to address the Year 2000 computer problems with \nregard to financial institutions, to extend examination parity to the \nDirector of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit \nUnion Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     THE EXAMINATION PARITY AND YEAR 2000 READINESS FOR FINANCIAL \n                            INSTITUTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today, with my esteemed colleague \nSenator Dodd, to address an issue of significant import. Almost all of \nour nation's commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions are regulated \nand insured. This brings great peace of mind to the American public. We \nall rest easier knowing that our funds, held by our insured and \nregulated financial institutions, are protected by (a) an insurance \nfund, (b) a safety and soundness regulator, and (c) the full faith and \ncredit of the US Treasury. In order to continue this tradition of safe \nand sound banking practice, we need to ensure that banking law stays \nabreast of current practices in the market place and that our banks \nhave the most up-to-date information available on upcoming issues \naffecting the safety and soundness of their operations.\n  The Bill we introduce today has a two-fold purpose. It grants the \nOffice of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and the National Credit Union \nAdministration (NCUA) the authority to examine third party service \norganizations which have assumed more of the traditional bank \nfunctions. This bill will make OTS and NCUA comparable to the Office of \nthe Controller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation in their ability to ensure safe and sound banking practices \nas they relate to third party service organizations. This Bill also \nrequires federal financial regulatory agencies to hold seminars for \nfinancial institutions on the implications of the Year 2000 (Y2K) \nproblem for safe and sound operations, and to provide model approaches \nfor solving common Y2K problems.\n  The authorities proposed for the NCUA and OTS have been requested by \nboth regulatory agencies. NCUA ``strongly supports [this proposal] and \nurges its quick enactment.'' OTS, in separate letters to Senator Dodd \nand myself, refers to the current situation as an ``obstacle'' to their \nsupervisory efforts and a ``statutory deficiency''. OTS Director \nSeidman further states ``I support your efforts. . . . I have asked my \nstaff to cooperate fully with Senate Banking Committee staff to address \nany concerns you may have regarding this provision.''\n  OTS staff has been very helpful in this effort and I want to take \nthis opportunity to thank OTS Director Seidman for her assistance as \nwell as Ms Deborah Dakins. I also want to express appreciation to the \nSenate Banking Committee staff, especially Mr. Andrew Lowenthal, and my \nown Subcommittee staff for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1671\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Examination Parity and Year \n     2000 Readiness for Financial Institutions Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. YEAR 2000 READINESS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Year 2000 computer problem poses a serious \n     challenge to the American economy, including the Nation's \n     banking and financial services industries;\n       (2) thousands of banks, savings associations, and credit \n     unions rely heavily on internal information technology and \n     computer systems, as well as outside service providers, for \n     mission-critical functions, such as check clearing, direct \n     deposit, accounting, automated teller machine networks, \n     credit card processing, and data exchanges with domestic and \n     international borrowers, customers, and other financial \n     institutions; and\n       (3) Federal financial regulatory agencies must have \n     sufficient examination authority to ensure that the safety \n     and soundness of the Nation's financial institutions will not \n     be at risk.\n       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the terms ``depository institution'' and ``Federal \n     banking agency'' have the same meanings as in section 3 of \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;\n\n[[Page S930]]\n\n       (2) the term ``Federal home loan bank'' has the same \n     meaning as in section 2 of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act;\n       (3) the term ``Federal reserve bank'' means a reserve bank \n     established under the Federal Reserve Act;\n       (4) the term ``insured credit union'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act; and\n       (5) the term ``Year 2000 computer problem'' means, with \n     respect to information technology, any problem which prevents \n     such technology from accurately processing, calculating, \n     comparing, or sequencing date or time data--\n       (A) from, into, or between--\n       (i) the 20th and 21st centuries; or\n       (ii) the years 1999 and 2000; or\n       (B) with regard to leap year calculations.\n       (c) Seminars and Model Approaches to Year 2000 Computer \n     Problem.--\n       (1) Seminars.--\n       (A) In general.--Each Federal banking agency and the \n     National Credit Union Administration Board shall offer \n     seminars to all depository institutions and insured credit \n     unions under the jurisdiction of such agency on the \n     implication of the Year 2000 computer problem for--\n       (i) the safe and sound operations of such depository \n     institutions and credit unions; and\n       (ii) transactions with other financial institutions, \n     including Federal reserve banks and Federal home loan banks.\n       (B) Content and schedule.--The content and schedule of \n     seminars offered pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be \n     determined by each Federal banking agency and the National \n     Credit Union Administration Board taking into account the \n     resources and examination priorities of such agency.\n       (2) Model approaches.--\n       (A) In general.--Each Federal banking agency and the \n     National Credit Union Administration Board shall make \n     available to each depository institution and insured credit \n     union under the jurisdiction of such agency model approaches \n     to common Year 2000 computer problems, such as model \n     approaches with regard to project management, vendor \n     contracts, testing regimes, and business continuity planning.\n       (B) Variety of approaches.--In developing model approaches \n     to the Year 2000 computer problem pursuant to subparagraph \n     (A), each Federal banking agency and the National Credit \n     Union Administration Board shall take into account the need \n     to develop a variety of approaches to correspond to the \n     variety of depository institutions or credit unions within \n     the jurisdiction of the agency.\n       (3) Cooperation.--In carrying out this section, the Federal \n     banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration \n     Board may cooperate and coordinate their activities with each \n     other, the Financial Institutions Examination Council, and \n     appropriate organizations representing depository \n     institutions and credit unions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President. I am very pleased to join with Senator \nBennett to introduce the ``Examination Parity and Year 2000 Readiness \nFor Financial Institutions Act.'' This legislation, while technical in \nnature, will provide badly needed authority and guidance to Federal \nfinancial regulators to help their supervised institutions cope with \nthe Year 2000 computer problem.\n  The Year 2000--or Y2K--computer problem is caused by the inability of \nmost of the major financial systems to process the year 2000 as the one \nthat follows the year 1999. This is caused by the fact that basic \ncomputer code, much of it written as many as thirty years ago, reads \ndates as two-digits, ``98'' or ``99,'' instead of four digits ``1999'' \nor ``2000.'' If left untreated, computers will read the year 2000 as \nthe years 1900, 1980 or some other default date. The result is not only \nerroneous calculations, but the total crash of many critical financial \nsystems.\n  Federal financial regulators have been very active, of late, in \nhelping their supervised institutions prepare for this extremely \ndangerous problem. However, both the Office of Thrift Supervision and \nthe National Credit Union Administration have notified Senator Bennett \nand I that they lack the authority to examine the Year 2000 \npreparations of service providers to thrifts and credit unions. \nCurrently, other federal financial regulators--the Federal Reserve, \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation--have this authority.\n  These service providers perform many of the key transaction and data \nprocessing for federally-insured thrifts and credit unions, \nparticularly smaller institutions for whom it is not cost-effective to \nestablish their own computer systems. As a result, it is imperative to \nthe safety and soundness of these institutions for the regulators to be \nable to establish that their service providers will be Year 2000 \ncompliant.\n  The legislation also contains provisions that require all financial \nregulators to hold seminars to educate their respective supervised \ninstitutions and, to the maximum extent possible, provide model \nsolutions for fixing the problem. The beneficial impact of such \noutreach and education efforts for federally-insured institutions is \nself-evident.\n  Mr. President, the Year 2000 problem is one that we will have to \nconfront in many more ways than this legislation. The extent of the \nproblem goes well beyond the financial services industry to affect \nvirtually every segment of our nation's economy. But this sensible bill \nis a good first step to ensuring that Federal financial regulators have \nthe tools necessary to address the problem in their area of \njurisdiction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1672. A bill to expand the authority of the Secretary of the Army \nto improve the control of erosion on the Missouri River; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             the missouri river erosion control act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to introduce the \nMissouri River Erosion Control Act of 1998, a bill to provide much-\nneeded assistance to homeowners who live along the Missouri River. Over \nthe past several years, many South Dakotans have seen property values \ndrop and homes nearly destroyed by shoreline erosion. This legislation \nwill help these families to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nto take responsible steps to prevent these problems. My colleague, \nSenator Johnson, is joining me as an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  While erosion occurs naturally on any river, shorelines on the \nMissouri are particularly vulnerable to it. Releases from the \nhydroelectric dams that span the river in South Dakota cause its depth \nand speed to fluctuate drastically, sometimes with dangerous \nconsequences. Following last year's flooding disaster, the rapid, \nswirling current caused by sustained high releases from the dams swept \naway half an acre of land near Burbank, South Dakota, in just 3 hours. \nA subsequent release destroyed an additional 40 feet of land, bringing \nthe river's edge to the foundation of the home of Neil and Eileen \nHelvig. Thanks to last minute work by the Corps of Engineers to \nstabilize the shoreline, the Helvig's home, and several others nearby, \nwere saved. However, this is not the only case when bank erosion has \nposed a threat to residential homes and without a comprehensive program \nin place to provide help to others in need, we may not be so lucky in \nthe future.\n  Over the last several years, Mrs. Lois Hyde of rural Lake Andes has \nwatched the river work its way to within a stone's throw of her home--\nan original homestead first settled by her family over 100 years ago. \nWithout additional help, it is likely that she may be forced to abandon \nher farm. I believe it is our responsibility to give individuals like \nher the help they need to protect their homes.\n  The Missouri River Erosion Control Act of 1998 will give homeowners \nthe opportunity to take responsible steps to protect their property. \nThe bill amends current law to permit homeowners to work in partnership \nwith the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take steps to stabilize their \nshoreline. Under the my bill, the Corps of Engineers will accept \napplications from private property owners along the Missouri River and \nrank those applications in order of need. The most vulnerable stretches \nof the shoreline would then be targeted for assistance. Like other \nerosion control programs, the bill requires a 35 percent non-federal \ncost share, while the federal government will provide the other 65 \npercent of the cost.\n  For many years the Corps of Engineers has been reluctant to work with \nprivate property owners to prevent damage to private property from \nerosion. Nevertheless, new circumstances require new thinking. \nParticularly in the wake of last year's disaster in South Dakota, \ncircumstances have made it clear that we must help families take the \nsteps they need to protect their homes. Homeowners want to take \nresponsible measures to protect their property. We must give them that \nopportunity. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1672\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I would like to speak on \nreauthorization of the highway bill. I respectfully urge the Majority \nLeader to take up Senate Bill 1173--ISTEA--now. Let's not delay its \nconsideration into the spring.\n  The State's highway programs are already operating under a temporary \nfunding extension. I believe that further delaying consideration of S. \n1173 will add more uncertainty to the States' highway construction.\n  As I mentioned, before this body adjourned last November, we passed a \ntemporary extension of the highway bill, after repeated attempts to \nbegin debate on the bill failed.\n  It now appears that floor consideration of S. 1173 may be delayed \nuntil after the Senate considers the Fiscal Year 1999 Budget \nResolution.\n  I am second to no Member in my commitment to a balanced federal \nbudget. However, I believe that we must also follow through on our \ncommitment to quality infrastructure, and these two objectives are by \nno means mutually exclusive.\n  The current funding extension expires on March 31. That means that \nall federal highway funds will be cut off on May 1. Clearly, prompt \naction on ISTEA is critical to maintaining the flow of federal highway \ndollars.\n  Unlike delays last fall, however, these spring delays for ISTEA will \noccur in the middle of construction season. This will compound the \ndisruptive effects of this halt on highway projects--and the jobs they \nsupport--around the country.\n  In the northern States, it is critical that construction funding \nflows at this time of year. The window for road construction work in \nmany areas is limited by weather factors during the winter months.\n  Many states, including my own, have highway construction projects \nunderway that are designed to reduce traffic congestion. This \ncongestion worsens air quality, causes ``road rage,'' increases wear \nand tear on vehicles, wastes fuel, and robs American businesses and \nfamilies of valuable time.\n  Cutting off crucial federal funds for these projects undermines State \nefforts to deal with their congestion problems.\n  It is very unfortunate that highway fatalities continue to rise. By \nFederal Highway Administration estimates, poor road maintenance may \ncontribute to as many as 30 percent of fatal accidents, resulting in \nthousands of deaths per year. Safety-related highway work faces \nstoppage if we delay consideration of ISTEA.\n  In fact, in North Carolina, 300 million dollars in safety projects \nmay be delayed if federal funds are not approved.\n  I want to emphasize that these funds come from gas taxes collected \nevery time Americans pull up to the pump. This ``user fee'' arrangement \nis supposed to ensure that these taxes pay for improving their \nhighways.\n  Mr. President, 31\\1/2\\ billion dollars in gas taxes are collected \neach year, of which about 20 billion dollars actually goes towards \nhighways. Even as we delay consideration of S. 1173, Americans pay \ntheir gas taxes in the belief that much-needed highway improvements \nwill be funded.\n  Looking at the legislative calendar between now and May 1, when \nfederal highway funds will dry up, there are 41 legislative days \nincluding Mondays and Fridays.\n  Even after we debate and pass a bill in the Senate, we have a \nconference report to complete.\n  Other issues are sure to be considered here, including potential \nmilitary conflict with Iraq, IRS restructuring, campaign finance \nreform, and the budget resolution. That will take us well into April at \nbest.\n  If we do not act on S. 1173 now, a lapse in federal highway funding \nis a virtual certainty. The presence of other important matters on the \ncalendar only increases the importance of bringing up the Highway bill.\n  This is our obligation. It is our obligation to the millions of \nmotorists who pay gas taxes, and the contractors, subcontractors and \nemployees working on highway projects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/24/senate-section/article/S941-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RED CEDAR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I would like to enter into the \nRecord an amazing story of heroism and courage. Faced with the threat \nof severe injury to his 4-year-old brother, Michael, Christopher \nSimmons, an 8-year-old from Mt. Vernon, Illinois, boldly placed himself \nbetween his brother and a 95-pound dog. In doing so, Christopher \ndemonstrated a profound sense of selflessness that is all too rarely \nreported. His heroism, as described in an article in the Mt. Vernon \nRegister-News, was quite possibly the only thing that saved his younger \nbrother from serious bodily harm.\n  On April 6, 1997, as the boys' father, Phillip Simmons, spoke with \nthe dog's owner, Christopher noticed the boxer playfully tugging at \nMichael's jacket. Suddenly, the dog lunged for the 4-year-old's throat. \nChristopher, without the slightest hesitation, stepped in front of the \nattacking dog and kicked it in the left eye. The dog, startled \nmomentarily, became more angry and jumped onto Christopher, clawing and \nbiting his chest. Fortunately, Christopher's quick thinking gave his \nfather enough time to come to his aid, removing the dog from the boy's \nchest and subduing it until the owner arrived.\n  Christopher received two chest wounds and lost a significant amount \nof blood. Michael, now 5 years old, needed surgery to repair a wounded \njaw and a severely damaged ear. The dog's teeth barely missed nerves \nthat help control the movements of the eyes and the jaw. If the dog had \nbeen able to do more harm to Michael, the little boy may not have \nsurvived.\n  This horrible incident had one positive consequence: Christopher will \nbe in Washington next month to represent 2.1 million Cub Scouts as he \npresents President Clinton with the Scouts' annual Report to the \nNation. I am pleased to have this opportunity to join President Clinton \nin honoring Christopher for his tremendous heroism and outstanding \ncourage. I ask that the Mt. Vernon Register-News article describing \nChristopher Simmons' act of heroism be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From the Mount Vernon Register-News, Feb. 2, 1998]\n\n    Mt. Vernon Youth Who Saved Brother From Dog To Meet With Clinton\n\n       MT. VERNON--A young boy who stepped between his 4-year-old \n     brother and a 95-pound attacking dog is being rewarded for \n     his bravery with a meeting with President Clinton.\n       Christopher Simmons, 8, has been chosen to represent the \n     nation's 2.1 million Cub Scouts in presenting scouting's \n     yearly Report to the Nation in the Oval Office next month.\n       His bravery also earned him the Scouts' rare Honor Medal, \n     ``for unusual heroism in saving or attempting to save life at \n     considerable risk to self.'' Only 42 such medals were earned \n     last year by the nation's 4.5 million Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts \n     and Explorers.\n       Christopher's story began last April 6 when his dad, \n     Phillip, took along Christopher, then 7, and his brother, \n     Michael, to help the dog's owner with some yard work.\n       Phillip Simmons was chatting with the man, who is in his \n     80s, when he saw the dog shaking Michael by his coat. The \n     boxer then released its grip and aimed for Michael's throat.\n       ``As his jaws closed on Michael's head, Christopher \n     launched a kick that connected with the dog's left eye,'' the \n     father recalled last week. ``The pain further enraged the \n     dog, who instantly turned on Christopher.''\n       As Christopher stepped back, with the dog's paws on his \n     chest and its jaws ripping at his coat, the momentary \n     diversion gave Simmons time to reach his sons.\n       ``I jumped on him and kicked him,'' Christopher, a third-\n     grader at St. Mary's School, recalled last week at his home \n     here. ``Then he jumped on me. By that time my dad was there. \n     I pulled my brother out of reach of the dog.''\n       Seizing the dog by one ear, Phillip Simmons rammed his fist \n     down the animal's throat and held him against a car.\n       ``As the dog struggled, I looked back to see Michael \n     standing frozen in a pool of blood, still within reach of the \n     dog if he got loose,'' the father recalled.\n       ``Chris, even though bleeding from two sets of chest \n     wounds, had the presence of mind to pull Michael out of range \n     of the boxer so I could release the dog,'' Phillip Simmons \n     added. ``There is no doubt that if it had not been for \n     Christopher's quick thinking and action, I would have lost my \n     4-year-old son.''\n       Michael, now 5, had to have surgery on his jaw and dangling \n     left ear. Physicians stitched along a crease so that the ear \n     would heal with no visible damage. The boxer's teeth barely \n     missed a nerve that controls the eye and another that \n     controls the jaw.\n       A typically lively 5-year-old, Michael seems to have few \n     emotional scars, though his parents say he is very afraid of \n     dogs.\n       The dog had no history of harming or threatening anyone.\n       Instead of insisting the dog be killed, the Simmons family \n     agreed to allow the boxer to be sent to a breeding farm where \n     children were not allowed. The dog has since died.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/24/senate-section/article/S942-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S942-S943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JACK VAN HOOSER\n\n Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, at the end of this month, Jack Van \nHooser the Commissioner for Rehabilitation Services for the State of \nTennessee is retiring after thirty-five years of dedicated service. \nThroughout his career, Jack has been a tireless servant of the State of \nTennessee and has worked to empower individuals with disabilities to \nachieve independence and gain employment.

The Chair announces on behalf of the majority \nleader, pursuant to Public Law 105-134, his appointment of the \nfollowing individuals to serve as members of the Amtrak Reform Council: \nGilbert E. Carmichael, of Mississippi, Joseph Vranich, of Pennsylvania, \nand Paul M. Weyrich, of Virginia.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the appointment of \nthree individuals to the Amtrak Reform Council--the ARC: Mr. Gilbert E. \n``Gil'' Carmichael of Mississippi, Mr. Joseph Vranich of Pennsylvania, \nand Mr. Paul M. Weyrich of Virginia. All three have years of rail \ntransportation experience. All three understand and respect Amtrak's \ncontributions to the American economy. All three are truly committed to \ngenuine railroad reform. All three will serve for five years. All three \nwill examine the fiscal performance of Amtrak.\n  Each of these appointees bring many years of experience to this \nchallenging railroad issue. Each brings his own particular approach to \nthis transportation job.\n  I've known Mr. Gil Carmichael for many years. He is a dedicated \npublic servant who has already served our nation as Federal Railroad \nAdministrator for President Bush and served four years on the Amtrak \nBoard of Directors. He also has an impressive depth and breadth of \nknowledge on all facets of transportation--it was Gil who sponsored the \nfirst World Railways Congress. It brought together senior rail \nofficials from around the world. so Gil knows the rail business from \nthe bottom up, and he brings to the ARC that good old every-day, common \nsense approach that we Mississippians are so proud of.\n  Mr. Joseph Vranich helped create Amtrak while serving as the \nExecutive Director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers. \nHe is a specialist on high-speed train travel, and literally wrote the \nbook on so-called ``Supertrains.'' Just late last year, he published \nthe most important new book on railroads, ``Derailed: What Went Wrong \nand What to Do About America's Passenger Trains.'' Mr. Vranich brings \nto the ARC a broad vision of passenger rail service, what it was, what \nit was meant to be, what it can be.\n  And Mr. Paul Weyrich has over 30 years of experience with rail and \nmass transit issues. He also served on the Amtrak Board of Directors \nduring the Bush administration, and has published numerous works on the \nsubject. Mr. Weyrich brings the hard-boiled sensibilities of a \nnewspaperman of the old school, a newspaperman good at digging for the \nfacts. Just the facts for the ARC.\n  The selection of these three reflects my desire to bring managerial \nexpertise to Amtrak's oversight. The ARC will ensure that Amtrak spends \nthe taxpayers' money wisely. The ARC's first loyalty will be to the \nAmerican taxpay--not to the nostalgic sound of passenger trains going \ndown the tracks.\n  Gil, Joe and Paul are executives who will take a good, hard look at \nAmtrak, and I expect them to exercise courage and leadership. The ARC \nhas the responsibility to offer sound judgment as they advise both the \nAdministration and the Congress.\n  I have no doubt the ARC will have a key role in shaping Amtrak's \nfuture.\n  I'm pleased to announce that today the Speaker will also identify his \nthree selections. These selections together will constitute the \nmajority of the ARC.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues who gave me such a rich \nlist of candidates to select from. The choices were difficult.\n  The Amtrak Board of Directors, the other managerial oversight body \nfor Amtrak is to be renominated this summer. I hope to see new faces, a \nfresh look and a fresh approach. This would help Amtrak successfully \ndeal with the cultural shift required by the new reauthorization \nstatute. The combined synergy of a new board and the ARC will make a \nprofound difference to the way America's passenger rail service will \nenter the next millennium.\n  I look forward to seeing ARC getting started on its important task. \nAmerica's passenger rail service will be well served by the ARC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/24/senate-section/article/S943-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1998\n\n  Mr. BURNS.
