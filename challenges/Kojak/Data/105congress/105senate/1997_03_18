Mr. President, I have not had the opportunity to come to \nthe floor to talk about the pending matter. I want to devote a little \ntime this morning to the constitutional amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\nHollings. I am a cosponsor of that legislation, and I proudly come to \nthe floor in my advocacy of the passage of his amendment.\n  I give him great credit. He has come to the floor for years \naddressing, in myriad ways, the issue of campaign finance, the problems \nthat we have associated with campaign finance, the difficulties, \nconstitutionally and statutorily, in addressing all of the problems \nthat he has so eloquently outlined now for a long period of time. Year \nafter year, in Congress after Congress, fight after fight, Senator \nHollings has been extraordinary in his effort to address this issue in \na consequential and comprehensive way.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the circumstances that I see facing \nall of us politically right now and my reasons for supporting the \nconstitutional amendment. There are at least four primary reasons why I \nbelieve that the constitutional amendment needs to be addressed. I am \nof the view that statutorily we are incapable of adequately addressing \nevery one of the nuances, every one of the problems that have arisen as \na result of our efforts to address meaningful campaign finance reform \nin the past. I do not have with me the record that we have compiled, \nbut we have spent hours and days and weeks in testimony and in hearings \nover the course of many Congresses grappling with this issue.\n  As I recall, there have been 49 hearings on campaign finance reform. \nThere have been thousands and thousands of pages of reports. There have \nbeen over a score of filibusters on the floor keeping this issue from a \nvote. So the record in the Congress over the last 10 years has really \nbeen abysmal. The problems continue to mount and the circumstances \ncontinue to worsen and the situation involving Members is compounded.\n  In 1976, the total cost of all Federal elections was $310 million. \nThat is total. That is what every House Member, every House candidate, \nevery Senator, every Senate candidate, and every Presidential candidate \nspent--$310 million. In 1996, that amount had exploded--and I use that \nword intentionally--exploded to $2.7 billion. That is $2,100 a day for \na Senate candidate. Every day, whether we generate the money all at \nonce or whether we generate it day by day, we need to raise $2,100 a \nday.\n  Just yesterday I was over at my political office. I have a political \noffice. I have a South Dakota office. I have a leadership office. I \nhave three service offices. But now, without a doubt, one of the most \nimportant parts of any Senate infrastructure is the political office.\n  I was over in my political office yesterday dialing for dollars. I do \nnot know how much I raised, but I made up yesterday for the fact that I \nhad not raised $2,100 every day in the previous weeks.\n  Now the average cost of a Senate campaign is $4.5 million per \nSenator. I am in cycle now. I will be running in 1998. My budget, Mr. \nPresident, is $5 million. I have already indicated that. That is no \nsecret. I will be raising and spending $5 million to be reelected.\n  I have heard colleagues on the Senate floor say, ``Well, you know, \nthe nation spends less than $2.7 billion on dog and cat food, so why \nshould we be worried? We spend a lot more on dog and cat food than we \nspend in political races.''\n  I do not think that is a proper comparison unless we have only 535 \ndogs and cats in this country. If you had 535 dogs and cats, that \ncomparison would work. I tell you, if we were spending $2.7 billion on \n535 designated dogs and cats, my sense is we would be outraged. There \nwould be all kinds of complaints that dog and cat food is way too high. \n``I can't afford to keep a cat or a dog.''\n  How is it we can afford a political process so denigrated today by \npractices that we all abhor that we are willing to spend $4.5 million \nper Senator? So, Mr. President, the cost is something that I think is \nvery clearly an issue that we have to address, because it is only going \nto get worse.\n  We used the increases in campaign costs since 1976 to estimate what \nthe cost of an election will be in the year 2025. Most of us, \nhopefully, will still be around. I will not be here, but I will be, \nhopefully, living. Our sons and daughters will be here seeking public \noffice.\n  Our estimate is that a Senate race will cost $145 million in the year \n2025. Now that is not any magical distortion of the amount. That is \nsimply taking the inflation rate that we have experienced and costing \nit out to the year 2025--$145 million. We will be raising over $200,000 \na day to meet that kind of cost in the year 2025.\n  So do we have a problem? I could rest my case on that alone. But \nthere are other problems that I want to talk about this morning.\n  I have a friend I have known for 20 years, who ran for Congress. He \nis idealistic, has a wonderful family; and is extraordinarily helpful. \nMy friend decided he wanted to run for Congress. He was at that point \nin life when he thought he could offer something. He cared deeply about \nthe issues, and is very, very patriotic, an extraordinary young man in \nall respects.\n  But in order to meet his budget, my friend found himself holed up in \na small cubicle with a desk and a phone calling for money about two-\nthirds to three-fourths of every day. Was he out there greeting the \npeople sharing his ideas? No. Was he out there shaking hands, learning \nfrom the people? No. A campaign, anybody who has been through one will \nrecognize, is really an educational experience.\n  Of course you impart your thoughts. But what I love about campaigns \nis how much you learn in return--the conversations with people in their \nhomes, the opportunity to answer questions and hear concerns at \nRotaries and chambers of commerce, the opportunity to shake hands at a \nplant gate and get comments about what families are thinking about. \nThat education is lost when any candidate spends two-thirds to three-\nfourths of his time doing nothing but dialing for dollars.\n  Wendell Ford, our distinguished colleague who sits right at this \ndesk, said fundraising was a major factor in his determination not to \nrun for reelection. We are going to lose an able public servant. When \nhe was first elected to the Senate in 1974, his campaign cost $450,000. \nBut he estimated he would have to raise $4.5 million for the race in \n1998. He said, ``I don't want to raise $4.5 million in Kentucky. I \ndon't want to have to go through that. I don't think it is right. I \ndon't want to have to sit in some cubicle called a `political office' \nand dial for dollars day after day. I don't want to do that.'' So he is \nhanging it up.\n\n  How many more Wendell Fords, how many more talented public servants \nwill hang it up or will not even start? So, Mr. President, this is a \nvery serious problem from the point of view of candidates themselves--\nRepublican or Democrat.\n  I recruit candidates, and one of the hardest things for me is to \nconvince possible candidates to run knowing they have to raise $4.5 to \n$5.5 million. You go tell some businessman to give up his business, \ngive up his family, give up his dignity, go tell them that ``you ought \nto do that so you can take a seat here in the U.S. Senate.'' Tell them \nthat. Convince them it is in the public interest. Here in the Senate, \nwe have a wonderful opportunity to serve, but to get here you pay a \nheavy price, too heavy in the minds of more and more people. Too many \ngood people are saying no to public life, no to public service because \nthey do not want to do it. Frankly, I do not blame them.\n  In the third category are the implications of the money in the \nsystem. The implications of all of this money troubles me. Every day \nthe front page has yet another story about White House difficulties. \nObviously, it is now the subject of an investigation in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and the Justice Department.\n  We are looking at all of that. We on the Democratic side have felt \nthat many of the abuses the Republicans may be guilty of have not \nreceived adequate attention.\n  The media seem honed in on everything that happened in the White \nHouse. As a colleague has reminded me on several occasions, ``Why hunt \nrabbits when you can hunt bear?'' Well, there are some elephants that \nought to be hunted, I think, given the circumstances.\n  There were reports in the Washington Post on January 23, 1997; the \nWall Street Journal on January 9; Business Week on December 30, 1996; \nRoll Call on January 20, 1997; Inside Congress on December 20, 1996, \nthat Republican leaders--including Republican National Committee \nChairman Haley Barbour, Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Tom\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\nDeLay, and John Boehner--summoned business leaders to a dinner to \nchastise them for donating money to Democrats and suggest that if they \ncontinue to do so, they would no longer have access to Republican \nleaders.\n  This is a quote--`` `Companies that want to have it both ways,' said \none top GOP strategist, `no longer will be involved in Republican \ndecisionmaking or invited to our cocktail parties.' They also demanded \nthat the company fire all of its Democratic lobbyists and replace them \nwith Republicans. A GOP leadership insider said, `If companies send \nlobbyists to Republican offices, they will have GOP credentials or they \nwon't be allowed in the room.' NRCC Chairman John Linder said, `We're \ngoing to track where the money goes.' ''\n  Mr. President, what does that mean? What are the implications of \n``money''? What do they mean when they say business leaders who \ncontribute to Democrats will no longer be involved in Republican \ndecisionmaking?\n  Here's another passage from Roll Call, October 30, 1995.\n\n       Upon winning control of the 104th Congress, Congressman \n     John Boehner, chair of the House Republican Conference, \n     organized a leadership/lobbyist operation to help pass the \n     Republicans' budget plan. Business lobbyists contributed at \n     least $2,000 toward an advertising campaign to support the \n     Republican budget. ``In exchange, they got a seat in the \n     inner circle that met every Monday in one of the Capitol's . \n     . . meeting rooms.''\n\n  So $2,000 for a seat in the inner circle meeting every Monday in the \nCapitol's meeting rooms.\n  Here's another example from Time magazine, March 27, 1995. Mr. \nBoehner also organized the Thursday group of ``lobbyists representing \nsome of the richest special interests in the country.'' The Republican \nleadership let these lobbyists use congressional office space and \nofficial resources to conduct their bill drafting and lobbying \nactivities. The Thursday group served as command central for a million \ndollar campaign to enact items in the Contract With America. On tort \nreform, the group's efforts included ``daily meetings of dozens of \nlobbyists on the seventh floor of the Longworth House Office Building, \na budget of several million dollars raised under the guidance of a \nGeneral Motors executive, and a vote-counting operation that was led by \nformer top lobbyists for Ronald Reagan and George Bush.''\n  Here is yet another example, this time from the Washington Post and \nLegal Times, dated October 29, 1996, and September 16, 1996, \nrespectively: ``Gingrich ally and foreign agent Grover Norquist's \nAmericans for Tax Reform received a $4.6 million contribution from the \nRNC in October,'' 1 month before the election, ``in October 1996 * * * \nthe RNC contributed $4.6 million to the tax-exempt Americans for Tax \nReform, which is headed by Gingrich ally Grover Norquist. Because it is \nnot structured as a political committee, ATR is not required to \ndisclose how it spends the money, as the RNC is. This $4.6 million in \n`soft money' could be used by ATR directly on behalf of federal \ncandidates--which would be scored as `hard money' if spent by the RNC. \nGrover Norquist is a close ally of Gingrich and is also registered as a \nforeign agent for the Republic of Seychelles, and Jonas Savimbi, rebel \nleader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.''\n  Mr. President I could go on and on.\n  Perhaps I will end with this one just received yesterday: 1997 RNC \nAnnual Gala, May 13, 1997. Cochairman--for a $250,000 fundraising \nrequirement, you get ``Breakfast and a Photo Opportunity with Senate \nMajority Leader Trent Lott and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on \nMay 13, 1997.'' You get a luncheon with ``Republican Senate and House \nleadership and the Republican Senate and House Committee Chairmen of \nyour choice.''\n  I am still reading from the document. You get a luncheon with the \nchairmen of your choice if you are willing to donate $250,000. If you \nonly donate $100,000, you still get a luncheon with the chairmen of \nyour choice, and you still get a breakfast and photo opportunity with \n``Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Speaker of the House Newt \nGingrich.'' You do not get dais seating. For $45,000, amazingly, you \nare still entitled to lunch with the chairmen of your choice.\n  Mr. President, we do not need that. We do not need that in this \ninstitution or in our political system. This has to end. This will not \ngo on without ultimately and directly affecting the quality and the \nhistoric standing of this institution.\n  Now let me address the last issue, and that is the constitutional \nissue. Mr. President, I have to say it is the hardest one. It is the \nhardest because there are a lot of people whose judgment I respect who \nare not willing to go as far as I am. But it is hard for me to \nunderstand what the Supreme Court said in Buckley versus Valeo. On the \none hand, they said it is all right to limit how much you give; on the \nother hand, it is not all right to limit how much you spend. Why? If we \nare worried about free speech, why is it appropriate to limit giving \nbut not limit spending? What is the constitutional premise that allows \nus to say we can limit how much you give, but we cannot limit how much \nyou spend? It seems to me that once they decided to limit how much you \ngive, they set themselves up, as well, for limiting how much you spend.\n  New York University law professor Ronald Dworkin and 40 other \nscholars wrote in a joint statement, ``We believe that the Buckley \ndecision is wrong and should be overturned. The decision did not \ndeclare a valuable principle that we should hesitate to challenge. On \nthe contrary, it misunderstood not only what free speech really is but \nwhat it really means for free people to govern themselves.''\n  The decision in Buckley and Colorado are a threat to the principle of \none person, one vote. There are Senators who disagree, and there are \nmany, many ways with which to express that disagreement. But I will say \nthis: No one is guaranteed free money. Mr. President, free speech is \nnot the same as free money. It is no more right for us to stand up in \nindignation with all of these problems and to say there is no problem, \nor that if there is a problem, we cannot address it because of the free \nspeech argument on this issue.\n  Mr. President, we have limited speech in other ways. We have limited \neven the right of advertising in ways that have been demonstrated to be \nconstitutional. When was the last time you saw a cigarette ad on \ntelevision? When was the last time you saw ads for drugs on television? \nObviously, there are restrictions on free speech. We all know that you \ncannot falsely yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Mr. President, I do \nnot buy the argument that we cannot carefully restrict speech, because \nwe restrict speech all the time.\n  I am out of time, and I know the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia is about to speak as is required by the order. We will return \nto this issue again.\n  Let me close by saying we also know that this legislation, this \namendment, is not going to pass. But we also know that there will be \nanother day. There will be another day to offer bipartisan campaign \nreform legislation from a statutory perspective. I intend to be as \naggressively supportive of that as I can be.\n  Let me say that this issue will not go away, not when our sons and \ndaughters will be spending $145 million in the year 2025 just to walk \nin this door and vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11 a.m. \nhas arrived. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized to speak up \nto 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I commend our leader who \nhas just spoken. I agree with him, as I shall elaborate at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2377-8", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2379-S2382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE HOLLINGS CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Ralph Waldo Emerson, in an oration delivered on August 31, \n1867, said:\n\n       This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but \n     know what to with it.\n\n  ``This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but know what \nto do with it.''\n  As the Senate considers the proposed constitutional amendment offered \nby our distinguished colleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, \nit is my fervent hope that each of us takes heed of Emerson's \nportentous words.\n  We have an opportunity to take an important step in the direction of \nrestoring the people's faith in our ability\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\nto rise above partisanship and really do something about our present \nsystem of financing Federal campaigns. It is rotten. It is putrid. It \nstinks. The danger, as always, is that we will ``circle the wagons,'' \nand avoid taking legal action aimed at meaningful reform.\n  Mr. President, as each day dawns, the public is confronted with new \nand increasingly garish allegations concerning the campaign financing \npractices that have become a way of life in our Nation.\n  Mr. President, we may be able to fool ourselves, but the time has \ncome for all of us to stop trying to fool the American people. They are \nmore than aware that both political parties--both political parties, \nnot just one--abuse the current system and that both political parties \nfear to change because they don't want to lose their own perceived \nadvantages. One party perceives certain advantages, and the other party \nperceives different advantages to its cause. But the insidious system \nof campaign fundraising and the increasing awareness by the people of \nour unwillingness to change it, will eventually lead to the destruction \nof our very system of Government. For our own sakes and for the sake of \nour people we must find ways to stop this political minuet, and come to \ngrips with the fact that we can't have it both ways. We can't continue \nto launch broadsides at each other and refuse to admit that we all bear \nthe blame--all of us, in both parties. We have it in our power to \nchange things and the excuses we creatively craft to duck that \nresponsibility are utterly hollow and quite transparent.\n  The incessant money chase that currently permeates every crevice of \nour political system is like an unending circular marathon. And it is a \nrace that sends a clear message to the people that it is money--money--\nmoney, not ideas, not principles, but money that reigns supreme in \nAmerican politics. No longer are candidates judged fit for office first \nand foremost by their positions on the issues. No longer are they \njudged by their experience and their capabilities. Instead, potential \ncandidates are judged by their ability to raise the millions, and tens \nof millions of dollars, and even hundreds of millions of dollars that \nit takes to run an effective campaign.\n  The average cost of a U.S. Senate race is $4.5 million. When I first \nran for the U.S. Senate in 1958, I ran with Jennings Randolph, as the \ntwo candidates for the Senate. We were two candidates for two different \nSenate seats from West Virginia. Jennings Randolph ran for the 2-year \nterm, the unexpired term of the late Matthew Mansfield Neely. I ran for \nthe 6-year term. Each of us won the nomination, and then after the \nprimary we joined together and we marshaled our monetary forces, which \namounted to something like $50,000--$50,000 for two Senators. And that \nwas more than had earlier been necessary in campaigns in West Virginia. \nWe didn't have much television in those days. We didn't have political \nconsultants. And so we ran on a war chest of $50,000. But the average \ncost of a U.S. Senate race today is $4.5 million. It can cost $10 \nmillion or $20 million or more to run for the Senate in some parts of \nthe country today.\n  Now, how in the future can a poor boy from back in the sticks of West \nVirginia, or any other State, hope to become a United States Senator? \nHow can a former welder in a shipyard, a former meatcutter in a coal \nmining community, a former produce salesman, a former groceryman--how \ncan one hope to ascend the ladder to the high office of United States \nSenator? It will be beyond the means of such persons.\n  The American people believe that the way to gain access and influence \non Capitol Hill is through money. And the American people are exactly \nright. The way to gain access on Capitol Hill, the way to get the \nattention of Members of this body is through money. The Bible says, \n``The love of money is the root of all evil.'' This campaign system \nthat we now have bears that out.\n  Anyone who reads the daily newspaper would have no trouble coming to \nthe conclusion that the best way to gain access to the White House is \nto be a so-called ``fat cat contributor.'' Now, who can fault such \nlogic? It is as plain as the nose on your face. We have to stop this \nmadness. We must put an end to the seemingly limitless escalation of \ncampaign costs and their pervasive influence of the special interests \nand the wealthy. We must act to put the United States Senate, the House \nof Representatives, and the Presidency of the United States back within \nthe reach of anyone with the brains, the spirit, the guts, and the \ndesire to want to serve. And the proposed constitutional amendment \nbefore us today is a necessary step on the way to accomplishing that \ngoal.\n  Now, I am aware that opponents of this measure--and they have a right \nto their opinion--would say that it would be wrong to amend the \nConstitution in this fashion. They will say that, although I may be \nright about the need for change in our current fundraising system, I am \njust wrong about this proposed amendment. I am very reluctant to amend \nthe Constitution, but I am not above amending it. The Constitution \ncontains a provision, as we all know, that was included by the framers \nof that document that points the way and is the guide, the roadmap to \namending the Constitution. It is well known that I believe that we \ntinker with the careful checks and balances of that document at our \nperil. But a Supreme Court decision in Buckley versus Valeo, a decision \nwhich I believe to be flawed, has all but doomed the prospects for \ncomprehensive legislative reform of this campaign finance system \notherwise. By equating campaign expenditures with free speech, Buckley \nversus Valeo has made it impossible for us to control the ever-\nspiraling money chase and to put anything but voluntary spending limits \non Federal campaigns. This basic inflexibility makes any legislation \nintended to control the cancerous effects of too much money in politics \ncomplicated and convoluted. The contortions such legislation has to \nresort to, simply because we cannot mandate spending limits, create new \nopportunities for abuse as fast as we attempt to close down the old \nones.\n\n  How do we pass any statute--any statute of consequence, that is--when \nthe Supreme Court has told us that spending equals speech? Spending \nequals speech. Well, if that is the case, I don't have the equality of \nfree speech that many Members in this body profess.\n  How do we place any kind of reasonable limit on fundraising and \nspending when the law of the land says that to do so violates the first \namendment of the Constitution? How do we end $40 million Senate \ncampaigns and $400 million Presidential campaigns when the Supreme \nCourt tells us that those amounts are constitutionally protected? How \ndo we really reform the system within the bounds of that judicial \ninterpretation? The plain truth is that it cannot be done effectively \nunless we do amend the Constitution.\n  We can tinker around the edges, of course. But we cannot enact \ncomprehensive legislation that will get at the heart of the problem. We \ncannot, consistent with the Court's ruling in Buckley versus Valeo, put \nan end to the hundreds of millions of dollars that are raised in ``soft \nmoney'' contributions, or the hundreds of millions of dollars that are \nspent through so-called ``independent expenditures.'' I wish we could. \nBut the fact is that we cannot get the kind of legislation we really \nneed unless we first pass an amendment to the Constitution which \nnullifies Buckley versus Valeo.\n  We have heard the first amendment invoked in Buckley. We have heard \nthe argument that we must not infringe upon freedom of speech. I \nbelieve that a continued failure to control campaign costs is actually \nwhat is injurious to free speech for all in political campaigns. Money \nhas become the great ``unequalizer''--the great ``unequalizer''--in \npolitical campaigns. Money talks. Money talks, and a lot of money talks \nlouder than a little money. Would anyone claim that the average citizen \nor the small contributor has the same access to, the same influence \nwith, politicians as the major contributor or the big PAC \nrepresentative? Well, take it from me, he doesn't. Whose opinions are \nheard? Whose free speech is heard? Whose ``speech\" gets through to the \npeople who count in Washington?\n  In the case of elections, who is more likely to win but the candidate \nwho can buy more TV time, the candidate who can afford more publicity, \na bigger staff? So much for free speech. When it comes to our political \nsystem, speech is very, very, very expensive indeed.\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\n  In a very real sense, Buckley versus Valeo disenfranchised those of \nmoderate and less than moderate means from having their views heard and \nweighted equally with those who can afford to contribute huge sums.\n  Who would stand here on the floor and tell me that the money that a \npoor coal miner is able to contribute will entitle that coal miner to \nthe same freedom of speech and the same influence with his \nrepresentatives in Washington as the wealthy can enjoy?\n  In a very real sense, Buckley versus Valeo, as I say, disenfranchised \nthose of moderate means, the individual who works with his hands, who \nearns his bread by the sweat of his brow. He can't speak loudly enough \nto be heard in the corridors of his representatives in Washington.\n  The influence of money has completely contorted the intent of the \nfirst amendment when it comes to our political system. And Buckley \nversus Valeo has written that contortion into our organic law.\n  Additionally, Buckley versus Valeo further disenfranchised those who \nmight endeavor to run for political office because it makes it \npractically impossible for most individuals to afford to run for office \nthemselves unless they are either independently wealthy or a well-\nfinanced incumbent. What is that but an effective denial of the basic \nright of any capable, motivated citizen to stand for Federal office? \nAnd what is that but the setting up of classes of citizens, some of \nwhom have more basic rights, some of whom have more freedom of speech \nbecause they have more money than others? It is nonsensical.\n  I believe that the Court in recent years, beginning with Buckley \nversus Valeo, has been far too dogmatic when it comes to the first \namendment. First amendment rights are not absolute. Ever since Mr. \nJustice Holmes wrote that the right of freedom of speech does not \ninclude the right to falsely shout ``fire''--it is all right to shout \n``fire'' in a crowded theater if there is a fire. So there is a \ndistinction. The right of freedom of speech does not include the right \nto falsely shout ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Ever since Mr. Justice \nHolmes wrote that, we have realized that there must and can be certain \nlimitations on free speech. Certainly when there is a compelling \nGovernment interest in the prevention of corruption or the appearance \nof corruption, the Court has generally understood that limitations can \nbe imposed. There could be few instances in which a compelling \ngovernmental interest in preventing corruption is more obvious than the \nexample of the bedrock of our representative democracy--fair elections.\n  As the Court said in Gibney versus Empire Storage and Ice Co., ''. . \n. It has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom of speech or press \nto make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in \npart initiated, evidenced or carried out by means of language, spoken, \nwritten or printed.''\n  So, Mr. President, when it comes to modern political campaigns, it is \nonly when there are no mandated expenditure limits that an inequality \nin free speech arises. The only real way to correct that inequity is to \nmandate limits on campaign expenditures. If the rules of the game are \nequal for all and fair to all, then no one is at a disadvantage simply \nbecause of purchasing power.\n  Mr. Hollings' amendment would begin to correct the mechanistic, \nsterile jurisprudence that has reared its head in recent Court \ndecisions regarding the first amendment and set us on a more correct \ncourse. The various ingenious forms of modern campaigning with their \noutlandish expenditures were never contemplated by James Madison and \nthe other framers of the Constitution--never contemplated.\n  Only a blatant disregard for the obscene disadvantage which money can \nconvey when not controlled in a political campaign could cause one to \nturn a blind eye to the need to respond to violence done to our \nRepublic by a continued failure to put some limitations on campaign \nexpenditures.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to stop. We have tried the \nlegislative course. When I was majority leader during the 100th \nCongress, I tried eight times--eight times--to break a filibuster \nagainst campaign spending reform.\n  Robert Bruce, the great leader of the Scots, tried seven times, and \nit was after the seventh time--as he had lain in the loft of a barn and \nseen the spider attempt to spin his web from rafter to rafter, it was \non the seventh time that the spider was successful in reaching the \nrafter--we are told that gave Robert Bruce the spirit and the \ninspiration and the faith he could try the seventh time and win. Well, \nI tried eight times. I was not successful in breaking the filibuster. I \ntried more times to invoke cloture than any leader has ever tried. It \nwould not work. It is not going to work the next time.\n  The time has come to stop. It is time to set aside the partisan \nbickering, the constant sniping, the ceaseless one-upmanship, and the \nincessant covering, and do something that will give us the powers \nnecessary to get at the root of the problem. Hiding behind the first \namendment will not work. If we continue to try to hide behind the first \namendment, we are going to destroy the trust of the people in our \nGovernment, in our system of Government. That is a system that is based \non the people's trust.\n  It is not valid to hide behind the first amendment. This is about \nallowing more freedom of speech than less. It is about returning \nGovernment to the man in the street, to the woman who rocks the cradle \nand makes a home. Give them freedom of speech. It is about returning \nGovernment to that man and that woman and getting it out of the \ncorporate boardrooms and the country clubs.\n  Fear is a very terrible thing. It is terrible because it paralyzes. \nFear clouds judgment. Fear of losing advantage is what has driven both \nparties' reluctance to enact meaningful campaign finance reform in the \npast, and that same fear is what is driving the current reluctance. But \nthe fixation with maintaining advantage is blinding us to a much \ngreater and more serious peril: the total loss of credibility. \nCredibility is a precious commodity. We politicians have collectively \nsquandered our credibility over the last several years because of the \nunchecked rise of the influence of money in politics. Already our \npeople do not vote. They do not vote because they think politicians are \nall the same and that an individual vote does not matter anymore. \nPoliticians are not trusted because all that concerns them, at least to \nthe perception of the average citizen, is money and winning the next \nelection.\n  I served as majority leader from the years 1977 through 1980 and \nagain in the years 1987 and 1988, and I served as minority leader \nduring the 6 years in between. It was a constant problem to be a leader \nand to program the Senate and to operate the Senate, and became \nincreasingly a problem because of the money needs, the needs of the \nmoney chase. Senators had to go here; they had to go there; they had to \nraise money; they had to go for lunch; they had to go for dinner; they \nhad to spend overnight. And it was virtually impossible to schedule \nvotes at any time that would please any and everybody.\n  The thing that seemed to be most needful in this Senate during those \nyears that I was the leader of my party was money, running around the \ncountry with a tin cup in one's hand raising money for a little, measly \n$134,000-a-year job. It is the most demeaning aspect of our lives as \nSenators, to have to run around and raise money. And it is getting \nworse.\n  The very fiber of what holds a Republic like ours together--trust--is \nripping audibly with each new scandal, each new revelation in the \npress. And so I ask my colleagues to turn away from that course. We can \nstart today. We can use what appears to be a low point in American \npolitics to take an important step toward the good. We can remove this \nobstacle to real reform, crafted by a wrongheaded Supreme Court \ndecision, and restore some precious equality to our political system.\n\n  Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, who is our leader in this effort. We probably won't win \ntoday. But it will be to the American people's loss. ``This is a good \ntime,'' as Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ``if only we know what to do with \nit.'' Let us not squander an opportunity to begin to fix this \nthoroughly rotten campaign finance system once and for all. Let us not \ncontinue to disappoint the American people out there.\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to take a stand and support this proposed \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2379-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S.J. Res. 18, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (Senate Joint Resolution 18) proposing \n     an amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     relating to contributions and expenditures intended to affect \n     elections.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 1 hour equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina [Mr. Hollings].\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me first thank Senator Byrd our \nresident Senate historian. I do not say that lightly--because the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia has been masterful in his \nanalysis and been very, very cautious and careful. He has stood many a \ntime for not amending the Constitution, that we don't do this, willy-\nnilly, for any and every problem. But, after 20 years, thousands of \nspeeches and hours and effort made, he has given a very masterful \nanalysis of the need for this amendment. The Senate and the Nation are \nindebted to him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd, of \nConnecticut, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, although I commend the efforts of the \nminority leader and others seeking to statutorily reform our campaign \nfinance laws, I am convinced the only way to solve the chronic problems \nsurrounding campaign financing is reverse the Supreme Court's flawed \ndecision in Buckley versus Valeo by adopting a constitutional amendment \ngranting Congress the right to limit campaign spending.\n  We all know the score--we are hamstrung by that decision and the ever \nincreasing cost of a competitive campaign. With the total cost for \ncongressional elections, just general elections, skyrocketing from $403 \nmillion in 1990 to over $626 million in 1996, the need for limits on \ncampaign expenditures is more urgent than ever. For nearly a quarter of \na century, Congress has tried to tackle runaway campaign spending with \nbills aimed at getting around the disjointed Buckley decision. Again \nand again, Congress has failed.\n  Let us resolve not to repeat the mistakes of past campaign finance \nreform efforts, which have become bogged down in partisanship as \nDemocrats and Republicans each tried to gore the other's sacred cows. \nDuring the 103d Congress there was a sign that we could move beyond \nthis partisan bickering, when the Senate in a bipartisan fashion \nexpressed its support for a constitutional amendment to limit campaign \nexpenditures. In May 1993, a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nwas agreed to which advocated the adoption of a constitutional \namendment empowering Congress and States to limit campaign \nexpenditures.\n  Now it is time to take the next step. We must strike the decisive \nblow against the anything-goes fundraising and spending tolerated by \nboth political parties. Looking beyond the current headlines regarding \nthe source of these funds, the massive amount of money spent is \nastonishing and serves only to cement the commonly held belief that our \nelections are nothing more than auctions and that our politicians are \nup for sale. It is time to put a limit on the amount of money sloshing \naround campaign war chests. It is time to adopt a constitutional \namendment to limit campaign spending--a simple, straightforward, \nnonpartisan solution.\n  As Prof. Gerald G. Ashdown has written in the New England Law Review, \namending the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate campaign \nexpenditures is ``the most theoretically attractive of the approaches-\nto-reform since, from a broad free speech perspective, the decision in \nBuckley is misguided and has worsened the campaign finance \natmosphere.'' Adds Professor Ashdown: ``If Congress could \nconstitutionally limit the campaign expenditures of individuals, \ncandidates, and committees, along with contributions, most of the \ntroubles * * * would be eliminated.''\n  Right to the point, back in 1974, Congress responded to the public's \noutrage over the Watergate scandals by passing, on a bipartisan basis, \na comprehensive campaign finance law. The centerpiece of this reform \nwas a limitation on campaign expenditures. Congress recognized that \nspending limits were the only rational alternative to a system that \nessentially awarded office to the highest bidder or wealthiest \ncandidate.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court overturned these spending limits in \nits infamous Buckley versus Valeo decision of 1976. The Court \nmistakenly equated a candidate's right to spend unlimited sums of money \nwith his right to free speech. In the face of spirited dissents, the \nCourt came to the conclusion that limits on campaign contributions but \nnot spending furthered ``* * * the governmental interest in preventing \ncorruption and the appearance of corruption'' and that this interest \n``outweighs considerations of free speech.''\n  I have never been able to fathom why that same test--the governmental \ninterest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption--\ndoes not overwhelmingly justify limits on campaign spending. The Court \nmade a huge mistake. The fact is, spending limits in Federal campaigns \nwould act to restore the free speech that has been eroded by the \nBuckley decision.\n  After all, as a practical reality, what Buckley says is: Yes, if you \nhave a fundraising advantage or personal wealth, then you have access \nto television, radio and other media and you have freedom of speech. \nBut if you do not have a fundraising advantage or personal wealth, then \nyou are denied access. Instead of freedom of speech, you have only the \nfreedom to say nothing.\n  So let us be done with this phony charge that spending limits are \nsomehow an attack on freedom of speech. As Justice Byron White points \nout, clear as a bell, in his dissent, both contribution limits and \nspending limits are neutral as to the content of speech and are not \nmotivated by fear of the consequences of the political speech in \ngeneral.\n  Mr. President, every Senator realizes that television advertising is \nthe name of the game in modern American politics. In warfare, if you \ncontrol the air, you control the battlefield. In politics, if you \ncontrol the airwaves, you control the tenor and focus of a campaign.\n  Probably 80 percent of campaign communications take place through the \nmedium of television. And most of that TV airtime comes at a dear \nprice. In South Carolina, you're talking between $1,000 and $2,000 for \n30 seconds of primetime advertising. In New York City, it's anywhere \nfrom $30,000 to $40,000 for the same 30 seconds.\n  The hard fact of life for a candidate is that if you're not on TV, \nyou're not truly in the race. Wealthy challengers as well as incumbents \nflushed with money go directly to the TV studio. Those without a \nfundraising advantage or personal wealth are sidetracked to the time-\nconsuming pursuit of cash.\n  The Buckley decision created a double bind. It upheld restrictions on \ncampaign contributions, but struck down restrictions on how much \ncandidates with deep pockets can spend. The Court ignored the practical \nreality that if my opponent has only $50,000 to spend in a race and I \nhave $1 million, then I can effectively deprive him of his speech. By \nfailing to respond to my advertising, my cash-poor opponent will appear \nunwilling to speak up in his own defense.\n\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall zeroed in on this disparity in his dissent \nto Buckley. By striking down the limit on what a candidate can spend, \nJustice Marshall said, ``It would appear to follow that the candidate \nwith a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a \nsignificant head start.''\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\n  Indeed, Justice Marshall went further: He argued that by upholding \nthe limitations on contributions but striking down limits on overall \nspending, the Court put an additional premium on a candidate's personal \nwealth.\n  Justice Marshall was dead right and Ross Perot and Steve Forbes have \nproved it. Massive spending of their personal fortunes immediately made \nthem contenders. Our urgent task is to right the injustice of Buckley \nversus Valeo by empowering Congress to place caps on Federal campaign \nspending. We are all painfully aware of the uncontrolled escalation of \ncampaign spending. The average cost of a winning Senate race was $1.2 \nmillion in 1980, rising to $2.9 million in 1984, and skyrocketing to \n$3.1 million in 1986, $3.7 million in 1988, and up to $4.3 in 1996. To \nraise that kind of money, the average Senator must raise over $13,800 a \nweek, every week of his or her 6-year term. Overall spending in \ncongressional races increased from $446 million in 1990 to more than \n$724 million in 1994--almost a 70-percent increase in 4 short years. I \npredict that when the final FEC reports are compiled for 1996, that \nfigure will go even higher.\n  This obsession with money distracts us from the people's business. It \ncorrupts and degrades the entire political process. Fundraisers used to \nbe arranged so they didn't conflict with the Senate schedule; nowadays, \nthe Senate schedule is regularly shifted to accommodate fundraisers.\n  I have run for statewide office 16 times in South Carolina. You \nestablish a certain campaign routine, say, shaking hands at a mill \nshift in Greer, visiting a big country store outside of Belton, and so \non. Over the years, they look for you and expect you to come around. \nBut in recent years, those mill visits and dropping by the country \nstore have become a casualty of the system. There is very little time \nfor them. We're out chasing dollars.\n  During my 1992 reelection campaign, I found myself raising money to \nget on TV to raise money to get on TV to raise money to get on TV. It's \na vicious cycle.\n  I remember Senator Richard Russell saying: ``They give you a 6-year \nterm in this U.S. Senate: two years to be a statesman, the next 2 years \nto be a politician, and the last 2 years to be a demagogue.'' \nRegrettably, we are no longer afforded even 2 years as statesmen. We \nproceed straight to politics and demagoguery right after the election \nbecause of the imperatives of raising money.\n  My proposed constitutional amendment would change all this. It would \nempower Congress to impose reasonable spending limits on Federal \ncampaigns. For instance, we could impose a limit of, say, $800,000 per \nSenate candidate in a small State like South Carolina--a far cry from \nthe millions spent by my opponent and me in 1992. And bear in mind that \ndirect expenditures account for only a portion of total spending. For \ninstance, my 1992 opponent's direct expenditures were supplemented by \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in expenditures by independent \norganizations and by the State and local Republican Party. When you \ntotal up spending from all sources, my challenger and I spent roughly \nthe same amount in 1992.\n\n  And incidentally, Mr. President, let's be done with the canard that \nspending limits would be a boon to incumbents, who supposedly already \nhave name recognition and standing with the public and therefore begin \nwith a built-in advantage over challengers. Nonsense. I hardly need to \nremind my Senate colleagues of the high rate of mortality in upper \nchamber elections. And as to the alleged invulnerability of incumbents \nin the House, I would simply note that well over 50 percent of the \nHouse membership has been replaced since the 1990 elections and just 3 \nweeks ago we swore in 15 new Senators.\n  I can tell you from experience that any advantages of incumbency are \nmore than counterbalanced by the obvious disadvantages of incumbency, \nspecifically the disadvantage of defending hundreds of controversial \nvotes in Congress.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, I submit that once we have overall spending \nlimits, it will matter little whether a candidate gets money from \nindustry groups or from PAC's or from individuals. It is still a \nreasonable amount any way you cut it. Spending will be under control, \nand we will be able to account for every dollar going out.\n  On the issue of PAC's, Mr. President, let me say that I have never \nbelieved that PAC's per se are an evil in the current system. On the \ncontrary, PAC's are a very healthy instrumentality of politics. PAC's \nhave brought people into the political process: nurses, educators, \nsmall business people, senior citizens, unionists, you name it. They \npermit people of modest means and limited individual influence to band \ntogether with others of mutual interest so their message is heard and \nknown.\n  For years we have encouraged these people to get involved, to \nparticipate. Yet now that they are participating, we turn around and \nsay, ``Oh, no, your influence is corrupting, your money is tainted.'' \nThis is wrong. The evil to be corrected is not the abundance of \nparticipation but the superabundance of money. The culprit is runaway \ncampaign spending.\n  To a distressing degree, elections are determined not in the \npolitical marketplace but in the financial marketplace. Our elections \nare supposed to be contests of ideas, but too often they degenerate \ninto megadollar derbies, paper chases through the board rooms of \ncorporations and special interests.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, campaign spending must be brought under \ncontrol. The constitutional amendment Senator Specter and I have \nproposed would permit Congress to impose fair, responsible, workable \nlimits on Federal campaign expenditures and allow States to do the same \nwith regard to State and local elections.\n  Such a reform would have four important impacts. First, it would end \nthe mindless pursuits of ever-fatter campaign war chests. Second, it \nwould free candidates from their current obsession with fundraising and \nallow them to focus more on issues and ideas; once elected to office, \nwe wouldn't have to spend 20 percent of our time raising money to keep \nour seats. Third, it would curb the influence of special interests. And \nfourth, it would create a more level playing field for our Federal \ncampaigns--a competitive environment where personal wealth does not \ngive candidates an insurmountable advantage.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, a word about the advantages of the amend-the-\nConstitution approach that I propose. Recent history amply demonstrates \nthe practicality and viability of this constitutional route. Certainly, \nit is not coincidence that five of the last seven amendments to the \nConstitution have dealt with Federal election issues. In elections, the \nprocess drives and shapes the end result. Election laws can skew \nelection results, whether you're talking about a poll tax depriving \nminorities of their right to vote, or the absence of campaign spending \nlimits giving an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates. These are \nprofound issues which go to the heart of our democracy, and it is \nentirely appropriate that they be addressed through a constitutional \namendment.\n  And let's not be distracted by the argument that the amend-the-\nConstitution approach will take too long. Take too long? We have been \ndithering on this campaign finance issue since the early 1970's, and we \nhaven't advanced the ball a single yard. All-the-while the Supreme \nCourt continues to strike down campaign limit after campaign limit. It \nhas been a quarter of a century, and no legislative solution has done \nthe job.\n  Except for the 27th amendment, the last five constitutional \namendments took an average of 17 months to be adopted. There is no \nreason why we cannot pass this joint resolution, submit it to the \nStates for a vote, and ratify the amendment in time for it to govern \nthe 1998 election. Once passed by the Congress, the joint resolution \ngoes directly to the States for ratification. Once ratified, it becomes \nthe law of the land, and it is a Supreme Court challenge.\n  And, by the way, I reject the argument that if we were to pass and \nratify this amendment, Democrats and Republicans would be unable to \nhammer out a mutually acceptable formula of campaign expenditure \nlimits. A Democratic Congress and Republican President did exactly that \nin 1974, and we can certainly do it again.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will address the campaign finance mess \ndirectly, decisively, and with finality.\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\n The Supreme Court has chosen to ignore the overwhelming importance of \nmedia advertising in today's campaigns. In the Buckley decision, it \nprescribed a bogus if-you-have-the-money-you-can-talk version of free \nspeech. In its place, I urge the Congress to move beyond these \nacrobatic attempts at legislating around the Buckley decision. As we \nhave all seen, no matter how sincere, these plans are doomed to fail. \nThe solution rests in fixing the Buckley decision. It is my hope that \nas the campaign financing debate unfolds, the majority leader will \nprovide us with an opportunity to vote on this resolution--it is the \nonly solution.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to the distinguished colleague from California, \nSenator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized to \nspeak for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to stand with Senator Hollings \nand Senator Byrd and many other Senators today in support of Senate \nJoint Resolution 18. This measure proposes a constitutional amendment \nto allow the Congress to limit the amount of money that is spent on \ncampaigns. I treasure the Constitution of the United States of America \nand never have I stood on the floor of the Congress supporting such a \nmeasure, except for the equal rights amendment and this measure. It is \nvery rare that I stand to amend this Constitution. But we are about to \nlose our democracy. It is that serious. I think what Senator Hollings \nhas come up with here is a way to save this democracy. So, I am so \nproud to be a cosponsor of his measure.\n  Total campaign spending for general election congressional races has \nincreased more than sixfold in the past 20 years. The total amount of \nmoney raised by Republicans and Democrats in 1996 was almost $900 \nmillion. In my own reelection campaign, I believe that it could cost at \nleast $20 million. I come from California. We have 33 million people. \nAnd $20 million would actually be less than what was spent several \nyears ago to win a U.S. Senate seat. It is an unbelievable amount.\n  So it is undeniable that there is an extraordinary amount of money in \npolitical campaigns. The amounts are growing and unfortunately, in my \nview, some partisan observers of our political system do not even see \nit as a problem. I have heard responses such as, ``So what?'' Or, \n``Money is the American way.'' Or ``The problem isn't too much money, \nit is too little money.'' And the most ludicrous I thought, ``We spend \nmore advertising dollars on yogurt than we do on campaigns.'' I \nstrongly disagree with the notion that money in politics is not a \nproblem. It is a serious problem, undermining our democracy, depressing \nvoter turnout, and, frankly, depressing the American people who should \nbe depressed that their elected officials have to spend so much time \naway from their official duties.\n  Let me talk about the California race. Today, a Senate candidate in \nCalifornia can expect to have to raise up to $10,000 a day, including \nSaturday and Sunday, 365 days a year, for 6 full years. Imagine, \n$10,000 a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, for a full 6 years. That \nis too much time away from work, too much time away from doing the \nkinds of things that we want to do here, making life better for people. \nI resent it. And I am so proud to be able to support this \nconstitutional amendment. Anyone who supports reform, therefore, has to \nsupport this. Because of the Supreme Court decision, we cannot control \nspending unless we pass this Hollings amendment. The Supreme Court \ndecision discriminates against potential candidates who do not have a \nlot of personal wealth. The talent pool for the House and Senate is \ndeclining because of the amount of money that is needed to be raised.\n  I want to talk a minute about the Supreme Court decision--which I \nknow my colleagues, who are attorneys, who understand it, perhaps, in a \ndeeper fashion, have already done--but I want to talk about it from a \ncommonsense point of view, and as someone who loves this Constitution. \nI think the Supreme Court was just completely wrong on this Buckley \nversus Valeo decision that said that Congress could not put a cap on \ncampaign spending. Freedom of speech is the most precious and most \nimportant of all the rights guaranteed in our Constitution. But, it \nseems to me, if you equate money with speech you are demeaning speech. \nYou are demeaning speech. Not everything can be equated with the \ndollar. Free speech goes far beyond that. And what about the speech of \nthe candidates who do not have personal wealth? What about their \nspeech? When someone comes in who is worth $200 million, $300 million, \nand throws $30, $40 million into a race--we have had that in \nCalifornia. What happens to the people who cannot afford to put their \nown money in a race? What happens to their speech?\n  So, it seems to me what the Court has done in Buckley is to support \nthe speech of the wealthy candidates, not the speech of those of us who \ncannot afford to put those millions of dollars into place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I so yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n2 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If money is speech, as the Supreme Court says, then more \nmoney must be more persuasive speech, and those ideas with the most \nmoney behind them will tend to prevail.\n  This is un-American. I am a product of public schools. I go toe to \ntoe here with people who went to Harvard and Yale and all those \nexpensive schools. My schooling was free, from kindergarten all the way \nthrough college. It is the American way, to give us all that level \nplaying field. We do not have a level playing field if we have to live \nwith Buckley versus Valeo. It is an un-American decision. It is wrong. \nIt is elitist. Ideas should prevail because of their inherent worth, \nnot because they were able to be hyped in 30-second commercials.\n  By the way, sometimes these commercials are not even ideas, they are \nterrible attacks on other candidates. So they are not even ideas, but \nsomehow they are worth so much because an individual may have the \nmoney.\n\n  ``Money is speech'' subverts the notion that ideas, not commercials, \nare the heart of the expression that the first amendment protects.\n  My colleague, Senator Hollings, who has been so eloquent and so \npersuasive in this debate was right when he said--and I quote--``Our \ndemocracy must be saved from this excess.''\n  Mr. President, it is time to go back to the original meaning of the \nfirst amendment, overturn Buckley versus Valeo and allow Congress to \nset spending limits that are fair for all congressional races. I can \nthink of no more important issue than this one to be dealing with at \nthis time as the furor swirls around all these large campaign \ncontributions. Well, folks, those are the rules. Those are the rules. \nWe allow it in the current system. We need to change the current \nsystem. To do that we need to pass the Hollings resolution.\n  I thank you very much and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me thank the distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia. She has spoken to the reality of what we really are \nconfronting.\n  I do not know how you run a race in the State of California. Mr. \nHuffington, of your State, spent $30 million of his own money to run \nfor Senate and lost. Last week the Senator from Nevada suggested that \nall Mr. Huffington needs to do would be come to Nevada. In Nevada he \ncould run a fine campaign for $10 million. He could move, saving $20 \nmillion of his money, down to the State of Nevada and win, so to speak, \nwith the $10 million. We know we know as in warfare, he who rules the \nair controls the battlefield. And he who rules the airwaves in politics \ncontrols the election.\n  And it is just that cold, hard reality that the Senator from \nCalifornia has spoken to. I am most grateful for her leadership on this \nparticular score.\n  Going right back, Mr. President, to 1974 and the passage of the \nFederal Election Campaign Act, in the aftermath of Watergate. We acted \ntogether--Republicans and Democrats and said with a strong vote that we \nshall not have the Government up for\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\nsale and that we had to limit spending in campaigns.\n  So in the 1974 act we limited the individual amount of a \ncontribution. In short, we limited the free speech. Congress did that \nafter a studied debate. We limited the spending of the independent \ngroups at that particular time. We limited the spending of the \npolitical action committees. We limited the spending of the individual \ncandidates' own personal wealth, and we limited the overall spending. \nSo the manifest intent in 1974 was to limit what my opponents now \ncharacterize as free speech.\n  In the 1976, Buckley decision, the Court went along with Congress' \neffort to limit an individual's free speech. When it comes to an \nindividual's contribution, they said fine, it is constitutional to \nlimit the spending or free speech of independent groups or of political \naction committees.\n  On the other hand, the Court then said, expenditures, they are not \nlimited. Any limit on expenditures would be a violation of the first \namendment. Now, that left us with a dilemma, the rich candidate or the \ncandidate with a fundraising advantage, he has got unlimited speech \nbecause he does not have limits. This and the unlimited spending by \ncandidates has become a cancer on the body politic. Combined spending \nof both political parties has gone up, as the Senator from California \nsaid, to almost a billion dollars.\n  So, Mr. President, what we have here is a terrible dilemma. We \nwrestled with it for 10 years after that 1976 decision until the mid-\n1980's when I first introduced a joint resolution to amend the \nConstitution and provide Congress the authority to limit campaign \nspending. We did not have a Pavlovian kind of reaction of ``Ipso facto, \njust run. Let's go ahead and amend the Constitution.'' We did it after \nnumerous attempts to correct the problem. First it was Common Cause, \nthey said we ought to publicly finance. Time and time again, Congress \nrejected public financing. Opponents characterized it as food stamps or \nwelfare for politicians. So that is not going to fly.\n\n  We tried individual voluntary restrictions. If we voluntarily \nlimited, then you can get free time, free television time, free \nmailings and other benefits.\n  We were never able to come to grips with reform largely because of \nthe Buckley decision. As Chief Justice Burger said in his dissenting \nopinion, expenditures and contributions were two sides of the same \ncoin, and to try to limit the one and not the other would not wash. \nThat was Chief Justice Burger's characterization of the decision.\n  So we are not coming here as just politicians, but with the support \nof the best of jurists who have come over the years and criticized the \nBuckley decision. J. Skelly Wright in the Yale Law Journal said that \nthere was nothing in the first amendment that commits us to the dogma \nthat money is speech.\n  So after trying for 10 years I introduced a constitutional amendment. \nAt that time, we believed perhaps the Court itself saw the practical \nand the scandalous effect the decision had had and that they would \nreverse their own decision.\n  But please, my gracious, Mr. President, they shot that idea with last \nyears Colorado Republican Party versus FEC decision and now ``Katie, \nbar the door. The sky is the limit.''\n  Now what do we have? We have the practical effect of absolutely no \nlimits. Business leaders now say, ``Senator, you know, we thought that \nwe sort of had done our part when we gave our $1,000. Now after that \nColorado decision the telephone rings off the hook. Now I want \n$100,000.'' ``What in the world has happened to you all here in \nWashington?''\n  They think this is the result of a congressional decision.\n  Back in 1974 the Congress agreed, in a bipartisan fashion--not \npartisan-- that we could only ask for that $1,000. That is no longer \nthe case.\n  I refer to an article in the Monday Washington Post, `Parties' \nCongressional Campaign Committees Took in Millions in `Soft Money' in \n1995-96.'' This is the practical effect of the Colorado decision.\n  This soft money represents independent contributions that, under the \nColorado decision, can be spent on congressional campaigns so long as \nyou cannot prove categorically it was coordinated--even though it went \nfor the benefit an individual candidate. In that case, they just \nstarted savaging a potential candidate way ahead of time on the radio.\n  Even though the Court is limiting the individual contributions, the \nPAC contributions, and right on down the line, now they say, ``Well, \nafter all, just go ahead with the so-called soft money,'' so that \npractically congressional committees have no limits. As the chart shows \nthe committees received ``donations of as much as $735,000 from a \nsingle corporation, $310,000 from a union, and $250,000 from an \nindividual from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1996.''\n\n       The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee \n     raised near $27 million in these unregulated donations in the \n     election year, about three times the total 4 years earlier. \n     The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee actively \n     solicited soft money for the first time in the 1995-96 \n     campaign, collecting about $14 million compared with the \n     $566,111 in 1991-1992.\n\n  So, you see, both parties just went running amok.\n  In response to my distinguished friend from Texas, who last week said \non this floor that the Republican Party was the poor party and the \nDemocrats were rich, I suggest a look at this chart.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article and the chart \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 17, 1997]\n\n Parties' Congressional Campaign Committees Took in Millions in ``Soft \n                           Money'' in 1995-96\n\n                        (By Charles R. Babcock)\n\n       While congressional and public attention has been focused \n     on the large donations the Democratic National Committee \n     solicited for the 1996 elections, the congressional arms of \n     both parties--whose stated purpose is helping to elect \n     federal officials--were busy raking in unlimited ``soft \n     money'' as well.\n       Corporations and labor unions may not give directly to \n     federal candidates, and individuals are limited to giving \n     $1,000 to a candidate per election and $20,000 a year to a \n     party committee. But most national party committees have been \n     raising money outside the federal limits, often in $50,000 \n     and $100,000 chunks. This soft money is supposed to be used \n     toward administrative costs and party-building activities \n     such as get-out-the-vote drives.\n       Federal Election Commission records, analyzed by Common \n     Cause, which is pushing to ban soft money as part of \n     reforming the way federal campaigns are financed, show the \n     congressional committees had donations of as much as $735,000 \n     from a single corporation, $310,000 from a union and $250,000 \n     from an individual from Jan. 1, 1995, through Dec. 31, 1996.\n       The National Republican Senatorial Committee raised nearly \n     $27 million in these unregulated donations in the election \n     cycle, about three times the total four years earlier. The \n     Democratic Senatorial Campaigns Committee actively solicited \n     soft money for the first time in the 1995-96 campaign, \n     collecting about $14 million, compared with $566,111 in 1991-\n     92.\n       On the House side, the National Republican Congressional \n     Committee raised nearly $19 million in soft money, three \n     times as much as it raised four years earlier. The Democratic \n     Congressional Campaign Committee raised nearly $12 million, \n     compared with $4.4 million in 1991-92.\n       FEC rules require that a percentage of the soft money the \n     committees raised be transferred to state and local \n     candidates. The practice has caused some controversy, with \n     Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) complaining that the DSCC \n     shouldn't be in that business after she learned it had spent \n     more than $1 million on state candidates in California.\n       The NRSC transferred $2.7 million to New York state \n     candidates and committees, with state Democrats complaining \n     that committee Chairman Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) did so to \n     shore up the party structure for his reelection run in 1998.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     To  DSCC   To  DCCC\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGave $75,000 or more to one of the Democratic                           \n committees:                                                            \n    American Federation of State County &                               \n     Municipal Employees..........................   $310,000   $272,500\n    Federal Express Corp..........................    250,125      7,500\n    Philip Morris Cos.............................    237,500    192,768\n    Peter B.

Mr. President, according to the Federal Election \nCommission, the total amount of money raised overall, hard and soft \nmoney, in 1996, by the Republicans was $548.7 million and by the \nDemocrats was $332.3 million.\n  So, the Democrats scramble everywhere. To the embarrassment of all of \nus both Democrat and Republican, but my opponents do not want to \nrecognize that.\n  I got a call from my distinguished colleague, the Senior Senator from \nAlabama. I understand he took the floor yesterday. Five times he has \nbeen a cosponsor of this particular joint resolution for a \nconstitutional amendment. Now he is worried about the freedom of \nspeech. You see now, the Senator from Alabama seems to have lost his \nfreedom of speech. It is a sad, sad, commentary, Mr. President, but \nthat is exactly what is happening. The other side says, look, here we \nhave the advantage of money overwhelmingly, and that is our advantage \nin politics, and we are not going to give it up, so let us hide behind \nthe First Amendment. It is a very shameful performance, a dog-and-pony \nshow, coming up here and saying we should not amend the Constitution, \nwe should not think of it. The very people saying that and quoting \nPatrick Henry have voted to amend the Constitution relative to the \nburning of the flag--the very speakers that have taken the floor. I \nhave seen hypocrisy before, but not like this.\n  Then they come saying ``Well, you know, we are not spending enough \nmoney in campaigns. What could happen,'' under this amendment is, ``the \nCongress could legislate us into incumbency, whereby you would never be \nopposed.''\n  They use Patrick Henry to defend their actions. He once cried, \n``Peace, peace, there is no peace.'' Here today we cry ``Free speech, \nfree speech, there is no free speech.'' In politics it is paid speech \nwe are talking about. As for me, give me this constitutional amendment \nto save democracy.\n  Justice Jackson said that the Constitution is not a suicide pact, Mr. \nPresident. In that context, I will review several of the most recent \nconstitutional amendments and show their relative significance to the \npending amendment. Amendment No. 27 has to do with the compensation of \nSenators and Representatives. Certainly, this is more important than \nthe 27th amendment. The 26th amendment has to do with the voting age. \nIf they can change the voting age, they can certainly change the money \nlimit. This is more important than the 26th amendment. The 25th \namendment had to do with the succession in office. This is far more \nimportant a problem. We deal with this each and every day--day in and \nday out, exacerbating, getting worse and worse, turning elections into \nauctions. And going right to the 24th amendment, the poll tax. Well, we \nsaid in the 24th amendment that you cannot separate voters financially. \nThat is exactly what Buckley has done. Those who have the money can \nshout to the rooftops. Those without money can get lockjaw--just hush, \nyou cannot compete. The last five or six amendments, Mr. President, we \nhave shown have been adopted in about a 20-month period. You can bet \nyour boots that this could easily be adopted in 1998.\n  What we have here is an amendment that is neutral. We do not say \nlimit spending or not limit. We merely authorize the States and the \nFederal Government to limit spending. Here we are asking for a right.\n  Here this devolution crowd that keeps coming up here and saying, \n``return government to the states, return government to the people, let \nthe people act,'' that is what I am trying to do. Pass my amendment, \nsend it to the States and let the American people make the decision. We \ndo not say ``limit.'' We do not say ``not limit.'' We just say give the \npeople's representative body--namely, the Congress of the United \nStates--the authority to limit. My opponents do not want to give the \npeople a chance to vote on it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from South \nCarolina he has 5 minutes 45 seconds remaining. Senator McConnell has \n30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is a right way and a wrong way of \nreforming our system of campaign finance. The Hollings proposal to \namend our Constitution is simply the wrong way. It would, in effect, \namend the first amendment to our Constitution to allow any reasonable \nrestrictions to be placed on independent campaign expenditures and \ncontributions. Why does he propose that we amend the first amendment? \nBecause the Supreme Court of the United States has held that \nrestrictions on independent expenditures violate the first amendment's \nfree speech protection and that such restrictions could only be \njustified upon a showing of a compelling--as opposed to any \nreasonable--reason.\n  The Hollings amendment would gut the free speech protections of the \nfirst amendment. It would allow the curtailing of independent campaign \nexpenditures that could overcome the natural advantage that incumbents \nhave. It would, thus, limit free speech and virtually guarantee that \nincumbents be reelected. Thus, the Hollings amendment could change the \nvery nature of our constitutional democratic form of Government by \nestablishing what the Founders of the Republic feared most: A permanent \nelite or ruling oligarchy that dominates us all. Let me explain.\n  The very purpose of the first amendment's free speech clause is to \nensure that the people's elected officials effectively and genuinely \nrepresent the public. For elections to be a real check on Government, \nfree speech must be guaranteed--both to educate the public about the \nissues, and to allow differing view points to compete in what Oliver\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\nWendell Holmes called the market place of ideas.\n  Simply put, without free speech, Government cannot be predicated \nupon, what Thomas Jefferson termed, ``the consent of the governed.'' \nWithout free speech, there can be no government based on consent \nbecause consent can never be informed.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States recognized this fundamental \nprinciple of democracy in the 1976 case of Buckley versus Valeo, 424 \nU.S. 1 (1976). The Court in Buckley recognized that free speech is \nmeaningless unless it is effective. In the words of Justice White, \n``money talks.'' Unless you can get your ideas into the public domain, \nall the homilies and hosannas to freedom of speech are just talk. Thus, \nthe Supreme Court held that campaign contributions and expenditures are \nspeech--or intrinsically related to speech--and that regulating of such \nfunds must be restrained by the prohibitions of the first amendment.\n  The Buckley Court made a distinction between campaign contributions \nand campaign expenditures. The Court found that free speech interests \nin campaign contributions are marginal at best because they convey only \na generalized expression of support. But independent expenditures are \nanother matter. These are given higher first amendment protection \nbecause they are direct expressions of speech.\n  Consequently, because contributions are tangential to free speech, \nCongress has a sizeable latitude to regulate them in order to prevent \nfraud and corruption. But not so with independent expenditures. In the \nwords of the Court:\n\n       A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by \n     restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of \n     their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This \n     is because virtually every means of communicating in today's \n     mass society requires the expenditure of money.\n\n  The Hollings amendment's allowance of restrictions on expenditures by \nCongress and State legislatures would impose direct and substantial \nrestraints on the quantity of political speech. It would permit placing \ndrastic limitations on both individuals and groups from spending money \nto disseminate their own ideas as to which candidate should be \nsupported and what cause is just. The Supreme Court noted that such \nrestrictions on expenditures, even if neutral as to the ideas \nexpressed, limit political expression at the core of our electoral \nprocess and of the first amendment freedoms.\n  Indeed, even candidates under the Hollings proposal could be \nrestricted in engaging in protected first amendment expression.\n  Justice Brandeis observed, in Whitney versus California, that in our \nRepublic, ``public discussion is a political duty,'' and that duty will \nbe circumscribed where a candidate is prevented from spending his or \nher own money to spread the electoral message. That a candidate has a \nfirst amendment right to engage in public issues and advocate \nparticular positions was considered by the Buckley Court to be of \n``particular importance. . . candidates [must] have the unfettered \nopportunity to make their views known so that the electorate may \nintelligently evaluate the candidates' personal qualities and their \npositions on vital public issues before choosing among them on election \nday.''\n  Campaign finance reform should not be at the expense of free speech. \nThis amendment, in trying to reduce the costs of political campaigns--a \nnoble goal, I can say--could cost us so much more; it could cost us our \nheritage of political liberty. Without free speech, our Republic could \nbecome a tyranny. Even the liberal American Civil Liberties Union \nopposes Senator Hollings-type approaches to campaign reform and calls \nsuch approaches a ``recipe for repression.''\n  Mr. President, the simple truth is that there are just too many on \nthe other side of the aisle that believe that the first amendment is \ninconsistent with campaign finance reform. That is why they are pushing \nthe Hollings proposal. To quote House minority leader Richard Gephardt, \n``[w]hat we have is two important values in direct conflict: freedom of \nspeech and our desire for a healthy campaign in a healthy democracy. \nYou can't have both.''\n  Well, I strongly disagree. You can have both. We have to have both. \nWithout both, the very idea of representative democracy is imperiled. \nThat is why I oppose the Hollings amendment. I think the distinguished \nMember of the House, Mr. Gephardt, is just absolutely wrong. I think if \nwe change the Constitution to denigrate the first amendment, we would \nbe absolutely wrong and it would fly in the face of what really ought \nto be done in campaign finance reform, which all of us would like to \nhave. But until it can be done in a balanced, reasonable way that \ndoesn't prefer one side over the other, it will never be done. That is \none of the problems. We cannot get it done in a balanced, decent way \nthat really evens the odds for everybody in our society, rather than \nstacking them in favor of one side or the other.\n  Having said all this, I want to pay tribute to my colleague, our \nfloor leader on this matter. He has taken a lot of flack from the media \nthat always seems to stand up for first amendment rights and freedoms, \nuntil it comes to this issue. Frankly, I have a lot of respect for our \ncolleague from Kentucky and the guts he has had to stand up for free \nspeech and for first amendment rights more than any other single Member \nof Congress. He did it in his campaign when they made this a major \nfocal effort of the campaign, and he still won by a considerable margin \nover the opponent who was making this a focal point.\n  I think we can have campaign finance reform, but we won't have it \nuntil it is fair, balanced, until it effects all parties and \ncandidates. And we won't have it, as far as I am concerned, unless we \nprotect free speech rights the way they ought to be protected.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague and express my support for his \nposition on the floor at this time. I express regret to my friend from \nSouth Carolina that I can't support him on this constitutional \namendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. ALLARD assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Utah for \nhis wonderful contribution to this debate we have had. It has been a \ngood debate about the first amendment. I also thank him very much for \nhis kind remarks about my work on this issue.\n  The Senator from Utah is right. It hasn't been easy from time to time \nbecause, as he pointed out, our friends in the press sometimes think \nthe first amendment only applies to them. The first amendment was not \ncrafted just for the press. It was crafted for all Americans. The free \nspeech provisions of the first amendment apply to individuals, \ncandidates, parties, groups; it applies to all of these people.\n  What we have before us today, Mr. President, is an effort to cut a \nchunk out of the first amendment and say that political discourse in \nthis country is entitled to less freedom than all other kinds of \nspeech, all other kinds of speech. Why, Mr. President, even pornography \nand flag burning would have more protection--more protection--than \npolitical discourse after this amendment. Because this amendment would \ngrant to Congress the power to shut everybody up, Congress being \ncomposed of incumbents, it is reasonable to assume that Congress would \nwant to shut up all those people who are criticizing Congress.\n  This amendment gives Congress the power to set reasonable limits--\nwhatever that is--on expenditures made, presumably, by the candidates, \nin support of--by people outside the campaigns--in support of the \ncandidate, or in opposition to the candidate, and the American Civil \nLiberties Union said it could apply to the press as well.\n  In short, this is a complete reversal of the kind of speech the \nFounding Fathers were the most concerned about. Mr. President, I am \nconfident they were most concerned about political discourse, political \ndiscussion, political speech. They were beginning to have experiences \nwith free press at that time. But I am confident that what they were \nmostly thinking about, when crafting the first amendment, was political \ndiscourse in the course of political campaigns.\n  So the question is, as the Senator from Utah and others have pointed \nout, it is not whether you are for reform, but whether you are for the \nfirst amendment. That is what is before us here today. This ought to be \na no- \n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\nbrainer. Even Common Cause is against this proposal. Even the \nWashington Post is against this proposal. Even Senator McCain and \nSenator Feingold, I believe, are going to oppose this.\n  In short, this proposal doesn't have any constituency. Even the \nreform groups are not for it. Of course, it has many opponents. There \nis a coalition--in fact, I had a press conference with a coalition just \nFriday in opposition not only to this amendment, but also to McCain-\nFeingold. The coalition spans the American political spectrum. At this \npress conference Friday, we had the ACLU and the National Education \nAssociation on the left, and the Christian Coalition, Right to Life, \nand the NRA on the right, and all other groups in between. What did \nthey all have in common? These people had never met each other before. \nThey didn't want the Government shutting them up. They didn't want the \nGovernment taking them off the playing field in political discussion in \nthis country. That is what they all had in common. They want to be free \nto criticize us. They think they have a constitutional right to do \nthat. They believe this amendment begins to eliminate that right, and \nproposals like McCain-Feingold do the same.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a very, very important issue. This vote \nwill be about whether you support the first amendment or not, whether \nyou support political free speech in this country, not just by \ncandidates, but by groups, individuals, and parties as well. This is at \nthe core of our democracy, and we are having a legitimate discussion \nhere about whether to carve that out and change that after 210 years.\n  Mr. President, this is a very, very significant step in the wrong \ndirection. I hope that it will be defeated later this afternoon \noverwhelmingly. It deserves to be defeated overwhelmingly. The goal \nhere is to reverse the Buckley decision, a well-thought-out, well-\nreasoned decision.\n  In the Buckley case, the Supreme Court said, ``The first amendment \ndenies Government''--that is us in here--``the Government the power to \ndetermine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, \nexcessive, or unwise.''\n  The Court went on, ``In a free society ordained by our Constitution, \nit is not the Government but the people, individually as citizens, \ncandidates, and collectively as associations and political committees, \nwho must retain control over the quantity''--how much we speak--``and \nthe range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.''\n  That pretty well says it all, Mr. President. At least Senator \nHollings, my good friend from South Carolina, understands that in order \nto change that ruling you really do have to change the first amendment. \nThat is what is before us--to change the first amendment for the first \ntime in 200 years to give the Government the power to shut up \nindividuals, candidates, associations, and political committees; tell \nthem how much they may speak, and maybe even what they may say. Who is \nto say how far the Government would go in seeking to quiet the voices \nof those who may oppose what we are trying to do?\n  The Court went on. It said, ``A restriction on the amount of money a \nperson or group can spend on political communication during a campaign \nnecessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the \nnumber of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the \nsize of the audience reach. This is because virtually every means of \ncommunicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of \nmoney.''\n  The Court was recognizing the obvious, recognizing reality. The Court \nwent on. It said, ``Even distribution of the humblest handbill costs \nmoney.'' Further, the Court stated, ``The electorate's increasing \ndependence on television and radio for news and information makes these \n`expenditures' of modes of communication indispensable instruments of \neffective political speech.''\n  The Court further said, ``There is nothing invidious, improper, or \nunhealthy in a campaign spending money to communicate.'' Further, the \nCourt said, ``The mere growth in the cost of Federal election campaigns \nin and of itself provides no basis''--they didn't equivocate here, Mr. \nPresident--``provides no basis for government restrictions on the \nquantity of campaign spending.'' The Court further addressed the old \nlevel-playing-field argument that we hear so frequently. The Court said \nabout the level playing field, ``The concept that the government may \nrestrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance \nthe relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first \namendment.''\n  The Buckley case was good in 1976, and it is good in 1997. In fact, \nthe Supreme Court in virtually every case in this field since 1976, \nsince the Buckley case, has moved further in the direction of more and \nmore openness in political discourse in this country. In other words, \nthey have reaffirmed Buckley time and time again over the last 20 \nyears. This is a position the Court isn't going to change. And the \nSenator from South Carolina, to his credit, understands that. He \nunderstands the Court is not going to shut up these individuals, \ngroups, candidates, and parties. He understands the Court realizes that \nthis kind of debate is at the heart of what makes America a great \ndemocracy.\n  The Senator from South Carolina looks at that and finds it \nunappetizing. He finds all of this political discourse offensive and \nsays we ought to carve a chunk out of the first amendment for the first \ntime in 210 years and give to us here in the Government the power to \ncontrol all of this discourse. It makes us uncomfortable. We don't like \nbeing criticized. We certainly do not like these campaigns against us \nby our opponents. But we don't like these outside groups either. It \nmakes us uncomfortable. They sometimes say bad things about us. This is \na terrible condition, that anybody other than the press could actually \nmuster the resources to criticize. We had better do something about it. \nWe had better shut those folks up. So we will just amend the first \namendment, and we will decide that political speech is somehow less \nworthy than other kinds of speech, and we will take those people off \nthe playing field, or we will make them report to the Government in \nadvance and salute before they get permission to speak.\n  That is what this is about, Mr. President. That is what this is \nabout. This constitutional amendment ought to be defeated resoundingly. \nIt is certainly my hope that it will be. As I said earlier, it has \nessentially no constituency even among those clamoring the loudest for \nsome form of campaign finance reform.\n  So later this afternoon when we vote on amending the first amendment \nfor the first time in 200 years, I hope the Senate will defeat it \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, there's an old joke that might help us put \nthe current activity surrounding campaign finance reform into some \nperspective. The joke concerns two men who hire a small plane to go \nhunting bear. The pilot, as he drops the hunters off, insists that the \nplane can only carry two passengers and one bear on its return trip. \nWith that warning ringing in their ears, the hunters go off and \neventually return with two bears.\n  The pilot protests that the huge second animal will overload the \nplane. The hunters remind him that that was just what he told them last \nyear. They reminded him that they had given him an extra $100 the year \nbefore, and that he had let them load both bears. ``So here's another \n$100,'' they say and then they pack both carcasses into the rear of the \nplane. The plane struggles down the runway and lifts uncertainly into \nthe sky. It gets halfway home but then crashes in the forest. The \nhunters crawl from the wreckage and ask the bruised pilot, ``Where are \nwe?'' The pilot looks around and replies, ``Same place we crashed last \nyear.''\n  Today, the debris of scandal associated with campaign financing is \nstrewn all about us. The White House is under siege as one news report \nafter another brings new information about suspected improprieties. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has now been asked to probe into the \nillegal and improper financial practices that may have taken place in \nthis last election.\n  What I want to remind my colleagues is that this is not the first \ntime we have addressed this issue. In fact, this is, as Yogi Berra \nwould say, deja vu all over again.\n  More than two decades ago, Congress passed legislation on campaign \nfinance\n\n[[Page S2389]]\n\nreform. That legislation included limits on all contributions and on \ncandidate expenditures. It placed limits on independent expenditures, \nrequired disclosure, and set limits on the amount of personal wealth a \ncandidate could spend on his campaign.\n  This was done, Mr. President, in 1974. Following that legislation, \nhowever, the Supreme Court stepped in and decimated the reforms with \nits decision in Buckley versus Valeo.\n  While the courts upheld limits on campaign contributions, it struck \ndown the limits on independent expenditures and on the use of personal \nwealth. This, in effect, increased the disparity between the wealthy \nand the not-so-wealthy in campaigns. It also increased the power and \nimpact of independent expenditures, much of which focuses on negative \nadvertising.\n  Each of these serious consequences of the Supreme Court's decision \ncreated conditions that were exactly opposite of what Congress had \nintended. For example concerning independent expenditures, this means \nthat person or group has unlimited ability to spend money for or \nagainst any candidate, as long as they do not coordinate their efforts \nwith the candidates.\n  Because of the Supreme Court's decision, and the rising costs of \npolitical campaigns--costs that can be prohibitive and exclusionary--I \nremained active in trying to find a remedy, a remedy that would result \nin the kind of real reform that Congress had intended. Because of \nBuckley versus Valeo, it was clear that such reform could not be \nachieved by statute, but that it required a constitutional amendment. \nIn four consecutive Congresses, Senator Hollings and I introduced \nconstitutional amendments that would achieve Congress' goal of complete \nreform.\n  In this Congress, Senator Hollings has reintroduced his \nconstitutional amendment, and once again I intend to support it. I \nintend to support it because anything short of an amendment will fail \nto achieve the conditions necessary for real reform. Statutory reforms \nwithout a constitutional amendment will create even greater problems as \npolitical money will flow elsewhere to get around the statutory \nlimitations.\n  In other words, as restrictions are placed on certain channels, money \nwill find its way into other channels--it will flow through independent \nexpenditures and unlimited personal contributions, which are protected \nby the Supreme Court's decisions.\n  Needless to say, this would further damage the ability of a sharp, \nqualified candidate to win office if he or she did not have the kind of \nmoney that a wealthy candidate--a candidate who may even come from out \nof State--can bring into a race. Small States like Delaware would be \nextremely vulnerable to the inequities created by these restrictions.\n  For over two decades now, reformers in Congress have been seeking to \noverturn Supreme Court decisions by simple statute even though the \ndecisions were based on the first amendment. That effort is a waste of \ntime for anyone seeking comprehensive reform. Of course, if one's goal \nis to incapacitate all candidates who are not wealthy and to allow the \nwealthy and the special interests to determine the outcomes of \nelections, then perhaps such statutory reforms will do. But if one's \ngoal is to level the playing field, then the solution must effectively \naddress all the players and not only the candidates.\n  So unlike some of my colleagues who support the pending \nconstitutional amendment, I cannot support statutory proposals whose \neffect would be to weaken the role of candidates and to strengthen the \nrole of those whose spending is constitutionally protected. No statute \ncan limit what the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, \nprotects.\n  The Constitution gives us, in these circumstances, a simple choice: \nwe can overturn the Supreme Court so that we can reenact the 1974 \ncampaign finance law or we can live under the Supreme Court decision, \npowerless to enact comprehensive reform.\n  I am glad to see that this basic constitutional fact of life has now \nbeen embraced by the minority leaders in both Houses. But we need more \nsupport than theirs to achieve the supermajority in both Houses \nrequired to propose ratification. And that will happen when those \norganizations espousing reform stop blocking the only path to real \nreform.\n  Last week on the floor, opponents of the pending constitutional \namendment argued that adoption of the proposal would allow Congress to \ndo all sorts of unreasonable things, such as outlawing all campaign \nexpenditures so that incumbents would be reelected. It may be helpful \nto recall that 10 years ago the Hollings proposal did not include the \nimportant word ``reasonable'' modifying the limits Congress could \nimpose on campaign expenditures. At that time, I argued that adding the \nword ``reasonable'' would make clear that judicial review of \ncongressional limits was intended.\n  Opponents seem to suggest that the pending proposal would give \nCongress unlimited discretion. That's not true. Courts now under the \nfourth amendment review what is ``unreasonable'' search and seizure. \nUnder the pending proposal, courts would review what is or is not a \n``reasonable'' limit on campaign expenditures.\n  Opponents also raised the question whether the proposal would \nauthorize Congress to limit editorials. I must say that I never viewed \neditorials as campaign expenditures, and I believe that most people \nhave the same view. If that point needed further clarification, I would \nthink legislative history could make clear that editorial coverage is \nnot intended to be included within the pending proposal.\n  Mr. President, campaign finance reform must be fair. A constitutional \namendment will allow us to make it fair. Campaign finance reform must \nalso look at making races less expensive and more accessible to fine \ncandidates who are deterred from running because of money.\n  Campaigns can be made less expensive by shortening the campaign \nseason, and by requiring television stations to grant free advertising \ntime as a condition of their Federal licenses.\n  It's no secret that the major expense in the electoral process is \nbuying media time. I have long been an advocate of free TV for \ncampaigns--going back to the 1970's--and I have introduced legislation \ntoward this end.\n  In 1993, I wrote to President Clinton seeking his support, and I'm \nnow delighted to see that he has suggested requiring broadcasters to \nprovide free time for candidates in exchange for new licenses to \nprovide high-definition television.\n  This will be no easy feat. When I first broached this idea, I could \nonly find three Senators who would support me. One was Majority Leader \nMike Mansfield. That was many years ago, and I must admit we have seen \nsome progress. The last time I brought this legislation to the floor, a \nfew years ago, I received six votes. But perhaps, in light of the \nscandal plaguing the White House, as well as the outcry from our \nconstituents, this is an idea whose time has come.\n  I have talked to my constituents, Mr. President. I know their \nfeelings on campaign finance reform. They want reasonable limitations \non campaign expenditures. They want reasonable limits placed on \nindependent expenditures. And they want shorter campaigns.\n  It is my sincere hope that as we move forward in this important \ndebate, we will achieve these three very basic objectives, and, unlike \nour bear hunters, we will not, in the years to come, find ourselves in \nthe same situation we are in now.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Joint \nResolution 18, the campaign finance reform constitutional amendment \nsponsored by Senators Hollings and Specter. This constitutional \namendment gives Congress and the States the power to limit campaign \nspending. Although I've supported similar constitutional amendments in \nthe past, this is the first time I've cosponsored such an amendment.\n  Amending the Constitution is not something I take lightly. The \nConstitution is the basic law of our land, and the guarantor of our \ncountry's most precious rights and liberties. The Constitution has only \nbeen changed 27 times--only 17 times since the first 10 amendments, the \nBill of Rights, were adopted in 1789. Voting to amend the Constitution \nis perhaps the most important vote I can cast as a U.S. Senator. \nHowever, it seems to me we have reached a crisis point with our current \ncampaign finance system. To put it simply, campaign spending is out of\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\ncontrol. It is my belief that this constitutional amendment will help \nus address in a fair and reasonable manner the chronic problems \nplaguing our current campaign finance system.\n  In 1974, 23 years ago, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign \nPractices Act in response to the controversy surrounding the Watergate \nscandal. The Federal Election Campaign Practices Act required greater \ndisclosure by candidates and parties, restricted cash contributions, \nand limited campaign expenditures. In 1976, the Supreme Court reviewed \nthe constitutionality of the act in Buckley versus Valeo. In reviewing \nthe case, the Court struck down the limits on campaign expenditures as \nan unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech. The effect of \nthis decision is that it equated the unlimited expenditure of campaign \nmoney with the exercise of free speech. In my view, this decision was a \nmistake.\n  Since that time, Congress has made numerous attempts at addressing \nthis decision, particularly during the last 10 years, by putting forth \nvarious comprehensive campaign finance reform initiatives. Most of \nthese bills attempted to address the campaign expenditure problem \neither by providing a system of public financing or providing \ninducements for voluntary spending limits. During my 10 years in the \nSenate, I have supported most of these proposals. Unfortunately, all of \nthese initiatives were defeated.\n  The campaign spending problem was further exacerbated by the Supreme \nCourt's decision last June in the Colorado Republican Party versus FEC. \nIn that decision, the Court struck down the spending limits of \npolitical parties in congressional campaigns. This decision virtually \nwiped out the remaining Federal campaign spending limits.\n  Last year, we saw record amounts of money spent on campaigns. \nRepublican and Democratic committees alone spent $881 million and it \nhas been estimated that more than $4 billion was spent on campaigns at \nall levels during the last election cycle. There is every indication to \nbelieve that the costs of campaigns will continue to skyrocket. Some \nargue that the amount of money spent on campaigns is insignificant when \ncompared with the amount we spend on other facets of our economy. I \nthink this is a specious comparison.\n  The current campaign finance system is out of control and it \nthreatens to push average Americans out of the process. Voter cynicism \nand apathy are on the increase. In the last election, voter turnout \nfell below 50 percent. Most people understand the corrosive effect the \ncurrent campaign finance system has on our democracy.\n  The time has come for us to fix this system by placing reasonable \nlimits on the amount of money that can be spent on campaigns. We must \nrestore confidence in our political system. Voting for this \nconstitutional amendment will allow us to do just that. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of Senate Joint Resolution 18.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nconstitutional amendment we are debating today.\n  Frankly, I think this amendment is very dangerous.\n  It is dangerous anytime you tinker with the first amendment, our \nright to freedom of speech.\n  I suppose what is most appalling to me is that we have the tenacity \nto even consider this amendment. Two weeks ago, the Senate could not \nmuster the fortitude to pass a constitutional amendment to control \nFederal spending.\n  Now, here we are debating an amendment to limit an individual's \nspending.\n  Mr. President, this demonstrates just how backward our priorities \nare.\n  We can't control how much the Federal Government will spend--but we \nwill presume to tell an individual how much he or she can spend on \npolitical campaigns.\n  That is simply unacceptable.\n  Also, Mr. President, I am not a lawyer. But the term ``reasonable'' \nlimits used in this amendment appears to be pretty loose.\n  How can we reasonably restrict what someone can spend?\n  How can we reasonably restrict political speech?\n  And the very thought that the Federal Government--the Congress--would \nbe setting a reasonable standard is troubling.\n  Further, Mr. President, we should call this for what it really is--\nthe incumbent protection constitutional amendment.\n  Everyone knows that if you limit your opponent's spending--the better \nknown incumbent has an advantage. And under this amendment, we can \nlimit opposition spending.\n  This is absurd--the Congress setting how much our opponents can spend \nagainst us.\n  Who can possibly hope to challenge an incumbent if he or she is not \nallowed to use their own money--however little or much--in the \ncampaign.\n  Of course, this amendment probably puts us on the path to Federal \nfunding of political campaigns.\n  Mr. President, I cannot abide the fact that not only do we pay a \npolitician's salary. Now some politicians expect the citizens to spend \ntheir tax dollars paying for the campaign as well.\n  We can't ask the working men and women of this country to do that.\n  Further, I would remind my colleagues that we have full Federal \nfunding for Presidential races--and has this stopped the President from \nshamelessly raising money? The answer is no.\n  President Clinton didn't need to sell the Lincoln bedroom to pay for \nhis campaign. The taxpayers of this country paid for every penny of his \ncampaign. We did this so that the President wouldn't have to be \nbothered or be influenced by the fundraising process.\n  But that apparently did not matter. His goal was to raise as much \nmoney as possible--beyond that legally permissible for himself--to buy \nmisleading ads on Medicare.\n  Federal funding has failed at the Presidential level--and it won't \nwork at the congressional level.\n  Mr. President, I also have to question why the minority and the \nPresident is in such a hurry to enact campaign finance reform.\n  During 1996, they used the White House and the executive branch to \nsqueeze money out of everyone from banks to Indian tribes.\n  Now the American public is finding out about it.\n  Suddenly, the No. 1 priority of the Democratic Party is campaign \nfinance reform.\n  When the horse is out of the barn, a horsethief running down the \nstreet telling everyone about it isn't going to do any good.\n  If the front pages weren't covered in negative stories about the \nsordid tales of DNC and White House fundraising, I don't think we would \nbe out here rushing to clutter the Constitution with supposed campaign \nreform.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we never seem to question why there is so \nmuch money in politics. One reason we have overlooked is because the \nGovernment is in everyone's business.\n  If we weren't threatening to legislate and regulate businesses on a \ndaily basis, perhaps they wouldn't feel compelled to give large \ndonations.\n  The best campaign finance reform we can make here is to get out of \nAmericans' daily lives. They shouldn't have to buy access for the \npurpose of making their views heard on legislation that would be \nruinous to the free enterprise system.\n  If we would stop the bad legislation and regulation--we could stop \nthe bad campaign finance practices we don't like.\n  Mr. President, I have great respect for Senator Hollings and Senator \nBryan, they are both fine Senators from the other party, but I believe \nthat on this issue, they have taken a very dangerous approach by \nsuggesting that we amend the Constitution.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield our remaining time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I am here to express my support for Senate Joint \nResolution 18, introduced by the Senator from\n\n[[Page S2391]]\n\nSouth Carolina and the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  If I may, let me just briefly respond to the statement made by my \nfriend from Kentucky that there are not any interest groups supporting \nthis amendment on the left or on the right. I am not surprised by that. \nDo you know who is supporting this amendment? The unorganized mass of \nthe American people who do not belong to special interest groups of the \nleft or the right and who know that something fundamentally wrong is \nhappening in our democracy that is depriving them of their equal and \nindividual right to affect their government. What is happening is the \nunlimited, and I am afraid corrupting, use of money in America \npolitics.\n  Mr. President, I do not come to supporting a constitutional amendment \nof any kind, certainly one affecting the first amendment, lightly. I do \nnot believe that I have ever supported any other amendment to the \nConstitution that would alter the first amendment. But I think that the \nthreat to our democracy from the excess of money in politics is so \nserious that it merits--in fact, it calls out for--support of this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Let's remember what we are doing here when we talk about the Buckley \ndecision. To pass this constitutional amendment is not to contradict \nwhat the Framers of the Constitution did in their great work more than \n200 years ago. It is to contradict five of the Members of the U.S. \nSupreme Court, who gave a rendering of the first amendment that I \ncannot imagine the Framers of our Constitution had in mind, which is \nthat money is speech. It is hard to believe. The consequences are \nserious.\n  So it is only by supporting this amendment and giving us the right to \nlimit the amount of money in politics that I think we can restore a \nsense of integrity and sanity to our campaign finance system and, if I \ndo say so, to our democracy.\n  Mr. President, much of the debate over this proposed constitutional \namendment has centered on this question of the threat to the principle \nof free speech. Of course, we all hold that principle dear. But free \nspeech is not what is at issue here. Free speech is about the \ninalienable God-given right of all of us to express our points of view \nwithout governmental interference. That simply is not at issue here in \nthis proposed amendment, or in our campaign finance system.\n  Mr. President, nothing in this amendment or in any campaign finance \nreform package that I have seen that could be passed here would \ndiminish or threaten individual Americans' rights to express their \nviews about candidates running for office, or about any problem or \nissue in American life. What would be threatened by this constitutional \namendment is what should be threatened by it, and that is something \nentirely different--the ever-increasing and disproportionate power that \nthose with money have over our political system. As everyone in this \nChamber knows, the spiraling costs of running for office require all of \nus to spend more and more time raising money and more and more time \nwith those who give it.\n  Barely a day goes by in which we do not learn of an event or a \nmeeting with elected officials attended only by those who could afford \nto give $5,000 or $10,000 or $100,000 or more--sums of money that are \nobviously beyond the capacity of the overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people. And that is threatening a principle all of us also \nhold dear, as dearly as the principle of free speech, which is the \nfundamental underlying principle of our democracy. It is a sacred \nprinciple. I say it is sacred because of that line in the beginning of \nthe Declaration of Independence: All men are created equal and we, men \nand women of America, are endowed not by Congress, not by some \ncommittee but by our Creator with the inalienable right to life, \nliberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  That principle guarantees that every person has one vote and each and \nevery one of us, rich or poor or in between, has an equal right and an \nequal ability to influence the workings of our Government. As it stands \nnow, it is that sacred principle, the underlying principle of all of \nthe rights expressed in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution, that is \nunder attack from our campaign finance status quo system, and that \nsacred principle that promises to remain under attack until we do \nsomething to save it and protect it, and that something, I submit, is \nquite simply to limit the influence of money in politics. I do not see \na way to do that without limiting the amount of money spent in \npolitical campaigns, and I do not see a way to do that constitutionally \nwithout passing this constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, nothing less than the future of our great democracy is \nat stake here. Unless we act to reform our campaign finance system, \npeople with money will continue to have disproportionate influence in \nour system. People who are not even citizens of the United States will \ntry to influence our Government's decision by their use of money. And \nthe genius of America--that our citizenship based on our common \ncreation by God, not our pocketbook, gives us each equal power to play \na role in our governance--that genius will continue to be under seige.\n  Mr. President, I support the constitutional amendment. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky has the remaining time, 8 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my good friend from Connecticut \nacknowledged that there were no groups agitating for a constitutional \namendment but the unorganized mass of people were.\n  Well, America is a seething cauldron of special interests. We all \nbelong to one group or another, many of which have legitimate issues \nbefore the Government. And, of course, we do not think the group we \nbelong to is a special interest. That is the other guy's group that is \ntrying to do something I do not like. But the fact is, the Founders of \nthis country envisioned that we would be a seething cauldron of \ninterest groups all banding together to petition the Government, which \nis another part of the first amendment. These people do not want to be \npushed off the playing field. They do not want to be pushed off the \nplaying field. They think that their involvement in issues is \nimportant. They think it helps create a better America. They do not \nview themselves as pursuing some evil goal. After all, who is it that \nis going to have the wisdom to sort of sanitize America of all these \nspecial interests and who are we to be so arrogant as to preach to \nthese groups that their interests are somehow evil. Who is not suspect? \nWhose interests are above reproach?\n  This amendment says we get to determine that right in here; we, the \nGovernment, get to decide what is reasonable speech. And you know what \nwe will do, Mr. President. We will shut up all the people who are \ncriticizing us. We will pull them off the playing field altogether. We \nwill set a spending limit so low that all of us are guaranteed to be \nreelected. We will control the game all right.\n  This is a preposterous suggestion, with all due respect to those who \nwill vote for it. It guts the first amendment. It takes citizens off \nthe playing field and out of the process. This is exactly the wrong \nthing to do.\n  George Will, in a column in the Washington Post February 13, referred \nto this as a ``Government Gag''--a ``Government Gag.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that George Will's column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 13, 1997]\n\n                             Government Gag\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       To promote the fair and effective functioning of the \n     democratic process, Congress, with respect to elections for \n     federal office, and States, for all other elections, \n     including initiatives and referenda, may adopt reasonable \n     regulations of funds expended, including contributions, to \n     influence the outcome of elections, provided that such \n     regulations do not impair the right of the public to a full \n     and free discussion of all issues and do not prevent any \n     candidate for elected office from amassing the resources \n     necessary for effective advocacy.\n       Such governments may reasonably define which expenditures \n     are deemed to be for the purpose of influencing elections, so \n     long as such definition does not interfere with the right of \n     the people fully to debate issues.\n       No regulation adopted under this authority may regulate the \n     content of any expression of opinion or communication.--\n     Proposed amendment to the Constitution\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\n       Like the imperturbable Sir Francis Drake, who did not allow \n     the Spanish Armada's arrival off England to interrupt a game \n     of bowling, supposed friends of the First Amendment are \n     showing notable sang-froid in the face of ominous \n     developments. Freedom of speech is today under more serious \n     attack than at any time in at least the last 199 years--since \n     enactment of the Alien and Sedition Acts. Actually, today's \n     threat, launched in the name of political hygiene, is graver \n     than that posed by those acts, for three reasons.\n       First, the 1798 acts, by which Federalists attempted to \n     suppress criticism of the government they then controlled, \n     were bound to perish with fluctuations in the balance of \n     partisan forces. Today's attack on free speech advances under \n     a bland bipartisan banner of cleanliness.\n       Second, the 1798 acts restricted certain categories of \n     political speech and activities, defined, albeit quite \n     broadly, by content and objectives. Today's enemies of the \n     First Amendment aim to abridge the right of free political \n     speech generally. It is not any particular content but the \n     quantity of political speech they find objectionable.\n       Third, the 1798 acts had expiration dates and were allowed \n     to expire. However, if today's speech-restrictors put in \n     place their structure of restriction (see above), its anti-\n     constitutional premise and program probably will be \n     permanent.\n       Its premise is that Americans engage in too much \n     communication of political advocacy, and that government--\n     that is, incumbents in elective offices--should be trusted to \n     decide and enforce the correct amount. This attempt to put \n     the exercise of the most elemental civil right under \n     government regulation is the most frontal assault ever \n     mounted on the most fundamental principle of the nation's \n     Founders.\n       The principle is that limited government must be limited \n     especially severely concerning regulation of the rights most \n     essential to an open society. Thus the First Amendment says \n     ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech,'' not ``Congress may abridge the freedom of speech \n     with such laws as Congress considers reasonable.''\n       The text of the proposed amendment comes from Rep. Richard \n     Gephardt, House minority leader, who has the courage of his \n     alarming convictions when he says: ``What we have is two \n     important values in conflict: freedom of speech and our \n     desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You \n     can't have both.''\n       However, he also says: ``I know this is a serious step to \n     amend the First Amendment. . . . But . . . this is not an \n     effort to diminish free speech.'' Nonsense. Otherwise \n     Gephardt would not acknowledge that the First Amendment is \n     an impediment.\n       The reformers' problem is the Supreme Court, which has \n     affirmed the obvious: Restrictions on the means of making \n     speech heard, including spending for the discrimination of \n     political advocacy, are restrictions on speech. It would be \n     absurd to say, for example: ``Congress shall make no law \n     abridging the right to place one's views before the public in \n     advertisements or on billboards but Congress can abridge--\n     reasonably, of course--the right to spend for such things.''\n       Insincerity oozes from the text of the proposed amendment. \n     When Congress, emancipated from the First Amendment's \n     restrictions, weaves its web of restraints on political \n     communication, it will do so to promote its understanding of \n     what is the ``fair'' and ``effective'' functioning of \n     democracy, and ``effective'' advocacy. Yet all this \n     regulation will be consistent with ``the right of the people \n     fully to debate issues,'' and with ``full and free discussion \n     of all issues''--as the political class chooses to define \n     ``full'' and ``free'' and the ``issues.''\n       In 1588 England was saved not just by Drake but by luck--\n     the ``Protestant wind'' that dispersed the Armada. Perhaps \n     today the strangely silent friends of freedom--why are not \n     editorial pages erupting against the proposed vandalism \n     against the Bill of Rights?--are counting on some similar \n     intervention to forestall today's ``reformers'' who aim not \n     just to water the wine of freedom but to regulate the \n     consumption of free speech.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In addition to that, Mr. President, the American Civil \nLiberties Union in a letter to me dated March 6, 1997, also expressed \ntheir opposition to this constitutional amendment to amend the first \namendment for the first time in 200 years. I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union strongly \n     opposes S.J. Res. 18, the proposed constitutional amendment \n     that permits Congress and the states to enact laws regulating \n     federal campaign expenditures and contributions.\n       Whatever one's position may be on campaign finance reform \n     and how best to achieve it, a constitutional amendment of the \n     kind here proposed is not the solution. Amending the First \n     Amendment for the first time in our history in the way that \n     S.J. Res. 18 proposes would challenge all pre-existing First \n     Amendment jurisprudence and would give to Congress and the \n     states unprecedented, sweeping and undefined authority to \n     restrict speech protected by the First Amendment since 1791.\n       Because it is vague and over-broad, S.J. Res. 18 would give \n     Congress a virtual ``blank check'' to enact any legislation \n     that may abridge a vast array of free speech and free \n     association rights that we now enjoy. In addition, this \n     measure should be opposed because it provides no guarantee \n     that congress or the states will have the political will, \n     after the amendment's adoption, to enact legislation that \n     will correct the problems in our current electoral system. \n     This amendment misleads the American people because it tells \n     them that only if they sacrifice their First Amendment \n     rights, will Congress correct the problems in our system. Not \n     only is this too high a price to demand in the name of \n     reform, it is unwise to promise the American people such an \n     unlikely outcome.\n       Rather than assuring that the electoral processes will be \n     improved, a constitutional amendment merely places new state \n     and federal campaign finance law beyond the reach of First \n     Amendment jurisprudence. All Congress and the states would \n     have to demonstrate is that its laws were ``reasonable.'' \n     ``Reasonable'' laws do not necessarily solve the problems of \n     those who are harmed by or locked out of the electoral \n     process on the basis of their third party status, lack of \n     wealth or non-incumbency. The First Amendment properly \n     prevents the government from being arbitrary when making \n     these distinctions, but S.J. Res. 18 would enable the \n     Congress to set limitations on expenditures and contributions \n     notwithstanding current constitutional understandings.\n       Once S.J. Res. 18 is adopted, Congress and local \n     governments could easily further distort the political \n     process in numerous ways. Congress and state governments \n     could pass new laws that operate to the detriment of dark-\n     horse and third party candidates. For example, with the \n     intention of creating a ``level playing field'' Congress \n     could establish equal contribution and expenditure limits \n     that would ultimately operate to the benefit of incumbents \n     who generally have a higher name recognition than their \n     opponents, and who are often able to do more with less \n     funding. Thus, rather than assure fair and free elections, \n     the proposal would enable those in power to perpetuate their \n     own power and incumbency advantage to the disadvantage of \n     those who would challenge the status quo.\n       S.J. Res. 18 would also give Congress and every state \n     legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First \n     Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the \n     press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and \n     magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable \n     operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of \n     editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered \n     editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at \n     the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in \n     support of or in opposition to particular political \n     candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would \n     authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the \n     expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly \n     reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a \n     society that cherishes the free press.\n       Even if Congress exempted the press from the amendment, \n     what rational basis would it use to distinguish between \n     certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be \n     justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run \n     unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it \n     unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase an unlimited \n     number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why \n     would it be permissible for a major weekly news magazine to \n     run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate, \n     but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to \n     raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the \n     same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that \n     is published by an advocacy group different from a major \n     daily newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of \n     candidates for federal office? Should one type of media \n     outlet be given broader free expression privileges than the \n     other? Should national media outlets have to abide by fifty \n     different state and local standards for expenditures? These \n     are questions that Congress has not adequately addressed or \n     answered.\n       Moreover, the proposed amendment appears to reach not only \n     expenditures by candidates or their agents but also the truly \n     independent expenditures by individual citizens and groups--\n     the very kind of speech that the First Amendment was designed \n     to protect.\n       If Congress or the states want to change our campaign \n     finance system, then it need not throw out the First \n     Amendment in order to do so. Congress can adopt meaningful \n     federal campaign finance reform measures without abrogating \n     the First Amendment and without contravening the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Rather than argue for these proposals, many members of \n     Congress continue to propose unconstitutional measures, such \n     as the McCain/Feingold bill that are limit-driven methods of \n     campaign finance reform that place campaign regulation on a \n     collision course with the First Amendment. . . .\n       The ACLU urges Senators to oppose S.J. Res. 18.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Laura W. Murphy.\n\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just today the Washington Times \neditorialized, saying ``Save the First Amendment,'' very strongly in \nopposition to the Hollings amendment. I ask unanimous consent that this \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 18, 1997]\n\n                        Save the First Amendment\n\n       ``The First Amendment denies government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views is \n     wasteful, excessive or unwise.'' So said the U.S. Supreme \n     Court in what some now refer to as its ``infamous'' 1976 \n     ruling in the landmark case Buckly vs. Valeo. The high \n     court's decision struck down as unconstitutional post-\n     Watergate reforms restricting campaign expenditures, and \n     critics have been trying to get around the decision ever \n     since.\n       Today, the U.S. Senate is scheduled to take up a proposed \n     constitutional amendment to override the ruling and, in \n     effect, reform the reforms. South Carolina Sen. Ernest \n     Hollings, the amendment's chief backer along with \n     Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, calls it the only ``rational \n     alternative'' to a system that awarded public office to the \n     highest bidder.'' Among other things it states Congress can \n     set ``reasonable'' limits on contributions to and \n     expenditures by candidates for federal office. It gives \n     states similar powers to control state campaign spending.\n       The proposed amendment is but the first shot in a battle \n     over campaign finance reform that gets hotter with each new \n     story about the golden handshakes Mr. Clinton got from \n     contributors during the last presidential campaign. Still to \n     come is the McCain-Feingold bill to put ``voluntary'' limits \n     on campaign contributions and an effort to provide for \n     taxpayer financing of campaigns or, as critics refer to the \n     idea, food stamps for politicians.\n       Arrayed against the Hollings amendment is a formidable \n     coalition of interest groups ranging from the American Civil \n     Liberties to the National Rifle Association, who have little \n     in common other than the principle that limiting \n     contributions and expenditures will restrict the right of \n     their members to free speech. These days, some speech costs a \n     lot, whether in the form of commercials, mailings or bumper \n     stickers. Cutting off funds in this case inevitably means \n     cutting off your ability to disseminate your message--free \n     speech, in other words.\n       At the head of the coalition is Kentucky Sen. Mitch \n     McConnell, whom Ellen Miller of Public Campaign calls the \n     Darth Vader of campaign-finance reform, so successful has \n     he been in blocking the proposed changes. Mr. McConnell is \n     an unapologetic defender of the political debate that \n     comes of campaign spending. Indeed, he considers such \n     spending to be evidence of the robust debate indispensible \n     to the well-being of the country.\n       If such a position makes him the Darth Vader of campaign \n     reform, then here's hoping the force, so to speak, is with \n     him. Campaign spending is one measure of the power government \n     has to manipulate political and economic ends to the benefit \n     of one group or another. If you want to limit spending, limit \n     the power and watch how quickly the fund-raisers dissipate.\n       Short of that, there is a danger that tightened regulations \n     may tilt campaign laws to benefit one group or other. If you \n     limit soft-money contributions to political parties, for \n     example, you may end up giving an edge to organized labor, \n     which favors candidates with in-kind and off-the-books \n     contributions in the form of get-out-the-vote drives and \n     phone banks.\n       There are also free-speech concerns with government \n     campaign financing. Why should taxpayers have to see their \n     hard-earned dollars go to support candidates with whom they \n     disagree?\n       Does the current system really favor those candidates with \n     deep pockets? Ask Oliver North, Michael Huffington and Steve \n     Forbes, all of whom raised and spent huge sums of money, in \n     some cases their own, without winning office.\n       The best kind of reform, long advocated here, would drop \n     spending limits and increase disclosure. As University of \n     Virginia professor Larry Sabato has put it, ``Let a well-\n     informed marketplace, rather than a committee of federal \n     bureaucrats, be the judge of whether someone has accepted too \n     much money from a particular interest group or spent too much \n     to win an election. Reformers who object to money in politics \n     would lose little under such a scheme, since the current \n     system--itself a product of reform--has already utterly \n     failed to inhibit special-interest influence.''\n       Congress shouldn't aggravate the problem by gutting the \n     First Amendment.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I referred earlier to a press conference that I \nhappened to have had Friday with various groups opposed to this \namendment and also opposed to McCain-Feingold. The press conference was \nreally about both. Among the groups organized in opposition: the \nNational Taxpayers Union, the National Right to Life Committee, the \nNational Rifle Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, the \nChristian Coalition, the Direct Marketing Association, the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters, the National Assocation of Business PAC's, \nthe National Education Association, the National Association of \nRealtors.\n  All of these groups, which represent over 15 million American \ncitizens, are saying in effect to the Congress, do not amend the first \namendment for the first time in 200 years. Do not pass a measure like \nMcCain-Feingold. Do not shut us up. We are not part of the problem. We \nare busily at work expressing our point of view, arguing for the causes \nthat we think are important. This is totally American. This is the \nessence of America.\n  And so those groups came together last Friday in an effort to express \nthemselves about this proposal to amend the first amendment and also \nMcCain-Feingold. I think one of the most interesting speakers was from \nan organization with which I am seldom aligned, the National Education \nAssociation. Don Morabito, who is from the NEA, was at the press \nconference, and he said, ``The fact is,'' referring to the groups in \nthe room, ``We don't represent the same people, don't contribute to the \nsame candidates and don't believe in the same things,'' with one \nexception. We agree on the first amendment. We agree on the first \namendment.\n  The ACLU, in referring to the proposal before us, said the \nconstitutional amendment is ``truly an abhorrent proposal,'' with \n``breathtaking implications, and McCain-Feingold is draconian \nregulation.'' ``And if you want to talk `unseemly,' added ACLU \nWashington director Laura Murphy, what about the current reform \nproposal's efforts to `demonize' special interests and political action \ncommittees that follow the law?''\n  So I think it is important to remember what the current feeding \nfrenzy is all about. We all thought it was about illegal, illegal \nactivity, and there seems to have been a good deal of that particularly \nat the White House and in the Democratic campaign for President last \nyear, but now the effort is to switch, change the subject and to pass \neither a constitutional amendment or some legislation to take American \ncitizens out of the game.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, would it be appropriate to say, I ask my \nfriend from Kentucky, that at the present time under the first \namendment the American people are free to participate in their \npolitical system and in public affairs pretty much in any way they \nwish, that their freedom of speech is entirely unlimited?\n  And would it be fair also to say that the thrust of this \nconstitutional amendment is that its sponsors are asking the American \npeople to give the Congress of the United States the right to devise, \nto knit together a gag which is then to be applied to the American \npeople themselves, not just candidates but to any American who wishes \nto express his views about a candidate, any organization that wishes to \nexpress its views about a candidate, for that matter, any newspaper or \ntelevision station that wishes to express its view about a candidate; \nthat this constitutional amendment says that what has been entirely \nfree, an entirely free process, we now ask that you allow us to impose \nwhatever we consider to be a reasonable gag upon your exercise of that \nright?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Washington, he is \nabsolutely correct. He describes the constitutional amendment with \nprecision. And that is exactly what the sponsors of this proposal have \nin mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for up to 10 minutes to speak on \nthe joint resolution under the control of the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to my cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the majority leader is on his way to the \nfloor. Apparently there is a unanimous-consent request. As soon as he \ngets here, I will be glad to yield to him at that time.\n  Mr. President, I support this constitutional amendment for campaign \nfinance reform and for overturning Buckley versus Valeo because I am \nconvinced that only if we have such a constitutional amendment will we \nbe able to have meaningful campaign finance reform. And that is \nurgently needed.\n  Those who oppose the amendment do so on a claim that there would be \nan invasion of inviolate first amendment protections. I suggest those \narguments are not well founded as a matter of constitutional law or \nconstitutional history.\n  The first amendment of the U.S. Constitution has been limited where \nthere are important reasons for doing so. Perhaps the most famous \ndecision is by Oliver Wendell Holmes on what is called the ``clear and \npresent danger'' which would warrant limiting freedom of speech. The \nfamous example was given of crying ``fire'' in a crowded theater.\n  And, Mr. President, I suggest that there is a clear and present \ndanger today to America's political system if we do not have effective \ncampaign finance reform.\n  The ``fighting words'' exception to freedom of speech is well \nrecognized in a distinguished opinion by Justice Murphy. If someone \nsays to another a racial slur or religious slur, that person may punch \nthe speaker in the nose and not be charged with assault and battery, so \nthat freedom of speech is limited by fighting words.\n  You have the examples of obscenity and moral standards, especially \nwith children. There are limits as to what may be spoken or what may be \nput into printed context on obscenity.\n  It is my view, and really a prevailing view in America today, that \nthere is an urgent necessity for campaign finance reform. It simply \ncannot be done if you have the Supreme Court decisions standing in the \nway, because they say that an individual may spend as much of his or \nher money as he or she may choose as a matter of freedom of speech but \nothers cannot do so. Others are limited to $1,000.\n  I have cited a rather forceful example from my point of view of my \nown personal experience running in the primary in 1976 for the U.S. \nSenate when the 1974 law was in effect limiting expenditures for a \ncandidate in the primary with the population size of Pennsylvania to \n$35,000. And my opponent in that race--who later was one of my very \nbest friends and closest colleagues in the U.S. Senate, Senator John \nHeinz--we were opposing each other in that Senate primary.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States held that an individual could \nspend millions, and Senator Heinz did that, spent more than $3 million \nin that primary and general election. But at the same time, the Supreme \nCourt upheld the limitation of $1,000 on what my brother could spend. \nWhere was Morton Specter's freedom of speech if he was limited by the \ncampaign finance law to $1,000?\n  What sense does it make to say that a candidate has more freedom of \nspeech than some other contributor? But that is what the Buckley versus \nValeo decision did.\n  Then you have this rule or exception on campaign expenditures which \nare independent. That has become a practical impossibility to define \nwhat is an independent expenditure.\n  You have the 1996 Presidential election. You have an enormous amount \nof soft money raised on both sides by Republicans as well as Democrats, \nbut the Democrats did it with more finesse, more direction, and more \nsuccess, when President Clinton used millions of dollars in soft money \nfor advertising in 1995, which so set the stage to make it impossible \nor at least virtually impossible to regain that ground. In this \nsituation you had President Clinton personally editing the commercials \nwhich went over. Yet, they were supposed to be somehow immune from the \nFederal election laws, notwithstanding the fact that when a candidate \nruns for President there is a pledge that there will be no funds used \non expenditures in addition to what the Federal Government is \nproviding.\n\n  We have myriad rules on soft money. We have rules that are really \nimpossible to apply on what is issue advocacy, where you can spend \nmoney, as opposed to advocacy for a candidate. Those commercials not \nonly go right to the line, they really cross the line, with no \nenforcement possible, with a commercial saying everything but ``vote \nfor candidate John Doe.''\n  The realism is that in the absence of an opportunity for Congress to \nlegislate in this field, without this constitutional inhibition, \ncampaign finance reform may not be achieved.\n  Then you had the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates in 1996 on the Colorado legal party where there are four \nopinions written and not one of the opinions commands the consent or \nconcurrence of five Justices. So when you finish reading that opinion, \nit is absolutely impossible to say what the law is on the important \ncampaign issues taken up in that case. The Supreme Court Justices are \nfrequent in their criticism of what we pass in the Congress where they \ncannot find a clear-cut statement on our legislation and then they look \nto legislative intent. Some of the Justices say they cannot find \nlegislative intent or they do not recognize legislative intent.\n  Our statutes are a model of clarity, and the worst of the statutes \never passed by the Congress of the United States is a model of clarity \ncompared to what you had in the Supreme Court decision in the Colorado \ncase, where you cannot possibly figure out what the law is, because \namong four opinions no five Justices have agreed on any set rationale \nto give guidance as to what the law should be.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, since the majority leader has arrived, \nit is my view, after studying the Constitution for more than 40 years, \nthat the decision of Buckley versus Valeo simply is not good \nconstitutional law to equate speech with campaign spending. It impedes, \nobstructs, and prevents Congress from legislating in this important \nfield. That is why I urge this amendment be adopted.\n  I have no doubt, Mr. President, about the outcome of today's vote. I \nsay as a matter for the future we ought to build a record, one day, so \nthat we will overturn Buckley v. Valeo, and then have some sensible \nlegislation in this very critical area.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n  Unanimous Consent Agreements--Senate Joint Resolution 22 and Senate \n                          Joint Resolution 18\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \npendency of Senate Joint Resolution 22, no amendments or motions be in \norder other than a motion to table, and at the conclusion of the vote \non passage of Senate Joint Resolution 18 at 2:45, approximately, today, \nthere then be 90 minutes for remaining debate, to be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designee, with an additional 10 \nminutes allocated to Senator Specter.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding \nback of debate time for Senate Joint Resolution 22 on Tuesday, the \njoint resolution be temporarily laid aside, and Senator Leahy or his \ndesignee be recognized to offer a joint resolution relative to the \nindependent counsel, and no amendments or motions will be in order, \nother than a motion to table, and that there then be 90 minutes of \ndebate to be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, and an additional 30 minutes under the control of Senator \nFeingold, 20 minutes under the control of Senator Byrd, 30 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Levin, 20 minutes under the control of \nSenator Nickles, and 40 minutes under the control of Senator Coats.\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time today, the second joint resolution be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, this agreement would \ncall for two rollcall votes on the independent counsel issue. However, \nthe votes have not been ordered by consent yet. I hope to discuss \nfurther with the Democratic leader today exactly when that will occur \nso that we can schedule those two votes.\n  I should note that we have one Senator who had a death in the family. \nWe want to make sure that he is able to be back here for that vote.\n  In light of this agreement, there will be no further votes after the \n2:45 vote today. Members should be prepared to vote tomorrow around 10 \no'clock on the independent counsel issue.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with considerable interest \nto the observations of my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, \nabout the, as he put it, ill-advised Buckley decision.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, I think the Buckley decision was an \noutstanding decision. Obviously, the Supreme Court feels it was because \nthey have had a number of opportunities in the last 20 years to revisit \nit, refine it, cut it back, restrict it, and in each instance they have \nexpanded it further in the direction of more and more freedom to speak \nin the political process in this country.\n  The essence of the Buckley decision was in several passages that bear \nrepeating as we move here toward the vote on this constitutional \namendment to, in effect, overturn the Buckley case. The Court said with \nregard to spending limits, ``The first amendment denies Government the \npower to determine that spending to promote one's political views is \nwasteful, excessive, or unwise. In a free society ordained by our \nConstitution, it is not the Government,'' said the Court, ``not the \nGovernment, but the people individually as citizens and candidates, and \ncollectively as associations and political committees who must retain \ncontrol over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a \npolitical campaign.''\n  Now, Mr. President, that really sums it up here. Who will control the \npolitical discourse? The Court had that issue directly before it in the \nBuckley case, and the Court said the Government is not going to control \npolitical speech in this country consistent with the first amendment.\n  Now, Senator Hollings understands that, and he is offering this \nconstitutional amendment to allow the Government to control political \ndiscourse for the first time in the history of our country. It leads \nyou to ask the question: Who will feel more comfortable if we, the \nCongress, are in charge of regulating and controlling political speech \nin this country? Well, I do not think our citizens will feel more \ncomfortable with that. That is clearly the end result of this debate, \nbecause this amendment says, in effect, the Buckley case will be \noverridden so that the amount of expenditures that may be made by, that \nis, by the campaigns, in support of the campaigns or in opposition to \nthe campaigns shall be regulated by the Government.\n  All of us in here will have the last word on just how much speech is \nallowed, not only the quantity of it but the range of it.\n  Now, the Buckley case went on to say that a restriction on the amount \nof money a person or group can spend on political communication during \na campaign necessarily, Mr. President, reduces the quantity of \nexpression. So what we have after this amendment is the Government with \nthe power to control how much we get to speak.\n  The Court said: ``* * * reduces the quantity of expression by \nrestricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \nexploration, and the size of the audience reached.'' That pretty well \nsays it all. Under the Hollings amendment, the Government will be able \nto decide how much we get to speak, how big an audience we get to \nreach. In short, the Government would control political discourse in \nthis country. The Court went on to say that ``this is because''--\nreferring to their opposition to spending restrictions--``virtually \nevery means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires \nexpenditure of money.'' It is a fact, whether we like it or not, to the \nextent that the Government defines what your financial outlays can be, \nif you are a candidate or if you are a group in support of or in \nopposition to a candidate, the Government is saying, in effect, you \nonly get so much speech, a rationing of speech. And we here in the \nCongress get to determine how much everybody talks.\n  I don't think it is much of a reach to suggest that we are going to \nwant to shut down those who criticize us. We don't like these \nindependent expenditures in particular. We certainly don't like what \nour opponents are saying about us. So what we would do in the aftermath \nof the Hollings amendment is shut those people up. We would probably--\nin terms of independent groups--shut them entirely up. In terms of our \nopponents, we would set the spending limit so low they would not have a \nchance and never will be able to get the message across, because \nvirtually every incumbent starts off ahead, and if the other fellow \ncan't get resources, he is going to stay ahead.\n  The Court went on to say, in Buckley, ``Even distribution of the \nhumblest handbill costs money.'' Further, the Court stated, ``The \nelectorate's increasing dependence on television and radio for news and \ninformation makes these expensive modes of communication indispensable \nelements of effective political speech.'' Indispensable elements of \neffective political speech.\n  Now, the Buckley case was right on the mark. They understood what it \ntakes to speak in today's modern American society. It is not a question \nof whether we like it or not. This is a fact. It is as certain as the \nSun is going to come up tomorrow. It is as certain as the Sun is going \nto come up tomorrow. Without the resources to market the message in \nthis society, your speech is quieted--under the Hollings amendment \nquieted by the Government, which will control your discourse.\n  The Court in the Buckley case further said, ``There is nothing \ninvidious, improper, or unhealthy in a campaign spending money to \ncommunicate.'' There is nothing unhealthy about that. Nothing is \ninherently unhealthy about that. With regard to the growth in campaign \nspending, which was anticipated in 1976 and certainly has occurred, the \nCourt said, ``The mere growth in the cost of Federal election campaigns \nin and of itself provides no basis for Government restrictions on the \nquantity of campaign spending.''\n  In other words, the Court was saying a lot of speaking is not bad, \nand an effort to try to restrict the amount of speaking to some \nGovernment-prescribed formula is a clear violation of the first \namendment, which is why we are now voting on the amendment of the \nSenator from South Carolina to give the Government the power to control \npolitical discourse in this country.\n  The Court also addressed the issue of the level playing field. We \noften hear that. Proponents of bills, for example, like McCain-\nFeingold, say they want to ``level the playing field.'' This is what \nBuckley had to say about leveling the playing field. The Court said, \n``The concept that Government may restrict the speech of some elements \nof our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is \nwholly foreign to the first amendment.'' In other words, the notion \nthat the Government is wise enough to level the playing field is \nabhorrent to the first amendment.\n\n  After all, if you think about it, it would be impossible to level the \nplaying field. How is the playing field leveled if you only leveled the \namount of money? I would say that in my State of Kentucky, in order to \nhave a remotely level playing field, you would have to get 600,000 \npeople to change their registration and two major newspapers to leave \nthe State. Then you might have, in some ways, a level playing field.\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\n Then, of course, what happens when your opponent is famous, maybe a \nwell-known athlete or a war hero, or somebody who has a special place \nin the hearts of the American people? How is the playing field leveled \nthen? The Government has prescribed how much you can speak in the \ncampaign. Your opponent starts off 5 yards from scoring a touchdown, \nand you're way back on your own 20, and the Government says this is how \nmuch you get to communicate with the constituents. In what way is that \na level playing field? In fact, the Court rejected out of hand the \nlevel playing field argument.\n  So the Buckley decision was a sound decision. The Supreme Court \nbelieves it is a sound decision. They have reinforced it time and time \nagain over the last 20 years. This amendment basically has no \nconstituency. Common Cause, the principal group supporting various \nkinds of campaign finance reform, opposes the Hollings amendment. The \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union opposes the constitutional amendment. \nEven our dear colleague, Senator McCain, who differs with me on this \nissue, opposes this amendment. This is an amendment without a \nconstituency. The Washington Post, who is certainly interested in its \nversion of campaign finance reform, opposes this amendment.\n  In short, Mr. President, regardless of how you may feel about which \nkind of campaign finance reform might be appropriate, amending the \nfirst amendment for the first time in 200 years to give the Government \nthe power to control the political discourse in this country by \nindividuals, groups, candidates, and parties is a substantial \noverreaching and a dangerous step in the wrong direction. I think it \ncould probably be argued persuasively that this is the kind of speech \nthat the Framers of our Constitution had most in mind when they were \nwriting the first amendment. They were just beginning the process of \nhaving elections and dealing with the issue of campaigning. Certainly \nat the heart of what they had in mind when they talked about free \nspeech was free political speech.\n  After this amendment, pornography and flag burning would have more \nprotection under the first amendment than political discourse. \nPolitical discourse would be singled out among all the other kinds of \nexpression that we are free to engage in in this country under the \nfirst amendment; political discourse would be singled out and handed \nover to Government control. Mr. President, this is clearly a step we \nshould not take. I hope the amendment will be substantially defeated.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is rather amusing to hear my \ndistinguished colleague say that this particular initiative is \n``without a constituency.'' The constituency started 10 years ago with \nthe Commission on the Constitutional System. I have quoted a group of \nseveral hundred present and former legislators, executive branch \nofficials, political party officials, professors, and civic leaders who \nare interested in analyzing and correcting the weaknesses that have \ndeveloped under our political system since the Buckley case.\n  We have the support of 44 law professors, which I have inserted into \nthe Record, as well as 24 State attorneys general. When I introduced \nthis joint resolution in some 10 years ago, it was only relevant and \npertaining to the Federal Government. The States came and begged and \nsaid, ``Amend the Buckley ruling and include protection for us also.'' \nThe cities came and said, ``Amend it, please, and include the \nprotection for the cities also.''\n  Yet, my distinguished colleague says that he has the endorsement of \nthe Washington Post and the ACLU. He had better not let many on his \nside of the aisle hear that or they will start changing their votes. I \nknow that crowd over there. I can tell you, Mr. President, we need to \nexamine the very authority that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky \nuses--the Buckley case--which he said was good. He said it was good \n1976 it is good in 1997. He says it's good and that ``we don't want, \nneed the Hollings resolution.'' Incidentally, it is the Hollings-\nSpecter. I don't know whether they are ashamed to have a Republican \ncosponsor it. They don't mind saying ``McCain-Feingold,'' but they \ndon't want to say ``Hollings-Specter.'' But I do appreciate the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania joining in. I understand also \nthat my colleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, has asked for time. I \nwas waiting to make sure he had a moment. But in any event, I admire \ntheir courage for joining me because apparently they have made this \ninto a party position. When I lose my good friend, the Senator from \nAlabama, Senator Shelby, who cosponsored this three times and now comes \nand says he is worried about the freedom of speech, I know the pressure \nis on. But, after saying Buckley is good, they then say vote against \nthe Hollings initiative. They argue that my amendment would be the \nfirst time in 200 years we have limited the freedom of speech, whereby \nthere is no question that this is exactly what the Buckley decision \ndoes. The Buckley decision limits the freedom of speech of those who \nwish to contribute in political campaigns. The Buckley decision limits \nto this very moment the freedom of speech of political action \ncommittees. He talks about this being the first time in 200 years, yet \nhe has to acknowledge that their authority shows the spurious nature of \ntheir defense.\n\n  Mr. President, what we have is what the Senator from Utah, Senator \nHatch, said would gut the freedom-of-speech provision for the first \ntime. Yet, we have already had it gutted in the Buckley decision. \nThereupon, as the Chief Justice said in his dissenting opinion, it is \nhalf a haircut. You can't deal with the contributions without dealing \nwith the expenditures of those contributions--both sides of the same \ncoin, as he expressed it.\n  So we have been at this now for 20 years. We have had over 240 votes \nin Congress on campaign finance reform. What we have finally come to is \nnot the question of how but the question of whether or not we are going \nto really limit. Heretofore, for 20 years we have had Common Cause say \nthat this measure is public financing. We have had McCain-Feingold say, \nif you will voluntarily limit yourself, you can get free time, free TV \ntime, free mailing time, and everything. All of those initiatives were \ndealing with how to limit. But now, my good friend from Kentucky says \nreally we should not limit it at all.\n  That is the vote. If you want to limit, this is the way to give the \nauthority to the national Congress to limit it. If you do not want to \nlimit it, then vote against it. If you want reform, if you want to \nreally get on top of this problem, we don't tell you how to do it. But \nyou have to have the authority within the people's national Congress to \nactually limit it. That is the resolution. A constitutional amendment \nwhich is just as significant--in fact, more important than-- five of \nthe last six amendments to the national Constitution dealing with \nelections. Adopt it, if you please, and in 18.5 months--the average of \nthose five--I would dare say that with the constituency we have of the \ncities, the States, the interest, and the people, this would be \nratified in the 1998 November election.\n  They have worked it pretty good in a partisan fashion to try to bring \nin the freedom of speech, by saying money is speech. But it can't be. \nBut what we are talking about is paid speech, not free speech. You go \ndown to the Washington Post, which he says endorses this, and ask them \nfor a quarter page or half page, and see how much free speech you get \nout of that newspaper.\n  What we are talking about is the right to control the election. The \nwar in the field of battle, as the distinguished Senator Inouye knows, \nis won by those who control air over the battlefield. Those who control \nthe airwaves win political elections. There isn't any question about \nit. Money talks here. If we can't get on top of this monster, as \nElizabeth Drew has said, we will never be able to save the process. We \nwill never be able to save the democracy itself. Chief Justice Jackson \nsaid that the Constitution is not a suicide compact. We can move after \n20 years to address this important problem facing our nation. We should \nmove.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just a couple of observations about the \nvote just completed.\n  The constitutional amendment to strip political speech out of the \nfirst amendment and give the Government the power to control said \nspeech was just defeated 61 to 38. We have had previous votes on the \nHollings amendment in other years.\n  I would just like to mention for the benefit of my colleagues this is \nthe biggest vote against the Hollings amendment yet achieved in the \nSenate. The opponents of this amendment included all but 4 Republicans \nand 11 Democrats. So I think it was a very encouraging indication of \ngrowing support for protecting the first amendment.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for this overwhelming vote against the \namendment. Also I thank Tamara Somerville and Lani Gerst for their \ncontinuing good work on this issue. They are both members of my staff.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2394-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2397-S2411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  APPOINTMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF \n                          ILLEGAL FUNDRAISING\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 22, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 22) to express the sense of \n     the Congress concerning the application by the Attorney \n     General for the appointment of an independent counsel to \n     investigate allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 \n     Presidential election campaign.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is my understanding, under the previous \nunanimous consent agreement, that discussion and debate will be taking \nplace on either the resolution that Senators just voted on or the \npending independent counsel resolution. Is that a correct assumption?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nIndiana has 40 minutes under the agreement.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I do not believe I will consume the full 40 \nminutes. In fact, I am sure I will not. And if I finish before that, I \nwould be happy to yield that time back to expedite the process.\n  Mr. President, I generally believe that the Senate floor should be a \nplace to talk about issues, not about scandals. So my first inclination \nis to voice my support for an independent counsel and hope the process \nwill take its course. The need for this investigation should be beyond \nquestion, proven on the front page of the newspaper every morning.\n  Under normal circumstances, there would be little more to say. But \nthis circumstance is not normal because it now concerns some of the \nmost disturbing questions that can be asked in a democracy.\n  Was the executive power of the White House abused to improperly \ninfluence the outcome of an American Presidential election?\n  Were foreign governments invited by the Democratic Party and the \nClinton administration to corrupt American elections?\n  Was the privilege of American citizenship distorted and undermined to \nserve the President's reelection?\n  And now we are forced to ask, were American intelligence services \nmanipulated by this administration as part of its fundraising machine?\n  The revelations that began last October, and have continued until \nthis morning, do not primarily concern the low standards of our current \ncampaign finance system. Those standards, it has been argued, should be \nchanged. We will be debating that in this body.\n  What the almost daily revelations we have seen do concern are the \nlegal and ethical breaches of the current standards by the Clinton \nadministration. And that charge is different in kind in the seriousness \nfrom the policy debate on campaign finance reform.\n  It is not the technical violation of campaign finance law that \nprimarily concern me. Those are for lawyers and prosecutors to debate \nand decide. The issue is far greater than the sum of those ethical and \nlegal problems. All of the strands of this scandal--high-pressure soft-\nmoney fundraising, illegal foreign contributions, the abuse of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service and of the CIA--reveal an \nadministration obsessed with reelection, indifferent to ethical rules \nand organized to skirt the law.\n  All of these efforts were directed toward one event, and one date: \nThe Presidential election on November 5, 1996.\n  There are countless complex elements to this scandal, but only one \ncentral issue. Was the executive branch of Government corrupted and \ncompromised by a rogue political election operation centered in the \nDemocratic National Committee, the Office of the President, the Office \nof the Vice President, and the Office of the First Lady?\n  By definition--no matter what the justification--this would not just \nbe a violation of legal and ethical standards regarding campaign \nfinancing, but arguably a crime against democracy itself.\n  The most recent revelation is one of the most damaging. We now know \nthat the Central Intelligence Agency was used by the Democratic \nNational Committee to encourage access to the President by Roger \nTamraz, an international fugitive and major donor to the Democrat \nParty.\n  We know that Donald Fowler, chairman of the DNC, made a call to the \nCIA asking that that agency provide classified information to the White \nHouse about Mr. Tamraz and his business interests in a pipeline project \nfunded partially by Chinese businessmen.\n  When the National Security Council refused to recommend a meeting \nbetween Mr. Tamraz and President Clinton, the White House eventually \nscheduled at least four that we know of. One meeting in April 1996 took \nplace while Mr. Tamraz was being sought for questioning by Interpol, \nthe international\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\npolice agency, for bank fraud in Lebanon. Mr. Tamraz made $177,000 in \ndonations to Democrat causes and maintained business ties with both \nSaddam Hussein's Iraq and Muammar Qadhafi's Libya.\n\n  The White House has responded by saying in effect, as they have said \nto every issue that has been raised regarding their ethics and \nregarding their fundraising operation, ``Well, everyone is doing it.''\n  Mr. President, unless there are things going on here in the Senate \nthat I do not know about, the White House defense that ``everyone is \ndoing it'' does not apply here.\n  It has been said that the confirmation process is at fault in the \nwithdrawal of the Anthony Lake nomination, the individual who headed \nthe National Security Council during these events.\n  The fault, in fact, Mr. President, lies elsewhere. The Lake \nnomination was eventually undermined because he was forced to operate \nin the heart of a political fundraising machine whose abuses are being \nrevealed to us in expanded detail each day.\n  The White House blames partisan Republicans, but the final straw in \nthe failure of this nomination came because our intelligence services \nwere politicized for partisan political advantage.\n  We are not entirely sure what Mr. Lake's role was in this. That is \nthe reason why we requested interviews with NSC staff, interviews that \nwere denied, and why we were going to seek today subpoenas to order \nthose interviews to take place.\n  But we do know what the White House role was. And it was clearly \ninappropriate. If Anthony Lake is the victim of a political process \ngone haywire, that political process is to be found in the White House \nitself.\n  The most recent revelation is part of a pattern, a pattern of abusing \nexecutive power for political ends.\n  Concerning political solicitation at the White House, we now know \nthat the Office of the President, the Office of the Vice President, and \nthe Office of the First Lady were all involved in these efforts.\n  We know that the President's request for immediate action on \nfundraising in early 1995--the written message that read ``ready to \nstart overnights right away''--we know that this began a program of \nWhite House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom overnights that eventually \nraised nearly $40 million.\n  We know that an unsigned memo was written to Martha Phipps, deputy \nchief of staff to the chairman of the Democratic Party, which suggested \n10 White House rewards for major donors: two seats on Air Force One, \ntwo seats on Air Force Two; six seats at all private dinners; six to \neight spots at all White House ceremonies and events; official \ndelegation trips abroad; better coordination on appointments to boards \nand commissions; White House mess privileges; White House resident \nvisits and overnight stays; guaranteed Kennedy Center tickets; six \nradio address spots; photo opportunities with White House principals.\n  We know, Mr. President, that at least 7 of these 10 perks were \nactually used in fundraising efforts. We know that the administration, \nin its fundraising efforts, applied few, if any, ethical standards to \nthose who were given access to the White House.\n  Included in the White House coffees with President Clinton were a \nmajor drug dealer, a twice-convicted felon for theft and tax offenses, \na Chinese arms dealer, and an international fugitive on conspiracy and \nembezzlement charges.\n  We know that the Vice President, Mr. Gore, solicited campaign \ncontributions by telephone from his White House office on more than 50 \noccasions. One business figure who received a call recounts--and I \nquote--``There were elements of a shakedown in the call. It was very \nawkward. For a Vice President, particularly this Vice President who has \nreal power and is the heir apparent, to ask for money gave me no \nchoice.''\n  We know that the First Lady's chief of staff, Margaret Williams, \naccepted a $50,000 political contribution at the White House.\n  We know that Harold Ickes, assistant to the President, wrote a memo \nto a major Democrat contributor advising him on ways to make a $5 \nmillion contribution to the Democratic National Committee tax \ndeductible. The three-page document detailed how such a contribution \ncould be filtered through 501(c)3 organizations that were helpful to \nDemocrat reelection efforts. In the memo, Mr. Ickes wrote, ``If \npossible, it would be greatly appreciated if the following amounts \ncould be wired to designated banks.''\n  We know there was a clear direction from the President and First Lady \nto use a White House computer database for political purposes. That \ndatabase, by the way, was purchased with $1.7 million of taxpayer \ndollars. One memo marked ``Confidential'' from White House political \naide Marsha Scott argues that the database be made available ``to the \n[Democrat National Committee] and other entities we choose to work with \nfor political purposes.'' On this memo are the handwritten words, \n``This sounds promising. Please advise.'' Signed HRC.\n  Another memo from Ms. Scott, to Erskine Bowles, the President's \ncurrent chief of staff, outlines a plan to use the database to reward \nsupporters with ``trinkets'' and access. The memo concludes, ``This is \nthe President's idea and it is a good one.''\n  Another memo from Ms. Scott to Thomas McLarty, the President's former \nchief of staff, states of this plan, ``Both the President and the First \nLady have asked me to make this my top priority.''\n  We know, Mr. President, that former White House counsel Bernard \nNussbaum, early in the Clinton administration, had contributed a memo \ntitled ``Criminal Statutes.'' In that memo he wrote, ``A number of \ncriminal statutes prohibit the use of Federal programs, [Federal] \nproperty or employment for political purposes. Violation of these \ncriminal statutes is punishable by imprisonment and/or payment of a \nsubstantial fine.'' The memo went on to outline the type of activities \nclearly prohibited by the law: ``Soliciting or receiving campaign \ncontributions on Federal property or in Federal buildings. This means \nthat fundraising events may not be held [--may not be held--] at the \nWhite House; that no fundraising phone calls or mail may emanate from \nthe White House or any other Federal buildings; and that no campaign \ncontributions may be accepted at the White House or any other Federal \nbuildings.''\n  So, Mr. President, based on the Nussbaum memo, the former White House \ncounsel memo, then White House counsel, we know this administration was \nfully informed of these ethical and legal standards, the standards of \nthe current system, but we also know those standards were broadly and \nrepeatedly violated at every level of the Clinton White House.\n  And then there is the issue of White House political involvement in \nforeign political contributions.\n  We know that many of the principal figures in the current scandal--\nincluding John Huang, Charlie Trie and Johnny Chung--have been longtime \nClinton supporters, some brought to Washington from Arkansas. They have \nhad open access to this administration --Huang visiting the White House \n78 times in 15 months and Chung visiting at least 49 times.\n  We know that Johnny Chung took six Chinese businessmen to the White \nHouse to hear President Clinton's radio address on March 11, 1996, in \nexchange for a $50,000 contribution to the Democratic National \nCommittee--the contribution that was given to Margaret Williams on \nMarch 17.\n  We know that Charlie Trie attempted to make a $460,000 contribution \nto the President's legal defense fund, claiming the money was collected \nfrom a variety of sources. Yet the serial numbers on the money orders \nwere sequential and much of the handwriting was identical. Initially, \nonly $70,000 of the money was returned. It took several months for the \nlaw firm overseeing the fund to return the remainder of the \ncontribution.\n  We know, Mr. President, that John Huang was an official at \nthe Clinton Commerce Department with a top-secret security clearance. \nWhile an official at Commerce, he recommended policies unfavorable to \nTaiwan and supported by China. We know that John Huang visited the \nChinese Embassy at least two times during his tenure. In one instance, \nMr. Huang requested top-secret documents on May 10, 1995, the day he \nwas scheduled to meet the Chinese Ambassador.\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\n  We know that in an Oval Office meeting on September 13, 1995 --\nincluding President Clinton, Bruce Lindsey, John Huang, and James \nRiady, the Indonesian head of the Lippo Group--a decision was made to \ntransfer Mr. Huang to the Democratic National Committee where he became \nvice chairman of finance.\n  We know that John Huang approached officials of the Asian American \nBusiness Roundtable with a plan to channel more than $250,000 through \nroundtable members to the Democratic National Committee in return for a \n$45,000 kickback.\n  We know Huang helped arrange a California fundraiser at a Buddhist \ntemple, attended by Vice President Gore, in which illegal contributions \nwere transmitted to the DNC through third parties. One participant was \npaid $5,000 in cash in small bills and told to write a check. Vice \nPresident Gore claimed for 2 months he was unaware this event was a \nfundraiser. But a memo later surfaced that revealed that Vice President \nGore's staff had briefed him on the fundraising purpose of the event.\n  We know that John Huang raised more than $3 million for Democrats in \nillegal contributions from Asian sources.\n  We know that the FBI, based on surveillance of the Chinese Embassy, \nexpressed serious concerns that the Chinese Government was attempting \nto influence American elections through illegal contributions. That \ninformation was communicated to two officials at the Clinton White \nHouse in June of 1996. For reasons that for the moment are unclear, Mr. \nPresident, that information was not acted upon.\n  Another area of White House political involvement concerns the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service.\n  We know in September 1995 a Democrat activist from Illinois wrote to \nthe First Lady to alert her of an ``opportunity'' presented by a new \nImmigration and Naturalization Service policy to increase the pace of \nnaturalization. Daniel Solis wrote, ``The people stuck in Chicago's \nnaturalization bottleneck represent thousands of potential voters.'' He \nadded that ``similar backlogs exist in politically important States'' \nlike California and Texas.\n  We know the Vice President's office initiated a program called \nReinventing Citizenship USA. We know the Vice President's office became \ninvolved in this project. A senior advisor to Vice President Gore sent \nan e-mail to a gentleman by the name of Dough Farbrother, another Gore \naide, in March of 1996. Mr. Farbrother, being another Vice Presidential \naide, received the memo in 1996, and that memo stated, ``The President \nis sick of this and wants action.''\n  We know that in a later message to the Vice President, Mr. Farbrother \nsaid that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is not doing \nenough to ``produce a million new citizens before election day.''\n  He concluded that, ``Unless we blast INS headquarters loose from \ntheir grip on the front line managers, we are going to have way too \nmany people still waiting for citizenship in November.''\n  We know that Mr. Farbrother later drafted a memo to President Clinton \non behalf of Vice President Gore, which stated that ``if we are too \naggressive in removing the roadblocks to success, we might be publicly \ncriticized for running a pro-Democrat voter mill and even having \nCongress stop us.''\n  We know that as a result of these efforts 180,000 people were \nprocessed without criminal background checks. Clearly, the standards of \ncitizenship were bent and broken for political purposes.\n  Mr. President, in the middle of all this political activity at the \nWhite House, designed to influence the Presidential election, Vice \nPresident Gore made the following statement: ``The ethical standards \nestablished in this White House have been the highest in the history of \nthe White House. You have a tougher code of ethics, tougher \nrequirements, strictly abided by.'' When that statement was made last \nyear, it was barely credible. Today, that statement is offensive and \noutrageous. Evidence piles upon evidence of legal and ethical \nwrongdoing in the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. President, each day, it seems, either the New York Times, or the \nWashington Post, or the Wall Street Journal, or other major, credible \ninvestigative organizations, detail new improper or illegal activity, \nor both, coming out of this administration, related to the campaign \nfinancing operation run in the White House during the last election. As \na consequence of this, I believe we are forced to three conclusions by \nthis unfolding scandal. First, the White House, in preparation for the \nelection, was turned into a political machine--more like Tammany Hall \nthan the most ethical White House in history. The staff of the \nPresident, the staff of the Vice President, the First Lady, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, and even the CIA were all \ninvolved. We are not sure exactly what the direct involvement was of \nthe President. We know the Vice President, who was referred to as \n``solicitor in chief,'' was a key player in all of this, in one way or \nanother, Mr. President, with fundraising or increasing the number of \nDemocrat voters. There was even use of the CIA in the operation to fund \nthis election, which was conducted in an unprecedented and \nextraordinary and very disturbing way. Clearly, all the advantages of \nthe executive branch were employed in the President's reelection \neffort.\n  Mr. President, there is something deeply disturbing and inherently \ntroubling about all of this. In a democracy, we prevent public \nofficials from using their public office to improperly influence the \noutcome of elections because such practices are, perhaps, the most \nserious form of corruption in a democracy.\n  The second conclusion from all of this is that the return of illegal \nmoney by the Democrat National Committee comes after the benefits that \nit bought, after the election is past and after the damage is done. In \nreality, the money raised by Johnny Huang and others cannot be returned \nbecause it has already been used. The DNC will simply raise new money, \nwhich is then refunded. We must not fool ourselves that returning \nillegal money is sufficient punishment, or any kind of punishment at \nall. It turns illegal funds into a campaign loan to be repaid after the \nvotes are counted. And now it is unclear just when that loan will ever \nbe repaid, because despite public announcements that the DNC is \nreturning illegal contributions, not a penny--at least a reported \npenny--has yet been returned.\n  Finally, this unfolding story of the White House improperly \ninfluencing the result of the national election is not politics as \nusual, as is so often alleged by the White House in response to each \nnew allegation. This is something unique and something uniquely \ndisturbing. This administration wants us to believe that its actions, \nif questionable, were normal practice, but we must never, Mr. \nPresident, become immune to illegality. This record of broken trust and \nbroken rules does not primarily indicate the need for campaign finance \nreform; it indicates the need for further FBI investigation. It \nindicates the need for immediate firings in the White House. It may \nindicate the need for criminal prosecutions. It certainly indicates the \nneed for independent counsel.\n\n  Every time the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, \nor other publication reports a new aspect of this scandal, the same \nresponse comes back from the White House: ``Republicans are being \npartisan. This is just politics. We all do it, so let's clean up the \nmess together.''\n  No one at the White House, in any context, seems willing to take \nresponsibility for ethical and legal violations. If the White House \nwill not assume that responsibility, then it must be imposed. Senator \nThompson's committee will doubtlessly do good work, but its results \nwill almost certainly be attacked and discounted by the Clinton \nadministration as simply ``partisan politics.'' I supported the effort \nto allow that committee to move forward in its investigation. But it is \nclear that the pattern of response from the White House now that \nwhatever is said either by this Senator on this floor, or any \nRepublican on this floor, or any Republican in a public statement, or \nconducted by any committee controlled by a Republican chairman--it's \nclear now that every question asked, every allegation made, and every \nstatement offered is simply labeled as ``partisan politics.''\n  For that reason, it seems that in the end, we have no choice but to \nproceed\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\nwith independent counsel. While far from perfect--and I have had my \nreservations about independent prosecutors--such a process, however, \nwas designed to move questions of criminality outside the political \nprocess. And those questions of criminality in this case are serious \nquestions--as serious as it gets--and may reach to the very highest \nlevels of our Government.\n  This administration has maintained its power, but has squandered its \nintegrity. It has actively undermined the integrity of an American \nPresidential election. This is a breathtaking act of political \narrogance. Yet, the President insists it was justified because, in his \nwords, ``The direction of the country was at stake.''\n  I wonder what the public response would have been, Mr. President, if \nduring the Watergate investigation of then President Nixon the response \nfrom the President, the response from the Vice President, and the \nresponse from the administration had been that all the means that we \ntook, all the things that we engaged in were justified because our \npolitical agenda and the direction of our country was at stake.\n  To overlook virtually every questionable, improper, illegal practice, \nand to overlook this 14 pages of what we know--who knows what we don't \nknow?--and simply say that it was justified on the basis that the \nagenda of this administration was so important that any law could be \nviolated, that any ethics rule could be overlooked, that any practice \ncould be undertaken, simply to advance their political agenda for the \nfuture of America, puts this country in a dangerous, dangerous \nsituation.\n  The ends do not justify the means. While the President and his party \nfeel strongly about what the agenda should be for this country, it is \nclear that there are opposing agendas that are debated every day on the \nSenate floor and in the Congress, and debated among the American \npeople. It is political arrogance to suggest that one party's political \nagenda for the future of this country justifies the kinds of campaign \npractices that took place in the reelection effort of this President.\n\n  The White House for years has chosen its own direction. That \ndirection appears to be the corruption of the very democratic process \nitself.\n  Mr. President, I believe this situation has become so serious and so \npotentially threatening, and damaging to the political process and to \nthe office of the Presidency that an independent counsel is needed, and \nneeded immediately. I, therefore, will join with many here in this body \nin a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling upon the Attorney General \nto immediately name an independent counsel, someone who is above \nreproach, whose credibility is acceptable to the American people, whose \nintegrity is unquestioned, to investigate the extraordinary serious \nallegations printed in major newspapers with great credibility. Just \nreading the quotes alone from memos obtained regarding some of these \npractices raises enough question I believe for the appointment of an \nindependent counsel.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort. Clearly the \nadministration and the White House has decided to follow the course of \nlabeling every charge as simply a partisan attack, equating campaign \nfinancing in the last congressional election with what took place at \nthe White House--and they are leagues apart in terms of degree--\nattempting to confuse the issue with phrases like ``Mistakes were \nmade''; ``We promise we won't do it again, even though we are proud of \nwhat we have done.'' The phrases and comments that seem to indicate \nthat we are all in the same pot together on this one; ``You guys did \nit. We did it. Let's put behind us what was done and move forward to \nclean up the system.''\n  I think it is time people began to take responsibility for their own \nactions. Since the White House refuses to do this, I think it is \nappropriate that we move forward with independent counsel. I will be \nsupporting the resolution to be voted on tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, if I have any time left, I yield that time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to support the resolution of \nSenator Lott calling for the Attorney General to appoint an independent \ncounsel to investigate many of the allegations of illegal activity \nconcerning the 1996 election cycle.\n  This statement--I will read most of it--is very serious. It bothers \nme as a Senator to do this. I am not a big proponent of the independent \ncounsel statute, but I think clearly it was written to avoid a conflict \nof interest between the Attorney General and covered persons, those \npersons being the President, the Vice President, and heads of national \ncommittees. I think we have seen evidence in the last 2 or 3 months \nthat there probably is a conflict of interest between the Attorney \nGeneral and the President and the Vice President and other high \nofficials within the Clinton administration.\n  In the New York Times there is an editorial that says:\n\n     Disclosures about a Chinese plan to influence the election \n     have taken the fund raising scandal to a new level of \n     seriousness and clarity. Now it is clear that any citizen \n     with a reasonable interest in the efficiency of the Federal \n     investigative agencies and the integrity of the electoral \n     process will want a full account of what went on.\n\n  I agree with that.\n  Recent news reports revealed conflicting accounts by President \nClinton, the White House, and the FBI, concerning whether the President \nwas made aware of intelligence information that the Chinese Government \nmight be trying to influence the upcoming elections. The FBI believe \nthey may attempt to funnel illegal donations into Presidential and \ncongressional campaigns. The question whether the President was aware \nof this information and if not, why it was kept from the President, is \njust one of the numerous conflicts of interest pending before the \nAttorney General.\n  It is an important issue to determine whether President Clinton was \naware of the Chinese Government's intended illegal actions before he \napproved White House coffees, lunches, and dinners with individuals \nknown to have close ties to the Chinese Government. Charlie Trie, \nPauline Kanchanalak, and Johnny Chung were allowed frequent access into \nthe White House to attend various functions and one-on-one meetings \nwith the President.\n  Mr. Chung came into the White House reportedly 49 times--and I have \nheard 51 times--and he donated over $366,000 that had to be returned. \nOne of Mr. Chung's visits came only 1 day after he delivered a $50,000 \ncheck to Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff Maggie Williams in the White \nHouse. Mr. Chung brought six Chinese businessmen into the Oval Office \nto watch the President's radio address, one of which is the vice \npresident of a Chinese company that trades weapons. They had their \nphotos taken afterward. The White House was warned about handing over \nthese pictures by the President's own NSC staff. They labeled Mr. Chung \na ``hustler'' and warned that he might use the pictures to ``enhance \nhis business.'' In spite of this, Mr. Chung also brought Chinese beer \nexecutives into the White House who evidently obtained their pictures \nwith the President since it was reported that one of these pictures was \nfeatured on a billboard advertisement for the beer company.\n  Pauline Kanchanalak visited the White House at least 26 times and \ndonated approximately $250,000 to the DNC. On the day Ms. Kanchanalak \nbrought some of her business clients to a White House coffee with the \nPresident, she donated $85,000 to the DNC and it was recorded that the \ndonation was for ``coffee with the President of the United States.'' \nMs. Kanchanalak has not been available to answer questions about any of \nthis. She apparently left the country after congressional subpoenas \nwere issued and there were news reports that documents were destroyed.\n  Charlie Trie visited the White House up to 37 times and delivered \n$640,000 in checks and money orders to the President's legal defense \nfund. The money had to be returned since it was from unverifiable \nsources. About 1 month after Mr. Trie delivered the bulk of these \nchecks, President Clinton expanded the number of members of the\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\nU.S.-Pacific Trade and Investment Policy Commission and Mr. Trie was \nappointed to that Commission. The White House denied any connection \nbetween the donations and the delivery of the money, but questions \nremain unanswered. Mr. Trie also arranged for Chinese arms merchant \nWang Jun to attend a White House coffee with President Clinton. Wang \nJun is a former officer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and was \nchairman of a Chinese company suspected of trying to import illegal \nautomatic weapons into the United States.\n  Did the President know about the Chinese Government's plan before his \nreelection campaign and his legal defense fund accepted hundreds of \nthousand of dollars in illegal donations?\n\n  Was the President aware of this information when he allowed a Chinese \narms dealer and manufacturer into the White House?\n  Was Mr. Trie's appointment to the Trade Commission related to his \ngenerous donations to help pay the President's legal expenses and to \naid his reelection efforts?\n  All of these examples show just how many conflicts of interest exist \nfor the Attorney General and the Department of Justice to investigate \nthese allegations. And that is just what they are at this point--\nallegations. However, the independent counsel statute clearly provides \nunder section 591(c)(1) and (d) of title 28, United States Code, that \nthe Attorney General may invoke the independent counsel process when \nthe Attorney General has received specific information from a credible \nsource sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate whether a \nviolation of any Federal criminal law, other than a Class B or C \nmisdemeanor or infraction, may have been committed by any other person \nif such investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice may \nresult in a personal, financial, or political conflict of interest.\n  The independent counsel statute is intended to allow the Attorney \nGeneral to request the appointment of an independent counsel when this \ntype of conflict of interest occurs involving those at the highest \nlevels of our Government and top officers of the President's political \nparty. I believe that Attorney General Reno has ample information and \nshould therefore, invoke this provision of the statute to immediately \nrequest appointment of an independent counsel.\n  Attorney General Reno testified before the Government Affairs \nCommittee in favor of the reauthorization of the act. She testified \nthat:\n\n       The reason that I support the concept of an independent \n     counsel with statutory independence is that there is an \n     inherent conflict whenever senior Executive Branch officials \n     are to be investigated by the Department and its appointed \n     head, the Attorney General. The Attorney General serves at \n     the pleasure of the President. . . .\n\n  Section 591 (a) and (d) of the independent counsel law also contains \na mandatory provision which requires the Attorney General to invoke the \nindependent counsel process whenever the Attorney General has received \nspecific information from a credible source sufficient to constitute \ngrounds to investigate whether any Federal criminal law, other than a \nClass B or C misdemeanor or infraction, may have been violated by a \ncovered person.\n  There has been specific credible information publicly reported that \nofficers and agents of the Democratic National Committee were acting \nunder the direction of and pursuant to instructions given by the \nPresident, Vice President, and other top level officials in the White \nHouse and the Clinton-Gore reelection campaign. The President, Vice \nPresident, the Clinton-Gore Reelection Campaign chairman and treasurer \nare named in the statute as covered persons.\n  If it is correct that certain officers and agents of the Democratic \nNational Committee were acting under the direction of the reelection \ncampaign and were in effect exercising authority for the campaign at \nthe national level, then it is open to interpretation whether the \nchairman and top officers of the DNC would also be covered persons \nunder the law.\n  The law also provides a list of other covered persons which includes \nthe Attorney General, certain top Justice Department officials, Cabinet \nSecretaries, and other top level administration officials. Any person \nworking in the Executive Office of the President with a salary of \n$133,500 or above is also a covered person under the law.\n  What this means is that if the Attorney General receives specific \ninformation from a credible source that any Federal criminal law, other \nthan a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction, may have been violated, \nAttorney General Reno must conduct a preliminary investigation and seek \nthe appointment of an independent counsel if further investigation is \nwarranted.\n  There are numerous Federal laws that may apply to the allegations we \nhave heard about and seen reported in the news:\n  Title 18 of the United States Code, section 599 makes it unlawful for \na candidate for Federal office to promise an appointment to any public \nor private position or employment in return for support of his \ncandidacy.\n  Section 600 makes it unlawful to promise employment, a contract, or \nother benefit in exchange for any political activity or support for a \ncandidate or political party.\n  Section 607 makes it unlawful for any person to solicit or receive \nany contribution intended to influence an election for Federal office \nin any [government] room or building.\n  This is the tone that has been related to the President's fundraising \ncoffers and also to the Vice President's phone calls.\n  Section 641 makes it unlawful to convert Government property which \nincludes telephones, copy machines, or Government computer records for \nones own use.\n  Section 201 makes it unlawful to give or offer a bribe to a public \nofficial in order to influence an official act.\n  Section 205 makes it unlawful for a Government employee to act as an \nagent for anyone before a Federal agency on matters that the United \nStates is a party or has a direct interest.\n  Section 793 makes it unlawful to communicate national defense \ninformation to anyone not entitled to receive it.\n  Section 794 makes it unlawful to communicate national defense \ninformation to a foreign government or representative of a foreign \ngovernment.\n  Section 219 prohibits a Federal Government official or employee from \nacting as foreign agent by delivering money actually derived from \nforeign countries.\n  Sections 611-621 of the Foreign Agents Registration Act prohibit any \nperson from acting in any capacity on behalf of a foreign government or \nforeign political party without registering with the Attorney General.\n  Section 1905 makes it unlawful for a Federal employee to make an \nunauthorized disclosure of proprietary business information.\n  Section 1956 is the money laundering statute.\n  Section 1505 makes it unlawful to obstruct an agency or committee \nproceeding.\n  All of these laws are subject to:\n  Title 18, section 371, conspiracy statute which makes it unlawful to \nconspire to commit any offense against the United States; and sections \n1341 and 1342, mail and wire fraud statutes which make it unlawful to \nuse the mails, radio, or telephones in connection with any scheme to \ndefraud or obtain money by false pretenses.\n  Section 1001 false statements statute which makes it unlawful to make \na false statement or use a document containing materially false \nstatements in a matter before the executive branch and with some \nlimitations, the judicial and legislative branches.\n  The Federal election laws make it unlawful to: Solicit or accept \npolitical contributions from foreign nationals in section 441e; it \nmakes it unlawful to knowingly accept a contribution made in the name \nof another person; section 441f; or makes it unlawful to solicit any \ncontribution from persons with contracts with any government agency; \nsection 441c.\n  These are only a portion of the Federal laws that apply to the \nallegations currently under review.\n  Recent news accounts of solicitations of campaign contributions by \nthe Vice President, and possibly the President or senior White House \nstaff, occurring in White House offices not used for residential \npurposes, or onboard Air Force One, may have violated Federal criminal \nlaws prohibiting soliciting or receiving political contributions in any\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\nGovernment room or office or conversion of Government property to one's \nown use.\n  There has been specific credible information publicly reported that \nthe Cheyenne-Arapaho Indians of Oklahoma contributed $107,000 to the \nClinton-Gore reelection campaign in order to meet with President \nClinton to discuss the return of Federal lands. It also was reported \nthat Clinton-Gore reelection campaign chief fundraiser Terrance \nMcAuliffe may have offered a Government benefit of access in exchange \nfor additional political support which may violate Federal law \nprohibiting the promise of a Government benefit in exchange for \npolitical activity or support.\n  There has been specific credible information publicly reported that \nPresident Clinton, Vice President Gore, Deputy Chief of Staff Harold \nIckes, and other covered White House and Clinton-Gore campaign officers \ncoordinated the solicitation and expenditure of independent Democratic \nParty funds which may be in violation of the Federal election laws. It \nwas further reported that Democratic party advertising and expenditures \nwere directed toward the reelection effort which may have had the \neffect to render these funds subject to campaign finance limitations to \nwhich they otherwise were not subject.\n  There has been specific credible information publicly reported that \nPresident Clinton met with Long Beach officials to advance a proposed \ncontract between the city of Long Beach and the Chinese state-owned \nmerchant fleet, the China Ocean Shipping Co., COSCO, to lease an \nabandoned United States Navy Station at Long Beach. It was also \nreported that individuals--Charlie Trie, Wang Jun, and Johnny Chung--\nwith business interests linked to the Chinese shipping company made \ncampaign donations to the Democratic National Committee and visited the \nPresident at a White House coffee during the negotiations for this \nlease which may have violated Federal laws if any promise of a \nGovernment benefit was given in exchange for political activity or \nsupport or if a promise of money from a foreign government was given.\n  Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that oil financier Roger \nTamraz, who had an outstanding international arrest warrant for \nallegedly embezzling $200 million from a Lebanese bank, attended a \nWhite House coffee, a White House dinner and reception, and viewed a \nmovie with President Clinton. All of these visits were allowed in spite \nof warnings from the President's own National Security Counsel Asian \nspecialist's recommendation that Mr. Tamraz should have no future \nmeetings or future access to the White House. Mr. Tamraz met with the \nNSC specialist in an attempt to obtain support from the administration \nfor a multibillion dollar oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to Turkey \nthat he was negotiating to build. He then tried to set meetings with \nVice President Gore and President Clinton.\n  The specialist's advice appears to have been followed until Mr. \nTamraz made donations of $50,000 and then $100,000 to the Democratic \nNational Committee. When the National Security Counsel determined that \nit was not in the best interest of the United States to support Mr. \nTamraz's business proposal or for his return to the White House, he \nwent to the Democratic National Committee.\n  Mr. Tamraz is quoted as saying that he thought that ``through the DNC \n[he] could make a policy heard.'' DNC Chairman Don Fowler is reported \nto have personally called the White House's NSC specialist and asked \nher to drop her opposition to Mr. Tamraz meeting with President \nClinton. Mr. Fowler apparently also managed to have the CIA send over a \npaper on Mr. Tamraz which Mr. Fowler said would show that Mr. Tamraz \nhad helped the United States in the past. The requested meetings with \nthe President did occur. It was reported that Mr. Tamraz had four \nmeetings with President Clinton in spite of these warnings. What did \nMr. Tamraz do to warrant such special access? We know that he donated \nat least $177,000 to the DNC and it was reported that he raised more \nmoney from other large donors.\n\n  Why was a man with an international arrest warrant, accused of \nembezzling $200 million from a foreign bank, allowed into the White \nHouse to meet with the President?\n  Why was this same man allowed to meet with President Clinton over the \nobjections of his own National Security Council Asia specialist's \nwarnings?\n  Why was the chairman of the Democratic National Party involving \nhimself in foreign policy issues?\n  Why did he call the National Security Council to attempt to change a \ndecision?\n  How did the chairman of the Democratic National Committee obtain a \ncopy of a paper on a donor from the CIA and have it sent to the \nNational Security Council?\n  On whose authority was this done?\n  Was the President aware of his party chairman's actions and did he \napprove?\n  If not, why did he continue to meet with this man?\n  What was requested in these meetings and was any benefit provided to \nMr. Tamraz as a result?\n  There has been specific credible information publicly reported that a \ncocaine dealer convicted of transporting nearly 6,000 pounds of cocaine \ninto this country, Jorge Cabrera, met with President Clinton in the \nWhite House. Eric Wynn, convicted of 13 counts of stock fraud which \nallegedly was to benefit the Bonano crime family, met with President \nClinton. And a man alleged to have been associated with Russian \norganized crime, Gregori Loutchansky, also met with President Clinton. \nMr. Yogesh Gandhi contributed $325,000 to the DNC and met with \nPresident Clinton to give him a World Peace Award although reports \nallege that he owed $10,000 in back taxes and filed divorce papers in \ncourt that he was a pauper and could not afford to pay the court's \nfees. Numerous other specific allegations surrounding John Huang and \nWebster Hubbell have been widely reported and raised questions about \ntheir activities in relation to Chinese interests.\n  All of these questions need to be answered. They clearly present a \nconflict of interest for the Attorney General and the Department of \nJustice. And they do involve credible information concerning covered \npersons that may have violated Federal law.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Attorney General to appoint a special \ncounsel to investigate these charges. I think the law calls for it. I \nthink it is very clear. I do not think it is close. So I urge the \nAttorney General to appoint an independent counsel immediately.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The absence of a quorum has been \nsuggested. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent following my \npresentation that Senator Levin from Michigan be recognized on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Levin has time reserved.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss a piece of \nlegislation that I and a couple of my colleagues intend to introduce, \nbut I did want to comment first on the remarks that have been offered \npreviously on the floor of the Senate, including the just-completed \nremarks by the majority whip.\n  It is certainly the case that a number of allegations about \nfundraising abuses are serious and ought to be investigated. The \ncurrent campaign financing system in this country is in desperate need \nof revision and reform. The range of abuses that need investigation \ngoes all the way around the spectrum. These include abuses by the major \ncampaign committees, both the Republican National Committee and the \nDemocratic National Committee, congressional campaigns, and the White \nHouse. There are a wide range of allegations surfacing almost daily now \nfor several months about abuses in campaign financing. All of them \ndeserve to\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\nbe fully investigated. The American people deserve no less than that.\n  Last week, there was an attempt to do a congressional investigation \nresolution on the floor of the Senate. That resolution was attempting \nto put blinders on the investigation sufficient so that it would only \ninvestigate a little corner of the problem, and it was the majority \nparty saying only investigate the opposition. It turned out that \nsufficient members of the Senate would not agree with that. So, finally \nit had to be broadened to say investigation of campaign finance abuses \nought to be across the board, no matter which party is involved with \nthose abuses. As a result the charter given last week to the Senate \nCommittee that will investigate these abuses, is a broader charter \nrather than a narrower charter.\n  The same should hold true with the discussion about the resolution \nnow before the Senate. This resolution, once again, attempts to narrow \nit. The resolution that will be offered by the Senator from Michigan, a \nsubstitute offered by Senator Levin, is what I will choose to support, \nlargely because that resolution contemplates that abuses shall be \ninvestigated with respect to either party or any party in which there \nis an allegation of fundraising abuse.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee already has petitioned the Attorney \nGeneral on the question of an independent counsel. The law provides for \nthat. The law does not provide for the Senate to intervene on a \npolitical basis to petition for an independent counsel. What is \nhappening here is unprecedented. It has not happened previously.\n  Part of this debate is whether this is politics or substance. We \nalready have a congressional investigation that will now be organized \nand will be very well funded. We already have a letter from the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to the Attorney General. The question of whether \nthis legislation now brought to the floor is a political missive, I \nsuppose, is up to those who are looking at it and would make judgments \nabout its narrow scope. I prefer that we consider the resolution and \nvote for the resolution offered by the Senator from Michigan.\n  I make one additional point. What is not on the floor of the Senate \nis campaign finance reform. It ought to be. Campaign finance reform \nought to be brought to the Senate. We ought to debate it. We ought to \nreform the campaign finance system.\n  What is not on the floor of the Senate, and it must be, is the \nChemical Weapons Treaty. That is very important business that is before \nthe body. We must bring it to the floor and have a vote on it and have \na debate on the Chemical Weapons Treaty. The attempt to end the spread \nof poison gases for warfare in this world is a noble attempt initiated \nfirst by President Reagan and then by President Bush, sent to us by \nPresident Clinton. Many countries have already signed the initiative. \nIt is being held up in this body. Very soon we will have to take \naggressive action to try to wedge that to the floor of the Senate and \ninsist on a vote on the important Chemical Weapons Treaty.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 465 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous-consent ordered, \nthe Senator from Michigan is to be recognized. The Senator from \nMichigan is recognized for not to exceed 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is only one reason the Senate is \nbeing asked by the majority leader's resolution to intervene in the \nindependent counsel process which is being considered by the Attorney \nGeneral. The reason is partisan politics, pure and simple. It is \nregrettable for many reasons, particularly following last week's \ndetermination by the full Senate to support a broad and fair and \nevenhanded investigation by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \ninto campaign finance practices in the 1996 election--Presidential and \ncongressional, House and Senate, Republican and Democratic. In doing \nthat last week, we recognized as a body that abuses in campaign \nfundraising are not in the exclusive domain of either political party, \nor either end of Pennsylvania Avenue. We confirm the view, as stated in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee report, in support of funding a \nbroad scope investigation that:\n\n       The committee intends to investigate allegations of \n     improper activities by all, Republicans, Democrats, or other \n     political partisans. It will investigate specific activities, \n     not the political party against which the allegations are \n     made.\n\n  But now, in a partisan attempt to reestablish the focus of the press \nand the public on just the Democratic National Committee and just the \nClinton-Gore campaign, the majority leadership brings this resolution \nto the floor. The very wording of the resolution reveals its partisan \nobjective. Nothing in the resolution mentions activities in connection \nwith the Republican National Committee, or the fundraising activities \nof Members of Congress. The resolution mentions possible Democratic \nproblems exclusively and calls upon the Attorney General to seek the \nappointment of an independent counsel to investigate only allegations \nagainst Democrats. It is an unbalanced, partisan piece of work, and I \nexpect it will receive the unbalanced partisan vote that it deserves.\n  But in addition to the reversal that it reflects of the Senate's \nunified position on a broad, bipartisan investigation into campaign \nfinance reform, it does damage to the very law that it is seeking to \ninvoke. For the past 18 years I have served as either chairman or \nranking Democrat on the Subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee with jurisdiction over the independent counsel law. I have \nbeen actively involved in three authorizations of this important \nstatute. And having experienced and studied the history of this law, it \nis apparent to me that this resolution runs directly counter to the \nfundamental purpose of the independent counsel law.\n  The independent counsel law was enacted in the aftermath of \nWatergate. The Watergate Committee recommended, and Congress agreed, \nthat we needed an established process by which criminal investigations \nof our top Government officials could be conducted in an independent \nmanner free from any taint of favoritism or politics. This was \nnecessary, we decided, in order to maintain the public's confidence in \none of the basic principles of our democracy--that this is a country \nthat follows the rule of law. We established a process whereby the \nAttorney General would follow certain established procedures in \nreviewing allegations of criminal wrongdoing by top Government \nofficials and decide at certain stages whether to ask a special court \nto appoint a person from the private sector to take over the \ninvestigation and conduct it independently from the chain of command at \nthe Department of Justice. We wanted the public to have confidence that \ninvestigations into alleged criminal conduct by top Government \nofficials were no less aggressive--and I might add no more aggressive--\nthan any such investigation of the average citizen. We particularly \nwanted to take any suggestion of partisanship out of the investigative \nand prosecutorial decisionmaking process.\n  So here is what we did. We established the requirement that if the \nAttorney General receives specific information from a credible source \nthat a crime, other than a class B or C misdemeanor, has been committed \nby certain enumerated top Government officials, the Attorney General \nhas to conduct a threshold inquiry lasting no more than 30 days, to \ndetermine if the allegation is frivolous or legitimate. The top \nofficials who trigger this so-called mandatory provision of the act are \nthe President and Vice President, the Cabinet Secretaries and Deputy \nSecretaries of the executive branch departments, plus very top White \nHouse officials who are paid a salary at least as high as Cabinet \nSecretaries or Deputy Secretaries, and in addition the chairman and \ntreasurer or other top officials of the President's campaign committee.\n  If, after that threshold inquiry, the Attorney General determines \nthat there is specific information from a credible source that a crime \nmay have been committed, the Attorney General must then conduct a \npreliminary investigation lasting no more than 90 days in which she \ngathers evidence to determine whether further investigation is \nwarranted. If, after the conclusion of the 90-day period, the Attorney \nGeneral determines that further investigation is warranted with respect \nto a covered official, then she must seek the\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\nappointment of an independent counsel. The Attorney General is required \nby law to seek such appointment from a special court made up of three \narticle III judges appointed for 2-year terms by the Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  The independent counsel law also has a provision that gives the \nAttorney General the discretion--and I repeat the discretion--to seek \nan independent counsel where there is a criminal allegation against a \nnoncovered official and the Attorney General determines that the \nDepartment of Justice has a political, personal, or financial conflict \nof interest with respect to the investigation. There must still be \nspecific information from a credible source that a crime may have been \ncommitted and a preliminary investigation to determine whether further \ninvestigation is warranted. Use of this provision is contemplated where \nthe Attorney General or top Justice Department employees may have been \npersonally involved in the matters under investigation or where the \nAttorney General has an unusually close personal relationship with the \nsubject of the investigation.\n\n  A third provision of the independent counsel law provides that the \nAttorney General may seek the appointment of an independent counsel \nrelative to allegations against Members of Congress. The independent \ncounsel law provides that if the Attorney General receives specific \ninformation from a credible source that a crime may have been committed \nby a Member of Congress, she can determine whether the continued \ninvestigation of that allegation should be conducted by the Department \nof Justice or whether it is in the public interest that the \ninvestigation be conducted by an independent counsel. Like the conflict \nof interest provision, this is a discretionary authority, but it is one \nthe Attorney General has available to her in matters involving Members \nof Congress.\n  In crafting the independent counsel law, Congress contemplated a role \nfor Congress with respect to the appointment of an independent counsel \nin a specific case. We included a provision that is tailored to the \npurposes of the law. The independent counsel law explicitly provides \nthat the appropriate avenue for congressional comment on the \nappointment of an independent counsel is through action of the \nJudiciary Committee. The law provides that either a majority of the \nmajority party or a majority of the minority party may request the \nAttorney General to appoint an independent counsel acting in the \nJudiciary Committee. Upon receipt of such a letter, the law provides \nthat the Attorney General must respond in writing to the authors of the \nletter explaining ``whether the Attorney General has begun or will \nbegin a preliminary investigation'' under the independent counsel law \nsetting forth ``the reasons for the Attorney General's decision \nregarding such preliminary investigation as it relates to each of the \nmatters with respect to which the congressional request is made. If \nthere is such a preliminary investigation, the report shall include the \ndate on which the preliminary investigation began or will begin.''\n  The Attorney General is not obligated to trigger the statute when she \nreceives such a letter. She is not required to initiate a threshold \ninquiry or conduct a preliminary investigation. She is only required to \nrespond within 30 days, as I have indicated before. That is the process \nthat we provided in the independent counsel law for Congress to express \nan opinion in triggering the statute.\n  Now, why did we adopt that procedure specifically in the statute? We \nwanted to provide an opportunity for congressional expression in a \nmoderate way. We did not say the Senate or the House could trigger the \nrequired report by resolution, thereby raising the stakes and \nincreasing the level of possible partisan bickering. We provided for \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee to make the request to the Attorney \nGeneral, and we required of her only that she respond in writing to the \nletter in a 30-day period in the manner indicated. So we channeled \ncongressional concerns about the appointment of an independent counsel \ninto a low-key, limited process to keep partisan politics at bay.\n  We also established this limited process because central to this law \nis the constitutional requirement that the Attorney General control the \ntriggering of the statute. Congress as a whole is constitutionally \nprohibited from forcing the Attorney General to seek an independent \ncounsel. In fact, when the constitutional challenge to the independent \ncounsel law was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of Morrison \nversus Olson, the Supreme Court based its finding of constitutionality \nfor the law upon the fundamental principle followed in the statute that \nthe Attorney General has full authority to exercise her discretion free \nof congressional control.\n  The Supreme Court said the following in Morrison versus Olson:\n\n       We observe first that this case does not involve an attempt \n     by Congress to increase its powers at the expense of the \n     executive branch . . . Indeed, with the exception of the \n     power of impeachment--which applies to all officers of the \n     United States--Congress retained for itself no powers of \n     control or supervision over an independent counsel. The act \n     does empower certain members of Congress to request the \n     Attorney General to apply for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel, but the Attorney General has no duty to \n     comply with the request, although he must respond within a \n     certain time limit . . . Other than that, Congress' role \n     under the Act is limited to receiving reports or other \n     information and oversight of the independent counsel's \n     activities, functions that we have recognized generally as \n     being incidental to the legislative function of Congress.\n\n  The resolution before us would tend to undermine that basic principle \nof this law. It also does undermine the nonpartisan spirit which has \nbeen so important to this law's operation. This law has been \nreauthorized in this Chamber at the instigation, I believe, at least on \nthe last three occasions, of then Senator Bill Cohen, Republican from \nMaine, and myself. We always did it on a bipartisan basis. We always \ntold each other it was critical to this law's functioning that it be \nimplemented carefully as written and not be undermined by bipartisan \nefforts to use it to its advantage in this most political body.\n\n  That is why as an alternative to the majority leader's resolution I \nhave introduced, with Senator Leahy, a resolution which simply urges \nthe Attorney General to follow the law as it is written, to do her job \nwith respect to all three of her powers to invoke the statute: The \nmandatory coverage of covered officials in the executive branch, the \nconflict of interest provision, and the Members of Congress provision. \nAnd it asks her to consider all allegations involving Federal \nelections, Democratic and Republican, Congress and the President, and \nto do so free of any political considerations.\n  The majority leader's resolution is problematic both for what it \nleaves out and what it includes. It leaves out any reference to \nallegations against Members of Congress and the Republican Party, and \nit includes conclusory language with respect to the allegations against \nthe White House and the Democratic Party. The resolution leaps to \njudgment and purports to make the very judgments about possible \ncriminality which the statute and the Constitution reserve for the \nAttorney General.\n  The majority leader's resolution very clearly leaves out the same \ngroup which some in this body tried to leave out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee's investigation, allegations against Members of \nCongress.\n  Let us just look at some of the activity that the majority leader's \nresolution would rather the Attorney General ignore that is not \nreferenced in this resolution at all.\n  A few months ago, when the 105th Congress first got underway, the \nmedia was filled with articles about Speaker Newt Gingrich and his \nmisuse of alleged tax-exempt organizations to further partisan \npolitical ends.\n  On January 17, 1997, a specially-appointed investigative subcommittee \nof the House Ethics Committee released a unanimous bipartisan report \nwhich presented the following conclusions:\n\n       The subcommittee found that in regard to two projects, Mr. \n     Gingrich engaged in activity involving 501(c)(3) \n     organizations that was substantially motivated by partisan \n     political goals. The subcommittee also found that Mr. \n     Gingrich provided the committee with material information \n     about one of those projects that was inaccurate, incomplete \n     and unreliable.\n\n  The two projects referred to, a television course called ``American \nOpportunities Workshop,'' and a college course called ``Renewing \nAmerican Civilization,'' were largely paid for with\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\ntax-exempt donations to two tax-exempt groups, the American Lincoln \nOpportunity Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation.\n  The House bipartisan report notes that tax-exempt groups are not \nallowed to engage in partisan political activities. It states that even \nMr. Gingrich's tax counsel, ``said that he would not have recommended \nthe use of 501(c)(3) organizations to sponsor the course because the \ncombination of politics and 501(c)(3) organizations is an `explosive \nmix,' almost certain to draw the attention of the IRS.''\n  The unanimous bipartisan report of the House ethics investigative \nsubcommittee went on to make the following notable findings:\n\n       Based on the evidence, it was clear that Mr. Gingrich \n     intended that the [American Opportunities Workshop] and \n     renewing American civilization projects have substantial \n     partisan political purposes.\n\n  This is a bipartisan finding, that Mr. Gingrich ``intended'' that \nthose two projects have ``substantial partisan political purposes.'' \nAnd the subcommittee went on:\n\n       In addition, he was aware that political activities in the \n     context of 501(c)(3) organizations were problematic. Prior to \n     embarking on these projects, [the committee wrote] Mr. \n     Gingrich had been involved with another organization that had \n     direct experience with the private benefit prohibition in a \n     political context, the American Campaign Academy. In a 1989 \n     tax court opinion [the subcommittee continued] issued less \n     than a year before Mr. Gingrich set the [American \n     Opportunities Workshop] projects into motion, the academy was \n     denied its exemption under 501(c)(3) because, although \n     educational, it conferred an impermissible private benefit on \n     Republican candidates and entities. Close associates of Mr. \n     Gingrich were principals in the American Campaign Academy. \n     Mr. Gingrich taught at the academy, and Mr. Gingrich had been \n     briefed at the time on the tax controversy surrounding the \n     academy.\n\n  And the investigative subcommittee over in the House continued:\n\n       Taking into account Mr. Gingrich's background, experience, \n     and sophistication with respect to tax-exempt organizations, \n     and his status as a Member of Congress obligated to maintain \n     high ethical standards, the Subcommittee concluded that Mr. \n     Gingrich should have known to seek appropriate legal advice. \n     . . . Had he sought and followed such advice . . . 501(c)(3) \n     organizations would not have been used to sponsor Mr. \n     Gingrich's [American Opportunities Workshop] and Renewing \n     American Civilization projects.\n\n  Now, that unanimous, bipartisan report was issued 2 months ago. It \nraises, directly, explicitly, serious questions about the deliberate \nand illegal misuse of tax-exempt organizations by a prominent Member of \nCongress, and false statements to Congress. The House Ethics Committee \nreport found that Speaker Gingrich intentionally used two tax-exempt \norganizations for partisan political purposes, even after having been \nspecifically denied tax-exempt status for another organization in 1989 \nbecause of the partisan nature of that organization's work. How \nrevealing it is that the resolution before us, of the majority leader, \ndoes not mention one word of that entire matter--not a word.\n  And even leaving aside the issue of Mr. Gingrich, given the campaign \nseason just behind us, it is also revealing that the resolution before \nus makes no mention in any way of the tax-exempt organizations that \nplayed so prominent a role in the 1996 election. Congress made a \ndecision many years ago that we wanted to give a break to charities and \ncivic organizations devoted to working for public purposes, but we \ndidn't want to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize partisan political \nactivities by these organizations. Blatant violations of the legal \nlimits on partisan political activity appear to have taken place during \nthe 1996 election cycle by a number of tax-exempt organizations. Let us \njust look at two examples.\n  In the last months of the 1996 election cycle, the Republican \nNational Committee transferred $4.6 million to Americans for Tax \nReform, an organization that is exempt from paying taxes. Grover \nNorquist, the president of tax-exempt Americans for Tax Reform, was \nquoted in one Washington Post article as stating that in the last weeks \nbefore the 1996 election, his organization sent out 20 million pieces \nof mail and paid for millions of phone calls in 150 congressional \ndistricts. Much of this last-minute activity was made possible by the \nRepublican National Committee's $4.6 million contribution. That is \naccording to the article.\n  An Associated Press article that came out in October of 1996 quoted \nMr. Norquist as saying that his group was sending out a last-minute, $3 \nmillion mailing to reinforce Republican antitax messages and that \n``two-thirds of the money came from the GOP.''\n  Mr. Norquist indicated in the Washington Post article that his group \ndidn't pay for televised political ads, but there is evidence to the \ncontrary. An ad broadcast in the New Jersey Senate campaign states that \nit was paid for by the tax-exempt Americans for Tax Reform. The ad \ndirectly attacks the Democratic candidate for missing votes. Here is a \nsample:\n\n       Taxpayers pay liberal Bob Torricelli $133,000 a year, but \n     he doesn't show up for work. That's wrong.\n\n  That ad was broadcast in the final weeks of the campaign. It \npresumably cost a great deal of money to air and may have been paid for \nwith those RNC funds.\n  Americans for Tax Reform also sponsored what was designated \nfacetiously as a special award for Members of Congress, in the last \nweeks of the 1996 campaign. The award was called the ``Enemy of the \nTaxpayer'' award, and it was given to 34 Members of Congress, none of \nwhom were Republicans. The press release issued by Americans for Tax \nReform contained a quotes from Mr. Norquist, directly attacking the \nDemocratic Party.\n  That is not all. A group called Women for Tax Reform, operating out \nof the same office as Americans for Tax Reform, was created in late \nAugust 1996, to launch a national television advertising campaign. It \nannounced its first two ads, both of which consisted of a woman \ndirectly attacking President Clinton. One included the following \nstatement:\n\n       When Clinton was running, he promised a middle-class tax \n     cut. Then he raised my taxes. He was just lying to get \n     elected. This year, he'll lie some more.\n\n  The activity that I have just described, TV ads, direct mail, phone \ncalls, and Enemy of the Taxpayer awards, are as partisan as anything I \nhave seen in my years in politics. These activities were directed at \nFederal candidates, they were timed to happen in the last weeks before \nthe Federal elections, and they were apparently paid for by millions of \ndollars in contributions given to the tax-exempt Americans for Tax \nReform, including millions from the RNC.\n  The president of Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist, is \nroutinely described by the Washington Times as a GOP strategist. In \n1995, he published a book called ``Rock the House'' celebrating the \nRepublican takeover of the House of Representatives, for which Speaker \nNewt Gingrich provided the introduction. The quotes inside the cover of \nhis own book reveal much about the man running this tax-exempt \norganization.\n  Rush Limbaugh states, ``Grover Norquist is perhaps the most \ninfluential and important person you've never heard of in the GOP \ntoday.''\n  Haley Barbour, RNC chairman, writes, ```Rock the House' is a true \ninsider's account of the Republican revolution of 1994.''\n  Paul Gigot, a Wall Street Journal columnist and television \ncommentator portrays Mr. Norquist as ``one of the main power brokers in \nthe new Republican majority.''\n  Mr. Norquist is described by these persons--each of whom he chose to \nfeature in quotations designed to promote his book--as a Republican \ninsider and power broker. That isn't exactly the profile one would \nexpect for what is supposed to be a nonpartisan, tax exempt group.\n  So, what are the possible violations? What are the possible \nviolations of criminal law? The list might include: Knowing and willful \nviolation of the Federal Election Campaign Act and false statements to \nthe IRS in violation of 26 United States Code 7206 or 18 United States \nCode 1001.\n  Let me describe another tax-exempt group. This one has not been \naround for very long. It is called Citizens for Reform. It incorporated \nin Virginia in May 1996, was granted tax-exempt status in June 1996. \nIts articles of incorporation state that the group's purpose is:\n\n       . . . to serve the public interest and to promote the \n     social welfare by fostering and developing greater public \n     participation, on a nonpartisan basis, in the national debate\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\n     concerning the size, scope, growth and responsibility of \n     government and of the impact of government on the community, \n     the private sector, and citizens in all walks of life.\n\n  This group stated that it expected to conduct conferences, seminars, \npublic events, research, and studies. In its application for tax-exempt \nstatus, which is, by law, a publicly available document, the group \nstates that it does not have any membership dues, contributions or \ngifts in 1996, and projects raising only $1,000 in revenue in 1997 and \nanother $1,000 in 1998.\n  This group, Citizens for Reform, stated that it had no plans to spend \n``any money attempting to influence'' any elections. Within months of \nits creation, this tax-exempt group, however, spent hundreds of \nthousands of dollars on television and radio ads targeting Federal \ncandidates, and brimming with the intensely partisan type of campaign \nrhetoric. Ads paid for by this group appear in California, Montana, New \nYork, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania. The group now, \napparently, admits spending $2 million in the 5 months before election \nday.\n  One TV ad specifically targeted a Democratic candidate for Congress \nin Montana, Bill Yellowtail. Here is an excerpt from this ad:\n\n       He preaches family values, but he takes a swing at his \n     wife. Yellowtail's explanation: he only slapped her once but \n     her nose was not broken.\n\n  That is supposed to be nonpartisan activity?\n  Another TV ad directly targeting a Democratic Congressman, Cal Dooley \nin California. Here is a sample:\n\n       Cal Dooley said no to increased money for drug enforcement. \n     Instead, Dooley gave your money to radical lawyers who \n     represented drug dealers.\n\n  How is that for another nonpartisan ad?\n  One of their radio ads was broadcast just before the 1996 election in \nNew York. The ad attacked Democratic Congressman Maurice Hinchey and \nlauded his Republican challenger. It was described in a Wall Street \nJournal column as follows:\n\n       Rep. Maurice Hinchey, the ad said, voted against ``sensible \n     welfare reform,'' [and] voted for ``the largest tax increase \n     in history'' and took money from a union with ties to the \n     mob. By contrast, it said, Rep. Hinchey's Republican \n     challenger . . . supports ``real welfare reform,'' would cut \n     taxes and promises to ``stop special-interest influence on \n     Capitol Hill.''\n\n  The Wall Street Journal article went on to say, ``It is impossible to \nfind out who put up the money for the ad; Citizens for Reform doesn't \nhave to say.'' The president of Citizens for Reform, Peter Flaherty, \nsaid that his group has spent money in 15 different congressional \ndistricts in 10 States.\n  What happened to the statement of that group that it had no plans to \nattempt to influence any elections? That is a statement made to the IRS \nto get an exemption: ``No plans to influence any elections''--that is \nthe representation.\n  How did it happen that just months after receiving its tax exemption, \nthis group had $2 million and the resources to sponsor patently \npolitical ads across the country? What happened to the conferences and \nthe seminars that this group was going to hold? What happened to the \nstatements it made to the IRS that it planned to raise no money in \n1996?\n  Those questions give rise to others. Was there a knowing and willful \nviolation of Federal campaign laws or false statements to the IRS?\n  But the majority resolution before us does not mention any \ninvestigation of Citizens for Reform or Americans for Tax Reform or any \nother tax-exempt group that was active in the 1996 elections in \nviolation, allegedly, of the laws prohibiting those groups from \nengaging in partisan activities and whose tax-exempt millions paid for \nTV ads, voter education materials, get-out-the-vote activities that are \njust completely at odds, apparently, with what a tax-exempt \norganization is allowed by law to do.\n  For my part, I trust the Attorney General to conduct a thorough \ncriminal investigation of all the allegations against Democrats and \nRepublicans, members of the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch. I think she will follow the evidence wherever it leads, as she \nshould. I also trust her to follow the independent counsel law, to use \nit if she determines that there is specific information from a credible \nsource that a crime may have been committed by a covered official, or \nto use it for anyone other than a covered official against whom there \nis such specific information the Department has a personal, financial, \nor political conflict of interest, or Members of Congress if she \ndetermines it is in the public interest to do so.\n  The majority leader's resolution omits what it should include, which \nis the Attorney General's review of activities of Members of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will give the Senator 3 minutes from the time reserved \nfor this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator is recognized for \n3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and my good friend from Vermont.\n  The majority leader's resolution omits what it should include, which \nis the Attorney General's review of activities of Members of Congress, \nand it includes what it should omit, by prejudging the very \ninvestigation by the Attorney General that it seeks. It thereby does a \ndisservice to the Nation, which is awaiting an objective and fair \nreview, and it undermines the independent counsel law which is \ndependent upon a nonpolitical application free from partisan pressure.\n  An alternative resolution that I and Senator Leahy will be offering \nwill urge the Attorney General to make a thorough and fair review of \nthe allegations, free from political pressure, to reach whatever \nconclusion is appropriate as to the persons covered by the statute, as \nto persons not covered by the statute where there might be a conflict \nof interest, and as to Members of Congress where the public interest \nindicates that an independent counsel might be the proper course for \nher to pursue.\n\n  This alternative resolution we will be offering embodies the spirit \nof the independent counsel law. It permits the process invoked by the \nJudiciary Committee a few days ago to proceed without interference by \nthis body. That letter was sent by Republican members of the Judiciary \nCommittee to the Attorney General asking her to appoint an independent \ncounsel. The law requires her to answer that request within 30 days. We \nshould not prejudge that process that the law provides for, and we \nshould not prejudge the Attorney General's answer. We should stand by \nthe process which was established in the independent counsel law and \nnot give in to this partisan effort.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin on the floor. I wonder if it might be in order for me to \nspeak for about 4 minutes and then it be in order for him to \nimmediately reclaim his time. I would take this time from the time \nreserved to the Senator from Vermont as manager on this side.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I spoke for hours on this issue on Friday \nand again yesterday. I will not repeat what I said other than to \ncompliment the distinguished Senator from Michigan and others for what \nthey have said. I put into the Record the editorial from the Washington \nPost that reaches the same basic conclusion as the resolution of the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  I spoke of the fact that the resolution before us, the resolution \nintroduced by the distinguished majority leader and others, is aimed \njust at the President, the Vice President and very, very carefully--\nvery, very carefully--excludes the Republicans in Congress as it does \nthe Democrats in Congress.\n  If we want to show real interest in justice, we should say, well, let \nus look at any activity of Members of Congress, too. Let us not act as \nthough we are so above the law that we can only point our finger at the \nPresident. But that is not the point I am here to bring up, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with five Presidents: President \nFord, President Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, and President \nClinton. I have served here with a number of very distinguished \nmajority leaders on my side of the aisle: Senator Mansfield, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Mitchell,\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nall as majority leader; and on the other side of the aisle, Senator \nBaker and Senator Dole. Of course, now I serve with the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott].\n  I mention these majority leaders, Senators Mansfield, Byrd, Mitchell, \nBaker and Dole, because there is one thing that I recall from each one \nof them in setting the agenda of the U.S. Senate. It was that if the \nPresident of the United States was going to be abroad in a summit \nmeeting, negotiating with other heads of state, the U.S. Senate would \nrefrain from bringing forward matters directly aimed--especially \npartisan matters--directly aimed at the President of the United States.\n  This resolution is directly aimed at the President of the United \nStates. And what is going to happen? We will arrange to make sure we \nvote on it almost within hours of the time he will sit down with the \nPresident of Russia, the leader of the only other nuclear superpower.\n  Mr. President, has this body and this town become so partisan that we \nare going to ignore the tradition of all Republican leaders and all \nDemocratic leaders in this body, and that is, to show some unity behind \nthe President while he is abroad representing not Democrats, not \nRepublicans, but all Americans?\n  Never in my 22 years in the Senate have I seen such an egregious \nbreach of tradition. That does not mean that a President, Republican or \nDemocrat, is given a free ride. What that means is that the President \nof the United States will at least be able to demonstrate, when he is \nabroad representing this country, that he is shown some support back \nhome during the time he is abroad. When he is back here, we will go \nback and forth and fight as we always have. Fine. That is the process. \nBut the tradition has always been to be supportive of the President \nwhen he is at a summit with other leaders. Of all summits he might be \nattending, what could be more important than the one with the President \nof Russia?\n  It was tasteless enough to introduce this resolution and start the \ndebate on it while the President was undergoing surgery at Bethesda. \nNow, that, at the very least, shows a tastelessness that also, I \nbelieve, is unprecedented in this body. That could be chalked up to \ntasteless partisanship that is not appropriate. It is as bad as making \njokes at the President's expense when he is lying there in pain \nrecovering. But we just assume that sometimes we have tastelessness in \npolitics.\n  However, when we have votes designed to hit directly at the President \nwhile he is abroad in a summit, that, Mr. President, goes beyond \ntastelessness. That shows no regard for history. That shows no regard \nfor the traditions of this body. That shows no regard for the \nimportance of a President being abroad.\n  Now, I had differences with President Reagan on the way the Contra \nwar was run. I recall we held off from any questions of that when he \nwas going abroad for summits. I may have had differences with President \nBush and some of his issues, but we held off on any discussion of that \nwhen he was going abroad for a summit.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to my good friends on the other \nside of the aisle--and I have many--I ask them to at least take a few \nminutes if they are going to set the schedule, and I ask them to take a \nlook at the history of the United States, the history of the Senate, \nthe history of the Presidency, and know there are certain things we do \nin this country to demonstrate we are worthy of being only 1 of 100 men \nand women representing a quarter of a billion Americans.\n  I am deeply saddened by this. I hope this is only a momentary lapse \nin the kind of traditions that have kept the Senate, occasionally at \nleast, the conscience of the Nation. I hope this is only a temporary \nlack of those things that show the Senate to be the best.\n  I thank my friend from Wisconsin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to speak on the \ntwo resolutions which the Senate is debating, the so-called Republican \nversion and the Democratic version. I take this opportunity to explain \nwhy I intend to vote against both versions as they are now being \noffered.\n  At the outset, we should be clear that there is no reason for the \nSenate to actually consider either version. The statute authorizing the \nappointment of an independent counsel gives the authority to make the \nappointment to the Attorney General of the United States, and it also \nprovides a mechanism for the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to \ninvoke a procedure for the Attorney General to respond to a request for \nappointment of an independent counsel. Mr. President, that, in fact, is \nwhat has been used in recent days. Both the House and Senate Judiciary \nCommittees last week voted to invoke that process. The Attorney General \nhas 30 days to respond.\n\n  In effect, what we are doing today, since all of that has already \nhappened, what we are doing today is really just shear theatrical \nmaneuvering. On the one side, we have the Republican resolution, which \ncarefully restricts the request and any implication of wrongdoing just \nto the Clinton White House. That resolution puts Congress off limits \nfor an independent counsel investigation for its alleged wrongdoing. It \nputs the Republican National Committee off limits for an independent \ncounsel investigation. The Republican resolution turns a blind eye to \nany allegations of impropriety beyond the White House itself.\n  On the other side, we have a Democratic resolution that stops short \nof even taking notice of the fact that there have been so many \nallegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Democratic Party that the \npublic is crying out for an independent, impartial investigation.\n  Mr. President, both sides appear to be ignoring the degree to which \nthe fundraising practices of the 1996 elections have gone beyond any \nlimits and created the appearance of a system totally out of control. \nThe improprieties are not limited to the fundraising activities in the \nWhite House. Both parties engaged in an almost mindless race to the \nbottom. The staggering amounts of money raised in the 1996 elections, \nmore than $2.7 billion, compelled the kind of fundraising excesses \nwhich continue to shock the country each day. Day after day the front-\npage story is yet another tale of improprieties and new scandals. The \nstories encompass both parties, the congressional races as well as the \nPresidential races.\n  Mr. President, according to a poll released last week by the Wall \nStreet Journal and NBC News, 91 percent of the American people believe \nthat, if an independent counsel was appointed, the investigation should \ninclude all Federal elections, not just the Presidential race, but \ncongressional races, as well.\n  Last fall, Common Cause filed a request with the Attorney General for \nappointment of an independent counsel to investigate the violations of \nlaw by both parties in the 1996 campaign.\n  At the time, I said that such action might be appropriate. More \nrecently, I reached the conclusion that it was necessary because it had \nbecome clear that the seemingly endless scope of allegations arising \nfrom campaign fundraising activities touching all levels of our \nGovernment had grown so vast that the only manner in which the public's \nconfidence can be ensured is, Mr. President, by the appointment of an \nindependent counsel. In my view, given the breadth of the allegations, \nany investigation conducted by the Department of Justice is inevitably \nand unavoidably subject to the taint of political conflict in this \ncontext. To this end, I called upon the Attorney General to appoint an \nindependent counsel.\n  However, an important distinction between the position I have taken \nand that offered by the majority in the form of this resolution is that \nI believe that any call for an independent counsel must necessarily \ninclude an investigation of all potential wrongdoers, be it on the part \nof the executive branch, the political parties, or the Congress. The \nRepublican resolution takes the position that neither Congress nor the \nRepublican National Committee should be subject to such an \ninvestigation. I believe the American people will see through this \napproach. How can anyone suggest to the citizens of this Nation that \npotential illegalities should be subject to an independent counsel, \nprovided the target is the President but not the Congress? When the \ntarget is one party, but not the other, they will surely see such a \nploy for exactly what\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\nit is, yet another partisan maneuver designed to delude the public into \nbelieving that the problem is limited to a small group of people and \nnot a systemic problem that demands a comprehensive overhaul of our \nsystem of campaign finance laws.\n  Mr. President, as a threshold, it is essential to understand the \nbasis for the independent counsel as well as who is covered by the law. \nThe underlying premise behind the independent counsel law, a premise \nwhich we should sustain and that is threatened by partisan \ngamesmanship, is that we have an inherent obligation to ensure the \nconfidence of the American people and the public in investigations of \nthe Government. This law, born of the Watergate scandal, was derived to \nrestore and protect the public's confidence in these types of \ninvestigations, and in the process preserve and promote the public's \nconfidence in the integrity of the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. President, the independent counsel law provides that the Attorney \nGeneral must seek an independent counsel upon finding specific \ninformation, derived from a credible source, that a violation of \nFederal law has potentially occurred in regard to certain covered \npersons, such as the President, the Vice President, Cabinet members, \ncertain high-level officials in the White House, among others. In \naddition to these mandatory provisions, the independent counsel law \nprovides the Attorney General with certain discretionary power for \nother persons--those not covered by the mandatory provisions--and, Mr. \nPresident, to emphasize, Members of Congress. Members of Congress are \nincluded within these discretionary powers of the Attorney General with \nregard to the independent counsel. In regard to other persons, an \nindependent counsel may be sought if, in the face of specific evidence \nof illegality, derived from a credible source, a personal, political, \nor financial conflict of interest exists or may arise as a result of a \nDepartment of Justice investigation. In regard to Members of Congress, \nthe discretionary standard is a public interest standard. In other \nwords, if the Attorney General has evidence of a violation of Federal \nlaw involving a Member of Congress, she may seek an independent counsel \nif she finds it to be in the public interest.\n  Mr. President, over the past few weeks, I have been approached by \ncolleagues and others who argue that Members of Congress are simply not \nsubject to the statute. Mr. President, that is simply incorrect. In \nfact, if one reviews the legislative history of this law, one finds \nthat Congress had previously been covered, albeit not explicitly, under \nthe other persons provision. In the 1994 reauthorization, Congress \nclarified this and added a separate section solely for Members of \nCongress.\n  The conference report accompanying the 1994 amendments to the \nindependent counsel law states as follows:\n\n       The 1987 law provided the Attorney General with the \n     discretionary authority to use the independent counsel \n     process for any person whose investigation or prosecution by \n     the Department of Justice ``may result in a personal, \n     financial, or political conflict of interest.'' This \n     discretionary authority permitted the Attorney General, if a \n     conflict of interest were present, to use the independent \n     counsel process to investigate Members of Congress. However, \n     Members of Congress were not specifically identified as \n     falling within that general category of coverage.\n\n  Mr. President, realizing the hypocrisy of a law that allows an \nindependent counsel in regard to the executive, but not explicitly with \nregard to Congress, the Congress chose to act. The conference report \ncontinues:\n\n       The Senate bill gives the Attorney General specific \n     discretionary authority to use the independent counsel to \n     investigate Members of Congress. It broadens the standard for \n     invoking the process with respect to Members from requiring a \n     conflict of interest to requiring the Attorney General to \n     find it would be in the public interest. This broader \n     standard would permit the Attorney General to use the \n     independent counsel process for Members of Congress in cases \n     of perceived as well as actual conflicts of interest.\n\n  Not only did the Congress then act to explicitly include Members of \nCongress, it took the additional step of making the standard for \ninvoking the statute easier to apply than it had been previously. As \nthe conference report stated, the statute may be invoked in the case of \na perceived or actual conflict of interest. Now, this is a significant \nstatement of congressional intent as to whether or not Congress falls \nwithin the ambit of the independent counsel statute.\n  Yet, Mr. President, the resolution brought to the floor of the Senate \nby a Republican leader chooses a different course and turns a blind eye \nto any potential illegal conduct on behalf of Members of Congress, be \nit real or perceived. It simply says to the Attorney General, appoint \nan independent counsel in regard to the Clinton administration, but not \nin regard to any illegality involving Congress or the Republican \nNational Committee. Mr. President, I believe this approach is seriously \nflawed and should be rejected.\n  As I indicated previously, 9 out of 10 Americans want all illegality \nin regard to the 1996 elections investigated. Yet, this resolution \nchooses to ignore that which the American people seem to readily \nunderstand--that being that all illegality should be investigated.\n  Mr. President, when one looks at the myriad of allegations that have \narisen in the wake of the 1996 Federal elections, it is not difficult \nto see why the American people feel that both political parties, and \nCongress, should be included in an independent counsel investigation.\n  There has been a lot of attention focused upon alleged wrongdoing by \nthe Clinton White House. But equal attention needs to be focused upon \nsimilar allegations about the behavior of both national parties and the \nMembers of the Congress during the fundraising explosion in the 1996 \nelection.\n  At the outset, it should be understood that what is being sought here \nis an independent counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing in \nthe 1996 election. The distinguished chairman of the U.S. Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, stated during the debate on this \nissue on Friday as follows:\n\n       The answer to whether criminal wrongdoing has occurred will \n     of necessity turn on the resolution of disputed factual, \n     legal, and state of mind determinations.\n\n  Repeating that, he said:\n\n       The answer to whether criminal wrongdoing has occurred will \n     of necessity turn on the resolution of disputed factual, \n     legal, and state of mind determinations.\n\n  We have to stress what the Senator from Utah stated: At this stage, \nwhether there was criminal wrongdoing turns on the resolution of \nfactual, legal, and state-of-mind determinations. Obviously, those \nfactual determinations can only be ascertained by an impartial \ninvestigation, and that statement applies equally to allegations \nregarding Republican conduct in fundraising activities as it does to \nDemocratic conduct.\n  Without engaging in an extensive description of the allegations of \nimproper conduct in the 1996 election, which goes well beyond the \nactivities of the White House, let me highlight a few areas.\n  First, with respect to the soft money machines that were operated by \nboth parties in the 1996 elections, the initial request filed by Common \nCause last fall for appointment of an independent counsel alleged that \nboth the Clinton and Dole Presidential campaigns, along with their \nrespective political parties, knowingly and willfully violated Federal \ncampaign finance laws. Common Cause specifically charged that both \ncampaigns were engaged in illegal schemes to violate the Presidential \nprimary spending limits and the ban on soft money being used directly \nto support a Federal candidate.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Utah also alluded to this question in \nhis remarks on Friday when he stated:\n\n       There remains significant factual questions of the extent \n     to which the allegedly improper fundraising activity was, in \n     fact, directed toward benefiting Federal campaigns.\n\n  If, indeed, it is determined that there were knowing and willful \nschemes to use soft money in both Presidential campaigns, both parties, \nas Common Cause asserts, would have violated existing law prohibiting \nsuch activity. Of course, Mr. President, the answer cannot be \nascertained until an independent investigation is conducted.\n  Mr. President, let me describe another piece of soft money activity \nthat has been tied directly to the Republican National Committee; that \nis, the transfer of some $4.6 million from the RNC to a tax-exempt \norganization headed by Grover Norquist, a close ally of the Republican \nSpeaker of the House. This organization, according to a Washington Post \nstory on December 10, 1996, then used the RNC money to flood voters in \n150 congressional districts with millions of pieces of mail and phone \ncalls.\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\n  Now, this story adds a rather peculiar twist to the concept of \nindependent expenditures. There have been plenty of complaints about \nvarious groups, including labor organizations, running independent \ncampaigns against particular candidates. But this story describes what \nappears to be what or what may have been a money laundering scheme, \nwhich allowed the RNC to raise soft money and then transfer it to this \ntax-exempt group, which then used the money for an independent \nexpenditure campaign.\n  Was there coordination of these expenditures with the candidates \nthemselves, or through the Republican National Committee? Was this \ntransfer of money designed to allow the RNC to do indirectly what the \nlaw prohibits them to do directly--that is, spend soft money in a \ncongressional campaign? Should we not be seeking the answer to that \nquestion? Was this a violation of tax laws as well as campaign finance \nlaws? As the Senator from Utah stated in calling for an investigation \nof Democratic fundraising activities, there are significant factual \nquestions involved here as to the extent to which this fundraising \nactivity was directed toward benefiting Federal congressional \ncampaigns. Mr. President, those questions cannot be resolved without an \ninvestigation.\n  With respect to the issue of foreign contributions being illegally \nfunneled into Federal elections, I think we are all aware of the \nallegations that have been made that the People's Republic of China may \nhave targeted Members of Congress, as well as the White House. How \nsuccessful they were remains unknown. Certainly, we ought to have this \nquestion addressed in any independent counsel investigation with regard \nto Members of Congress, as well as the White House.\n  Finally, let's be candid about the fact that the allegations that \ncampaign contributions were exchanged for special access to \npolicymakers are not directed solely against the current \nadministration. The newspapers have been filled with story after story \nof Members of Congress, and the political campaign committees of both \nparties, establishing various schemes to woo and impress large \ncontributors.\n  For example, in 1995, the Republican National Committee is reported \nto have promised $15,000 donors four meetings a year with House and \nSenate Republican leaders, as well as participation in international \ntrade missions. Of course, in fairness, similar charges have been made \nagainst the Democratic National Committee. Did these schemes cross the \nline in some cases? Was there illegal exchanges of access for campaign \ncontributions? The answers can only be ascertained after factual \ninvestigations.\n  It is little wonder, Mr. President, that in light of these types of \nallegations, the American public would ask for a broad investigation. \nIt is not difficult to understand why 91 percent of the American people \nthink that all illegality, including that of Congress should be \nconsidered by an independent counsel.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned earlier that the statute provides a \nspecific mechanism for congressional involvement in the appointment of \nan independent counsel. That mechanism is triggered by a request from \nthe House and Senate Judiciary Committees. I also noted that both \ncommittees had already acted pursuant to that statutory authority to \nsubmit a request to the Attorney General.\n  Unfortunately, that process also broke down along partisan lines. As \na Democratic Senator who had previously called for appointment of an \nindependent counsel, I had hoped to be able to work on a bipartisan \nbasis within the Judiciary Committee to formulate a request that would \ntranscend party lines. Unfortunately, that effort failed.\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Republican members sent one \nletter; the Democratic members sent another. The respective letters \nresembled the resolutions before us today. As far as I am concerned, \nneither letter went far enough.\n  I choose not to sign either letter because the Democratic letter \nstopped short of calling for an independent counsel, while the \nRepublican letter, much like this resolution, chose to focus solely on \nthe administration and ignored the potential illegal conduct on behalf \nof the Congress. Instead, I sent my own letter asking for the \nappointment of an independent counsel in regard to all illegal activity \nin the 1996 Federal election, including Congress.\n  Mr. President, in calling as I have for an independent counsel, I \nhave been taken to task by all sides--from those who do not want a \nspecial counsel and from those who, somehow, believe that by calling \nfor an independent counsel to investigate all parties, I am somehow \nseeking to protect the administration. Notwithstanding these \ninconsistent conclusions, I remain firm in my belief that the scope of \nthe allegations is such that the only way we can hope to salvage the \nconfidence of the American people in any investigation of campaign \nfundraising illegalities is to appoint an independent counsel. In so \ndoing, I do not mean to disparage or question the ability of our \nAttorney General, Janet Reno, to conduct a fair and evenhanded \ninvestigation. I simply feel that the scope of this problem is such \nthat irrespective of her evenhandedness, her ultimate conclusion will \nbe suspect and challenged on political grounds. In a sense, the \npolitical nature this debate has taken in the Senate makes my point.\n\n  In regard to many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I \nsimply disagree with those who argue that an independent counsel should \nnot be appointed. While I appreciate the sincerity of their \nperspectives, I have reached a different conclusion. The decision to \ncall for an independent counsel is not one that any of us should take \nlightly. The statue exists for very specific reasons directed at \npromoting public confidence in the investigation of the Government. The \nstatute does not exist to provide elected officials opportunities to \nscore political points against officials of the other party as I fear \nhas been attempted with this resolution.\n  In my view, we risk something far greater than short-term partisan \nadvantage by engaging in a process as partisan as this. We risk the \nfurther erosion of the public's confidence in the Government and in \nparticular the U.S. Senate to set aside partisanship and work for the \ngood of the American people. At the same time, my friends on the \nRepublican side of the aisle ought to be willing to expose their own \nparties to the same intense scrutiny that they urge for the opposite \nparty. An evenhanded investigation into all aspects of fundraising \nimproprieties in the 1996 election is the fair response.\n  This raises the final point I wish to make. That being the pressing \nneed to set about doing the work of the people of this Nation in a \nbipartisan, constructive manner. As I travel to each county in \nWisconsin, as I do each year, I talk with the men and women of my State \nand at each and every stop, be it in Milwaukee or Bayfield County, the \npeople I listen to all want us to work together and help solve the \nproblems that confront them each and every day.\n  Sadly, the short history of the 105th Congress, much like the 104th \nCongress, seems to ignore that call to action. Rather than setting \nabout the hard work of actually balancing the Federal budget we debated \nfor a number of weeks a constitutional amendment which would have \nforestalled the hard choices until well into the next century. In the \nmeantime, the budget process itself, the process by which we can \nactually balance the budget, continues to languish. In fact, the 105th \nCongress has debated more constitutional amendments than it has \nconfirmed Federal judges--three constitutional amendments, no judges. \nWe have also debated a resolution dealing with the scope of the \nGovernmental Affairs inquiry into campaign irregularities and finally, \nafter much public pressure, the scope of that inquiry was adjusted to \ncover not just illegality but improper conduct, but only after the \nSenate was needlessly tied up for a number of days. Although this \nresolution before us for the third day now should only be concerned \nwith illegality, we are nonetheless at an impasse because the \nproponents of this nonbinding and unnecessary resolution refuse to \ninclude themselves in the scope of the inquiry. No wonder people are \nturned off by government.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I will not support this one-sided \nresolution calling for an independent counsel to investigate only one \naspect of the 1996 elections. I have made clear my belief that one \nshould be appointed and I did\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\nso long before the political exercises which have consumed the \nJudiciary Committee and this body were set in motion a few weeks ago. \nFurther, I will not support the Democratic alternative because it fails \nto call for an independent counsel. While the Democratic alternative is \ncorrect that any investigation must necessarily cover Congress it falls \nshort of calling for an independent counsel. But more importantly Mr. \nPresident, than how any one of us votes on these resolutions, it is my \nsincere hope that we can set aside the divisive partisan issues which \nhave characterized the outset of the 105th Congress and move toward \nbipartisan solutions. We should balance the budget, we should address \njuvenile crime, we should strengthen educational programs, and we \nshould reform the campaign laws which have created the unrelenting \nmoney chase that gives rise to so many of the problems which frame this \ndebate.\n  The campaign finance system in this Nation is broken and in desperate \nneed of repair and the American people understand that, even if some \nmembers of the Senate seem to believe the current, scandal-ridden \nsystem works fine, they certainly don't feel that way. Furthermore, the \nAmerican people also understand that the responsibility for the current \nscandals regarding the campaign fundraising activities of the 1996 \nFederal elections lie at the feet of both parties, the administration \nand the Congress.\n  Yet what is ultimately more important than assessing blame and \npassing nonbinding resolutions is whether or not this body moves \nforward and adopts comprehensive, bipartisan campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the majority is bringing to a vote a \nresolution that urges the Attorney General to begin the process of \nappointing an independent counsel to investigate allegations of illegal \nfundraising in the 1996 Presidential election campaign. I will oppose \nthis resolution, if it remains unchanged, because it urges an overly \nnarrow, one-sided investigation. Instead, I will support the \nalternative to be proposed by Senator Leahy.\n  Let us remember that the independent counsel law places the authority \nto seek an independent counsel in the hands of the Attorney General, \nand her hands are tied unless certain thresholds are met. I have great \nfaith in the independence and integrity of Janet Reno. She has already \ninvoked the independent counsel process several times during this \nadministration. If and when she believes that the law should be \ntriggered, she will, I am confident, take appropriate action. Yet the \nmajority seeks with this unfortunate resolution to tell her what to do.\n  I hope that the majority will instead accept the alternative \nresolution being proposed by Senator Leahy. The Leahy amendment would \nchange the majority's resolution in several ways, all for the better.\n  The Leahy amendment suggests that the Attorney General use her best \nprofessional judgment to determine whether to invoke the independent \ncounsel process. It asks that she make her decision without regard to \npolitical pressures. It urges her to do so in accordance with the \nstandards of the law and the established procedures of the Department \nof Justice. And it makes no distinction between presidential and \ncongressional campaigns; it urges that potential illegalities by \ncovered persons be investigated, regardless of which branch of \ngovernment is involved.\n  In short, the Leahy alternative attempts to observe both the letter \nand the spirit of the law in this matter. It avoids prejudging the \nissue. Most importantly, it attempts to prevent the further \npoliticization of the independent counsel process, a process that \nCongress established in order to take politics out of the investigation \nor prosecution of high government officials.\n  Fundamentally, that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nmajority's resolution and support the Leahy alternative. Let us not \nattempt to politically influence our Justice Department and Federal \njudiciary in this matter. Let us not make a bad situation worse. Let us \nrepeat the bipartisanship that we showed last week. Let us respect the \nindependent counsel law and the independence of the judiciary. And let \nus also proceed with a diligent and thorough congressional \ninvestigation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of the time \nallotted to the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I do not know whether in the coming \nweeks the Attorney General will determine whether or not the threshold \nhas been reached to name independent counsel. But I do know, in her \ntenure of service, Attorney General Reno has had an uncompromising \nsense of personal integrity. She was called upon in a number of \ninstances to reach a determination about investigating high officials \nin this administration, including President Clinton. She has never \nhesitated to act in the interests of justice. So, while I do not \npersonally believe at the moment that the circumstances exist for \nindependent counsel as defined by the law, it is important, again, to \nreassure ourselves about the quality of justice in this country under \nthe leadership of the Attorney General and, just as important, in the \ngreat traditions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the able \nleadership of the Bureau's Director, Louis Freeh.\n  Though I recognize that today some disagree and in their own judgment \nbelieve that it would be better in the national interest to proceed to \nan independent counsel, whether you accept their evaluation on this day \nor perhaps mine in believing it should be left to another day, there is \nthe question about whether or not the act is able to be properly \nimplemented at this moment as intended in the independent counsel \nstatute. It is my judgment that, while we may differ in this \ninstitution on whether or not the act should be applied, we should be \nable to agree on the underlying problem, and that is there is a problem \nin the court with the ability to appoint a special counsel.\n  The statute requires that the Chief Justice appoint judges to serve \nin the special division for a term of 2 years. Three judges are to \nserve on the council that will, in turn, name a special counsel in this \nor any other instance. It was the intention of the Congress to \nfacilitate a rotation of these judges to ensure their independence so \nthat no one dominates the appointing process, for purposes of the \nconfidence of this Congress and the interests of justice. For whatever \nreasons, what were to be temporary assignments on the court in this \nspecial division appear to be becoming lifetime appointments. Judge \nSentelle, who chairs the court, is in his third consecutive term. Judge \nButzner is in his fourth. Judge Fay has now begun his second term.\n  Mr. President, this is not what was intended in the independent \ncounsel statute, and as we debate today the relative merits of whether \nto appoint an independent counsel, every Member of the Senate needs to \nconsider, if the Attorney General is requested to make this \nappointment, who will be making the appointment and what confidence do \nwe have the congressional intent of independence and the integrity of \nthe judgments will meet the necessary standards of justice?\n  Most particularly is the question of Judge Sentelle. Judge Sentelle's \nposition in leading this three-judge panel raises serious questions \nand, indeed, I believe inhibits the ability of the Attorney General to \nproceed with confidence when and if she reaches a determination the \nstatutory requirements to name an independent counsel are reached.\n  During the 1993 debate over reauthorization of the independent \ncounsel statute, Senator Cohen perhaps said it best. He said:\n\n       The appearance of justice is just as important as justice \n     itself, in terms of maintaining public confidence in our \n     judicial system.\n\n  Mr. President, no one could possibly believe that the appearance of \njustice is served by having Judge Sentelle in these circumstances name \nan independent counsel. Judge Sentelle is a known\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\npolitical associate of two Republican Senators who have views on this \nissue. He has served as a member of Senator Helms' National \nCongressional Republican Club and was chairman of the North Carolina \nState Republican Party convention. He stands accused of engineering the \nremoval of Whitewater counsel, Robert Fiske, and replacing him with an \nindependent counsel who clearly has exercised his position with \nquestionable judgment and clear partisanship. I speak, of course, of \nKenneth Starr.\n  The decision to appoint Mr. Starr came only days after Judge Sentelle \nhad a private luncheon with two Members of this institution who had \nstrong views on the subject, in what was an extrajudicial and clearly \ninappropriate meeting.\n  Mr. President, despite poor judgment, inappropriate actions, Judge \nSentelle was recently reappointed to his third term on the court. As \nsenior judge in this position, with the other two judges serving in \nthis similar capacity, both on senior status, he clearly has an \nextraordinary influence over the operation of the appointing process.\n  Five former presidents of the American Bar Association considered \nthese facts, these extrajudicial communications, and determined they \ngive rise to appearance of impropriety.\n  As long as Judge Sentelle sits on the special division, there will \nalways be questions regarding the objectivity of the independent \ncounsel appointments. I believe, therefore, whether you share my \njudgment that the trust should be placed in the Attorney General to \ndetermine whether or not the requisite requirements have been reached \nin the statute before appointing or requesting the appointment of an \nindependent counsel or you agree with other Members of the Senate that \nthose criteria have already been reached, we certainly, in the interest \nof fairness, can reach a judgment today that Judge Sentelle should \nrecuse himself from his current responsibilities. Failing that recusal, \nit is certainly incumbent upon Chief Justice Rehnquist, given his \ngeneral responsibility for the administration of the courts, to remove \nJudge Sentelle or request that he temporarily remove himself from the \nappointment process.\n  I recognize the strong divisions in the Senate. I understand the \npassions that this issue brings to different Members of the Congress. \nBut certainly despite our partisan differences or our interpretations \nof the facts, our common interest in justice should lead us to one \ndetermination. There is a need in our country and in this Senate to \ncome away from this debate with a feeling that an impartial and a fair \nadministrator of justice is required to implement the independent \ncounsel statute, whether that determination in naming an independent \ncounsel is to be reached now or whether the facts dictate that they are \nto be named later.\n  Mr. President, it is a simple question of fairness and justice. I \nhope other Members of the Senate will join with me in calling upon \nJudge Sentelle, in the best traditions of the American judiciary, to \nrecuse himself now, but I also hope, before any other Members of this \nSenate need to rise and express themselves on these facts, the Chief \nJustice of the United States will exercise his responsibilities to \nensure that the courts are true to their traditions of justice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2397-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RELATIVE TO THE DECISION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON THE INDEPENDENT \n                            COUNSEL PROCESS\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr. President, today the Labor Committee is \nconsidering the nomination of Alexis Herman to be Secretary of Labor. \nAlexis Herman has been a friend and a colleague for many years. I \nbelieve she would make an outstanding Secretary of Labor. She has \nalways shown the leadership, good judgment, and high principles that \nthe job requires. Her commitment to improving the condition of \nAmerica's working people is second to none.\n  Alexis Herman has long dedicated her efforts to putting all Americans \nto work. She began her career by bringing together workers needing \nemployment and employers needing workers. She did this by providing \nrelevant, necessary training for potential employees so that they \npossessed the skills needed by employers.\n  Through her work, companies across America had access to employees \nwho had the specific skills necessary for each company's particular \njobs, and the people she trained were able to obtain work because they \nwere trained for positions that actually existed.\n  As you know, she went on to head the Women's Bureau of the Department \nof Labor under President Carter. Her work there included helping \ndisplaced homemakers enter the work force, increasing opportunities for \nwomen to apprentice in skilled trades, and promoting women-owned \nbusinesses, something that has received strong bipartisan support in \nthe Congress.\n  I would like especially to highlight her efforts at the Women's \nBureau to provide job training opportunities for welfare recipients. \nNow, more than ever, we need to promote practical policies for putting \npeople to work. Last year's welfare bill will mean that a flood of \nuntrained, unskilled people will be searching desperately for work, or \ntheir families will go hungry. Without skills and training, however, \ntheir prospects for finding a job are bleak. We need Alexis Herman's \npractical experience working with employers and employees in the coming \nyears if we are to put over a million people to work.\n\n  Alexis Herman's commitment to diversity will also enhance our work \nforce. We, in this Nation, have the best work force in this world. Any \ntime we retreat from providing equal opportunities to all of our \ncitizens, however, we risk weakening our greatest asset, our workers. \nIf we fail to utilize the talents of all of our people, we sell \nourselves short as a nation. With her vast experience in increasing \ndiversity in the workplace, Alexis Herman will ensure that no talent \ngoes untapped.\n  In addition, as public liaison for President Clinton, Ms. Herman \nworked with Americans across the country--Americans with diverse \nbackgrounds and concerns. She has served as a liaison with these many \ndiverse groups and the President so successfully, because she is \ninterested in, sympathetic to, and able to work with, the full spectrum \nof the American people.\n  I would also like to note Ms. Herman's commitment to continue the \nwork of Secretary Reich in enhancing pension security. I have spent the \nlast several years focusing on retirement security for all Americans, \nand for women in particular. Secretary Reich was a strong ally and we \nare beginning to make progress. Retirement security is one of the most \nimportant issues for our time, with baby boomers turning 50 every 9 \nseconds. If we allow a generation to retire into poverty, the Nation\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\nwill lose a generation of consumers and gain a generation of \ndependents; an outcome that no one wants. I am confident that Alexis \nHerman's talent and experience will propel the efforts to improve \nretirement security forward and I would welcome the opportunity to work \nwith her on this issue.\n  I would like to emphasize that I believe that one of Ms. Herman's \ngreatest strengths is that she has formed partnerships with both \nbusiness and labor in her many years working on employment issues. She \nunderstands the kind of investment business must make in human capital \nto improve productivity, increase profits, and create new jobs. She \nunderstands how difficult it is for small businesses to start up, and \nalso how important these small businesses are to the economy as a \nwhole. She understands that people want to work, and that they need the \nopportunity to be trained so that they can become productive members of \nthe work force. She understands that we are all in this together.\n  Alexis Herman has spent many years serving the people and the \ncountry. I believe that there could be no better candidate for \nSecretary of Labor than Alexis Herman. She is an outstanding public \nservant. Her confirmation will make history; as Secretary of Labor she \nwill make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans and \nworkers throughout the world. I urge my colleagues to support the \nnomination of Alexis Herman to be Secretary of Labor and I look forward \nto her rapid confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2411-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

PAUL CURRIE ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, Senator Christopher S. ``Kit\" Bond and I \nwould like to share with our colleagues in the U.S. Senate the example \nof a man who has been a model of citizenship, character, and service to \nhumanity throughout his lifetime. The gentleman about whom I speak is \nDr. Paul Currie, who will soon retire as pastor of the Presbyterian \nChurch of Caruthersville.\n  On September 22, 1983, Dr. Paul Currie was present in this Chamber \nserving as Chaplain and offering the opening prayer. While this is \nhistorically an honor for any individual, we believe it was more of an \nhonor for the U.S. Senate to have Dr. Currie serving in this chamber. \nIndeed, we believe the nearly four decades of service rendered to the \ncommunity of Caruthersville, MO, serves as the real testimony to his \ncompassion for his fellow man.\n  Since arriving in Caruthersville in 1958, Dr. Currie has always \nsought to reach beyond the lines of faith and unite all denominations \nin service to those in need. We can take faith that there are others \nwho have been inspired by Dr. Currie and now live outside our great \nstate, serving others.\n  Although Dr. Currie will be retiring, we will never forget his \nleadership. This veteran of the Korean war, this humble servant of God, \ncommunity, and family, deserves to be recognized for his decades of \nservice to his fellow man.\n  Senator Bond and I recognize today not only a lifetime of \naccomplishments by Dr. Currie, but also his inspiration of others. His \nexample will inspire others to seek to enhance freedom, opportunity, \nand family life for generations to come.\n  In closing, I would like to quote a few words from Matthew 25:21, \nwhich I feel summarizes Dr. Paul Currie's many great deeds: ``Well \ndone, my good and faithful servant!\"\n  We congratulate Dr. Currie on his retirement and extend him our best \nwishes for health and happiness for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2412-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:29 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to the \nprovisions of section 274(b)(2) of Public Law 104-264, the Speaker \nappoints to the National Civil Aviation Review Commission the following \nmembers from private life on the part of the House: Mr. John J. \nO'Connor of Pennsylvania and Mr. D.

A bill to establish a partnership to rebuild and modernize \nAmerica's school facilities; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n        THE PARTNERSHIP TO REBUILD AMERICA'S SCHOOLS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I send to the desk, and I am \npleased to introduce, along with a number of my colleagues, the \nPartnership To Rebuild America's School Act of 1997. This legislation \nis designed to address one of the most fundamental problems that we \ncurrently face as a nation with regard to public elementary and \nsecondary education: many of our schools are literally falling down \naround our children. This legislation will help us address this \nproblem, the crisis of crumbling schools in America.\n  On Friday, the President officially transmitted this legislation to \nthe Congress. The bill is the result of months of work by the \nDepartment of Education, the Department of the Treasury, the White \nHouse, my office, and a number of other congressional offices.\n  At the outset, I commend and thank everyone who has participated in \nthe development of this legislation for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, the Partnership To Rebuild America's Schools Act of \n1997 will help States and local school districts finance the repair, \nrenovation, modernization and construction of their schools. States and \nschool districts will be able to use the Federal funds to assist them \nin financing their highest priority projects.\n  This bill will allow school districts to do more of what they need to \nbe doing, educating our children for the 21st century.\n  In America, the rungs on the ladder of opportunity are still crafted \nin the classroom. High school graduates earn, on average, 46 percent \nmore every year than those who do not graduate. College graduates earn \n155 percent more every year than those who do not graduate from high \nschool. Over the course of a lifetime, the most educated Americans will \nearn five times as much as the least educated.\n  Education, however, is not just a matter of individual benefit. It is \na public good as well. It affects and correlates to the status and the \nquality of life for our entire community. It correlates to just about \nevery indicia of economic and social well-being. Educational attainment \ncan be directly tied to income, health, the likelihood of being on \nwelfare, the likelihood of being incarcerated, and the likelihood of \nvoting and participating in our democracy. Education, therefore, has \nboth national as well as individual implications.\n  In a recent Wall Street Journal survey of leading U.S. economists, 43 \npercent of those surveyed said the single most important thing that we \ncould do to increase our long-term economic growth rate would be to \ninvest more in education and research and development. Nothing else \neven came close to education in the survey. One economist said, ``One \nof the few things that economists will agree upon is the fact that \neconomic growth is very strongly dependent on our own abilities.''\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton noted that \neducation is a critical national security issue for our future. I \nbelieve this notion should be at the heart of our debate over \neducation.\n  In order to compete with cheap, Third World labor in a global \neconomy, in an information age, and to maintain the standard of living \nto which we have grown accustomed as Americans, we will have to have a \nwork force that works smarter, that works better, that can hold its own \nin this global economy at the high end of the productivity scale.\n  So education then becomes a matter of national concern and, indeed, \nas the President pointed out, a matter of our national security, \nbecause it is directly linked to our ability to be able to maintain the \nstandard of living that we have come to appreciate as Americans and our \nability to compete in this global marketplace.\n  We all have a role to play. That is why this legislation starts off \ncalling itself a partnership, because there must be a partnership \nbetween State, local and National Government to\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\nmeet the challenge that this global economy, and changes in the world, \nhave given us all to face.\n  The Partnership To Rebuild America's Schools Act of 1997 will help us \nto meet the challenge by investing in education in ways that preserve \nthe fundamental tenet of local control of education.\n  By investing in bricks and mortar the Federal Government can \ncontribute to a more balanced partnership among all levels of \nGovernment and in the private sector to rebuild and modernize our \nschools so they can serve all of our children in the 21st century. This \nlegislation strikes that balance. This legislation does preserve local \ncontrol, but, much to the point, it says that we at the national level \nhave an obligation to participate in addressing those needs that can be \nmost appropriately addressed at the national level; and that is \nrebuilding our crumbling schools.\n  The bill uses 5 billion Federal dollars to leverage an additional $15 \nbillion worth of State, local and private resources. Half of the money \nwill be apportioned to States using the existing Title I basic grants \nformula. The remainder will flow directly to the 100 school districts \nin the country with the largest numbers of children living below the \npoverty level.\n\n  Of the amount available for direct assistance to these impoverished \ncommunities, the Department of Education will apportion 70 percent by \nformula and will make the remaining 30 percent available on a \ncompetitive basis.\n  In addition, the bill will allocate 2 percent of the funds to the \nSecretary of the Interior for administration to Indian schools and to \nthe Secretary of Education for the outlying territories.\n  Under both the State and local programs, States and school districts \nwould have an enormous amount of flexibility in the use of these \nFederal funds to help finance school improvement projects. They could \nuse the funds to subsidize State or local bond issues, certificates of \nparticipation, purchase or lease agreements, or other financial \ntransactions used to finance school improvements.\n  In addition, the States would be allowed to capitalize on entities \nsimilar to the State infrastructure banks which are currently used by a \nnumber of States to help finance highway improvement projects. These \ninfrastructure banks could be used to leverage additional resources.\n  This program is designed to stimulate new construction and \nrenovation, and there are specific provisions in the bill to ensure \nthat Federal funds are not used simply to finance school improvements \nthat would have occurred anyway. The bill is designed to fill a real \nneed that exists at both the State and local levels for school \nfinancing assistance, not to supplement districts that would have \notherwise been able to finance their projects.\n  It is carefully crafted to minimize administrative costs at the \nFederal level and to maximize local control over decisions that must be \nmade with regard to school improvements.\n  States and districts will be required to submit applications to the \nSecretary of Education describing their needs and the process that will \nbe used to award the Federal funds. Once these applications are \napproved, grantees will immediately receive the full share of the $5 \nbillion.\n  In addition, other than following certain criteria, States and local \ndistricts will be free to finance their top-priority projects. The \nFederal Government will not be in the business of dictating priorities \nand needs to State and local school districts who know their schools \nbest.\n  This bill helps address a need that has completely overwhelmed States \nand local school districts. The magnitude of the school facilities \nproblem is so great today that many districts cannot maintain the kind \nof educational environment necessary to teach all of our children the \nkind of skills they will need to compete in the 21st century, global \neconomy.\n  The U.S. General Accounting Office, which at my request conducted an \nintensive 2-year study of the condition of America's schools, recently \nconcluded that 14 million children attend schools in need of major \nrenovations or outright replacement, and 7 million children attend \nschools with life-threatening safety code violations. They found that \nit will cost $112 billion to essentially bring schools up to code, not \nto equip them with new computers and cosmetic improvements, but just to \naddress the toll that decades of deferred maintenance have taken on our \nNation's school facilities.\n  That $112 billion price tag, as enormous as it may sound, does not \ninclude the cost of wiring schools for modern technology. One of the \ngreatest barriers to the incorporation of modern computers into the \nclassroom is the physical condition of many school buildings. You \ncannot very well use a computer if you do not have the electrical \nsystem to plug it into the wall. Too many schools across the country do \nnot have the physical capacity to provide our youngsters with the \ninstruments they will need in order to be educated for this information \nage.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, almost half of all \nschools lack enough electrical power for the full-scale use of \ncomputers, 60 percent of them lack enough conduits in the walls \nto connect classroom computers to a network, and more than 60 percent \nlack enough phone lines for instructional use.\n\n  For this generation, computers really are the functional equivalent \nof books. My son sometimes is amazed that computers were not around \nwhen I was in school. The fact of the matter is, though, that many of \nour schools were built before the advent of these technologies, and \nthey have not been upgraded so that modern teaching tools can be used \nin the classroom. Our youngsters need modern technology if they are to \nbe prepared for this information age and for this global economy.\n  That $112 billion price tag also does not include the cost of \nexpanding capacity to accommodate soaring enrollments. According to the \nU.S. Department of Education, just to keep up with growing enrollment, \nwe will need to build 6,000 new schools over the next 10 years.\n  Teachers and parents know full well that these conditions directly \naffect the ability of children to learn. Recent research, however, has \nlent scientific proof to that intuitive knowledge. Two separate studies \nfound a 10 to 11 percent achievement gap between students in good \nschool buildings and those in poor school buildings after controlling \nfor all other factors.\n  Other studies have found that when buildings are in poor condition, \nstudents are more likely to misbehave. That should come as no surprise \nto parents. Three leading researchers in this area recently concluded, \n``Based on our research, there is no doubt that building condition \naffects academic performance.''\n  Mr. President, this legislation is in the interest, I believe, of not \njust the children of America who have to go to these school buildings, \nmany of which are dilapidated and rundown and neglected, but it is also \nin the interest of communities that will need the help to finance \nschool repairs, and it is in the interest of our Nation that will need \nto have an educated work force.\n  Mr. President, the current system of school finance, which relies \nprimarily on local property taxes, is not flexible enough to meet the \nenormous needs of our Nation's schools. This country, I believe, needs \na new approach to solve the problem of crumbling schools, a partnership \namong all levels of government and the private sector that preserves \nlocal control of education, but creates some balance, and infuses, \nfrankly, a little more reason into our school finance system that does \nnot now adequately serve the schools, the children, the country, or the \nlocal property taxpayers.\n  The Department of Education has looked closely at a number of \ncommunities around the country and assessed the effect that this \nlegislation would have on their ability to finance their construction \nneeds. The Department looked at, for example, Los Angeles. Most of the \nschool buildings there are more than 40 years old and are not wired for \ntechnology. Mr. President, 245 schools need roof replacements, and 50 \nof them need new boilers. According to the Department, this legislation \ncould accelerate many long overdue projects and facilitate the passage \nof bond referenda at the local level.\n  The Department also looked at the State of Maine, which has many 100-\nyear-old buildings and one-room\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\nschoolhouses. According to the Department, most districts in that State \ncannot cover the total cost of bonds issued to finance repair and \nmodernization projects. Again, this legislation would allow needed \nprojects to go forward.\n  The Department also looked at a school district in southern Florida \nsuffering from severe overcrowding. Mr. President, 34,000 students in \nthat district do not have permanent desks. There are 10,000 new \nstudents added to the system each year. The district would have to \nbuild a new school every month to keep up with this demand. According \nto the Department this legislation will help this district move away \nfrom the use of portable classrooms, which do not provide as conducive \na learning environment as real schools.\n  My own State of Illinois would benefit greatly from this legislation. \nAs the GAO reported last week, my State has unfortunately one of the \nmost inequitable school finance systems in the Nation. With a low State \ncontribution to school resources, and with a poor State effort to \ntarget funds to the neediest districts, local property taxpayers in \nIllinois are saddled with almost 60 percent of the costs of educating \ntheir children. It is no wonder, then, that the State board of \neducation estimates that Illinois' construction needs are $13 billion. \nToo many of Illinois' school districts have a difficult time even \nproviding textbooks and pencils, let alone major capital improvements. \nThis legislation would free up local resources in Illinois for \neducation by providing Federal support for the construction, \nrehabilitation and renovation of the school buildings.\n  I urge all my colleagues to take a close look at the needs of the \nschools in their States and consider joining us in cosponsoring this \nlegislation. This initiative is not about partisan politics. In fact, I \nthink most Americans would agree wholeheartedly with the President when \nhe said that partisan politics should stop at the schoolhouse door. \nThis is something that transcends partisan differences and goes to the \nheart of our ability to provide for our children's well-being and their \nneeds going into the 21st century.\n  Congress has a unique opportunity to take a fundamentally new \napproach to improving the quality of elementary and secondary \neducation. This bill represents a chance to improve our system of \nschool finance and help prepare our children for the 21st century. I \nbelieve this will be welcomed by taxpayers at the local level, \nparticularly those who, at this point, are unfairly burdened with the \ncosts of trying to keep up a school system that deserves the support of \nall levels of government in our country.\n  Mr. President, I have several documents from the Department of \nEducation that I would like to have printed in the Record. I have the \nletter of transmittal from the Secretary of Education to the President \nof the Senate, a fact sheet regarding the correlation between building \nconditions and student achievement, and seven case studies assessing \nthe impact this legislation would have on communities across America. I \nask unanimous consent that these materials, as well as the text of the \nbill itself, be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 456\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Partnership to Rebuild America's \n     Schools Act of 1997.''\n\n            TITLE I--SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n                           TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nSEC. 101.

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) According to the General Accounting Office, one-third \n     of all elementary and secondary schools in the United States, \n     serving 14,000,000 students, need extensive repair or \n     renovation.\n       (2) School infrastructure problems exist across the \n     country, but are most severe in central cities and in schools \n     with high proportions of poor and minority children.\n       (3) Many States and school districts will need to build new \n     schools in order to accommodate increasing student \n     enrollments; the Department of Education has predicted that \n     the Nation will need 6,000 more schools by the year 2006.\n       (4) Many schools do not have the physical infrastructure to \n     take advantage of computers and other technology needed to \n     meet the challenges of the next century.\n       (5) While school construction and maintenance are primarily \n     a State and local concern, States and communities have not, \n     on their own, met the increasing burden of \n     providing acceptable school facilities for all students, \n     and the poorest communities have had the greatest \n     difficulty meeting this need.\n       (6) The Federal Government, by providing interest subsidies \n     and similar types of support, can lower the costs of State \n     and local school infrastructure investment, creating an \n     incentive for States and localities to increase their own \n     infrastructure improvement efforts and helping ensure that \n     all students are able to attend schools that are equipped for \n     the 21st century.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide Federal \n     interest subsidies, or similar assistance, to States and \n     localities to help them bring all public school facilities up \n     to an acceptable standard and build the additional public \n     schools needed to educate the additional numbers of students \n     who will enroll in the next decade.\n\n\n                              definitions\n\n       Sec. 103.

Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed for consideration of the \n     Congress is the Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act \n     of 1997, a bill that would provide a one-time Federal \n     stimulus to help States and localities bring all public \n     school facilities up to acceptable standards and build the \n     additional schools needed to serve increasing enrollments. \n     Also enclosed is a section-by-section analysis summarizing \n     the contents of the bill. I am sending an identical letter to \n     the Speaker of the House.\n       Mr. President, a number of factors have led the \n     Administration to conclude that the Federal Government must \n     assist the States and localities in providing the school \n     facilities that our children will need if they are to achieve \n     to challenging educational standards. First of all, recent \n     General Accounting Office reports have documented the \n     deplorable condition of too many of the Nation's schools. \n     According to the GAO, one-third of all schools, serving more \n     than 14 million students, need extensive repair or renovation \n     of one or more buildings. Students are attending schools that \n     have antiquated heating, plumbing, and electrical systems and \n     even fail to meet local health and safety codes. Some schools \n     do not provide full access to individuals with disabilities, \n     and many do not have the infrastructure needed to adopt new \n     educational technologies. All of these problems are most \n     prevalent in urban districts.\n       In addition to making repairs and renovations to their \n     existing schools, many districts will have to build new \n     schools in order to accommodate increasing enrollments. In \n     fact, the Department has projected that States and localities \n     will need to build 6,000 more schools in order to serve an \n     additional 2.9 million students who will enroll in the next \n     decade. This need will put further pressure on already \n     strained school budgets.\n       Clearly, school construction is, and will remain, primarily \n     a State and local responsibility, and the vast majority of \n     facilities needs will have to be met with non-Federal \n     resources. Unfortunately, however, for a variety of reasons \n     State and local governments have not been making substantial \n     progress even in clearing the existing backlog of \n     construction needs. The Federal Government can play a crucial \n     role in addressing this problem by providing limited \n     resources, on a one-time basis, in a manner that spurs \n     States, communities, and even the private sector to bear the \n     burden and provide adequate school facilities for all \n     children. That is the purpose of the enclosed legislation.\n       In order to have maximum impact, our bill would leverage \n     State, local, and private support for school construction, \n     rather than paying for 100 percent of the cost of \n     construction projects. The proposal would provide interest \n     subsidies for school construction bonds, or other financing \n     mechanisms, to States and major urban school districts. \n     States would, in turn, pass these subsidies along to \n     localities, use them to reduce the servicing costs of State \n     bonds or other financing vehicles, use them to capitalize \n     State revolving funds for school construction, or use them \n     for other, similar purposes. The maximum amount of Federal \n     subsidy would be the equivalent of 50 percent of the interest \n     cost on bonds. Through this mechanism, every dollar of \n     Federal money would be matched by a minimum of three dollars \n     of State, local, or private money.\n       The Federal Government would not determine the specific \n     construction projects that would be funded. Rather, States \n     and localities would use the Federal subsidy for the costs of \n     construction projects that reflect their highest needs, such \n     as addressing health and safety problems or problems with air \n     quality, plumbing, heating, and lighting; removal of \n     architectural barriers in order to ensure access for \n     individuals with disabilities; projects to increase energy \n     efficiency; construction to facilitate the use of modern \n     educational technologies; and new construction needed to \n     accommodate increased enrollments. While the State and local \n     recipients would have the flexibility to determine which of \n     these types of construction activities are their highest \n     priority, they would have to base their use of the Federal \n     funds on a thorough survey of State or local school \n     construction needs and use the funds in a manner consistent \n     with several other general criteria such as, at the State \n     level, awarding the subsidy to communities with the greatest \n     construction needs and the least ability to meet those needs \n     with their own resources.\n       Under the program, the Department would allocate one-half \n     of a $5 billion mandatory appropriation to States using the \n     existing ``Title I'' basic grants formula. The remainder \n     would flow directly to the 100 districts that enroll the \n     greatest numbers of children living in poverty; those urban \n     districts, according to the GAO data, have far and away the \n     greatest school construction needs. Of the amount available \n     for direct assistance to urban districts, the Department \n     would allocate seventy percent by formula, again on a Title I \n     basis, and make the remainder available competitively to \n     districts that have particularly severe needs and are willing \n     to provide the most support for infrastructure improvements \n     from non-Federal resources.\n       Under both the State and local programs, a critical \n     objective would be to spur additional construction paid for \n     with non-Federal dollars. For this reason, the bill would \n     prohibit recipients from using the Federal funds to supplant \n     State and local support for school construction. In addition, \n     each State or locality receiving assistance would have to \n     assure the Department that it will increase, over a four-year \n     period, the amount of school construction paid for with non-\n     Federal funds compared to the level expended during the \n     preceding four-year period. These provisions would ensure \n     that a one-time Federal stimulus has an impact far beyond the \n     immediate benefit attributable to the Federal expenditures.\n       Administration of the program would be kept simple. The \n     Department would make a single award to each State and \n     locality receiving direct assistance. We would allow the \n     recipients to invest the Federal funds in a prudent manner, \n     and use the returns from that investment to meet bond \n     payments and other costs. All of the mandatory appropriation \n     would become available in fiscal year 1998, and all the \n     payments would be made within a four-year period.\n       To summarize, our bill reflects the following principles: \n     (1) The Federal Government should make available a one-time \n     $5 billion mandatory appropriation to address the major \n     national problem of inadequate school infrastructure; (2) The \n     Federal funds will have their greatest impact if they are \n     used to leverage additional State, local, and private effort \n     rather than for direct support for the entire cost of \n     construction projects; (3) Because the largest cities have \n     the most school construction needs, and often the fewest \n     resources for meeting those needs, they should receive a \n     major share of the funding; and (4) States and localities \n     should have the flexibility to use the Federal subsidy to \n     carry out the construction projects they deem most important, \n     but they should do so only after completing a careful survey \n     of their construction needs. Further, both the States and the \n     Federal Government should direct the subsidy to the most \n     needy communities.\n       I urge the Congress to take prompt and favorable action on \n     this proposal. Its enactment would spur States and \n     communities nationwide to bring their school facilities up to \n     the standard our children need and deserve.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this proposal to the \n     Congress and that its adoption would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Richard W. Riley.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       Impact of Inadequate School Facilities on Student Learning\n\n       A number of studies have shown that many school systems, \n     particularly those in urban and high-poverty areas, are \n     plagued by decaying buildings that threaten the health, \n     safety, and learning opportunities of students. Good \n     facilities appear to be an important precondition for student \n     learning, provided that other conditions are present that\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\n     support a strong academic program in the school. A growing \n     body of research has linked student achievement and behavior \n     to the physical building conditions and overcrowding.\n\n\n                      Physical Building conditions\n\n       Decaying environmental conditions such as peeling paint, \n     crumbling plaster, nonfunctioning toilets, poor lighting, \n     inadequate ventilation, and inoperative heating and cooling \n     systems can affect the learning as well as the health and the \n     morale of staff and students.\n\n                     Impact on student achievement\n\n       A study of the District of Columbia school system found, \n     after controlling for other variables such as a student's \n     socioeconomic status, that students' standardized achievement \n     scores were lower in schools with poor building conditions. \n     Students in school buildings in poor condition had \n     achievement that was 6% below schools in fair condition and \n     11% below schools in excellent condition. (Edwards, 1991)\n       Cash (1993) examined the relationship between building \n     condition and student achievement in small, rural Virginia \n     high schools. Student scores on achievement tests, adjusted \n     for socioeconomic status, was found to be up to 5 percentile \n     points lower in buildings with lower quality ratings. \n     Achievement also appeared to be more directly related to \n     cosmetic factors than to structural ones. Poorer achievement \n     was associated with specific building condition factors such \n     as substandard science facilities, air conditioning, locker \n     conditions, classroom furniture, more graffiti, and noisy \n     external environments.\n       Similarly, Hines' (1996) study of large, urban high schools \n     in Virginia also found a relationship between building \n     condition and student achievement. Indeed, Hines found that \n     student achievement was as much as 11 percentile points lower \n     in substandard buildings as compared to above-standard \n     buildings.\n       A study of North Dakota high schools, a state selected in \n     part because of its relatively homogeneous, rural population, \n     also found a positive relationship between school condition \n     (as measured by principals' survey responses) and both \n     student achievement and student behavior. (Earthman, 1995)\n       McGuffey (1982) concluded that heating and air conditioning \n     systems appeared to be very important, along with special \n     instructional facilities (i.e., science laboratories or \n     equipment) and color and interior painting, in contributing \n     to student achievement. Proper building maintenance was also \n     found to be related to better attitudes and fewer \n     disciplinary problems in one cited study.\n       Research indicates that the quality of air inside public \n     school facilities may significantly affect students' ability \n     to concentrate. The evidence suggests that youth, especially \n     those under ten years of age, are more vulnerable than adults \n     to the types of contaminants (asbestos, radon, and \n     formaldehyde) found in some school facilities (Andrews and \n     Neuroth, 1988).\n\n                           Impact on teaching\n\n       Lowe (1988) interviewed State Teachers of the Year to \n     determine which aspects of the physical environment affected \n     their teaching the most, and these teachers pointed to the \n     availability and quality of classroom equipment and \n     furnishings, as well as ambient features such as climate \n     control and acoustics as the most important environmental \n     factors. In particular, the teachers emphasized that the \n     ability to control classroom temperature is crucial to the \n     effective performance of both students and teachers.\n       A study of working conditions in urban schools concluded \n     that ``physical conditions have direct positive and negative \n     effects on teacher morale, sense of personal safety, feelings \n     of effectiveness in the classroom, and on the general \n     learning environment.'' Building renovations in one district \n     led teachers to feel ``a renewed sense of hope, of \n     commitment, a belief that the district cared about what went \n     on in that building.'' In dilapidated buildings in another \n     district, the atmosphere was punctuated more by despair and \n     frustration, with teachers reporting that leaking roofs, \n     burned out lights, and broken toilets were the typical \n     backdrop for teaching and learning.'' (Corcoran et al., 1988)\n       Corcoran et al. (1988) also found that ``where the problems \n     with working conditions are serious enough to impinge on the \n     work of teachers, they result in higher absenteeism, reduced \n     levels of effort, lower effectiveness in the classroom low \n     morale, and reduced job satisfaction. Where working \n     conditions are good, they result in enthusiasm, high morale, \n     cooperation, and acceptance of responsibility.''\n       A Carnegie Foundation (1988) report on urban schools \n     concluded that ``the tacit message of the physical \n     indignities in many urban schools is not lost on students. It \n     bespeaks neglect, and students' conduct seems simply an \n     extension of the physical environment that surrounds them.'' \n     Similarly, Poplin and Weeres (1992) reported that, based on \n     an intensive study of teachers, administrators, and students \n     in four schools, ``the depressed physical environment of many \n     schools . . . is believed to reflect society's lack of \n     priority for these children and their education.''\n\n\n                              Overcrowding\n\n       Overcrowded schools are a serious problem in many school \n     systems, particularly in the inner cities, where space for \n     new construction is at a premium and funding for such \n     construction is limited. As a result, students find \n     themselves trying to learn while jammed into spaces never \n     intended as classrooms, such as libraries, gymnasiums, \n     laboratories, lunchrooms, and even closets. Although research \n     on the relationship between overcrowding and student learning \n     has been limited, there is some evidence, particularly in \n     high-poverty schools, that overcrowding can have an adverse \n     impact on learning.\n       A study of overcrowded schools in New York City found that \n     students in such schools scored significantly lower on both \n     mathematics and reading exams than did similar students in \n     underutilized schools. In addition, when asked, students and \n     teachers in overcrowded schools agreed that overcrowding \n     negatively affected both classroom activities and \n     instructional techniques. (Rivera-Batiz and Marti, 1995)\n       Corcoran et al. (1988) found that overcrowding and heavy \n     teacher workloads created stressful working conditions for \n     teachers and led to higher teacher absenteeism.\n       Crowded classroom conditions not only make it difficult for \n     students to concentrate on their lessons, but inevitably \n     limit the amount of time teachers can spend on innovative \n     teaching methods such as cooperative learning and group work \n     or, indeed on teaching anything beyond the barest minimum of \n     required material. In addition, because teachers must \n     constantly struggle simply to maintain order in an \n     overcrowded classroom, the likelihood increases that they \n     will suffer from burnout earlier than might otherwise be the \n     case.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                              Case Studies\n\n\n                     broward county/ft. lauderdale\n\n                              The problem\n\n       Broward County is located in Southern Florida and is the \n     fifth largest school district in the nation. Its schools \n     suffer from severe overcrowding: 34,000 students without \n     permanent desks; approximately 10,000 new students added to \n     the school system each year; and in the past nine years, \n     Broward has built 36 new schools and rebuilt 23 schools, and \n     continues to have a difficult time meeting its demand.\n       Broward would have to build a new school every month to \n     meet this demand adequately. Citing the approximately 2,000 \n     portable classrooms in the county, the budget director for \n     the county public schools described Broward as ``the portable \n     capital of the world.'' One high school has 46 portable \n     classrooms in use during this school year alone.\n\n                     Needs and available resources\n\n       A recent needs analysis estimated Broward's capital \n     construction needs at $2.4 billion, $200 million of which is \n     needed for technology improvements alone. The last bond \n     approved for school construction was for $317 million in \n     1987. Mobilizing local support for new tax or bond referenda \n     has been difficult. In fact, in September, 1995, a tax \n     referendum to increase the sales tax by one penny to raise $1 \n     billion for school construction was defeated.\n\n  Potential impact of the Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act\n\n       Under the President's legislative proposal, approximately \n     $16.4 million would be allocated to the county school \n     district. Broward could use these funds to subsidize interest \n     costs for a local bond to cover a substantial part of its \n     school construction costs. This funding could support nearly \n     $70 million in leveraged funds to assist in rebuilding a \n     number of local schools.\n       These new funds would be used primarily to ease \n     overcrowding in schools by funding new schools as well as \n     renovations and additions to existing schools that would \n     expand seating capacity. Broward also wants to reduce its \n     reliance on portable classrooms due to the fact that--with a \n     life expectancy of approximately 20 years--portables are not \n     a good long-term investment compared to a traditional school \n     structure. In addition, portables cannot be wired for \n     technology the same way as a traditional classroom.\n\n\n                  LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n                      I. The problem/current needs\n\n       The Los Angeles Unified School District is one of the \n     largest institutions of any kind in the nation with an \n     enrollment of 670,000 students. The prevalence of aging \n     school facilities in Los Angeles poses a number of expensive \n     problems for the district, which estimates its current \n     deferred maintenance costs at more than $600 million. A \n     majority of Los Angeles school buildings are more than 40 \n     years old. As a result, most schools are not wired for \n     technology, and most are not equipped with modern security \n     systems, telecommunications systems, or air conditioning. \n     Many facilities face similar repair needs--roof replacement \n     is needed for 245 schools, repainting at more than 600 \n     schools, boiler replacement at more than 50 schools, and \n     playground re-pavement at almost 400 schools.\n       A rebounding economy and an influx of immigrants is driving \n     steady growth in the Los Angeles schools. The number of \n     students grew by 18,000 this year, and school officials \n     predict enrollment will grow another 15,000 next year.\n       A State of California mandate to lower class size in the \n     earliest grades consumed the limited number of vacant \n     classrooms that existed. The need for more classrooms is \n     illustrated by the fact that the district transports about \n     12,000 students a day to more distant schools because of \n     overcrowding in their area school.\n\n[[Page S2424]]\n\n                  II. Needs versus available resources\n\n       The State of California school construction program uses \n     two mechanisms to provide funds to local districts for new \n     construction and modernization. In the more common approach, \n     the state pays one-half of the ``allowable'' costs as defined \n     by the state. Otherwise, the state pays the full bill, but in \n     a very limited number of projects. Additionally, the state \n     offers a small deferred maintenance program in which it \n     provides matching funds of up to one-half of 1 percent of the \n     district's general funds. In recent years, the Los Angeles \n     district has been eligible for about $17 million through this \n     program, but the state has not fully funded it in recent \n     budgets.\n       District officials in Los Angeles report that a significant \n     impediment to raising funds for construction is the \n     requirement imposed by the state Constitution, which requires \n     a two-third majority vote for the passage of school bonds \n     financed by property tax increases. The last time the Los \n     Angeles Unified School District passed a bond measure was \n     1971. (This vote came shortly after the Sylmar earthquake \n     closed many schools and raised serious safety questions about \n     others. The measure received 66.5 percent of the vote, but \n     under state law, this bond required only a majority vote \n     because it pertained to buildings deemed structurally \n     unsafe.)\n\n             III. The impact of the President's initiative\n\n       A $2.4 billion school bond measure on the ballot in \n     November 1996 for school construction and modernization \n     received 65.5 percent of the vote, just missing the two-\n     thirds majority needed for passage. In December 1996, the \n     board of Education voted to put another $2.4 billion bond \n     measure on the ballot in April 1997. The President's \n     initiative could accelerate the development of the long \n     overdue projects that would be financed by this bond.\n\n\n                           THE STATE OF MAINE\n\n                      1. The problem/current needs\n\n       Maine is struggling to cope with two major factors related \n     to school facilities--booming economy driving explosive \n     growth in the southern part of the state, and the continued \n     use of one-room schools and other antiquated buildings--some \n     dating 100 years--throughout the state.\n       The Bowdoin Community School offers an instructive example. \n     The dozen portable classrooms now in use exceed the number of \n     permanent classrooms inside the main structure. A proposed \n     expansion of the school has been shelved since 1987 because \n     of insufficient state funding to support the project.\n\n                  II. Needs versus available resources\n\n       Support from the state of Maine for local school \n     construction projects is restricted to debt service \n     subsidies, and the level of available support is extremely \n     limited. In fiscal 1998, school districts requested such \n     subsidies for 83 projects. However, the $65.8 million \n     authorized by the state is expected to be consumed by the \n     four projects given the highest priority.\n       Schools districts in Maine are generally successful in \n     getting voter approval for bond measures, but most districts \n     in the state cannot cover the total cost of the bond. The \n     lack of support from the state for debt service is cited as \n     the leading reason why school districts fall short in raising \n     financing, leading to the deferment of these sorely needed \n     projects.\n\n        III. The potential impact of the Presidential Initiative\n\n       The executive director of the Maine Municipal Bond Bank \n     noted that the President's school construction initiative \n     could help Maine schools in two ways. The state could choose \n     to use its allocation all at once to supplement its debt \n     service subsidy program, or it could use that money to \n     establish a revolving loan fund that would commit its \n     revenues to debt service subsidies.\n\n\n                         the state of maryland\n\n                      I. The problem/current needs\n\n       There are two primary problems facing Maryland school \n     facilities: aging structures and rising enrollments.\n       A review of the list of Capital Improvement requests to the \n     state for the coming year reveals the extent of aging school \n     facilities. Requests are filled with descriptions of items in \n     need of repair or replacement, such as roofs as much as 44 \n     years old, HVAC systems that are 25 years old or more, \n     boilers and chillers that date to the 1950s, and windows and \n     doors in use since the 1960s.\n       Over the last decade, enrollment in Maryland schools has \n     grown by approximately 150,000 students. State officials \n     expect enrollment to continue climbing by another 30,000 or \n     so annually over the next five to ten years. Overall, local \n     districts requested approximately $310 million for 459 \n     construction and renovation projects for FY 1998. While a \n     district might request more than one project for a school, \n     these figures suggest that districts are seeking assistance \n     with construction and renovation projects that could affect a \n     third of the state's 1,280 schools.\n\n                  II. Needs versus available resources\n\n       The Maryland State Public School Construction Program is \n     designed to help local districts with costs related to \n     planning and funding of school construction and renovation \n     projects.\n       Early in the program, the state covered 100 percent of \n     eligible costs for approved projects. However, since the mid-\n     1980s, the state use a sliding scale based on need to \n     determine how much assistance a district receives.\n       Since the program's inception,the amount of funds requested \n     each year by local districts has exceeded program \n     allocations. For example, in FY 73, the program funded 72 \n     percent of district requests--the highest proportion in the \n     program's history. In FY 89, the state supported an all-time \n     low of 24 percent of requests. In the current fiscal year, \n     the state funded 51 percent of requests, totaling $274 \n     million.\n\n        III. The potential impact of the Presidential initiative\n\n       State officials see three possibilities for the use of \n     federal funds from the proposed School Construction \n     Initiative.\n       First, the funds could subsidize additional state general \n     obligation bonds. Therefore, the amount of assistance going \n     to local districts with eligible costs would increase, and \n     more projects would be funded. The federal funds could be \n     targeted at poorer districts with larger projects that have \n     been delayed due to fiscal constraints. It should be noted \n     that an increase in the state funds for the Public School \n     Construction Program might lead more districts to seek state \n     assistance for additional projects. At this time, there are \n     projects for which local districts do not submit requests \n     because the district senses these projects will be deferred \n     due to state fiscal constraints.\n       A second option would allow the state to use a portion of \n     the funds to subsidize a combination of additional state \n     bonds and country general obligation bonds. Finally, the \n     state could use all the federal funds to subsidize additional \n     county general obligation bonds.\n\n\n                     new york city school district\n\n                      I. The problem/current needs\n\n       New York is experiencing enrollment growth of 20,000 to \n     23,000 students a year. In addition, more than half of the \n     over 1,000 school buildings are 50 years old or more. The \n     district must upgrade these facilities and accommodate its \n     burgeoning student population.\n       There are limits to the amount of money the district can \n     raise through general obligation bonds, and this mechanism is \n     not sufficient to meet the district's needs. There is a state \n     constitutional limit on the amount of debt the district can \n     issue (as a percentage of total assessed property value), and \n     the district is running up against this limit.\n       The fiscal year 1997 capital expenditures budget for the \n     Board of Education is just over $1 billion, out of a total \n     city capital budget of just over $4 billion. A proposed 10-\n     year capital plan has just been put forth for $12.6 billion, \n     which includes an amount contingent on receipt of federal \n     funds. One of the main emphasis of this plan is to address \n     the district's overcrowding, using strategies such as new \n     construction, other ways of handling seating capacity, and \n     converting some schools to a year-round schedule, which could \n     increase seating capacity by 25 to 33 percent.\n\n        II. The potential impact of the Presidential initiative\n\n       New York expects that it could leverage federal funds to \n     address several needs. Among the most dire needs is for \n     additional seats for children. The districts proposed 10-year \n     plan was increased by about $700 million to address seating \n     capacity needs. The district envisions six different avenues \n     for the use of this money to increase seating capacity: \n     Leasing new facilities, transportables, modular construction, \n     rehabilitation of existing facilities to increase size, new \n     construction, and converting schools to a year-round schedule \n     (which necessitates putting in air-conditioning.)\n\n\n                      Philadelphia School District\n\n                       The problem/current needs\n\n       The Philadelphia story has two strands. First, the district \n     estimates that it will need about two-thirds of a billion \n     dollars to bring its 257 existing building sites up to \n     standard. This includes major renovations, repairs, \n     improvements, and technology needs (schools need to be wired \n     for computers, but 60 of Philadelphia's schools are over 70 \n     years old.)\n       Second, to accommodate expected population growth, \n     approximately one-quarter of a billion dollars in additional \n     funding may be necessary. In the past five years, the public \n     school population has grown 9.2 percent, and in the past \n     seven years it has grown 12.6 percent. The district expects \n     this growth to continue by 1.4 percent the next year and by \n     2.5 percent the following year. In one area, the district \n     deals with overcrowding through a combination of classrooms \n     under stairwells, walling off the ends of hallways to create \n     classrooms, and portables.\n\n                 II. Needs versus available resources.\n\n       The district knows that its capital needs in the next 5 to \n     10 years seriously exceed its current budgeted capital \n     capacity. A Long Range Facilities Plan is being developed, \n     and it is expected that the total need will ultimately be \n     between $1-$1.4 billion.\n\n        III. The potential impact of the Presidential Initiative\n\n       The district says that federal funds could be extremely \n     helpful by supporting preventive maintenance projects. With \n     shrinking operation budgets, it is preventive maintenance \n     that gets cut from the budget. These projects include minor \n     roof and gutter repair, HVAC system cleaning, and yearly \n     boiler maintenance. These activities get pushed aside for \n     emergency projects and educational needs. Yet today's \n     preventive maintenance\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\n     project is tomorrow's capital project. Roofs, boilers, and \n     heating systems wear out years before their time because \n     preventive maintenance funds are scarce. The failure of these \n     systems also causes additional capital damage, such as water \n     and pipe damage. Much of this could be avoided and long-term \n     capital budget could be brought down with additional \n     resources for preventive maintenance.\n\n\n                   Santa Ana Unified School District\n\n                      I. The problem/current needs\n\n       Santa Ana is an extremely densely populated area. In its 24 \n     square miles, there are 350,000 resident, and 52,000 \n     students. There is a school approximately every two blocks.\n       The primary problem in the district is school overcrowding, \n     the result of a lack of construction funding during a period \n     of raid enrollment growth. The district has grown from 31 \n     thousand student in 1980 to 52,000 students in 1996.\n       The school district has converted 22 of 31 elementary \n     schools and four of seven intermediate schools to multi-\n     track, year-round schedules. Although other school districts \n     in California and around the country use year-round \n     schooling, it is unusual to have such a high percentage of \n     schools on this tract. The district has 534 portable \n     classrooms on existing sites, which is the equivalent of 24 \n     free standing elementary schools. Santa Ana estimates that it \n     now spends $1 million to lease portable classrooms.\n       A secondary, but also severe problem is maintaining ill-\n     equipped and deteriorating facilities. The district prepared \n     a state-mandated five-year plan to deferred maintenance \n     needs, which is updated annually--the currently version \n     projects a $15 million need.\n\n                  II. Needs versus available resources\n\n       Santa Ana Unified has a need for three elementary schools \n     plus a new high school. Enrollment growth has averaged over \n     1300 students annually since 1980. The need is accentuated by \n     the fact that the State School Building Program is, ``broke'' \n     and it is not clear when there will be another bond measure.\n\n        III. The potential impact of the President's initiative\n\n       President Clinton's initiative would potentially provide \n     major benefits to the Santa Ana Community. The district needs \n     adequate classrooms equipped with up-to-date education \n     technology will be available to educate the rapidly growing \n     student population. If the district received an estimated six \n     million dollars from the federal government, it could \n     leverage those funds to pay for additional elementary \n     schools.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I would also like to call to my colleagues' \nattention the reports and the work done by the General Accounting \nOffice recently, both with regard to the condition of America's \nschools, State efforts to address the issue of crumbling schools, and \nthe most recent GAO report on school finance generally. These reports \nspeak to the ability or the efforts taken by State and local \ngovernments to address the disparities between wealthy and poor and \nmiddle-class school districts.\n  The fact of the matter is that this disparity, this gap in school \nfunding, does not serve our national interest, does not serve the \ninterest of taxpayers, and does not serve the interest of our children.\n  I believe we have an obligation to put aside the old debates of \nwhether or not school funding should happen here or happen there, and \nwe should look at developing a partnership in which everybody plays a \npart, in which all levels of government collaborate, in which \ncommunities, parents, property taxpayers, and income taxpayers \ncooperate to prepare our people for the 21st century and the challenges \nthey face.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I give my strong support to President \nClinton's Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act of 1997, \nintroduced today by Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  The Nation's schools are facing enormous problems of physical decay. \nFourteen million children in one-third of the schools are learning in \nsubstandard school buildings. Half the schools have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental condition.\n  Massachusetts is no exception. Forty-one percent of Massachusetts \nschools report that at least one building needs extensive repair or \nshould be replaced; 75 percent report serious problems in buildings, \nsuch as plumbing or heating defects; 80 percent have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental factor.\n  It is difficult to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms. Student \nenrollments are at an alltime high and are continuing to rise. We \ncannot tolerate a situation in which facilities deteriorate while \nenrollments escalate.\n  GAO estimates that schools need $112 billion just to repair their \nfacilities. Obviously, the Federal Government cannot meet all of these \nneeds. The Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act encourages \nState, local, and private support by providing interest subsidies for \nschool construction bonds. The Federal Government will pay up to 50 \npercent of interest on bonds used to finance school repair, renovation, \nmodernization, and construction.\n  Half of the $5 billion in Federal funds earmarked for this program \nover the next four years will be allocated to States using the existing \ntitle I formula. States and localities will distribute these funds to \ncommunities with the greatest construction needs and the least ability \nto meet their needs with their own resources. Massachusetts would \nreceive $48 million for grants to local communities.\n  The remaining Federal funds will be distributed by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education among the 100 school districts that enroll the \ngreatest number of students living in poverty. Thirty percent of this \nfunding will be allocated competitively to school districts that have \nparticularly severe needs and obtain the most support for their \nconstruction projects from non-Federal sources. Under this part of the \nbill, Massachusetts would receive an estimated $25 million.\n  I hope that the Partnership To Rebuild America's Schools Act will \nreceive the bipartisan support it deserves, so that it can be in place \nfor the beginning of the next academic year. Investing in education is \ninvesting in a stronger America here at home and around the world. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto enact this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 457. A bill to amend section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961 to provide alternative certification procedures for assistance for \nmajor drug producing countries and major drug transit countries; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n               THE MEXICO PROBATIONARY CERTIFICATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this month Congress has been considering \nthe important issue of whether to uphold or overturn the President's \ncertification of Mexico as fully cooperating with the United States to \nfight drug trafficking. I am concerned that without congressional \naction, the Senate must choose between two less than ideal options: \nFirst, to support the President's certification of Mexico and continue \nbusiness as usual, thereby downplaying serious deficiencies in Mexico's \nefforts; or second, to decertify Mexico, with or without a waiver, \nwhich might destabilize an important country along our southern border.\n  Under current law, notice provided to the target country is often too \nlate and not specific enough to fix the problems. Moreover, access to \nmore timely and specific information would assist Congress in \nexercising its legislative and oversight responsibilities.\n  Therefore, today I propose a bill to provide an alternative approach. \nThis legislation would provide the administration a new option to \ncertify countries such as Mexico on probationary status for 7 months, \nwhich extends from March 1 through September 30, the end of the fiscal \nyear. However, during this time period, the country on probationary \ncertification is expected to comply with certain conditions stipulated \nby the President. If these conditions are not met at the end of this 7-\nmonth period, the United States will act firmly, such as by cutting off \naid.\n  This alternative would put countries on notice that the United States \nhas serious concerns about their lack of cooperation. But, it would \nprovide a fair period of time during which those countries could \naddress U.S. concerns.\n  This constructive notice period would be less disruptive to our \nbilateral relations. We saw last week some of the damage which could \noccur in our relationship with Mexico after the House voted to \ndecertify Mexico within 90 days if certain criteria are not met. News \nreports quoted Mexico's President, Ernesto Zedillo, as stating: ``This \nis where we draw the line. Our sovereignty and dignity as a nation are \nnot negotiable.''\n  My bill also provides better notice to Congress. Under this \nalternative, Congress would be informed about those specific concerns \nwhich the President identified regarding a country's lack of \ncooperation. Congress also would be\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\nable to track that country's progress during the 7-month probationary \nperiod and, of course, maintain its prerogative to pass legislation as \nit deems necessary. I believe this would help avoid the contentious \nbattle in which the Congress and the administration currently are \nengaged this month over Mexico.\n  It is no surprise that many Senators feel strongly about decertifying \nMexico. Reports indicate that as much as 70 percent of the cocaine \nentering the United States comes through Mexico; up to 30 percent of \nthe heroin used in the United States comes through Mexico; and 80 \npercent of imported marijuana comes through Mexico.\n\n  Recent developments in that country have exacerbated what is already \na serious flow of illegal drugs into the United States. For example, \naccording to a news report in the March 2 San Diego Union Tribune, \nMexican authorities are now preventing our DEA agents and law \nenforcement officers from carrying their weapons into Mexico. In \nresponse, the DEA reportedly pulled its agents out of cross-training \nand intelligence-gathering projects in Mexico along the border. Agents \nand officers now fear they will become targets for gangs and drug \ntraffickers, especially if Mexico's certification is revoked. This is \nintolerable.\n  Further motivating the push to decertify Mexico is the recent arrest \nof Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, on allegations he \nwas being paid to protect one of Mexico's top drug lords. The general \nis reported to have extensive drug ties, dating back to at least 1993, \nat the same time he was supposed to be fighting drug use and trade in \nhis country.\n  Any information that the general may have possessed has been \ncompromised. Nor is he alone in being corrupt. According to a Los \nAngeles Times report on March 3, court documents from two drug gang \nassassins indicate that approximately 90 percent of the law enforcement \nofficers in Tijuana and the State of Baja California in Mexico are \ncorrupt.\n  These developments raise serious concerns among DEA agents, who \ncannot adequately do their job if they do not receive the help of their \nMexican counterparts. During his testimony before the House \nSubcommittee on National Security on February 27, 1997, Thomas \nConstantine, the Administrator of the DEA, called fighting drug \ntrafficking without assistance from other countries nearly impossible.\n  In light of these disturbing developments, I wrote to the President \nlast Friday expressing my concern with his certification of Mexico. I \nalso urged the administration to take all necessary steps to ensure \nMexico does its fair share in controlling the flow of illicit drugs \nacross its border into the United States.\n  Decertifying Mexico will not make this process any easier. Yet, we \ncannot risk the implication that we condone Mexico's failed drug policy \nby fully certifying Mexico without certain conditions. Certification of \nMexico in light of the compelling facts of that country's involvement \nin drug trafficking also makes a mockery of the certification \nprovisions of the Foreign Assistance Act.\n  In light of these facts, I am concerned that the President has \ncertified Mexico as fully cooperating with the United States. However, \nI am also concerned that decertifying Mexico could destabilize a \ncountry important to us and cause a potential crisis on our southern \nborder. Unfortunately, that is the choice the administration has under \nexisting law.\n  Therefore, the bill I introduce today would amend the existing law to \navoid this type of problem in the future. The current certification \nprocess is set forth in section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961. It requires the President to submit to Congress by March 1 of \neach year a list of major illicit drug producing and transiting \ncountries which he certifies are fully cooperating with the United \nStates. This bill offers a good middleground--I urge support.\n  Under existing law, the President has three options: One, certify a \ncountry which has cooperated fully with U.S. anti-drug efforts or has \ntaken adequate steps on its own to comply with the 1988 U.N. anti- drug \ntrafficking convention. Two, decertify a country for not fully \ncooperating. Or three, decertify a country but provide a waiver because \nit is in the national interests of the United States to continue to \nprovide aid.\n\n  Under this law, when a country is decertified, at least 50 percent of \nU.S. bilateral foreign aid is suspended in the current fiscal year. In \nfact, that county may lose more than 50 percent of its current funding \nif the State Department has not yet released the aid. Unless the \ncountry is recertified, all U.S. aid is suspended in subsequent fiscal \nyears. And, the United States is required to vote against loans in the \nmultilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank.\n  Congress has 30 days from receipt of the President's certification to \nenact a joint resolution disapproving the President's action. If \nCongress passes such a resolution, the President can veto it and \nrequire a two-thirds majority vote in Congress to override the veto.\n  Congress also has its prerogative to pass a resolution with other \ntimeframes, which would be subject to a Presidential veto. We saw this \nlast week when the House passed a resolution to decertify Mexico within \n90 days if certain criteria are not met.\n  On February 28, 1997, the President submitted his annual list to \nCongress. This report indicated that 23 countries, including Mexico, \nare certified as fully cooperating; three countries were determined not \nto be fully cooperating, but were deemed in the national interest--\nBelize, Lebanon, and Pakistan--and six countries were decertified \n(Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, Iran, Nigeria, and Syria.\n  The impact of this process on Mexico could be dramatic. If Congress \nwere to pass a resolution of disapproval within the 30-day review \nperiod and the President does not exercise his waiver authority, the \nimpact would include: Suspension of at least 50 percent of United \nStates assistance for the current fiscal year; total suspension of aid \nin the next fiscal year, unless Mexico were recertified; and the United \nState would vote against loans to Mexico in the multilateral \ndevelopment banks. Mexico receives $17 million in bilateral aid from \nthe United States and, according to the Export-Import Bank, 56 \napplications from Mexico could be affected which total $3.24 billion.\n  The alternative that I am proposing today provides a middle ground \nbecause it revisits the certification issue more often during the \ncourse of the year. The President also is given more flexibility in \nlabelling countries more accurately.\n  I'm also concerned that under existing law, we are giving a free ride \nto countries which are decertified but then are granted a waiver and \ncontinue to receive aid because it is deemed in the national interest \nof the United States. These waivers, in essence, allow the provision of \naid year after year to countries not fully cooperating with the United \nStates. What incentive do these countries have to improve their \ncooperation?\n  My legislation builds on the existing carrot and stick approach in \nthe certification process. This type of approach has been successful \nwith other problems in the past, and I think it would go a long way to \navoid similar controversies in the future like the one we have seen \nsurrounding the Mexico certification this month.\n  Under my bill, the carrot is certification, although for a finite \nperiod of time of 7 months. During this probationary period, all U.S. \naid continues to flow and the United States remains supportive in \ninternational development banks. The President also stipulates which \nspecific conditions must be met by that country to improve its \ncooperation with the United States and to continue receiving U.S. aid. \nNot only is sufficient notice provided to the country, but to the \nCongress as well.\n  The stick is a penalty similar to that under existing law. If after 7 \nmonths the country does not comply with the stipulations made by the \nPresident to improve its cooperation with the United States, 100 \npercent of U.S. bilateral aid is cut off. The United States also would \nvote against aid in the multilateral development banks if the country \ndoes not comply with U.S. stipulations, as provided for under current \nlaw. These penalties would remain in effect until the President \nnotifies Congress that the country has complied with the stipulations \nmade in the President's original probationary certification.\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\n  In my opinion, this alternative approach would force fuller \ncompliance by countries and, in future cases similar to Mexico, help \navoid a potential crisis in those countries.\n  We need to send a very strong message to our neighbors in Mexico and \nsimilarly situated countries when we do not believe that they are fully \ncooperating with United States efforts to combat drug trafficking. But, \nto risk a crisis along our own border is asking for greater trouble.\n  I believe that a compromise solution, as outlined in my proposal, is \nthe most reasonable way to address similar circumstances in the future, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 457\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for State housing occupancy standards, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                       THE HOUSING PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill \nto protect housing. This bill will ensure that all residents have a \npeaceful, well-maintained, and managed community with the services they \ndeserve.\n  The Housing Protection Act prohibits the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development [HUD] from establishing a national occupancy standard \nand transfers the authority to set those standards to the States. In \nthe absence of a State standard, a two-person-per-bedroom standard \nwould be presumed reasonable.\n  In 1995, Senator Kyl and I introduced this same piece of legislation, \nafter HUD's General Counsel Nelson Diaz issued a memorandum which, in \neffect, attempted to supplant the reasonable two-person-per-bedroom \nstandard with conditions which could have forced housing owners to \naccept six, seven, even eight people in a two-bedroom apartment. The \nHouse of Representatives passed it as part of its public housing reform \nbill, but the bill failed to pass out of conference last year.\n  Too often apartments are crowded with excessive numbers of people. \nWhen this happens, apartment complexes experience excessive noise, \nlower levels of safety and most often deterioration of the units. \nBuilding codes are in place for a reason. They are designed to \ndetermine the maximum amount of people who may safely exit a building \nduring a fire or other emergency. Occupancy standards, on-the-other-\nhand, determine how many residents can be accommodated and for whom \nthey can properly provide services on the premises.\n  The purpose of occupancy standards is to provide decent, safe, \ncomfortable housing and a peaceful living environment for all \nresidents. They also help maintain properties in excellent condition. \nWhile housing providers set their own occupancy standards, such private \nstandards are in effect limited by state-set laws or policies which \nestablish the minimum occupancy levels at which housing providers \nachieve safe harbor from charges of familial discrimination.\n  This bill is widely supported by housing industry associations such \nas the National Association of Homebuilders and the National Apartment \nAssociation, among others. Many of our colleagues have joined us in \nsupport of this bill, and I urge others to consider cosponsoring it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the State Housing \nProtection Act. I thank Senator Faircloth for his leadership on this \nissue and joining in sponsoring this bill. This bill prohibits the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] from enforcing a \ncomplaint of discrimination on the basis of a housing provider's \noccupancy standard, and thereby, transfers from HUD to the States the \nauthority to set occupancy standards.\n  Mr. President, in July 1995, HUD General Counsel Diaz issued a \nmemorandum which, in effect, tried to supplant the traditional two-per-\nbedroom occupancy standard, and could have forced housing owners to \naccept six, seven, eight, or even nine people in a two-bedroom \napartment. HUD should not be establishing national occupancy standards.\n  In 1995, Senator Faircloth and I blocked HUD from imposing national \noccupancy standards until it completed an official rule. Soon \nthereafter, along with Representative McCollum, we introduced our bill \nto permanently transfer authority back to the States. The House passed \nit as part of its public housing reform bill, but it died in the \nconference committee late last year.\n  By pursuing a policy that encourages overcrowding, thereby \ndepreciating housing stock that is scarce to begin with, HUD is poorly \nserving lower income families and defeating its own charter. Our bill \nwill help correct the problem. It is supported by the Council for \nAffordable and Rural Housing, the Council of Larger Public Housing \nAuthorities, the Multi Housing Institute, the National Apartment \nAssociation, the National Assisted Housing Management Association, the \nNational Association of Home Builders, the National Association of \nHousing and Redevelopment Officials, the National Leased Housing \nAssociation, the National Multi Housing Council, and the Public Housing \nAuthorities Directors Association.\n  Several States have an occupancy standard; the one in my own home \nState of Arizona has worked well. The intrusion of a Federal \nbureaucracy often does more harm than good. That is why Senator \nFaircloth and I have reintroduced this bill. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us and cosponsor it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\n       By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Murkowski, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 459. A bill to amend the Native American Programs Act of 1974 to \nextend certain authorizations, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Indian Affairs.\n\n\n  THE NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS ACT OF 1974 REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nextend the authorization for certain programs under the Native American \nPrograms Act of 1974. This bill is critical to continue the \navailability of a modest amount of grant funds used by native \ncommunities nationwide to foster economic growth, develop tools for \ngood governance methods, and promote social welfare.\n  The authorization for most of these programs has expired and though \nthe administration has requested funding for fiscal year 1998 at fiscal \nyear 1997 levels, it has not introduced legislation to reauthorize the \nact. The legislation I am introducing today would do just that.\n  These programs are administered through the Administration for Native \nAmericans [ANA] located within the Department of Health and Human \nServices. By awarding annual grants on a competitive basis, the Native \nAmerican Programs Act promotes self-sufficiency and self-determination \nby encouraging tribes, villages, and other native communities to \ndevelop and plan local strategies in economic and social development. \nThe program is designed to build greater capacity at the tribal level \nfor better governance, more vibrant and diversified economies, and \nsocial development.\n  The ANA Program has proven successful for native communities since \nits inception and has generated widespread support by America's native \ncommunities. The centerpiece of the program are grants made under the \nSocial and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) Program; grants to \ntribes enhance tribal environmental regulatory capabilities; and grants \nmade to preserve and rehabilitate native languages.\n  This legislation will simply extend for 4 years until fiscal year \n2000 the authorization for these modestly funded yet very successful \nprograms to strengthen and rebuild tribal communities around the United \nStates.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in enacting this reauthorization \nso that these proven tools for development can again be made available \nto native peoples around the Nation. I ask unanimous consent that a \nsection-by-section summary and the bill language be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             BILL LANGUAGE\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF CERTAIN APPROPRIATIONS UNDER THE \n                   NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS ACT OF 1974.\n\n       Section 816.--Section 816 of the Native American Programs \n     Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 2992d) is amended--\n\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``for fiscal years 1992, \n     1993, 1994, and 1995.'' and inserting ``for each of fiscal \n     years 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000'';\n       (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``for each of the fiscal \n     years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996,'' and inserting ``for \n     each of fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000,''; and\n       (3) in subsection (e), by striking ``$2,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 1993 and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years \n     1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997.'' and inserting ``such sums as \n     may be necessary for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, and \n     2000.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       The purpose of this bill is to amend the 1974 Native \n     American Programs Act, P.L. 93-644 (42 U.S.C. 2991 et seq.) \n     to extend to fiscal year 2000 the authorization of \n     appropriations for three grant programs administered by the \n     Administration for Native Americans (ANA) in the Department \n     of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n       Section 1. Authorization of Certain Appropriations Under \n     the Native American Programs Act of 1974.\n  Section 816.--\n\n       (a) this subsection provides for a four year extension to \n     fiscal year 2000 of the present authority to appropriate such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out the general grant \n     provisions of the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2992d). The bill would continue the current ``such \n     sums as may be necessary'' language contained in current law.\n       (c) this subsection provides for a four year extension to \n     fiscal year 2000 of the present authority to appropriate \n     funds for the purpose of carrying out the provisions related \n     to grants for tribal regulation of environmental quality (42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2991b(d). The bill would continue the current \n     authorized level of $8 million for such grants.\n       (e) this subsection provides for a four year extension to \n     fiscal year 2000 of the present authority to appropriate such \n     sums as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying out the \n     provisions related to grants for the preservation of Native \n     languages (42 U.S.C. Sec. 2991b-3). The bill would strike the \n     current authorized appropriaitons level of $2 million for \n     Native language grants and instead would substitute ``such \n     sums as may be necessary''.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators Campbell, McCain, and Murkowski in sponsoring this act to \nextend the authorization of several important programs for American \nIndians. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] \nadministers these programs through the Administration for Native \nAmericans [ANA]. Over the past 5 years, funding has ranged from $34.5 \nmillion to $38.6 million. In fiscal year 1997, the funding was $34.9 \nmillion.\n  Our bill will reauthorize important programs to promote economic \ndevelopment, strengthen tribal governments, and provide for the better \ncoordination of social programs available to tribes. The ANA funding \npolicy is to assist Indian Tribes and Native American organizations to \nplan and implement their own long-term strategies for social and \neconomic development. The aim is to increase local productivity and \nreduce dependence on government social services.\n  Competitive grants are the means for distributing these vital funds. \nIn New Mexico, the Pueblos of Laguna ($382,000), Picuris ($167,000), \nPojoaque ($120,000), Sandia ($133,890), Tesuque ($125,000), San Juan \n($232,000), Santa Ana ($112,000), and Santo Domingo ($110,464) all \nreceived grants from fiscal year 1996 funds. New Mexico Tribes and \nPueblos have participated in ANA grant activity for about three \ndecades.\n  The Social and Economic Development Strategies [SEDS] program fosters \nthe development of stable, diversified local economies. SEDS grant \nfunds are used to develop the physical, commercial, industrial and/or \nagricultural components necessary for a functioning local economy. \nSocial infrastructure includes the maintenance of a tribe's cultural \nintegrity. Pojoaque Pueblo's Cultural Center is the beneficiary of an \nANA grant.\n  Other ANA grants are used to establish or expand business activity or \nto stabilize and diversify a tribe's economic base. Micro enterprises \nand other private sector development are encouraged.\n  Mr. President, I thank Chairman Campbell of the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs for his good work to extend the authorization for these \nvaluable resources to improve tribal opportunities for self-\nsufficiency. I urge my colleagues to support the reauthorization of \nthese Administration for Native Americans Programs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor a measure to \nreauthorize the Native American Programs Act of 1974. The purpose of \nthis bill is to amend the Native American Programs Act to extend the \nauthorization of appropriations for programs administered by the \nadministration for Native Americans within the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to fiscal year 2000.\n  In 1974, the Native American Programs Act was enacted by the Congress \nto assist tribes and other Native American entities with developing \nsocial, economic, and governance strategies in order to become viable \nand economically self-sufficient communities.\n  In the decades since its enactment, hundreds of tribes, reservation \ncommunities, and native organizations have benefited from the programs \nfunded under this act. In fiscal year 1994 alone, the administration \nfor Native Americans provided 215 grants for governance, social, and \neconomic development projects, several dozen grants to assist with \ntribal recognition efforts, 26 grants for projects to assist tribes in \ntheir capacity to meet environmental requirements, 18 grants to support \nprojects assisting the survival and preservation of Native American \nlanguages, and funds to support the Native Hawaiian revolving loan \nfund.\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\nThese projects have served to improve the quality of living for \nthousands of Native American families and communities.\n  Over 2 years ago, on March 7, 1995, Senators McCain, Campbell and I \nintroduced S. 510, a bill which reauthorized programs under the Native \nAmerican Programs Act. On May 11, 1996 this body passed S. 510, as \namended in committee, by unanimous consent, but the bill was \nsubsequently not acted upon by the House prior to the adjournment of \nthe 104th Congress.\n  The bill being introduced today is substantially similar to S. 510, \nas introduced in the last Congress. I am pleased that once again, the \nchairman, as his predecessor did, is willing to consider the inclusion \nof provisions that would reauthorize for a period of 1 year, the Native \nHawaiian revolving loan fund.\n  Mr. President, the programs authorized in this measure are critical \nto fostering Native American social and economic self-sufficiency--a \ngoal shared by this Congress as we move toward greater fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to act favorably and expeditiously on this \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Mack, Ms. Mikulski and Mr. Grams):\n  S. 460. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe deduction for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals, \nto provide clarification for the deductibility of expenses incurred by \na taxpayer in connection with the business use of the home, to clarify \nthe standards used for determining that certain individuals are not \nemployees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE HOME-BASED BUSINESS FAIRNESS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, home-based businesses are a significant and \noften overlooked part of this country's economy. Some people may be \nsurprised to learn that over 9 million men and women in this country \nnow operate home-based businesses, and over 14 million individuals earn \nincome through home-based businesses. Even more impressive is the fact \nthat a majority of these enterprises are owned by women, and the Small \nBusiness Administration estimates that women in this country are \nstarting over 300,000 new home-based businesses each year.\n\n  There are a number of reasons for the explosive growth of home-based \nbusinesses. Recent innovations in computer and communication technology \nhave made the virtual office a reality and allow many Americans to \ncompete in marketplaces that a few years ago required huge investments \nin equipment and personnel. In addition, many men and women in this \ncountry turn to home-based business in an effort to spend more time \nwith their children. By working at home, these families can bring in \ntwo incomes, while avoiding the added time and expense of day-care and \ncommuting. Corporate down-sizing, too, contributes to the growth in \nthis sector as many skilled individuals convert their knowledge and \nexperience from corporate life into successful enterprises operated \nfrom their homes.\n  The rewards of owning a home-based business are also numerous. The \nadded independence and self-reliance of having your own business \nprovides not only economic rewards but also personal satisfaction. You \nare the boss: you set your own hours, develop your own business plans, \nand choose your customers and clients. In many ways, home-based \nbusinesses provide the greatest avenue for the entrepreneurial spirit, \nwhich has long been the driving force behind the success of this \ncountry.\n  But with these rewards comes a number of obstacles, not the least of \nwhich are regulations and burdens imposed by the Federal Government. In \nfact, the tax laws, and in particular the IRS, are frequently cited as \nthe most significant problems for home-based businesses today. Changes \nin tax policy must be considered by this Congress to ensure that our \nlaws do not stall the growth and development of this successful sector \nof our economy.\n  Mr. President, in answer to this call for help, I am introducing \ntoday the Home-Based Business Fairness Act of 1997. This legislation is \nthe product of extensive input from actual home-based business owners \nand the efforts of my colleagues Senators Olympia Snowe and Don \nNickles. The bill is designed to address three tax issues that \ncurrently pose significant problems for home-based businesses.\n\n\n     deductibility of health-insurance costs for the self-employed\n\n  First, the bill addresses the deductibility of health-insurance costs \nfor the self-employed. During the 104th Congress, we made significant \nprogress in this area. First, we made the deduction permanent after \nyears of uncertainty. Then, last summer, we passed legislation that \nwill increase the deduction for these health-care costs to 80 percent \nincrementally by 2006. While I fully supported that increase, the self-\nemployed cannot wait 10 years for partial deductibility when their \nlarge corporate competitors can fully deduct such costs today.\n  With the self-employed able to deduct only 40 percent of their \nhealth-insurance costs today, it comes as no surprise that nearly a \nquarter of the self-employed, many of whom operate home-based \nbusinesses, do not have health insurance. In fact, 4 million households \nin this country headed by a self-employed individual do not have health \ninsurance.\n  In order to make it easier for home-based business owners and their \nfamilies to have health insurance, we must level this playing field. My \nbill will increase the deductibility of health insurance for the self-\nemployed to 100 percent beginning this year. A full deduction will make \nhealth insurance more affordable to home-based business owners and help \nthem and their families get the health insurance coverage that they \nneed and deserve.\n\n\n                         home-office deduction\n\n  Second, the Home-Based Business Fairness Act will restore the home-\noffice deduction and further level the playing field for home-based \nbusinesses. After the Supreme Court's 1993 Soliman decision, the only \nhome-based businesses that can deduct the costs associated with their \nhome office are those that see their clients in the home and that \ngenerate their income within the home office. That narrow \ninterpretation of the law denies the home-office deduction to service \nproviders like construction contractors, landscaping professionals, and \nsales representatives, who must by necessity perform their services \noutside of the home.\n\n  It is patently unfair to prevent these individuals from deducting \ntheir utility costs, property taxes, and other expenses related to the \nhome office, when they could do so if they rented an office separate \nfrom the home. I thank my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his \nwillingness to allow us to work together on this issue. My bill \nincorporates the legislation that Senator Hatch introduced earlier this \nmonth and will permit a home office to include one where the individual \nperforms his essential administrative and management activities such a \nbilling and record keeping. In order to qualify for the deduction, the \nbill requires that the business owner perform these activities on a \nregular, on-going, and nonincidental basis and have no other office in \nwhich to perform them.\n  The restoration of the home-office deduction for home-based \nbusinesses not only puts them on an equal footing with their larger \ncompetitors, but also frees important capital that can be used to \nexpand the business. For too long home-based businesses have lived with \nthe fear of an IRS audit fueled by the Soliman decision. It is time to \neliminate this obstacle to the continued success of these important \nentrepreneurs.\n\n\n             Clarification of Independent-Contractor Status\n\n  The final element of the Home-Based Business Fairness Act is relief \nfor entrepreneurs seeking to be treated as independent contractors and \nfor businesses needing to hire independent contractors. As the chairman \nof the Small Business Committee, I have heard from countless small \nbusiness owners who are caught in the environment of fear and confusion \nthat now surrounds the classification of workers. This situation is \nstifling the entrepreneurial spirit of many small business owners who \nfind that they do not have the flexibility to conduct their businesses \nin a manner that makes the best economic\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\nsense and that serves their personal and family goals.\n  Mr. President, the root of this problem is found in the IRS' test for \ndetermining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an \nemployee. Over the past three decades, the IRS has relied on a 20-\nfactor test based on the common law to make this determination. On \nfirst blush, a 20-factor test sounds like a reasonable approach: if a \ntaxpayer demonstrates a majority of the factors, he or she is an \nindependent contractor. Not surprisingly, the IRS' test is not that \nsimple. It is a complex set of extremely subjective criteria with no \nclear weight assigned to any of the factors. As a result, a small \nbusiness taxpayer is not able to predict which of the 20 factors will \nbe most important to a particular IRS agent, and finding a certain \nnumber of these factors in any given case does not guarantee the \noutcome.\n  To make matters worse, the IRS' determination inevitably occurs 2 or \n3 years after the parties have determined in good faith that they have \nan independent-contractor relationship. And the consequences can be \ndevastating. The business recipient of the services is forced to \nreclassify the independent contractor as an employee and must pay the \npayroll taxes the IRS says should have been collected in the prior \nyears. Interest and penalties are also added on. The result for many \nsmall businesses is a tax bill that bankrupts the company. And that's \nnot the end of the story. The IRS then goes after the service provider, \nwho is now classified as an employee, and disallows a portion of his \nbusiness expenses--again resulting in additional taxes, interest, and \npenalties.\n  Mr. President, all of us in this body recognize that the IRS is \ncharged with the duty of collecting Federal revenues and enforcing the \ntax laws. The problem in this case is that the IRS is using a procedure \nthat is patently unfair and is doing so on an increasingly frequent \nbasis. Between 1988 and 1994, the IRS' use of the 20-factor test \nresulted in some 11,000 audits, 483,000 worker reclassifications, and \n$751 million in back taxes and penalties. These facts make me wonder \nwhether the IRS is using this test as a de facto source of enhanced \nrevenue collection when the classification decision does not alter the \naggregate tax liability to the Federal Government at all.\n  For its part, the IRS has just released its revised worker \nclassification training manual. In the Commissioner's accompanying \nmemo, she describes the manual as an ``attempt to identify, simplify, \nand clarify the relevant facts that should be evaluated in order to \naccurately determine worker classification. . . .'' There can be no \nmore compelling reason for immediate action on this issue. The revised \nmanual is over 150 pages--even longer than the original draft. If it \ntakes this many pages to teach revenue agents how to simplify and \nclarify this small business tax issue, I think we can be fairly sure \nhow simple and clear it is going to seem to the taxpayer who tries to \nfigure it out on his own.\n\n  The Home-Based Business Fairness Act removes the need for so many \npages of instruction on the 20-factor test by establishing a clear safe \nharbor based on objective criteria. Under these criteria, if there is a \nwritten agreement between the parties, and if an individual \ndemonstrates economic independence and independence with respect to the \nworkplace, he will be treated as an independent contractor rather than \nan employee. And the service recipient will not be treated as an \nemployer. In addition, individuals who perform services through their \nown corporations will also qualify for the safe harbor as long as there \nis a written agreement and the individuals provide for their own \nbenefits.\n  The safe harbor is simple, straightforward, and final. To take \nadvantage of it, payments above $600 per year to an individual service \nprovider must be reported to the IRS, just as is required under current \nlaw. This will help ensure that taxes properly due to the Treasury will \ncontinue to be collected.\n  Mr. President, the IRS contends that there are millions of \nindependent contractors who should be classified as employees, which \ncosts the Federal Government billions of dollars a year. This assertion \nis plainly incorrect. Classification of a worker has no cost to the \nGovernment. What costs the Government are taxpayers who do not pay \ntheir taxes. My bill has two requirements that I believe will improve \ncompliance among independent contractors using the safe harbor. First, \nthere must be a written agreement between the parties--this will help \nthe independent contractor know from the beginning that he is \nresponsible for his own tax payments. Second, the safe harbor will not \napply if the service recipient does not comply with the reporting \nrequirements and issue 1099's to individuals who perform services.\n  My bill also provides relief for businesses and independent \ncontractors when the IRS determines that a worker was misclassified. \nUnder the bill, if the business and the independent contractor have a \nwritten agreement, if the applicable reporting requirements were met, \nand if there was a reasonable basis for the parties to believe that the \nworker is an independent contractor, then any IRS reclassification \nupheld in court will only apply prospectively. This provision gives \nimportant peace of mind to small businesses that act in good faith by \nremoving the unpredictable threat of retroactive reclassification and \nsubstantial interest and penalties.\n  A final provision of this legislation, Mr. President, is the repeal \nof section 1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. This provision effectively \nbarred an entire group of independent contractors from the protection \navailable in section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. When section 1706 \nwas enacted, its proponents argued that technical service workers--such \nas engineers, designers, and computer programmers--were less compliant \nin paying their taxes. Later examination of this issue by the Treasury \nDepartment found that technical service workers are in fact more likely \nto pay their taxes than most other types of independent contractors. \nThis revelation underscores the need to repeal section 1706 and level \nthe playing field for individuals in these professions. In the 104th \nCongress, proposals to repeal section 1706 enjoyed wide bi-partisan \nsupport, and it is my hope that the 105th Congress will finally act on \nthis proposal to restore equality for these professionals.\n  Mr. President, the importance of adding clarity to the independent-\ncontractor situation is underscored by the fact that the 2,000 \ndelegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business voted to \ndesignate it as their top priority. At that conference, IRS \nCommissioner Richardson noted that either classification--independent \ncontractor or employee--can be a valid and appropriate business choice \nas long as the individual pays his taxes. This conclusion was later \naffirmed in the IRS' new worker classification training manual. It is \ntime that the law reflect this conclusion and allow small businesses to \nhire employees or independent contractors as their business needs \ndemand, without the fear and uncertainty that now prevails.\n  The Home-Based Business Fairness Act is a common-sense measure that \nwill provide tax fairness for the increasing number of individuals who \noperate their businesses from home and contribute so significantly to \nthe strength of our economy. These business owners have waited far too \nlong. I urge the members of the Finance Committee to work with Senator \nNickles and to report out a bill that provides these three much needed \nchanges in the tax law so that we do not keep them waiting any longer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 460\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Currently the limit on \n     deductibility of health insurance costs for these individuals \n     is 40 percent, and it is scheduled to rise to 80 percent by \n     2006, under the provisions in the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which was signed \n     into law in August 1996. The bill is designed to place self-\n     employed individuals on an equal footing with large \n     businesses which can currently deduct 100% of the health \n     insurance costs of all of their employees.\n\n\n                Restoration of the Home-Office Deduction\n\n       Section 3 of the bill clarifies the definition of \n     ``principal place of business,'' which relates to the home-\n     office deduction under section 280A of the Internal Revenue \n     Code. The bill permits a home office to include an office \n     where a taxpayer performs his or her essential administrative \n     or management activities such as billing and recordkeeping. \n     In order to qualify for the new definition, the taxpayer must \n     perform these activities on a regular, on-going, and non-\n     incidental basis in the home office and have no other \n     location at which to perform these business activities. This \n     section of the bill will be effective on January 1, 1997.\n       The bill is designed to address the ambiguities resulting \n     from the Supreme Court's 1993 decision, Commissioner v. \n     Soliman. That case has been interpreted to require two new \n     tests for the home-office deduction: (1) the customers of a \n     home business must physically visit the home office, and (2) \n     the taxpayer's business income must be generated within the \n     home office itself--not from transactions that occur outside \n     of the home office. The bill is intended to permit taxpayers \n     who perform their services outside the home but use their \n     home office for essential billing and recordkeeping to \n     qualify for the home-office deduction.\n\n\n                Safe Harbor for Independent Contractors\n\n       Section 4 of the bill addresses the worker-classification \n     issue (e.g., whether a worker is an employee or an \n     independent contractor) by creating a new section 3511 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code. The new section will provide a general \n     safe harbor and protection against retroactive \n     reclassification of an independent contractor in certain \n     circumstances. The bill is designed to provide certainty for \n     businesses that enter into independent-contractor \n     relationships and minimize the risk of huge tax bills for \n     back taxes, interest, and penalties if a worker is \n     misclassified.\n\n                          General safe harbor\n\n       Under the general safe harbor, if either of two tests is \n     met, an individual will be treated as an independent \n     contractor and the service recipient will not be treated as \n     an employer. The first test requires that the independent \n     contractor demonstrate economic independence and workplace \n     independence and have a written contract with the service \n     recipient.\n       Economic independence exists if all of the following apply: \n     the independent contractor has the ability to realize a \n     profit or loss, he or she incurs unreimbursed expenses that \n     are consistent with industry practice and that equal at least \n     2 percent of the independent contractor's adjusted gross \n     income from the performance of services during the taxable \n     year, and the independent contractor agrees to perform \n     services for a particular amount of time or to complete a \n     specific result or task.\n       Workplace independence exists if one of the following \n     applies: the independent contractor has a principal place of \n     business (the definition of which includes the provisions of \n     section 3 of the bill, which address the Soliman decision); \n     he or she performs services at more than one service \n     recipient's facilities; he or she pays a fair-market rent for \n     the use of the service recipient's facilities, or the \n     independent contractor uses his or her own equipment.\n       The written contract between the independent contractor and \n     the service recipient must provide that the independent \n     contractor will not be treated as an employee.\n       Under the second alternative test, an individual will be \n     treated as an independent contractor if he or she conducts \n     business through a corporation or a limited liability company \n     and the independent contractor does not receive benefits from \n     the service recipient--instead the independent contractor \n     would be responsible for his or her own benefits. The \n     independent contractor must also have a written contract with \n     the service provider stating that the independent contractor \n     will not be treated as an employee.\n       The general safe-harbor provisions also apply to three-\n     party situations in which the independent contractor is paid \n     by a third party, such as a payroll company, rather than \n     directly by the service recipient. The general safe harbor, \n     however, will not apply to a service recipient or a third-\n     party payor if they do not comply with the existing reporting \n     requirements and file 1099s for individuals who work as \n     independent contractors. A limited exception is provided for \n     cases in which the failure to file a 1099 is due to \n     reasonable cause and not willful neglect.\n       The bill also provides additional relief for cases in which \n     a worker is treated as an independent contractor under the \n     general safe harbor and the IRS later contends that the safe \n     harbor does not apply. In that case, the burden falls on the \n     IRS, rather than the taxpayer, to prove that the safe harbor \n     does not apply. To qualify for this relief the taxpayer must \n     demonstrate a credible argument that it was reasonable to \n     treat the service provider as an independent contractor, and \n     the taxpayer must fully cooperate with reasonable requests \n     from the IRS.\n       In the event that the general safe harbor does not apply, \n     the bill makes clear that the independent contractor or \n     service recipient can still rely on the 20-factor common law \n     test or other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code \n     applicable in determining whether an individual is an \n     employee or an independent contractor. In addition, the bill \n     does not limit any relief that a taxpayer may be entitled to \n     under Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. The bill also \n     makes clear that the general safe harbor will not be \n     construed as a prerequisite for these other provisions of the \n     law concerning worker classification.\n\n            Protection against retroactive reclassification\n\n       The bill also provides protection against retroactive \n     reclassification by the IRS of an independent contractor as \n     an employee. For many service recipients who make a good \n     faith effort to classify the worker correctly, this event can \n     result in extensive liability for back employment taxes, \n     interest, and penalties.\n       Under the bill, if the IRS notifies a service recipient \n     that an independent contractor should have been classified as \n     an employee, the IRS' determination can become effective only \n     30 days after the date that the IRS sends the notification. \n     To qualify for this provision, the service recipient must \n     show that: There was a written agreement between the parties; \n     the service recipient satisfied the applicable reporting \n     requirements for all taxable years covered by the contract; \n     and there was a reasonable basis for determining that the \n     independent contractor was not an employee and the service \n     provider made the determination in good faith. The bill \n     provides similar protection for independent contractors who \n     are notified by the IRS that they should have been treated as \n     an employee.\n       The protection against retroactive reclassification is \n     intended to remove some of the uncertainty for taxpayers who \n     must use the IRS's 20-factor common law test. While the bill \n     would prevent the IRS from forcing a service recipient to \n     treat an independent contractor as an employee for past \n     years, the bill makes clear that a service recipient or an \n     independent contractor can still challenge the IRS's \n     prospective reclassification of an independent contractor \n     through administrative or judicial proceedings.\n\n              Additional independent contractor provisions\n\n       Section 4 of the bill contains two additional provisions \n     designed to assist independent contractors. The first \n     clarifies that an individual's compliance with a statutory or \n     regulatory requirement will not be treated as evidence of \n     control. The 20-factor common law test focuses in part on the \n     business' control over a worker. When the business can direct \n     how, when and where a worker performs a task; such control \n     usually indicates that the worker is an employee rather than \n     an independent contractor. Certain statutory and regulatory \n     requirements, which a business and/or a worker must follow, \n     have been interpreted by the IRS as demonstrating evidence of \n     this type of control when the majority of other factors would \n     lead to the conclusion that a worker is an independent \n     contractor. The bill clarifies that compliance with statutory \n     or regulatory requirements should not be a factor in \n     determining whether an individual is an independent \n     contractor.\n       Second, the bill would repeal section 530(d) of the Revenue \n     Act of 1978, which was added\n\n[[Page S2433]]\n\n     by section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This provision \n     precludes technical service providers (e.g., engineers, \n     designers, drafters, computer programmers, systems analysts, \n     and other similarly qualified individuals) who work through a \n     third party, such as a placement broker, from applying the \n     safe harbor under section 530. The bill is designed to level \n     the playing field for individuals in these professions.\n\n                            Effective dates\n\n       In general, the independent-contractor provisions of the \n     bill, including the general safe harbor, will be effective \n     for service performed after the date of enactment of the \n     bill. The protection against retroactive reclassification \n     will be effective for IRS determinations after the date of \n     enactment, and the repeal of section 530(d) will be effective \n     for periods ending after the date of enactment of the bill.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, in the introduction of the Home-\nBased Business Fairness Act. I compliment Senator Bond for his \nleadership on these issues and all matters affecting small business as \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business.\n  The small, independent business is the engine which drives \ninnovation, job creation, and increased economic activity in this \ncountry. I am proud to live in a country where any person can use \ntalent, intelligence, and hard work to start a business. I believe \nthese businesses are the foundation of our free enterprise economy, and \nthe very essence of capitalism.\n  There are 5 million independent contractors in America according to \nthe Small Business Administration, and almost one-third of all \ncompanies use independent contractors to some degree. Further, the SBA \nestimates that more than 14 million individuals earn some income from \nhome-based businesses, and some 300,000 women start home-based \nbusinesses every year.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Code does not \nalways treat small businesses fairly, and it often acts to limit and \nrepress the entrepreneurial spirit. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday is intended to address some of the Tax Code's inequities and \nremove the roadblocks to the creation of new small businesses.\n  A perfect example of the Tax Code's bias against small business is \nthe treatment of health insurance expenses. Corporations can currently \ndeduct 100 percent of the health insurance costs of their employees. As \nrecently as 2 years ago, self-employed individuals were only allowed to \ndeduct 25 percent of their health insurance costs. Fortunately, the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 increased \nthis limit to 40 percent this year, with a scheduled increase to 80 \npercent by 2006. However, the bias against small business continues. \nOur legislation increases the deduction for health insurance cost for \nself-employed individuals to 100 percent beginning on January 1, 1997.\n  For some small business taxpayers, the enemy has not been the IRS or \nthe Congress, but the judiciary. A 1993 Supreme Court decision, \nCommissioner versus Soliman has been interpreted to require two new \ntests for the home-office deduction: First, the customers of a home \nbusiness must physically visit the home office, and second, the \ntaxpayer's business income must be generated within the home office \nitself--not from transactions that occur outside of the home office. \nThis interpretation has effectively prevented millions of taxpayers \nfrom deducting valid, reasonable, and necessary business expenses. The \nHome-Based Business Fairness Act will permit taxpayers who perform \ntheir services outside the home but use their home office for essential \nbilling and recordkeeping to qualify for the home-office deduction, \nprovided they perform these activities on a regular, ongoing, and \nnonincidental basis in the home office and have no other location at \nwhich to perform these business activities. This section of the bill \nwill be effective on January 1, 1997.\n  Finally, Mr. President, our legislation addresses a major, continuing \nproblem for the small business community. The problem is worker \nclassification--independent contractor or employee. In a perfect world, \nthis issue should be irrelevant. The relationship between a worker and \na business would be strictly based on their individual needs, and the \nGovernment's only interest would be to collect the same amount of taxes \nregardless of the relationship.\n  Unfortunately, however, this is not a perfect world. The complexity \nof the Tax Code and Congress' failure to provide adequate guidance to \nsmall businesses and their workers has resulted in a confusing mess. \nLeft to their own devices, the Internal Revenue Service has adopted an \naggressive, proemployee agenda.\n  For the last 20 years, the classification of workers as contractors \nor employees has been controlled by a 20-factor common law test which \nattempts to define a business' control over a worker. This common law \ntest is the bane of employers and workers across the country. The \nGeneral Accounting Office has called the common law test unclear \nand subject to conflicting interpretations. Even the Treasury \nDepartment has testified that:\n\n       Applying the common law test in employment tax issues does \n     not yield clear, consistent, or even satisfactory answers, \n     and reasonable persons may differ as to the correct \n     classification.\n\n  Beyond the 20-factor test, some businesses may avail themselves of a \nsafe harbor enacted in 1978. The section 530 safe harbor prohibits the \nIRS from reclassifying workers as employees if the business had a \nreasonable basis for treatment of the workers as independent \ncontractors, or if a past IRS audit did not dispute the workers' \nclassification.\n  Our bill creates a new worker classification safe harbor and provides \nlimited relief from retroactive worker reclassification, two changes \nwhich will resolve many of the problems small businesses face with the \nIRS. Our bill does not repeal the 20-factor common law test, it does \nnot repeal the section 530 safe harbor, and it does not affect other \nspecial worker classification situations such as statutory employees or \ndirect sellers. Put simply, our bill will benefit those businesses and \ncontractors who have not resolved their status with the IRS, while \npreserving current law for those who are satisfied with it.\n  To summarize briefly, our legislation protects businesses and \ncontractors who meet one of two tests. The first test measures a \nworker's economic risk and workplace independence, and requires the two \nparties to have a written contract and comply with all tax reporting \nrequirements. Under the second test, a worker who conducts business \nthrough a corporation or a limited liability company, does not receive \nbenefits from the service recipient, and has a written contract will be \ntreated as an independent contractor.\n  Our bill also protects businesses from retroactive reclassification \nof workers and the associated liability for back taxes, interest, and \npenalties, provided the business had a written contract with the \nworkers, complied with all tax reporting requirements, and had a \nreasonable basis to treat the workers as contractors. Finally, our \nlegislation repeals section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which \nprecludes third-party technical service workers from the section 530 \nsafe harbor, and it clarifies that compliance with a statutory or \nregulatory requirements will not be treated as evidence of control for \nthe purpose of worker classification.\n  Mr. President, the Tax Code reforms included in the Home-Based \nBusiness Fairness Act are commonsense solutions to the real problems \nfaced by small businesses. With this bill, Senator Bond and I have \ntried to address those problems which we believe are most critical to \nthe creation of new small businesses, new jobs, and new economic \ngrowth. I encourage my colleagues to give this legislation their \nthoughtful consideration and join us in this initiative.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of The Home-Based \nBusiness Fairness Act of 1997, introduced today by the chairman of the \nSmall Business Committee, Senator Bond. I know that Senator Bond, \nSenator Nickles and Senator Snowe have worked hard to draft this bill \nand I am proud to be an original cosponsor. It addresses three concerns \nthat have weighed heavily on the small business community for years: \nFirst health insurance fairness; second the home-office deduction; and \nthird the status of independent contractors. I hope the Senate and the \nHouse will move quickly to pass this legislation.\n  It is a good bill because it responds directly to what small \nbusinesses have been asking us to do. It will help create\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\njobs that will put people on welfare back to work. This is an issue \nthat policymakers have been concentrating on since last year's welfare \ndebate--the President has proposed a Welfare to Work Program while \nCongress is looking at the best ways to stimulate the economy and \ncreate jobs. Toward that effort, it is impossible to overlook the \nimportance of small business. Small businesses create nearly 100 \npercent of this country's new jobs and employ over 65 percent of \nAmericans working in the private sector. And I guarantee it would be \nsmall businesses that hire the majority of today's welfare recipients \nif Government would make it affordable to do so.\n  Small business is more than the backbone of this country. Small \nbusiness is the engine of the American Dream. But it needs a system \nthat empowers people, not government. This bill would help people by \nremoving just a couple of the obstacles in the way of that Dream.\n  When I was elected to the Senate last November, my first choice of \ncommittee assignments was the Small Business Committee. My wife, Diana, \nand I were small businessowners and we have experienced--at one time or \nanother--nearly all of the obstacles that can stand in the way of a \nsuccessful small business. At this time last year, in fact, my wife and \nI were balancing our books and paying our taxes--hoping to find that \nthe books still balanced after paying the taxes! So I know what small \nbusinessowners are going through. Very recently, I have been there.\n  There is a lot of talk in this legislative body about improving the \nenvironment for small business. In fact, I doubt that any Member would \nstand up and say he or she does not support small business. We hold \nhearings and listen to testimony, we provide for White House \nconferences on small business, we receive stacks of polling data and we \ncreate commission after commission to tell us what needs to be done. In \nthe end, we find out what I think we already know--the problem is \ntaxes. Too many and too much.\n  This bill is a small step in the Tax Code, but a giant step for \nsensibility. It recognizes some of the revolutionary changes in \nAmerican business. The advent of personal computers, high speed modems, \ncell phones, pagers, and fax machines that have enabled Americans to \nwork via audio and video conferencing, from satellite offices, and by \ntelecommuting. Our tax laws have not kept up with the sea of change in \nAmerican business.\n\n  One example of this change is the increasing number of women in our \nNation's work force. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 76 \npercent of mothers with school-age children now work. Among two-parent \nhouseholds, 63 percent report that both parents must work outside the \nhome--in many cases, one works to pay the bills, while the other works \nto pay the taxes. And of these women entering the work force, 1 in 20 \nare starting their own businesses and many are home based and that \nnumber is rising rapidly. In fact, women start new businesses at twice \nthe rate of men--and with a very good success rate. But the Tax Code \nneeds improvement. It discourages self-employment and home-based \nbusiness through discrimination and complexity. This bill would change \nthat.\n  The Home-Based Business Fairness Act would finally put an end to our \nregressive, two-tiered system that makes self-employed people pay more \nfor their health insurance. It is time to give small business \ncompetitive parity with big business. All the technical assistance and \nloan guarantees in the world cannot overcome unfair tax treatment and \ndisproportionately burdensome regulations. Last year, Congress \nrecognized the inequality by voting to phase in an 80-percent \ndeductibility for health insurance costs. That's a good start. But if \nwe know the tax treatment is not fair, then shouldn't we make it right? \nAmerica's small businesses need fair and equal treatment.\n  This legislation would also add fairness for people who work in their \nhomes. Our current outdated Tax Code discriminates against home-based \npeople by restricting their ability to deduct office expenses. The \nmessage is, if you can't afford a real office, then you can't deduct \nyour expenses. In this way, we increase the hurdles for entrepreneurs \nwho want to earn a living, but can't afford to rent separate office \nspace. This part of the legislation will benefit thousands of home-\nbased women and men. It is very important and deserves a thoughtful \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  Another puzzling antibusiness setup that this bill would simplify is \nthe definition of independent contractor. American entrepreneurs--and \nespecially home-based business owners--need a simpler test. I have \nalways believed we could make things a lot easier if we just followed \nthe payroll taxes. Who pays them? Is there a written contract? It does \nnot have to be ``rocket science.'' This legislation would simplify the \ntest so that everyone can understand it--not just the tax attorneys at \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  On that subject, in Wyoming recently, the IRS has taken after the \nlast bastion of budding entrepreneurs, our paper boys. Once again, the \nthirsty IRS auditors are devising ways to haunt working people--\npresumed guilty until proven innocent. When did the IRS decide to pick \non the hard-earned wages of independent paperboys and girls? They are \nnot now, and never have been, salaried newspaper employees. They are \njust kids who want to earn some money by working before or after \nschool.\n  I think we should call this part of the bill, The Paperboy Protection \nAct. The last bastion for new entrepreneurs needs our help. The small \nbusiness owners of tomorrow are counting on us to pass this \nlegislation. I thank my colleagues on the Small Business Committee, and \nthe assistant majority leader, for their hard work on the bill. I urge \nother Senators to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 461. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 and the National Labor Relations Act to modify certain provisions, \nto transfer certain occupational safety and health functions to the \nSecretary of Labor, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n         THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nmy colleagues, Mr. Inhofe and Mr. Helms, the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Reform Act of 1997. This legislation will transform OSHA from an \nagency that generates fines and paperwork to one that plays a more \nconstructive role in improving worker safety.\n  Mr. President, the Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted in \n1970. It may not surprise my colleagues that since that time, the \nincidence of work-related injuries and illnesses has steadily declined. \nBut it may surprise them to learn that in the 25 years prior to \nenactment of OSHA, workplace injuries declined almost twice as fast as \nthey have since the enactment of OSHA. The reduction of workplace \ninjuries, which had been occurring before OSHA was created, has \nactually slowed since the agency was created.\n  One may reasonably ask, why is that the case? Mr. President, I have \ntalked to hundreds of business people throughout my State of Texas and \nthroughout the Nation. Time and again, I have heard stories of \nburdensome and complex OSHA requirements and of arbitrary and unfair \ninspections and fines.\n  The vast majority of other employers in this country desire and \nstrive to see to it that their employees have a safe place to work. \nIndeed, it is in their own best interest to do so. Injuries are costly: \nThey interrupt production schedules, cause a loss of productivity and \nincrease the burgeoning expense of workers' compensation, not to \nmention the impact on overall employee morale and productivity.\n  Many of the employers I speak with would like to work with, rather \nthan against OSHA, but fear that if they take any affirmative steps to \nimprove and review the safety of their workplace, it will only serve to \nattract aggressive OSHA inspectors. Thus, rather than helping to raise \nthe safety level of American workers, the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act actually discourages employers in many cases from \naggressively working to improve workplace health and safety.\n  Remarkably, OSHA's response to the growing call for reform of its \nenforcement tactics has been to seek to expand its territory. Most \nrecently,\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\nOSHA has worked on establishing new and enormously costly standards on \nergonomics and even on the prevention of nighttime crime at retail \nstores.\n\n  Mr. President, when Congress established OSHA, it did so with the \nintent that the agency, employers, and employees would all work toward \nthe common purpose of creating safer and healthier workplace \nenvironments. Unfortunately, the culture of OSHA has evolved into one \nof regulatory excess, punitive enforcement, and standard setting based \non arbitrariness rather than sound cost/benefit analysis. Things have \ngotten so bad that OSHA inspectors have even testified that they have \nbeen required to meet monthly quotas for citations and fines.\n  The bill I am introducing today will restore OSHA to its intended \nmission by requiring the agency to take a commonsense approach to \nestablishing safety standards and by encouraging cooperation and \nvoluntary improvement rather than confrontation. In brief, the bill:\n  Requires that OSHA, prior to setting a new standard, establish that a \nworksite safety hazard exists and consider whether it can economically \nbe corrected using feasible technology;\n  It provides safety consultation and assistance to small businesses to \nencourage OSHA compliance;\n  It gives employers an opportunity to correct problems identified by \nemployees before a formal OSHA complaint is filed, and protects \nemployees who raise safety concerns to their employers;\n  It stops the practice of citing contractors for the violations of \nsubcontractors whose employees are not under the contractor's control;\n  It limits employers' liability for the unsafe conduct of employees \nwho have been properly trained and equipped by their employer;\n  It requires that fines for violations be proportional to their actual \nimpact on employee safety; and\n  It will end the de facto practice of establishing quotas for \nenforcement activities.\n  Mr. President, I realize that there are employers out there who may \nnot care about the safety of their employees. To them, I say, beware. \nUnder this bill, OSHA will be freed to concentrate its resources and \nenforcement efforts on those employers who willfully disregard \nworkplace safety.\n  But to the other 99 percent of the honest, hardworking business \npeople in America who want to do right by their employees, I say: We \nhave heard your call for action, and help is on the way. I urge them \nand I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 461\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform and consolidate the public and assisted \nhousing programs of the United States, and to redirect primary \nresponsibility for these programs from the Federal Government to States \nand localities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n        THE PUBLIC HOUSING REFORM AND RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am today introducing, along with Senators \nD'Amato, Bond, Faircloth, and Grams, the Public Housing Reform and \nResponsibility Act of 1997. This bill is similar to public and assisted \nhousing reform legislation, S. 1260, that was introduced in the 104th \nCongress and passed unanimously by the Senate.\n  The Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997 addresses a \npublic housing system fraught with counterproductive rules and \nregulations that make it impossible for even the best run public \nhousing authorities [PHA's] to operate effectively and efficiently. It \nwill help to make public housing a platform from which residents can \nachieve the goal of economic independence and self-sufficiency. In \naddition, it promotes increased residential choice and mobility by \nincreasing opportunities for residents to use tenant-based assistance.\n  Most public housing today serves only the poorest of the poor--on \naverage those with incomes at 17 percent of area median. The gap \nbetween tenant rent contributions and the cost of operating public \nhousing is growing wider than the ability of Federal housing subsidy \nfunds to close it. PHA's are denied the flexibility necessary to \nmaintain the existing supply of public housing in decent and safe \ncondition, and in some cases are even constrained from demolishing \nvacant or nonviable public housing developments.\n  Just as these rules have made it difficult for housing authorities to \nprovide and maintain decent and safe housing or to meet basic operating \ncosts, these rules have been even worse for tenants. They have \ndestroyed the ability of families to move up and out of public housing \nand become economically self-sufficient. Public housing rent rules, in \nparticular, create strong economic disincentives for residents to work \nor seek higher paying jobs.\n  The following reforms contained in the Public Housing Reform and \nResponsibility Act represent significant improvements in current public \nand assisted housing policies.\n  First, the bill consolidates a multitude of programs into two \nflexible block grants to expand the eligible uses of funds and allow \nmore creative and efficient use of resources. The bill also repeals a \nnumber of current programs that are obsolete, unused, or unfunded.\n  Second, it institutes permanent rent reforms such as ceiling rents, \nearned income adjustments, and minimum rents that provide PHA's with \nthe tools to develop rental policies that encourage and reward work and \nfurther the goal of creating mixed-income communities. The bill also \nremoves the floor on rents that may be charged under the Brooke \namendment, while assuring that poor families will not pay more than 30 \npercent of their income for rent.\n  Third, the bill requires tough, swift action against PHA's with \nsevere management deficiencies and provides HUD or court-appointed \nreceivers with the necessary tools and powers to deal with troubled \nagencies and protect public housing residents.\n  Fourth, it requires intervention with respect to severely distressed \npublic housing developments that trap residents in deplorable living \nconditions and are costly to operate or maintain. It provides residents \nwith alternative housing using vouchers or other available housing.\n  Fifth, the bill permanently repeals the one-for-one replacement \nrequirement and streamlines the demolition and disposition process to \npermit PHA's to demolish or sell vacant or obsolete public housing.\n  Sixth, it gives PHA's broad flexibility to develop or participate \nwith other providers of affordable housing in the development of mixed-\nincome, mixed finance developments.\n  Seventh, it repeals Federal preferences that have had the unintended \nconsequence of concentrating the poorest of the poor in public housing \ndevelopments and allows PHA's to operate according to locally \nestablished preferences consistent with local housing\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\nneeds. The bill still maintains the requirement that most housing \nassistance be targeted to very low-income households.\n  Eighth, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act calls on \nPHA's to increase coordination with State and local welfare agencies to \nensure that welfare recipients living in public housing will have the \nfull opportunity to move from welfare to work.\n  Ninth, the bill provides residents with an active voice in developing \nthe local PHA plans that will govern the operations and management of \nhousing and for direct participation on housing authority boards of \ndirectors. It also authorizes funds for resident organizations to \ndevelop resident management and empowerment activities.\n  Finally, it merges the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs \ninto a single, choice-based program designed to operate more \neffectively in the private marketplace. It repeals requirements that \nare administratively burdensome to landlords, such as take-one, take-\nall, endless lease and 90-day termination notice requirements. These \nreforms will make participation in the section 8 tenant-based program \nmore attractive to private landlords and increase housing choices for \nlower income families.\n  The reforms contained in this legislation will significantly improve \nthe nation's public housing and tenant-based rental assistance program \nand the lives of those who reside in Federally assisted housing. The \nfunding flexibility, substantial deregulation of the day-to-day \noperations and policies of public authorities, encouragement of mixed-\nfinance developments, policies to deal with distressed and troubled \npublic housing, and rent reforms will change the face of public housing \nfor PHA's, residents, and local communities.\n  Reform of the public housing system has been and should remain a \nbipartisan effort. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues \ntoward early passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2416-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2439-S2480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PUBLIC HOUSING REFORM AND RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1997 SUMMARY OF KEY \n                               PROVISIONS\n\n\n                                FINDINGS\n\n       Recognizes the Federal government's limited capacity and \n     expertise to manage and oversee 3,400 public housing agencies \n     nationwide. Acknowledges the concentration of the very poor \n     in very poor neighborhoods, disincentives for economic self-\n     sufficiency, and lack of resident choice have been the \n     unintended consequences resulting from Federal \n     micromanagement of housing programs in the past.\n\n\n                                PURPOSE\n\n       To reform the public housing system by consolidating \n     programs, streamlining program requirements, and providing \n     maximum flexibility and discretion to public housing \n     authorities [PHAs] who perform well with strict \n     accountability to residents and localities, and to address \n     the problems of housing authorities with severe management \n     deficiencies.\n\n\n                            BASIC PROVISIONS\n\n       Program Consolidation. Consolidates public housing programs \n     into two flexible block grants--one for operating expenses \n     and one for capital needs. Requires HUD to establish new \n     formulas through negotiated rulemaking. Funding for section 8 \n     tenant-based program will continue to be funded as a separate \n     program.\n       Elimination of Obsolete Regulations. Eliminates all current \n     HUD rules, regulations, handbooks, and notices pertaining to \n     public housing and section 8 tenant-based programs under the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 one year after enactment; \n     requires HUD to propose new regulations necessary to carry \n     out the revised Act within 9 months.\n       Public Housing Agency Plan [PHAP]. Refocuses the \n     responsibility for administering public housing back to the \n     PHA, the tenants and the local community. Requires each PHA \n     to submit a comprehensive public housing agency plan to HUD, \n     consistent with the local Comprehensive Housing Affordability \n     Strategy [CHAS] and developed in conjunction with a resident \n     advisory board.\n       The plan is intended to serve as an operating, management \n     and planning tool for PHAs. Plan requirements, to be \n     established through negotiated rulemaking, would include: a \n     description of the PHA's uses for operating and capital \n     funds; a description of the PHA's management policies; \n     procedures relating to eligibility, selection, and admission; \n     plans for capital improvements and demolition and disposition \n     or properties; and policies regarding rents, security, and \n     tenant empowerment activities. The plan would also include a \n     statement of needs which would describe the needs of the low-\n     income families in the community and on the waiting list and \n     how the PHA intends to address those needs.\n       HUD review of the public housing agency plan would be \n     limited to determine whether the contents of the plan: (1) \n     set forth the information required to be contained in the \n     plan; (2) are consistent with the information and data \n     available to HUD; and (3) are not prohibited by or \n     inconsistent with the requirements of this Act or any \n     applicable law.\n       The bill allows HUD to require additional information from \n     troubled PHAs, and a streamlined plan for high-performing \n     PHAs and small PHAs with less than 250 units.\n       Vouchering Out of Public Housing. Allows PHAs to convert \n     any public housing development to a tenant-based or \n     ``voucher'' system, but requires the vouchering out of all \n     severely ``distressed'' public housing. Requires each PHA, \n     within 2 years, to assess all public housing for the purpose \n     of vouchering out by performing a cost and market analysis \n     and an impact analysis on the affected community; provides \n     HUD with waiver authority for PHAs to conduct the assessment.\n       Choice and Opportunity for Residents. Provides public \n     housing families with an active voice in developing a PHA \n     plan that is responsive to their needs. Provides funds for \n     resident organizations to develop resident management and \n     empowerment activities.\n       Federal Preferences. Repeals Federal preferences and allows \n     PHAs to operate according to locally established preferences \n     consistent with local housing needs.\n       Income Targeting and Eligibility. Allows PHAs in any fiscal \n     year to make units available for initial occupancy to \n     families with incomes up to 80% of median income, except that \n     at least 40% of the units must be reserved for families whose \n     income does not exceed 30% of the area median and at least \n     75% of the units must be reserved for families whose income \n     does not exceed 60% of area median; requires PHAs to include \n     a plan in the public housing agency plan for achieving a \n     diverse income mix among tenants in each project and among \n     scattered-site public housing. Income targeting provisions \n     for the section 8 tenant-based program are similar to public \n     housing except 50% of vouchers must be reserved for families \n     whose income does not exceed 30% of the area median.\n       Rent Flexibility. Allows PHAs to set rents at a level not \n     to exceed 30% of a tenant's adjusted income. Encourages PHAs \n     to develop rental policies that reward employment and upward \n     mobility.\n       Ceiling Rents. Allows PHAs to set ceiling rents that \n     reflect the reasonable rental value of units in order to \n     remove the disincentive for residents to work or seek higher \n     paying jobs where rents are based on a percentage of income.\n       Minimum Rents. Allows PHAs to set a minimum rent for both \n     Section 8 and public housing units, not to exceed $25 per \n     month.\n       Income Adjustments. Allows a PHA to disregard certain \n     income in calculating rents to take away the disincentive for \n     tenants to work and earn higher incomes.\n       Troubled PHAs. Requires HUD to take over or appoint a \n     receiver for PHAs that are in substantial default within one \n     year of enactment. Expands HUD's powers for dealing with \n     troubled PHAs by allowing it to break up troubled agencies \n     into one or more agencies, abrogate contracts that impede \n     correction of the agency's default, and demolish and dispose \n     of a PHA's assets. Allows HUD to provide technical assistance \n     to assist near-troubled PHAs from becoming troubled.\n       Demolition and Disposition. Repeals the one-for-one \n     replacement requirement and streamlines and makes flexible \n     the demolition and disposition process to permit PHAs to \n     demolish and dispose of vacant or obsolete housing. \n     Authorizes HUD to disapprove any demolition or disposition \n     that is clearly inconsistent with the information and data \n     available to HUD.\n       No Net Increase in Public Housing Units. Prohibits PHAs \n     from using capital or operating funds to increase the overall \n     number of public housing units they own and/or operate.\n       Substance, Alcohol Abuse, Criminal Activity. Retains \n     provisions enacted as part of last year's Housing Opportunity \n     Program Extension Act that: (1) require PHAs to prohibit \n     occupancy by, or terminate tenancy of, any person a PHA \n     determines is illegally using a controlled substance or has \n     reasonable cause to believe his/her drug use or alcohol abuse \n     could/does interfere with the health, safety, or right to \n     peaceful enjoyment of other tenants; (2) strengthen the \n     ability of PHAs to evict residents for drug-related criminal \n     activity; (3) deny housing assistance to residents evicted \n     for drug-related activities for up to three years; and (4)\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\n     provide PHAs with greater access to the criminal conviction \n     records of adult applicants and residents.\n       Consortia and Joint Ventures. Allows PHAs to form a \n     consortium with other PHAs, form and operate wholly-owned or \n     controlled subsidiaries, or enter into joint ventures, \n     partnerships or other business arrangements to administer \n     housing programs; requires any income to be used for low-\n     income housing or to benefit the tenants of the PHA.\n       Designated Housing for the Elderly and Disabled. Retains \n     provisions enacted as part of last year's Housing Opportunity \n     Program Extension Act that: (1) permits PHAs, in their own \n     discretion, to designate public housing projects (or portions \n     thereof) as elderly-only, disabled only, or elderly and \n     disabled housing under their Public Housing Agency Plans; (2) \n     permits PHAs, for purposes of elderly-only housing, to \n     provide a secondary preference for occupancy for near elderly \n     families; and (3) prohibits the eviction of existing tenants \n     as a result of the designation of a public housing project \n     (or portion).\n       Community Work Requirements. Requires residents to perform \n     at least 8 hours of community work per month with the \n     exception for the elderly, disabled and those working full-\n     time, those in school or receiving vocational training, and \n     single parents or the spouse of an otherwise exempt \n     individual who is the primary caretaker of young children.\n       Coordination with Welfare Agencies. Calls on PHAs, to the \n     maximum extent possible, to enter into cooperation agreements \n     with State and local welfare agencies to share information \n     regarding rents, income, and benefits to assist such entities \n     in carrying out their appropriate functions.\n       Public Housing Homeownership Opportunities. Authorizes PHAs \n     to sell public housing units to the low-income tenants of the \n     PHA or to any organization that serves as a conduit for sales \n     to such persons. Allows PHAs to assist residents to purchase \n     a principal residence not located in a public housing \n     project.\n       Mixed-Finance Projects. Allows PHAs to own, operate, \n     assist, or otherwise participate in one or more mixed-finance \n     projects. Permits consistency with the rent requirements of \n     the low-income housing tax credit. Provides broad flexibility \n     for the development of mixed-finance projects, while \n     maintaining the requirements of the public housing program \n     for units which receive assistance as public housing units.\n       Public Housing Mortgages and Security Interests. Authorizes \n     HUD to develop requirements, subject to certain criteria, for \n     PHAs to mortgage or otherwise grant a security interest in \n     any public housing project. Prohibits any action taken under \n     this section to result in any liability to the Federal \n     government.\n       Revitalization of Severely Distressed Public Housing. \n     Revises current severely distressed public housing program \n     and sunsets it on October 1, 1999. Permits competitive grants \n     for: demolition of obsolete public housing; site \n     revitalization; and providing replacement housing, including \n     tenant-based assistance.\n       Section 8 Tenant Based Assistance. Merges the voucher and \n     certificate program into a single voucher program that \n     emphasizes lease requirements similar to the market place. \n     Repeals requirements that are administratively burdensome to \n     landlords, such as ``take one take all'', endless lease, \n     Federal preferences, and ninety-day termination notice \n     requirements.\n       Program Repeals. Repeals several programs, demonstrations, \n     and studies that are either merged into the new block grants, \n     expired, inactive, or already completed including: the Public \n     Housing One-Stop Perinatal Services Demonstration, Public \n     Housing Childhood Development Program, Indian Housing \n     Childhood Development Program, Public Housing Mincs \n     Demonstration, Public Housing Energy Efficiency \n     Demonstration, Public and Assisted Housing Youth Sports \n     Programs, Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Program, \n     Report Regarding Fair Housing Objectives, and Special \n     Projects for Elderly and Handicapped Families.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor the Public Housing \nReform and Responsibility Act of 1997. This important legislation \ncontains significant policy reforms which will greatly improve our \nNation's public and tenant based housing programs. The Public Housing \nReform and Responsibility Act of 1997 is very similar to legislation \n(S. 1260) which was passed unanimously by the Senate in January 1996.\n  I wish to salute Senator Connie Mack, chairman of the Banking \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, for his \nsuccessful leadership in the development and passage of public housing \nreform legislation in the 104th Congress. I commend Senator Mack for \nhis initiative and steadfastness in producing an improved housing bill \nwhich builds on the lessons learned during the last Congress. \nSubstantial input from the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n[HUD], resident associations, public housing authorities and other \ninterested parties has been received and incorporated into this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation addresses just one area of long overdue reform \nneeded at HUD. Given limited Federal resources and the need to balance \nthe budget by the year 2002, Congress must find more cost-effective \nways to provide affordable housing. This bill represents a concrete \nstep in the fulfillment of Congress' responsibility to the American \ntaxpayer to ensure that every Federal dollar is maximized to its \ngreatest potential.\n  The reform provisions contained in this bill will help to ensure the \nlong-term viability of our Nation's existing stock of affordable \nhousing and reaffirms our commitment to providing decent, safe, and \naffordable housing. Efficiencies will be realized from the elimination \nand consolidation of duplicative and burdensome Federal regulations, \nwhile the essential mission of our housing programs is retained and \nstrengthened.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment on several guiding principles \nof the legislation. First, it will reform the public housing system \nthrough the devolution of control from the Federal Government to high \nperforming public housing authorities and their residents. It will \nstreamline program requirements, consolidate programs and provide \nincreased flexibility to public housing authorities which have \ndemonstrated a track record of good management. Federal oversight and \nenforcement of troubled housing authorities will be increased \nsignificantly.\n  The bill provides incentives to empower public housing residents and \nfacilitate the transition from welfare to work. It provides important \nlinkages to the welfare reform bill which became law last year. This \nwill allow our Nation's public housing residents a greater opportunity \nto achieve economic independence.\n  Mr. President, the bill seeks to increase the local accountability of \nhousing authorities through the implementation of a local planning \nprocess. Public housing authorities will prepare 5-year and annual \nplans which will include all significant matters related to the \noperation of the housing authority. These plans will be required to be \nconsistent with relevant State and local comprehensive plans. In \naddition, plans will be reviewed by resident advisory boards.\n  The bill recognizes that public housing is most effective when there \nis a viable income mix among its residents. Federal preferences will be \nrepealed. The Brooke amendment, which requires residents to pay 30 \npercent of their income as rent, would be altered to allow tenants to \npay ``up to'' 30 percent of their incomes in rent. This will remove a \nwork disincentive which has hampered the economic livelihoods of many \nresidents, while retaining the 30 percent limit as a cap.\n  The bill has additional rent reforms such as income disregards which \nwill allow welfare recipients to move to work without losing 30 percent \nof their new-found income to rent, and ceiling rents which will allow \nworking families to continue to move up the economic ladder without a \n30 percent tax on income.\n  Mr. President, this legislation ensures that a significant percentage \nof units that become vacant in a given year will be set aside for the \nlowest income families. I believe this bill achieves the delicate \nbalance between fostering the growth of mixed-income communities while \nensuring that our neediest citizens will continue to be served.\n  The safety and security of the residents of public and assisted \nhousing is a paramount objective. Many safety and security measures, \nincluding allowing public housing authorities increased access to \ncriminal conviction records and greater flexibility in the eviction of \ndrug criminals, were passed last year in legislation which I \nintroduced, the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act (Pub. L. 104-\n120). This legislation includes numerous additional safety and security \nprovisions, including allowing HUD to waive rent requirements to permit \npolice officers a lower rent as an inducement to living in project-\nbased section 8 housing.\n  Furthermore, the bill will streamline the demolition and disposition \nprocess of distressed housing projects through the repeal of the one-\nfor-one replacement requirement and other measures. This impractical \nand counterproductive Federal requirement has \n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\nbeen waived for the last 2 fiscal years through the appropriations \nprocess. By making this repeal permanent, our housing authorities will \nbe able to operate with certainty.\n\n  Mr. President, the Banking Committee and its Housing Subcommittee \nwill continue to evaluate proposals for HUD reorganization. Legislation \nto reform HUD's Federal Housing Administration insured and section 8 \nassisted multifamily properties will be introduced this spring. \nAdditional legislative initiatives to reform HUD and its multitude of \nduplicative programs also will be considered.\n  We must remember that the fundamental goal of this process is to \naddress adequately the affordable housing and community development \nneeds of our citizens in a time of dwindling Federal resources. It is \nimperative that we protect our needy poor and working class residents \nwhom these programs are intended to serve. Reforms must be made with \ncaution and careful consideration.\n  This legislation has been crafted with the benefit of a lengthy and \nproductive debate in the 104th Congress. The Banking Committee \nconducted a series of hearings on HUD and its public and assisted \nhousing programs during the 104th Congress. Additional hearings are \nplanned for this year. The Banking Committee will seek to achieve the \nswift implementation of needed reforms. The committee will utilize an \nopen process with an opportunity for input from all concerned parties, \nwhich has as its goal the formation of a consensus for change.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill appropriately balances the social \npurpose of public and assisted housing programs while also responding \nto Federal fiscal constraints. I look forward to working with all \nMembers of the Banking Committee on a bipartisan basis to ensure the \nspeedy passage of this important housing initiative.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support with Senators Mack and \nD'Amato in introducing the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act \nof 1997. This legislation is substantially the same as S. 1260 which \npassed the Senate in the 104th Congress, but fell short of enactment in \nthe waning days of that Congress.\n  This legislation is a critical step to the needed reform of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, as well as a major reform \nbill in its own right. This legislation consolidates the public housing \nand section 8 tenant-based assistance programs, and redirects the \nresponsibility and authority for public housing and section 8 back to \nfederally assisted residents, the public housing agencies, the \nlocalities, and the States.\n  This bill also dovetails with many of the public housing reforms \ncontained in the VA/HUD fiscal years 1996 and 1997 appropriations bills \nand reflects the need to provide streamlined programs and local \nresponsibility as the most appropriate method to address local housing \nneeds.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the need to find a measured solution to the \nhousing problems of this Nation and to HUD's overregulation of housing \nand community issues that are better addressed at the local level. This \nbill represents a complete overhaul of the public housing system and \nthe section 8 tenant-based program and a move away from HUD's all too \ncommon one-size-fits-all mentality.\n  The linchpin of this legislation is to place the responsibility for \nthe decisionmaking for public housing issues, from the demolition of \nobsolete units to the issue of elderly only housing to the voluntary \nconversion of public housing to tenant-based assistance, in the hands \nof local public housing agencies through public housing agency plans \ndeveloped in conjunction with residents and consistent with state and \nlocal housing plans.\n  In addition, this legislation would continue to protect the poorest \nof the poor by requiring PHA's to continue to make 40 percent of all \nunits available to families whose incomes do not exceed 30 percent of \nthe area median income, 75 percent of all units to families whose \nincomes do not exceed 60 percent of median income and to make all other \nunits available to families with incomes no greater than 80 percent of \nmedian income.\n  This bill also reforms and consolidates the section 8 voucher and \ncertificate program into a single voucher program which will reduce \nadministrative burden and increase the acceptability of vouchers in the \nprivate housing market.\n  Finally, the bill continues the Distressed Public Housing Program for \nthe demolition of obsolete and uninhabitable public housing. Obsolete \npublic housing has long been a drag on communities, and I consider it \nan absolute priority to remove these projects and provide low-income \nfamilies with positive, affordable housing choices.\n  I see this bill as part of a downpayment on a larger HUD reform \neffort which I expect to be pursued throughout this Congress. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on these important issues and I \nam optimistic that we can address many of them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 464. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to allow \nrevision of veterans' benefits decisions based on clear and \nunmistakable error; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n              THE CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE ERROR LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation to \nensure that the Board of Veterans' Appeals errs on behalf of our \nveterans rather than on the side of the Federal Government. \nSpecifically, my legislation will allow a veteran to correct a rating \ndecision which is a clear and unmistakable error.\n  I am pleased to be joining with Congressman Lane Evans in introducing \nthis legislation. Congressman Evans has been a champion in this cause \nand he has shepherded clear and unmistakable error legislation through \nthe House of Representatives in the last two Congresses. The House \nVeterans' Affairs Committee will markup this legislation later this \nweek; again, paving the way for House passage of this legislation. This \nis the first time that Senate legislation has been introduced on clear \nand unmistakable error. I look forward to working with my colleagues at \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to raise the profile of this \nissue in the Senate in the coming days.\n  Since joining the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in the last \nCongress, I have made it a priority to work closely with the veterans \nof my State. This legislative initiative is a direct result of that \npartnership between my office and the veterans of Washington State. \nSeveral veterans service organizations have contacted me in support of \nthis legislation, and I do also know that this issue is a priority for \nthe Disabled American Veterans.\n  For the record, I want to detail a vivid example of a clear and \nunmistakable error. The Department of Veterans Affairs schedule for \nrating disabilities prescribes a 40-percent disability rating for an \namputation of the leg below the knee and a 60-percent disability rating \nfor an amputation of the leg above the knee. In an instance where a \nveteran had an above the knee amputation but was assigned a 40-percent \nrating, the rating decision is indisputably wrong--clear and \nunmistakably wrong. My legislation would ensure that egregious errors \nlike this at any administrative level of adjudication would be subject \nto review.\n  In recent months, I've handled several cases with the Department of \nVeterans Affairs that directly involved clear and unmistakable error. \nIn one case, a veteran with a serious shoulder injury dating back to \nthe Vietnam war was rated incorrectly for more than 20 years. In \nanother case, a veteran with PTSD also dating to service in Vietnam was \nmisdiagnosed for a lengthy period, affecting his disability rating and \nbenefits and the treatment he received. To the VA's credit, some cases \nof clear and unmistakable error are reversible but it depends on where \nthe veteran is in the VA process. Some cases of clear and unmistakable \nerror no longer offer recourse to the veteran. My legislation seeks to \ncorrect this. I believe that we must make available every opportunity \nto right a wrong on behalf of a veteran.\n  Importantly, this legislation will also allow a veteran who under \ncurrent law cannot seek to have a clear and unmistakable error claim \nreviewed the opportunity to request that the Board of Veterans' Appeals \nreview its prior decision. So often we in Congress talk about providing \nfor veterans or about meeting our obligations to veterans.\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\n That is what this bill is all about; it gives a veteran the right to \nrequest a review rather than subjecting an ailing vet to a sometimes \nfaceless bureaucracy hesitant to correct its mistakes.\n  This issue has been cast by some as arcane and complicated. And it \nis. But let me break it down to its most basic element for the Members \nof the Senate. Clear and unmistakable errors are errors that have \ndeprived and continue to deprive veterans of benefits for which their \nentitlement is undeniable. To deny a veteran due to a bureaucratic \nmistake is beyond comprehension. When I first heard of this problem, I \ndoubted the severity of the problem. But for a small number of \nveterans, the problem is real, very real, and it is causing hardships \nfor some in meeting the challenges of everyday life.\n  The Congressional Budget Office determined a previous version of this \nlegislation to be budget neutral. Stated another way, this legislation \nwould not require additional resources for the VA or take needed \nresources from other VA programs or benefits.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs does have a number of objections \nto the legislation. I do look forward to working with Secretary Jesse \nBrown to address these concerns so that this important veterans \nlegislation can go forward. Secretary Brown is the most passionate \nadvocate for veterans within government service. I have every \nconfidence that he will work with me and other concerned Members to \nensure that the VA works for the veteran.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to review this legislation and \njoin me as cosponsors of this important initiative on behalf of \nveterans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Byrd and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 465. A bill to establish an Emergency Commission To End the Trade \nDeficit; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  THE EMERGENCY COMMISSION TO END THE TRADE DEFICIT ESTABLISHMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor of the \nSenate today with my distinguished colleague, the Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd. There is no one in the Senate for whom I have \ngreater respect. I am pleased today to join him in introducing a piece \nof legislation dealing with a very important issue for this country, \nthe trade deficit. Most especially, the merchandise trade deficit.\n  On behalf of myself, Senator Byrd, and Senator Sarbanes, we are \nintroducing legislation today which will establish a commission that \nwill meet and make recommendations on how to end the crippling and \ngrowing merchandise trade deficit in our country.\n  We have had a great deal of discussion about the budget deficit in \nthe U.S. Senate, and in Congress in recent months. In fact, it was not \ntoo long ago we had a stack of books, I venture to say 5-foot high, \nstacked on a desk that was, I think, to demonstrate deficits in various \nbudgets for many years. That was one deficit.\n  That deficit is a difficult and a serious issue and one we must \naddress. The question was whether it should be addressed through an \nattempt to alter the Constitution of the United States. There was great \ncontroversy about that. Yet, there was no disagreement about whether we \nhad a responsibility to address the fiscal policy deficits. We have \naddressed them. We need to do more. They are coming down. They have \nbeen decreased by over 60 percent. The budget deficit has been coming \ndown substantially for 4 years in a row. We have made progress, but we \nhave a ways to go.\n  But there is another deficit in this country that is not even \nwhispered about in this town or on the floor of Senate save for a \ncouple of Members who care about it and come to speak about it. That is \nthe merchandise trade deficit. That is a deficit that has not been \nreduced each of the last 4 years, as has the budget deficit.\n  This is a deficit that has been growing each of the last 4 years. \nThis is a deficit that last year was the largest in our country's \nhistory. This is a deficit that, added on top of other trade deficits \nwhich have occurred for 21 consecutive years, now stacks up to a pile \nof $2 trillion. We have nearly $2 trillion of accumulated merchandise \ntrade deficits that this country must repay some day with a lower \nstandard of living here in the United States.\n  This is the third straight year of record trade deficits. It is the \nthird straight year of new record levels in a string of 21 consecutive \nyears of trade deficits. The last trade surplus in this country was in \nthe year 1975.\n  Now, I have a chart I will show that demonstrates the fact that the \nUnited States has moved from a net creditor position to a net debtor \nposition.\n  We are the largest debtor nation in the world. This has happened in a \nvery short period of time. This shows what has happened to our \nposition. We used to export more than we imported. We now import far, \nfar more than we export. The question is, what do we import in this \ncountry?\n  This describes, of course, the yearly merchandise trade deficits, and \nthis chart has enough red on it to demonstrate where we have been and \nwhere we are going. This is a very sad picture. It cries out for a \nremedy. This is not the picture of a strong economy. This is not a road \nmap to a strong economic future.\n  The next chart shows that the U.S. imports that are coming into this \ncountry consist particularly of manufactured goods, and they make up 85 \npercent of our Nation's imports. These manufactured goods are mostly \nhigh-value goods that come from skilled labor. In fact, 75 percent of \nour trade deficit consists of high-value manufactured goods, such as \nautomobiles, auto equipment, electronics goods and telecommunications \nequipment.\n  I have another chart that shows the U.S. imports of manufactured \ngoods. You will see that we now import goods sufficient to match \nslightly over half of all that we make here. That is quite a statistic. \nYou can see the growth of it. It is almost exponential growth. Imported \nmanufactured goods as a percentage of the U.S. manufacturing gross \ndomestic product have increased from 11 percent in 1970 to 56 percent \nthis past year. As I showed from the previous chart, most of it is \nhigh-value manufactured goods.\n  If I might make a point with respect to our neighbor to the south, \nMexico. Mexico now sends us more automobiles than we ship to the rest \nof the world. Let me repeat that. Today, the United States imports more \nautomobiles from Mexico than we send to the rest of the world.\n  The next chart shows that the trade deficit we have is principally \nwith six other countries. With Japan, we have had a $50 billion to $60 \nbillion-a-year trade deficit for a long period. We now have a \nsubstantial deficit with China, amounting to nearly $40 billion. With \nCanada and Mexico, our two nearest neighbors, we have a combined \ndeficit of nearly $40 billion.\n  You can see the dilemma in this country, where we have growing trade \ndeficits with respect to Canada and Mexico and substantially growing \ntrade deficit with respect to China and long-abiding deficits with \nrespect to Japan. You can see what is happening. It is sapping the \neconomic strength of our manufacturing sector in this country.\n  Yesterday, on a radio program, the talk radio announcer said, ``I \ndon't understand, Senator Dorgan. Unemployment has come down, and our \neconomy seems strong.'' I said, ``Yes, all that seems to be the case.'' \nI know that there are neighbors, no doubt, who seem to have great-\nlooking homes, a shiny new car, maybe newly poured cement for a new \ndriveway, and they have all the latest gadgets. But you don't see their \ncredit statement. They may well be deep in debt with all that shiny new \nequipment in their garage.\n  The question is not how things appear, but what are the fundamentals \nof our economy? What does the foundation look like? The foundation of \nan economy that works and one that will grow and provide jobs in the \nfuture has a strong manufacturing sector. No country will long remain a \nworld economic power if it does not retain a strong manufacturing base.\n  I have said often--and people probably get tired of hearing it from \nme--that you cannot measure this country's economic strength, as the \neconomists so often do, by measuring what we consume every month or \nquarter. That is not a measurement of economic strength. Our economic \nstrength is measured by what we produce, not what we consume.\n  What we produce from our manufacturing sector is all too often now \nmoving. Our productive sector is moving out from our country to other \ncountries. Jobs are moving from here to\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\nthere. It weakens our country internally and weakens our manufacturing \nsector.\n  The next chart talks about trade and jobs. There has been an old \nformula--in fact, they used this formula to sell the NAFTA trade \npackage to us. They said every billion dollars in trade is the \nequivalent of 20,000 jobs. What would that mean? In 1996, our trade \ndeficit meant we had a loss of 3.8 million good jobs; 3.8 million good \njobs were lost. Just the increase in the deficit from 1995 to 1996--\nmeans another 300,000 jobs are gone. They have gone across the border, \noffshore, overseas. That is the dilemma.\n  Now, what do people say will happen to the trade deficit? We have the \nlargest trade deficit in this country's history. You can see what has \nhappened to it. It has been a steady, growing deficit. It continues to \nbe a serious problem, and now it is at record levels. Some forecasters \nsay that this deficit is going to continue to reach new record levels. \nIn fact, one expert is predicting a deficit of $354 billion by 2007.\n  You know, we must think about what these trends mean. What is this \nall about? If I might simplify it for people, let us look at Japan. \nThis is an ally of ours, a good country, a country that, by all \naccounts, has citizens who work hard and strive to compete aggressively \nin the world marketplace and do very, very well. We have become a \nsponge for much of their manufactured goods, and they make pretty good \nmanufactured goods. They are tough, shrewd international competitors.\n  But when we send a pound of T-bone steak to Tokyo, guess what? A \nNorth Dakota rancher is often out during calving time in some pretty \ntough weather. He works really hard to deal with the tasks of everyday \nlife on the ranch to care for maybe a 300-cow herd. That rancher raises \nsome beef and then markets the beef. Eventually the beef finds a \nmarket, some in this country and some we want to export. When that \nNorth Dakota rancher wants to export beef to Japan, guess what happens \nto that beef? Japan regularly slaps a 50-percent tariff on every pound \nof beef going into Japan.\n  Does anybody think that is reasonable? And this is after our \nnegotiations. It is after we have supposedly succeeded in negotiating \ndown the tariffs on beef going into Japan. We have a celebration, but \nthere still is a 50-percent tariff on T-bone steak going to Tokyo.\n  Guess what? Under any other standards of measurement, that would be \nconsidered a failure in international trade negotiations. Only because \nwe have such low expectations from those with whom we trade are we \nwilling to say that is a success. It is not a success, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  Why did we get to this position? Well, briefly, after the Second \nWorld War, our trade policy was foreign policy. Our trade policy was \nstructured on the premise that we were the biggest, the best, the most, \nthe strongest country on the face of the Earth, and we could compete \nwith almost anybody in this world with one hand tied behind our back \nand win the competition. So our trade policy with Japan and European \ncountries and others was largely foreign policy.\n  What we needed to do to at that time was to construct a trade \nrelationship with our allies that helped them? We could certainly \nafford to help them, and we felt we must help them. That was our trade \npolicy. For a quarter century it was necessary, and it worked, and \nguess what? We helped grow and nurture the restoration of post-Second-\nWorld-War economies, sufficient so that, I am pleased to say and I \nthink others would be as well, that we now have very tough, shrewd \ncompetitors in the world marketplace. They are allies, friends and, \nyes, in the market system they are competitors.\n  It is time that we understand that this country can no longer win \nwith one hand tied behind its back. It is time to understand that trade \npolicy must be more than foreign policy, and we must insist on \nreciprocal trade treatment from our allies and trading partners. We \nmust insist on not only free and open and expanded trade, but \nespecially fair trade.\n  It upsets me to discover what we negotiated in a trade agreement with \nour neighbor to the north, a wonderful country with good people in it, \nCanada. We discover what is inside. It is like peeling an onion. You \nget the layers off and figure out what is in the middle of the treaty.\n  You discover that literally hundreds of semi-trucks come south from \nCanada into our country with durum wheat and barley. These are crops \nthat we already grow in substantial surplus. Then I get in a little \ntruck--a little, 12-year-old, 2-ton orange truck--with a North Dakota \nfarmer with 220 bushels of wheat, and we go up to the Canadian border \nnear Portal, ND. And we are stopped. They say, ``What do you have in \nthe truck?'' ``We have 220 bushels of wheat.'' ``You can't go into \nCanada with wheat.'' ``Gee. We just passed 20 semitrucks coming south \ninto our marketplace with wheat.'' ``Well, that may be but you can't \ntake American wheat into Canada.''\n\n  That is the sort of thing that is fundamentally wrong with our trade \nagreements. We need fully reciprocal trade with all of our trade \nallies.\n  Let me finally in the last chart talk about what we are here to \npropose: An emergency commission to end the trade deficit. We need to \nrespond to and deal with the growing, burgeoning problem in this \ncountry. That is the record merchandise trade deficits that we face and \nthat our children and their children must repay with a lower standard \nof living. We must stop it. How do we stop it?\n  Senator Byrd, myself, and Senator Sarbanes propose that a commission \nbe impaneled that addresses the wide range of concerns: The manner in \nwhich the Government establishes and administers our trade policies and \nobjectives; the causes and consequences of the persistence and growth \nof the overall trade deficit, as well as the specific bilateral trade \ndeficits I mentioned; the relationship of United States trade deficits \nto both comparative and competitive advantages; the relationship \nbetween investment flows, both in and out of the U.S.; and, the \ndevelopment of policies and alternative strategies to end the trade \ndeficit by 2007 and improve the economic well-being of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted that Senator Byrd is on the floor \ntoday. I want to make one additional comment.\n  Those who talk about trade in public discourse here in the U.S. \nCongress and about town are generally divided into two groups. There is \nthe group that is in favor of free trade and has been for a couple of \ndecades. They are called the free traders, and they are described as \nthose with world vision, those who can see over the horizon, who have \nthe creative ability to think expansively about what our obligations \nare and what the future will be. And then there are others. They are \nclassified as the xenophobic isolationist stooges who simply don't get \nit.\n  The minute you speak about the trade problem and the trade deficit, \nthey say you are a ``protectionist,'' a ``xenophobic isolationist. That \nis who that is.''\n  I come from a State in which about half of what we produce must find \na foreign home. I am the last person that would want to create walls \naround our border. I want expanded trade. I want open trade. I want \nfree trade. But I demand that trade be fair.\n  American businesses and American workers ought to be able to expect \nthat they are going to compete in a marketplace that is a fair \nmarketplace. They should not be expected to compete against a 14-year-\nold that works 14 hours a day and is paid 14 cents an hour in some \nforeign factory producing a good that is then shipped to Fargo, \nPittsburgh, or Denver. That is not fair trade, and American workers \nought not to expect that.\n  We simply say there is a chronic and growing problem that ought to be \naddressed. We propose that an emergency commission be impaneled to end \nthe trade deficit and make recommendations on how to do it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \n        Feinstein and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 466. A bill to reduce gun trafficking by prohibiting bulk \npurchases of handguns; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  THE ANTI-GUN TRAFFICKING ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto stop the growing gun violence and death associated with interstate \ngun trafficking.\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\n  Recently, the scourge of gun violence invaded all of our homes, when \na madman opened fire on innocent tourists atop the Empire State \nBuilding. When the shooting stopped, one person was dead, and six were \ninjured. One of the victims was 27-year-old Matthew Gross of Montclair, \nNJ. Matthew Gross was shot in the head, and lingered in a coma, \nconnected to a ventilator, for 8 agonizing days. Thankfully, this \ncourageous young man has come out of the coma and is beginning the long \nand arduous task of recovery.\n  Mr. President, this gun violence must stop. It is too easy to obtain \na gun in America. This morning, I stood with Matthew's father and \nbrother and we all committed ourselves to intensify the fight against \ngun violence. Because Matthew Gross wasn't only a victim of a disturbed \ngunman. He was a victim of the epidemic of gun violence. Reducing this \nviolence must be a top national priority.\n  Today, Mr. President, I am introducing the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act, \nto reduce interstate gun trafficking by prohibiting bulk purchases of \nhandguns. The bill would prohibit the purchase of more than one handgun \nduring any 30-day period. I am joined in this effort by Senators \nKennedy, John Kerry, Feinstein, and Torricelli.\n  Mr. President, no one needs more than one gun a month. In New Jersey, \nwe have banned assault weapons, and we have established strict \npermitting requirements for handgun purchases. Yet the effectiveness of \nthese restrictions is substantially diminished because the controls in \nother States are far less strict.\n  Unfortunately, many gun traffickers make bulk purchases of handguns \nin States with weak firearm laws, and then transport them to other \nStates with tougher laws for illegal sale on the streets. This has \nhelped spread the plague of gun violence nationwide. And without \nFederal limits, there is little that any one State can do about it.\n  A few years ago, Mr. President, the State of Virginia enacted \nlegislation designed to prevent gunrunners from buying large quantities \nof handguns in Virginia for export to other States. Under that State \nlaw, as under my proposal, handgun purchases are limited to one per \nmonth. This Virginia statute has proven to be very effective in \ncontrolling gun trafficking from Virginia.\n  Before the ban, Virginia had become the firearm supermarket of the \nEast Coast. It supplied more than 40 percent of the guns used in crimes \nin New York City. But under the new legislation, the results were \ndramatic. The percentage of guns traced back to Virginia gun dealers \nfell by 61 percent for guns recovered in New York, 67 percent for guns \nrecovered in Massachusetts, and 38 percent for guns recovered in New \nJersey.\n  Mr. President, Virginia's experience suggests that a ban on bulk \npurchases can substantially reduce gunrunning. However, to be truly \neffective, such a limit must be enacted nationwide. Otherwise, \ngunrunners will simply move their operations to other States. The only \nway to close down the ``iron pipeline'' is to plug it up at all ends.\n  The Anti-Gun Trafficking Act will impose such a nationwide limit on \nbulk gun purchases. I do not claim this restriction would end all \nhandgun violence. And, personally, I don't see why anyone needs even 12 \nguns a year. However, it is a reasonable and modest step in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, a one-gun-a-month law would take a bite out of \ngunrunning without imposing any burden on hunters and other law-abiding \ngun users. After all, who but gang members, drug dealers, and other \ncriminals needs more than 12 guns a year? Law abiding citizens are made \nsafer by limiting the number of firearms available for purchase at one \ntime.\n  Mr. President, this is a sensible approach, and one which will help \nto make our families, our streets, our communities, and our country \nsafer. I urge my colleagues to support restrictions on bulk purchases \non handguns and to join in cosponsoring ``One Gun a Month.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 466\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prevent discrimination against victims of abuse in \nall lines of insurance; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               victims of abuse insurance protection act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues and original cosponsors Senator Ron Wyden, Senator Patty \nMurray, and Senator Byron Dorgan in reintroducing the Victims of Abuse \nInsurance Protection Act, legislation that will outlaw discrimination \nby insurance companies against the victims of domestic violence in all \nlines of insurance. Congressman Bernie Sanders is introducing an \nidentical bill in the House this week.\n  With this legislation, we are trying to correct an abhorrent practice \nby many insurance companies--the denial of coverage to battered women. \nIt is plain, old-fashioned discrimination. It is profoundly unjust and \nwrong. And, it is the worst of blaming the victim. Denying women access \nto the insurance they require to foster their mobility out of an \nabusive situation must be stopped.\n  While we were successful in including language in the Kassebaum-\nKennedy law which prohibits insurers from denying insurance because the \napplicant is a victim of abuse, insurance companies can still charge \nvictims of abuse a higher rate.\n  In Minnesota, three insurance companies denied an entire women's \nshelter insurance because, as a battered women's shelter, we were high \nrisk. The Women's Shelter in Rochester, MN, was told that it was \nconsidered uninsurable because its employees are almost all battered \nwomen.\n  Another shelter in rural Minnesota purchased a car so that women and \nchildren in danger who were trying to leave an abusive situation could \nuse this anonymous vehicle and thus the abuser could not track their \nautomobile to find them. The shelter could not find a company to \nprovide them with automobile insurance once the companies knew of the \nrisks surrounding battered women.\n  A woman in Iowa named Sandra was denied life insurance after the \ncompany found out that she had been beaten up twice. In one incident, \nshe had\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\nbeen so badly beaten by an ex-boyfriend that her cheekbones were \nsplintered, and one of her eyes had to be put back in its socket. Her \nmother, Mary, was the one who originally applied for the life insurance \npolicy, explaining, ``I didn't ask for a lot of coverage. I just wanted \nto apply for $1,000 coverage, just enough that if something happened, \nGod forbid, that we could at least bury her.''\n  Mary was angry about the denial, so she wrote to State officials and \nthe Iowa insurance commissioner's office tried to intervene on their \nbehalf. In four separate letters, the insurance company officials \nstated they denied the coverage because of a history of assaults. In \none letter they defended their decision by citing numerous documents \nwhich showed that people involved in domestic violence incidents are at \na higher risk of death and injury than others, and, therefore, not a \ngood risk.\n  There are, unfortunately, many other instances of victims of domestic \nabuse being denied fire insurance, homeowners insurance, life \ninsurance, and health insurance--denied because they were victims of a \ncrime.\n  This bill goes a long way toward treating domestic violence as the \ncrime that it is--not a voluntary risky behavior that can be easily \nchanged and not as a pre-existing condition. Insurance company policies \nthat deny coverage to victims only serve to perpetuate the myth that \nvictims are responsible for their abuse.\n  In order to address the practice of insurers using domestic violence \nas a basis for determining whom to cover and how much to charge with \nrespect to health, life, disability, homeowners, and auto insurance, \nthis legislation prohibits insurance companies from discriminating \nagainst victims in any of the following ways:\n  First, denying or terminating insurance; second, limiting coverage or \ndenying claims; third, charging higher premiums; or fourth, terminating \nhealth coverage for victims of abuse in situations where coverage was \noriginally issued in the abuser's name, and acts of the abuser would \ncause the victim to lose coverage.\n  This legislation also keeps victims' information confidential by \nprohibiting insurers from improperly using, disclosing, or transferring \nabuse-related information for any purpose unrelated to the direct \nprovision of health care services.\n  Insurance companies should not be allowed to discriminate against \nanyone for being a victim of domestic violence. We may never know the \nfull extent of the problem, but it is a grossly unfair practice and \nshould be prohibited.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 467\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Victims of Abuse Insurance \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

For group \n     insurance, such term includes a person who is a beneficiary \n     covered by a group policy, certificate, or health benefit \n     plan. For life insurance, the term refers to the person whose \n     life is covered under an insurance policy.\n       (7) Insurer.--The term ``insurer'' means any person, \n     reciprocal exchange, interinsurer, Lloyds insurer, fraternal \n     benefit society, or other legal entity engaged in the \n     business of insurance, including agents, brokers, adjusters, \n     and third party administrators.

DISCRIMINATORY ACTS PROHIBITED.\n\n       (a) In General.--No insurer or health carrier may, directly \n     or indirectly, engage in any of the following acts or \n     practices on the basis that the applicant or insured, or any \n     person employed by the applicant or insured or with whom the \n     applicant or insured is known to have a relationship or \n     association, is, has been, or may be the subject of abuse:\n       (1) Denying, refusing to issue, renew or reissue, or \n     canceling or otherwise terminating an insurance policy or \n     health benefit plan.\n       (2) Restricting, excluding, or limiting insurance or health \n     benefit plan coverage for losses incurred as a result of \n     abuse or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result \n     of abuse, except as otherwise permitted or required by State \n     laws relating to life insurance beneficiaries.\n       (3) Adding a premium differential to any insurance policy \n     or health benefit plan.\n       (4) Terminating health coverage for a subject of abuse \n     because coverage was originally issued in the name of the \n     abuser and the abuser has divorced, separated from, or lost \n     custody of the subject of abuse or the abuser's coverage has \n     terminated voluntarily or involuntarily and the subject of \n     abuse does not qualify for extension of coverage under part 6 \n     of subtitle B of title I or the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1161 et seq.) or 4980B of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Nothing in this paragraph \n     prohibits the insurer from requiring the subject of abuse to \n     pay the full premium for the subject's coverage under the \n     health plan if the requirements are applied to all insureds \n     of the health carrier. The insurer may terminate group \n     coverage after the continuation coverage required by this \n     paragraph has been in force for 18 months if it offers \n     conversion to an equivalent individual plan. The continuation \n     of health coverage required by this paragraph shall be \n     satisfied by any extension of coverage under part 6 of \n     subtitle B of title I or the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1161 et seq.) or 4980B of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provided to a subject of abuse \n     and is not intended to be in addition to any extension of \n     coverage provided under part 6 of subtitle B of title I or \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 \n     U.S.C. 1161 et seq.) or 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n       (b) Use of Information.--\n       (1) In general.--No person employed by or contracting with \n     an insurer or health benefit plan may use, disclose, or \n     transfer information relating to an applicant's or insured's \n     abuse status or abuse-related medical condition or the \n     applicant's or insured's status as a family member, employer, \n     or associate,\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\n     person in a relationship with a subject of abuse for any \n     purpose unrelated to the direct provision of health care \n     services unless such use, disclosure, or transfer is required \n     by an order of an entity with authority to regulate insurance \n     or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In \n     addition, such a person may not disclose or transfer \n     information relating to an applicant's or insured's location \n     or telephone number. Nothing in this paragraph shall be \n     construed as limiting or precluding a subject of abuse from \n     obtaining the subject's own insurance records from an \n     insurer.\n       (2) Authority of subject of abuse.--A subject of abuse, at \n     the absolute discretion of the subject of abuse, may provide \n     evidence of abuse to an insurer for the limited purpose of \n     facilitating treatment of an abuse-related condition or \n     demonstrating that a condition is abuse-related. Nothing in \n     this paragraph shall be construed as authorizing an insurer \n     or health carrier to disregard such provided evidence.\n\n     SEC. 4. INSURANCE PROTOCOLS FOR SUBJECTS OF ABUSE.\n\n       Insurers shall develop and adhere to written policies \n     specifying procedures to be followed by employees, \n     contractors, producers, agents and brokers for the purpose of \n     protecting the safety and privacy of a subject of abuse and \n     otherwise implementing the provisions of this Act when taking \n     an application, investigating a claim, or taking any other \n     action relating to a policy or claim involving a subject of \n     abuse.\n\n     SEC. 5. REASONS FOR ADVERSE ACTIONS.\n\n       An insurer that takes an action that adversely affects a \n     subject of abuse, shall advise the subject of abuse applicant \n     or insured of the specific reasons for the action in writing. \n     Reference to general underwriting practices or guidelines \n     does not constitute a specific reason.\n\n     SEC. 6. LIFE INSURANCE.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a life \n     insurer from declining to issue a life insurance policy if \n     the applicant or prospective owner of the policy is or would \n     be designated as a beneficiary of the policy, and if--\n       (1) the applicant or prospective owner of the policy lacks \n     an insurable interest in the insured; or\n       (2) the applicant or prospective owner of the policy is \n     known, on the basis of police or court records, to have \n     committed an act of abuse against the proposed insured.\n\n     SEC. 7. SUBROGATION WITHOUT CONSENT PROHIBITED.\n\n       Subrogation of claims resulting from abuse is prohibited \n     without the informed consent of the subject of abuse.\n\n     SEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Federal Trade Commission.--The Federal Trade Commission \n     shall have the power to examine and investigate any insurer \n     to determine whether such insurer has been or is engaged in \n     any act or practice prohibited by this Act. If the Federal \n     Trade Commission determines an insurer has been or is engaged \n     in any act or practice prohibited by this Act, the Commission \n     may take action against such insurer by the issuance of a \n     cease and desist order as if the insurer was in violation of \n     section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Such cease and \n     desist order may include any individual relief warranted \n     under the circumstances, including temporary, preliminary, \n     and permanent injunctive and compensatory relief.\n       (b) Private Cause of Action.--An applicant or insured who \n     believes that the applicant or insured has been adversely \n     affected by an act or practice of an insurer in violation of \n     this Act may maintain an action against the insurer in a \n     Federal or State court of original jurisdiction. Upon proof \n     of such conduct by a preponderance of the evidence, the court \n     may award appropriate relief, including temporary, \n     preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief and compensatory \n     and punitive damages, as well as the costs of suit and \n     reasonable fees for the aggrieved individual's attorneys and \n     expert witnesses. With respect to compensatory damages, the \n     aggrieved individual may elect, at any time prior to the \n     rendering of final judgment, to recover in lieu of actual \n     damages, an award of statutory damages in the amount of \n     $5,000 for each violation.\n\n     SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall apply with respect to any action taken on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, except that \n     section 4 shall only apply to actions taken after the \n     expiration of 60 days after such date.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ncolleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, in introducing the Victims \nof Abuse Insurance Protection Act. I believe that every Senator in this \nChamber should join in support of this important legislation.\n  The Victims of Abuse Insurance Protection Act will prohibit \ndiscrimination by insurance companies against victims of domestic \nviolence. This prohibition will apply to all lines of insurance \nincluding health, life, and homeowners.\n  We are all proud of our efforts to increase our commitment to ending \ndomestic violence. The Federal Government has dramatically increased \nresources to fighting this devastating public health threat. We have \nworked to strengthen enforcement of domestic violence laws and ensure \nthat victims have access to the resources and assistance necessary to \nend the cycle of violence. However, the first step for most victims is \nreporting the violence and removing themselves from the violent \nsituation. But, if a victim of domestic violence knows that by \nreporting and seeking help they have now accepted the fact that they \nwill face discriminatory practices in when they try to secure any form \nof insurance, fewer victims will come forward. This is a chilling \nconsequence that we cannot allow.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is a real threat. I have been \napproached by an insurance agent in Washington State who told me that \nshe cannot sell life insurance to victims of domestic violence. I also \nknow of women who are unable to afford adequate homeowners insurance \nbecause of past domestic violence. This is an outrage and runs counter \nto all that is fair and decent. This is a classic example of blaming \nthe victim.\n  As a strong advocate of ending domestic violence, I cannot sit by and \nwatch insurance companies deny victims insurance or impose such drastic \ncost barriers that few could overcome. I am appalled by this type of \ndiscrimination and extremely concerned about the impact it has on our \nefforts to combat domestic violence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 468. A bill to continue the successful Federal role in developing \na national intermodal surface transportation system, through programs \nthat ensure the safe and efficient movement of people and goods, \nimprove economic productivity, preserve the environment, and strengthen \npartnerships among all levels of the government and the private sector, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n the national economic crossroad transportation efficiency act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing, along with my \ncolleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, the National Economic \nCrossroad Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, referred to as NEXTEA. \nNEXTEA is the Clinton administration's legislative proposal for the \nreauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct.\n  I am introducing NEXTEA because it builds upon the landmark ISTEA \nlegislation. It emphasizes environmental protection, system \npreservation, safety, and intermodalism. I would like to encourage my \ncolleagues to take a serious look at this proposal.\n  In addition, I will be a cosponsor of the ISTEA Reauthorization Act \nof 1997, a bill that has been written by Senators Moynihan, Lieberman, \nand Lautenberg which will be introduced in the near future. This \nproposal also builds upon the program structure and emphasis of the \noriginal ISTEA.\n  Today's introduction does not mean that I endorse all the ideas in \nthe administration's proposal. I am still in the process of reviewing \nthe bill's details and plan to ask the administration questions about \ntheir provisions and the thinking behind some of their proposals.\n  Of particular interest to my colleagues is whether my introduction of \nthe administration's bill indicates my endorsement of the \nadministration's formula for distributing funds among the States. It \ndoes not.\n  The administration's formula relies to a great extent on the \ncontributions paid into the highway trust fund by the individual \nStates. I have serious concerns about setting national policy on the \nbasis of where gasoline is purchased. The Federal Highway \nAdministration's estimate of the highway trust fund contributions is \nbased upon where gasoline is purchased, not even where it is used. Let \nme give a couple of examples of the problems I see with this misplaced \nfocus.\n  If you buy gas in Baltimore, MD, and drive to Woonsocket, RI, you \nwill drive through the States of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, \nConnecticut, and Rhode Island. Maryland will be the only State that \ngets credit for this trip.\n  Even if we were better able to estimate where gasoline is used, \nrather than just where it is purchased, setting national transportation \npolicy on gasoline usage provides incentives that contradict policies \nof ISTEA such as environmental protection, intermodalism,\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\nand efficiency. Under a gas tax-based formula, States and localities \nthat use transit significantly or use less gasoline because of good \nplanning are actually penalized for their good work.\n  For example, programs or policies that encourage any of the following \nwould be penalized: Shifting highway usage to other modes such as \ntransit, greater use of carpooling and High Occupancy Vehicle [HOV] \nlanes, progressive land use planning, and the use of alternative fuels, \nor electric vehicles. In other words, ``no good deed, goes unpunished'' \nunder such a national policy.\n  Gasoline taxes are an efficient and low-cost way of raising revenue \nfor transportation purposes. They should not, however, be attributed a \npolicy importance that they do not deserve.\n  Let me conclude my statement by encouraging all of the Members of the \nSenate to work together as we craft an ISTEA reauthorization proposal. \nI know we have some substantial disagreements that need to be resolved.\n  As we move forward, we need to keep in mind the diversity and \nuniqueness of the country and all of its transportation needs. All of \nus must resist the temptation to set a national transportation policy \nbased solely on our own region's particular demands. The demands of the \nNortheast are different from those of the South; the demands of the \nSouth are different from those of the West. And so on.\n  We need to be cognizant of the population growth that has taken place \nin the South and Southwest and the strains that such growth has put on \nareas within that region. Many of the Western States, by contrast, with \ntheir low-population density and the great distances involved in \ntravel, rely on highways as the major mode of transportation. We also \nneed to acknowledge the uniqueness of the Northeast United States; its \nolder infrastructure and acute congestion make it more dependent on \nnonhighway modes such as transit and Amtrak. Attempts to pass a new \nbill by forming alliances along regional lines will fail unless the \nbill recognizes the needs of all regions.\n  I am hopeful that the ISTEA reauthorization will build upon the \nstrong record of its predecessor. Admittedly, the transition from old \npolicies and practices to those embodied in ISTEA has not always been \neasy, and more work needs to be done. However, we should not let these \nbumps in the road cause us to retreat from the progress we have made.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nsummary be printed in the Record.\n\n\n                      SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS\n\n     Sec. 1. Short Title; Secretary Defined; Table of Contents\n       This section designates the title of this legislation as \n     the ``National Economic Crossroads Transportation Efficiency \n     Act of 1997,'' defines ``Secretary'' as the Secretary of \n     Transportation, and lists the table of contents for this \n     legislation.\n\n\n                    TITLE I--SURFACE TRANSPORTATION\n\n     Sec. 1001. Short Title; Authorization of Appropriations\n       This section designates title 1 of this bill as the \n     ``Surface Transportation Act of 1997.'' This section also \n     authorizes sums out of the Highway Trust Fund (other than the \n     Mass Transit Account) for the National Highway System, the \n     Interstate maintenance program, the surface transportation \n     program, the congestion mitigation and air quality \n     improvement program, the highway bridge replacement and \n     rehabilitation program, the Federal Lands Highways program, \n     the infrastructure safety program, the integrated safety \n     fund, the national recreational trails program, and \n     university transportation centers.\n       Authorizations for other highway trust-funded programs not \n     included in this section are included in the legislative \n     provisions authorizing the programs themselves, such as \n     Federal Highway Administration's research and technology, \n     Intelligent Transportation Systems, and motor carrier safety \n     programs.\n       Paragraph (5) establishes a $17 million annual take-down \n     from HBRRP apportionments to fund the alteration of bridges \n     determined to be unreasonable obstructions to navigation \n     under the Truman Hobbs Bridge Act, 33 U.S.C. 511-524, and \n     requires the Secretary to transfer such sums (contract \n     authority), an amount of obligation authority equal to 100 \n     percent of such contract authority, and the responsibility \n     for administering such sums to the United States Coast Guard. \n     These sums are to be administered in accordance with the \n     Truman Hobbs Bridge Act, rather than the HBRRP.\n     Sec. 1002. Definitions\n       This section revises the current definition of \n     ``operational improvement'' found in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) to \n     expressly include the installation, operation, or maintenance \n     of certain Intelligent Transportation Systems infrastructure \n     projects, and the installation or operation of communications \n     systems, roadway weather information and prediction systems, \n     and other such improvements designated by the Secretary that \n     enhance roadway safety during adverse weather. This language \n     expands the definition of operational improvement to include \n     operation and maintenance expenses for public ITS \n     infrastructure projects, since these activities are integral \n     to and inseparable from the installation of the associated \n     infrastructure. Operational improvement projects continue to \n     be eligible for National Highway System (NHS) and surface \n     transportation program (STP) apportionments under the revised \n     NHS and STP provisions of this Act.\n     Sec. 1003. National Highway System\n       Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) amend 23 U.S.C. 103(i) to expand \n     NHS eligibility to make publicly owned intercity passenger \n     rail capital projects eligible for NHS funds under the same \n     criteria that currently apply to transit and non-NHS highway \n     projects under 23 U.S.C. 103(i)(3).\n       Paragraph (a)(3) amends paragraph 103(i)(13) to expand NHS \n     funding eligibility to include natural habitat mitigation \n     under the same circumstances in which wetlands mitigation is \n     currently eligible for funding under this paragraph.\n       Paragraph (a)(4) amends section 103 by adding two new items \n     to the list of projects generally eligible for NHS funding: \n     publicly owned intracity or intercity passenger rail or bus \n     terminals and publicly owned intermodal surface freight \n     transfer facilities, other than seaports and airports, where \n     such terminals and facilities are located at or adjacent to \n     the NHS or connections to the NHS; and infrastructure-based \n     Intelligent Transportation Systems capital improvements.\n       This paragraph also adds to the list of eligible NHS \n     projects a paragraph applicable only to projects on the \n     Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands. The Federal-aid highway funds \n     provided to these territories are NHS funds, and therefore, \n     in amending the list of NHS-eligible projects under section \n     103, new paragraph 103(i)(16) permits these territories to \n     use their entire Federal-aid highway apportionments for any \n     STP-eligible project, any airport, and any seaport. This \n     greatly increases the territories' ability to craft the most \n     appropriate solution to their transportation needs, \n     regardless of transportation mode.\n       Paragraph (a)(5) amends section 103 by adding a definition \n     of ``intermodal surface freight transfer facilities.'' Under \n     this definition, this term would include: any access road, \n     parking or staging area, ramp, loading or unloading area and \n     equipment, rail yard, track, and interest in land, publicly-\n     owned rail access line to a seaport, and publicly owned \n     access road to a seaport, if they are used to effect the \n     transfer of freight.\n       Because Congress has enacted legislation designating the \n     National Highway System, subsection (b) amends section 103 to \n     strike all out-of-date references to the States, local \n     officials, and the Secretary working cooperatively to develop \n     and submit to Congress a proposed National Highway System; \n     the requirement that Congress must enact a law designating \n     the National Highway System; the requirement for the \n     equitable allocation of highway mileage on the National \n     Highway System among the States; and the interim National \n     Highway System. Subsection (b) also makes several conforming \n     changes to section 103 to reflect the removal of these NHS \n     designation provisions from this section. Subsection (b) also \n     adds a new paragraph to subsection 103(b) to provide \n     congressional approval of the Department's submission of NHS \n     intermodal connectors.\n     Sec. 1004. Apportionments\n       Subsection (a) of this section revises 23 U.S.C. 104(a) to \n     more accurately reflect the program authorizations from which \n     the Secretary may deduct to fund the administration of the \n     Federal-aid highway program and surface transportation \n     research.\n       Subsection (b) of this section amends 23 U.S.C. 104(b) by \n     revising the current formulas for the National Highway \n     System, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement \n     program (CMAQ), and surface transportation program (STP) \n     apportionments.\n\n                      NHS and STP Program Formulas\n\n       Revised paragraph 104(b)(1) provides that NHS funds shall \n     be apportioned in each fiscal year, on or after October 1, \n     according to the following factors:\n       75 percent according to each State's annual contributions \n     to the Highway Trust Fund (excluding the Mass Transit \n     Account) as a percent of the total annual contributions to \n     the Highway Trust Fund (excluding Mass Transit) by all States \n     (using the latest available data);\n       15 percent according to each State's annual commercial \n     vehicle contributions to the Highway Trust Fund (excluding \n     the Mass Transit Account) as a percent of the total annual \n     commercial vehicle contributions to the Highway Trust Fund \n     (excluding Mass Transit) by all States (using the latest \n     available data). Commercial vehicle contributions to the \n     Highway Trust Fund include Federal diesel fuel taxes, the \n     Federal heavy vehicle use tax, the Federal truck and trailer \n     excise tax, and the Federal truck tire tax (using the latest \n     available data); and\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\n       10 percent according to each State's public road mileage as \n     a percent of the total public road mileage for all States \n     (using the latest available data);\n       With the guarantee that each State's annual apportionments \n     will equal no less than one-half of one percent (0.5 percent) \n     of the total annual apportioned NHS funds.\n       Revised paragraph 104(b)(3) provides that STP funds shall \n     be apportioned according to the following factors:\n       70 percent according to each State's annual contributions \n     to the Highway Trust Fund (excluding the Mass Transit \n     Account) as a percent of the total annual contributions to \n     the Highway Trust Fund (excluding Mass Transit) by all States \n     (using the latest available data); and\n       30 percent according to each State's total population as a \n     percent of the total population of the United States (using \n     the latest available annual data);\n       With the guarantee that each State's annual apportionments \n     will equal no less than one-half of one percent (0.5 percent) \n     of the total annual apportioned STP funds.\n\n                              CMAQ Formula\n\n       The existing CMAQ formula at 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(2) is based \n     on two factors: the population living in ozone nonattainment \n     areas within each State and the severity of that ozone \n     pollution. For increasing levels of severity, an additional \n     weighting factor is applied to the nonattainment area \n     population, rising from 1.0 for the least severe to 1.5 for \n     the most severe ozone air pollution. If an ozone \n     nonattainment area is also nonattainment for carbon monoxide, \n     it receives an additional weighting factor of 1.2. Under the \n     NHS Designation Act of 1995, CMAQ apportionment factors \n     (including the nonattainment area population and the severity \n     level, or ``classification'') were frozen as they were in \n     1994 to hold CMAQ funding levels even for States whose \n     nonattainment areas were redesignated to attainment and thus \n     dropped out of the apportionment formula.\n       In subparagraphs 104(b)(2) (A) and (B), the basic formula \n     would remain the same, however additional funding would be \n     apportioned to States with particulate matter pollution and \n     additional consideration would be given to carbon monoxide \n     pollution. Also, a new weighting factor is employed for those \n     areas that have redesignated to attainment, or ``maintenance \n     areas''. They would be given a 1.0 weighting factor and all \n     other ozone nonattainment areas would be bumped up, ranging \n     from a factor of 1.1 to 1.5.\n       In subparagraph 104(b)(2)(D), any additional area newly \n     designated as nonattainment as a result of a change in the \n     national ambient air quality standards that has submitted to \n     EPA a State implementation plan will have its population \n     included in the CMAQ apportionment formula with a weighting \n     factor of 1.0.\n       To ensure that no State will receive less in CMAQ funding \n     as a result of a redistribution of funds caused by the new \n     standards, new subparagraph 104(b)(2)(E) provides such sums \n     as necessary from the surface transportation program before \n     STP funds are apportioned, to hold States harmless.\n\n                  National Recreational Trails Program\n\n       Subsection (c) of this section amends 23 U.S.C. 104(h) to \n     establish the formula to be used in apportioning funds \n     authorized to be appropriated for carrying out the National \n     Recreational Trails Program. In paragraph 104(h)(1), the \n     Secretary is directed to deduct, from the sums authorized to \n     carry out this program, an amount to cover the cost of \n     administering the Recreational Trails Program, the cost of \n     research under that program, and the cost of administering \n     the Federal Recreational Trails Advisory Committee. Paragraph \n     104(h)(1) also limits this amount to three percent or less of \n     the sums authorized. Paragraph 104(h)(2) delineates the \n     manner in which the Secretary is to apportion among the \n     States the remainder of the sums authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out the Recreational Trails Program. \n     Subparagraph 104(h)(2)(A) provides that the Secretary is to \n     apportion fifty percent of the remainder of the authorized \n     sums equally among the States eligible for funding under the \n     Recreational Trails Program. Subparagraph 104(h)(2)(B) \n     directs the Secretary to apportion the other fifty percent \n     among the eligible States in amounts proportionate to the \n     degree to which non-highway recreational fuel was used in \n     each such State during the preceding year.\n\n                     Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge\n\n       Subsection (d) of this section amends 23 U.S.C. 104(i) to \n     authorize funding for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, to \n     remain available until expended, for the rehabilitation of \n     the existing Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge and for the costs \n     related to construction of a new bridge. The design of the \n     new bridge will be based on the design selected by the \n     Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge Coordination Committee, and \n     no actual construction contracts can be let until \n     ownership of the bridge is transferred to the Woodrow \n     Wilson Memorial Bridge Authority. The requirements for \n     design selection and transfer of ownership were \n     established by the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge \n     Authority Act of 1995. Construction of the new bridge \n     shall be administered in accordance with Federal \n     Acquisition Regulations.\n       Subsection (e) of this section adds a new subsection, (k), \n     to section 104, recodifying current subsection 134(k) with \n     one significant revision. New subsection 104(k) establishes a \n     process for transferring and administering transit funds made \n     available for highway projects and highway funds made \n     available for transit projects. This subsection has been \n     revised to expressly provide for program-wide transfers of \n     funds and a like amount of obligation authority, where the \n     current subsection only provides for the project-by-projects \n     transfer of funds. This subsection also provides for program-\n     wide transfers of highway and transit funds to Amtrak and \n     other eligible rail projects.\n\n\n                      Audits of Highway Trust Fund\n\n       Subsection (f) permits the Secretary to reimburse the \n     Department of Transportation's Inspector General for the cost \n     of conducting annual financial statement audits of the \n     Highway Trust Fund in accordance with the Chief Financial \n     Officers Act of 1990.\n\n\n                           Equity Adjustments\n\n       Subsections (g) and (h) of this legislation revise and \n     rename the current minimum allocation provision of title 23. \n     As revised, 23 U.S.C. 157(a)(1) provides that each State \n     shall receive at least 90 of its annual contributions to the \n     Highway Trust Fund (excluding the Mass Transit Account) as a \n     percent of total annual contributions to the Highway Trust \n     Fund (excluding Mass Transit) by all States (using the latest \n     available data.) Such adjustment shall only apply to funds \n     apportioned under the following programs: Interstate \n     maintenance, National Highway System, bridge, surface \n     transportation program/enhancements, congestion mitigation \n     and air quality improvement, metropolitan planning, and \n     infrastructure safety.\n       Paragraph 157(a)(2) provides that for fiscal years 1998 \n     through 2003, each State except Alaska shall receive at least \n     90 percent of the funds apportioned to that State in the \n     preceding fiscal year, including equity adjustments, but \n     excluding State percentage guarantee amounts. Alaska shall \n     receive at least 90 percent of its previous year's \n     apportionments in fiscal year 1998 and 100 percent of each \n     preceding year's apportionments for each of fiscal years 1999 \n     through 2003.\n     Sec. 1005. State Percentage Guarantee\n       Similar to the hold harmless provision (subsection 1015(a)) \n     of ISTEA, this section establishes levels for annual \n     apportionments such that each State is guaranteed to receive \n     at least a certain percentage of total apportionments for \n     each year for the NHS, CMAQ, STP, IM, bridge, infrastructure \n     safety, both equity adjustments in section 157, and \n     Interstate reimbursement programs. Each State's STP \n     apportionment would be increased or decreased as necessary \n     each year to ensure that the total amount of specified \n     apportionments at least equals the percentage specified in \n     this section for every State.\n     Sec. 1006. Project Approval and Oversight\n       This section revises 23 U.S.C. 106, concerning Federal and \n     State responsibilities for projects funded under title 23.\n       Paragraph (a)(1) of this section retitles section 106 from \n     ``Plans, Specifications, and Estimates'' to ``Project \n     Approval and Oversight'' to reflect the greater scope of this \n     section, as revised.\n       Paragraph (a)(2) of this section redesignates subsection \n     106(e) and (f) as 106(f) and (g), respectively.\n       Paragraph (a)(3) of this section strikes current \n     subsections 106(a), (b), (c), and (d) and replaces them with \n     five new subsections. While several of the provisions of \n     these four subsections have been incorporated into this \n     revised section, the 15 percent limit on estimates for \n     construction engineering, found in current subsection 106(c), \n     has not been included in this new section. Striking current \n     subsection 106(c) eliminates this outdated provision that has \n     been found to be flawed for several reasons. It is burdensome \n     to both the States and the Secretary to collect and maintain \n     the data necessary to monitor States' compliance with this \n     provision. Also, because this is only a limit on aggregate \n     (State-wide) construction engineering costs, it is \n     ineffective at controlling such costs on any individual \n     project. Also, this provision has been found to be \n     unnecessary because the benefits of limiting construction \n     engineering costs are uncertain, and an argument can be made \n     that such a limit could potentially affect the quality of the \n     project. Without this limit, States can be reimbursed for \n     their actual costs of construction engineering for each \n     project without having to compile the costs of construction \n     engineering in an annual accounting to see if the costs are, \n     on average, within the 15 percent limitation.\n       New subsection 106(a) combines the current two-step process \n     for project approval and execution of a project agreement \n     into a process where both actions are taken concurrently, by \n     merging the provisions of current subsection 106(a) with \n     current subsection 110(a). Current subsection 106(a) provides \n     for the Secretary's approval of plans, specifications, and \n     estimates that a State submits for approval. The Secretary's \n     approval constitutes an obligation of the Federal government \n     to pay the Federal share of the cost of the project. Current \n     subsection 110(a) provides for the execution of a project \n     agreement that formalizes the conditions of the project \n     approval. Execution of the project agreement typically occurs \n     at a time later than the time of project approval (usually \n     after contract bids are received). In merging these current \n     provisions for project approval, execution of the project \n     agreement, and obligation of Federal funds into a single \n     process, this subsection would greatly simplify these \n     procedures.\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\n       New subsection 106(b) combines the project agreement \n     provisions from current subsections 110(a) and (b) into one \n     subsection. This new subsection states that the project \n     agreement shall specify the State's pro rata share of project \n     costs and provides that the Secretary may rely on the \n     State's representations of arrangements or agreements made \n     by the State with local officials, where projects are to \n     be constructed at the expense of, or in cooperation with, \n     local agencies.\n       New subsection 106(c) parallels current subsection 117(a) \n     and covers the conditions governing the Secretary's \n     responsibilities for oversight of projects funded under title \n     23, and how those responsibilities may be discharged. New \n     paragraph 106(c)(1) permits the Secretary to discharge to the \n     State the Secretary's responsibilities under title 23 for the \n     design, plans, specifications, estimates, contract awards, \n     and inspection of projects on the National Highway System \n     (NHS). The intent of this paragraph is to provide significant \n     flexibility to the States and the Secretary to discuss and \n     mutually determine the appropriate balance between State and \n     Federal (FHWA) oversight for Federal-aid highway projects, \n     taking into account overall needs and resources. A threshold \n     of responsibility for the States is ensured in that this \n     paragraph provides that the Secretary's responsibilities \n     under this provision shall be no greater than they are under \n     current law, unless differently agreed upon by the Secretary \n     and the State. The oversight agreement to be reached by the \n     Secretary and the State could be based on the scope and \n     complexity of NHS projects or other criteria determined \n     significant by a State. The agreement could also take into \n     account different levels of Federal oversight on NHS \n     projects: from a detailed review of all project actions to a \n     process review/product evaluation approach. Under new \n     paragraph 106(c)(2), the State must assume the Secretary's \n     responsibilities under title 23 for oversight of projects off \n     of the National Highway System.\n       New subsection 106(d) is meant to be substantively the same \n     as current subsection 117(e). This language clarifies that, \n     in discharging responsibilities to the States under new \n     section 106, the Secretary is discharging only those title 23 \n     responsibilities listed in this section. The Secretary may \n     not discharge any other Secretarial responsibilities under \n     any other Federal law, including sections 113 and 114 of \n     title 23, United States Code, the National Environmental \n     Policy Act of 1969, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n     the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Land Acquisitions \n     Policies Act of 1970, and any Federal laws administered by \n     the Department of Labor.\n       New subsection 106(e) is substantively identical to current \n     subsection 106(d); only an out-of-date reference to ``any \n     Federal-aid system'' has been updated. This subsection \n     provides that the Secretary may require that plans, \n     specifications, and estimates for proposed projects on any \n     Federal-aid highway be accompanied by a value engineering or \n     other cost reduction analysis.\n       New subsection 106(f) provides that the Secretary shall \n     require a financial plan for any project with an estimated \n     total cost of $1 billion or more.\n       Subsection (b) of this section amends title 23 by creating \n     a new subsection 109(r). New subsection 109(r) parallels a \n     provision in current paragraph 106(b)(3) governing safety \n     considerations for projects for which the State has assumed \n     the Secretary's responsibility for approving plans, \n     specifications, and estimates. This new subsection provides \n     that safety considerations for projects under this title may \n     be met by phase construction. In placing this sentence in \n     section 109, which sets forth Federal standards for all title \n     23-funded projects, this amendment permits States to use \n     phase construction to meet safety considerations on any title \n     23-funded project.\n       Subsection (c) of this section revises the provision making \n     Davis-Bacon Act wage protections applicable to highway \n     construction projects so that the scope of this provision is \n     commensurate with the scope of project eligibility under \n     title 23. That is, where the current subsection 113(a) \n     applies the Davis-Bacon Act's prevailing wage requirement to \n     laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or \n     subcontractors on the construction work performed on highway \n     projects, this revised language would extend these wage \n     protections to the same workers employed on any project \n     eligible for funding under title 23--not simply highway \n     construction projects. This subsection does not apply to \n     projects on local roads and rural minor collectors and on \n     transportation enhancement and recreational trails programs \n     not within a Federal-aid highway right-of-way or otherwise \n     linked based on proximity or impact to a Federal-aid highway.\n       Subsection (d) of this section strikes current sections 110 \n     and 117 because these sections have been incorporated into \n     the new section 106. Subsection also strikes section 105, \n     because this section is out-of-date, having been superseded \n     in by the State transportation improvement program \n     requirements of section 135, which were added by ISTEA.\n       Subsection (e) of this section makes a conforming amendment \n     to the analysis at the start of chapter 1 of title 23 to \n     reflect the new title of section 106 and to remove the items \n     relating to sections 110 and 117, which have been stricken.\n     Sec. 1007. Real Property Acquisition and Corridor \n         Preservation\n       The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n     1991 (ISTEA) placed increased emphasis on sound \n     transportation planning, including the preservation of \n     transportation corridors for future use. Ongoing efforts by \n     State and local officials to preserve such corridors can be \n     hampered when development pressures create adverse impacts on \n     affected property owners. Development, when not coordinated \n     with transportation needs, can often foreclose options \n     available to transportation officials to avoid \n     environmentally sensitive sites. Often in such cases, early \n     action and acquisition is the only way to assure that lands \n     can be obtained and reserved for future use.\n       The changes made by this section expand or modify the \n     flexibility provided to local and State governments to take \n     prudent public action to compete for land resources and \n     implement corridor preservation programs adopted through the \n     public planning process.\n       Sections 108 and 323 of 23 U.S.C. are modified to remove \n     restrictive language and out-dated programs, revise language, \n     and add opportunities for States and local governments to \n     utilize early acquisition when necessary while retaining \n     maximum flexibility to leverage the use of Federal funds.\n       Section 108 is retitled to reflect its applicability to \n     general corridor preservation programs as well as to \n     identified project right-of-way needs.\n       Subsection 108(a) is revised to conform with the new title \n     for this section and to provide that property acquisition can \n     be conducted in support of federally assisted transportation \n     improvements and is not limited to Federal-aid highways. \n     States can use any apportioned funds for land acquisition, \n     but the action must be supported by their approved \n     transportation program. The term ``highway department'' is \n     removed from the section to reflect the changed \n     organizational environment and the move to multi-modal \n     planning processes.\n       Subsection 108(c) is revised to provide an expiration and \n     close-out period for obligations already authorized from the \n     right-of-way revolving fund. No allocations of funds have \n     been made during the last two years, and the fund is no \n     longer considered necessary to support State acquisition \n     activities. Subsection 108(c), as revised, provides that \n     credits based on conversion or reimbursements are to be \n     applied to the Highway Trust Fund rather than the revolving \n     fund.\n       Section 323 is amended to add flexibility and to provide an \n     alternative means of leveraging Federal funds apportioned to \n     each State by providing a credit based on the value of \n     publicly owned lands incorporated within a federally funded \n     project. This credit applies not only to property that has \n     been donated to the State or local government, but also other \n     property that is owned by the State or local government, so \n     long as at the time such property was acquired there was no \n     intent to avoid requirements of the Uniform Relocation \n     Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act or any \n     other Federal law. This provision is consistent with the \n     credits already permitted for donated real property and \n     services. Along with other financing options provided under \n     ISTEA (including provisions retained in 23 U.S.C. 108 \n     regarding reimbursement for property acquired in advance of \n     Federal authorizations and innovative options to establish \n     State-based funds to support early acquisitions), the \n     provisions added by this section expand the choices available \n     to State and local governments in fashioning financial \n     strategies to best serve their transportation objectives.\n     Sec. 1008. Proceeds from the Sale or Lease of Real Property\n       Current section 156 of title 23, United States Code, \n     requires States to charge fair market value for the use of \n     airspace acquired in connection with a federally funded \n     project. This section also authorizes States to retain the \n     Federal share of net income from the sale, use, or lease of \n     this airspace as long as that same amount was used by the \n     State for projects eligible for funding under title 23.\n       This section revises 23 U.S.C. 156 to expand these \n     principles regarding airspace income to apply to the net \n     income generated by a State's lease, sale, or other use of \n     all real property acquired with Federal financial assistance. \n     This reduces administrative overhead relating to property \n     management practices and simplifies such practices by \n     applying the same standard to all real property interests \n     that are acquired with Federal-aid highway funds and \n     requiring that the Federal share of any proceeds be reapplied \n     within the State to other projects eligible for funding under \n     title 23.\n     Sec. 1009. Interstate Maintenance Program\n       Subsection (a) strikes subsections 109(m) and 119(b) of \n     title 23, United States Code, to eliminate both the \n     requirement for the Secretary of Transportation to issue \n     Interstate maintenance guidelines and the requirement for \n     States to annually certify that they have a maintenance \n     program in place that is in accordance with those guidelines. \n     Subsection (a) also strikes subsection 119(e) of such title \n     to eliminate the separate Interstate System preventive \n     maintenance eligibility standard. Accordingly, Interstate \n     System preventive maintenance eligibility would be determined \n     in accordance with the general preventive maintenance \n     provision of subsection 116(d).\n       Subsection (b) amends subsection 119(c), now 119(b), to \n     expand IM eligibility to include the reconstruction of \n     Interstate highways and infrastructure-based ITS capital \n     improvements to the extent that they improve the performance \n     of the Interstate.\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\n       Subsection (c) revises subsection 119(f), now 119(d), to \n     require a State that seeks to transfer any of its IM funds to \n     its NHS or STP apportionments to annually certify that it is \n     adequately maintaining its Interstate pavement and bridges \n     and that the IM funds it seeks to transfer are in excess of \n     its needs for its Interstate pavement and bridges.\n       Subsection (d) technically amends subsection 119(a) to \n     strike an out-of-date reference to subsection 119(e).\n     Sec. 1010. Maintenance\n       Subsection (a) amends subsection 116(a) of title 23, United \n     States Code, to revise an out-of-date reference to a Federal-\n     aid highway system and to clarify when a State's duty to \n     maintain shall cease.\n       Subsection (b) adds a requirement to subsection 116(a) that \n     each State annually certify that it is maintaining its \n     Federal-aid highway projects.\n       Subsection (c) makes several technical amendments to \n     subsections 116(b) and (c).\n     Sec. 1011. Interstate 4R Discretionary Program\n       This section amends 23 U.S.C. 118(c) to reauthorize the \n     current Interstate 4R discretionary program at a level of $45 \n     million per year for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2003. \n     The eligibility, priority, and funds availability criteria \n     for this program are unchanged from current law.\n       This section also strikes paragraph 118(c)(1) to eliminate \n     an out-of-date provision. Paragraph 118(c)(1) authorized \n     funding for a set aside from Interstate construction \n     apportionments for construction projects, however, funds were \n     not authorized for the Interstate construction program after \n     fiscal year 1995.\n     Sec. 1012. Emergency Relief Program\n       Subsection (a) of this section amends 23 U.S.C. 120(e) to \n     reduce the Federal share payable on emergency relief projects \n     to 75 percent of the cost of each such project. This \n     amendment brings the Federal share requirement of the FHWA's \n     emergency relief program in line with the government-wide \n     emergency relief proposal advanced by the President. \n     Subsection (a) also amends 23 U.S.C. 120(e) to shorten the \n     time period in which States receive a 100 percent Federal \n     share of emergency relief funds to the first 30 days after a \n     disaster occurrence. ER funds can be used for eligible \n     emergency repairs done to restore essential highway traffic, \n     minimize the extent of damage, or protect the remaining \n     facility. The 100 percent Federal share requirement for \n     emergency relief projects on Federal lands and U.S. \n     territories is unchanged. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section \n     technically amends 23 U.S.C. 120 to replace an outdated \n     reference to Federal-aid highway systems.\n       Paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) strike 23 U.S.C. 125(a), \n     redesignate subsections 125(b), (c), and (d) as 125(d), (e), \n     and (f), respectively, and reorganize subsection 125(a), \n     dividing the subsection by subject matter, removing out-of-\n     date language concerning emergency relief authorizations for \n     prior years, and providing that emergency relief funds shall \n     be available until expended.\n       Paragraph (b)(4) makes conforming amendments to 125(d), as \n     so redesignated, to conform internal section references to \n     the changes made by paragraph (b)(2).\n       Paragraph (b)(5) technically corrects 125(e), as so \n     redesignated, to correct a reference to Federal-aid highways.\n     Sec. 1013. Toll Roads, Bridges, Tunnels, and Ferries\n       Subsection (a) of this section amends paragraph 129(a)(1) \n     of title 23, United States Code, to remove the prohibitions \n     against Federal participation in the initial construction of \n     a toll highway, bridge, or tunnel on the Interstate System or \n     in the reconstruction of a toll-free Interstate highway and \n     its conversion to a toll facility. Such initial Interstate \n     construction or Interstate reconstruction/conversion would be \n     eligible for Federal-aid highway funds to the same extent and \n     under the same terms (including limitations on the use of \n     toll revenues) as such projects on non-Interstate highways, \n     bridges, and tunnels currently are eligible under section 129 \n     of such title. For those States that choose to toll \n     Interstate routes under this provision, the Department \n     encourages the use of electronic tolling. Electronic tolling \n     shortens delays at toll facilities, thereby shortening trip \n     times and reducing vehicle emissions.\n       Subsection (b) of this section eliminates an out-of-date \n     subsection (129(d)) which established a tolling pilot program \n     that has accomplished its intended purpose. However, pilot \n     toll agreements that were executed under subsection 129(k) \n     are still valid unless they were modified under 23 U.S.C. \n     129(a)(6).\n     Sec. 1014. Surface Transportation Program\n       Subsection (a) amends subsection 133(a) of title 23, United \n     States Code, to reflect that the surface transportation \n     program provided for under this section has already been \n     established.\n       Subsection (b) of this section amends paragraph 133(b)(2) \n     to clarify that the eligibility for privately owned vehicles \n     and facilities used to provide intercity passenger service by \n     bus or rail under the STP program parallels the eligibility \n     of such vehicles and facilities under 49 U.S.C. 5302(a)(1), \n     as revised by this Act. Subsection (b) also amends 133(b) to \n     expand STP eligibility regarding safety projects to include \n     publicly owned rail safety infrastructure improvements and \n     programs and non-infrastructure highway safety improvements. \n     Subsection (b) also amends paragraph 133(b)(3) to make clear \n     that STP funds may be used to fund the modification of \n     existing public sidewalks to comply with the requirements of \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act. Subsection (b) also \n     codifies a provision governing transportation enhancements \n     eligibility that has been set forth in agency guidance: a \n     transportation enhancements activity must have a direct link \n     to surface transportation. Subsection (b) also expands STP \n     funding eligibility to include natural habitat mitigation \n     under the same circumstances in which wetlands mitigation is \n     currently eligible for funding under 133(b). Subsection (b) \n     also amends subsection 133(b) to expand STP eligibility to \n     include two new categories of projects: publicly owned \n     intercity passenger and freight rail infrastructure and rail \n     passenger vehicles.\n       Subsection (c) amends section 133 to eliminate the safety \n     set-aside from the STP program and makes conforming \n     amendments to section 133. Highway safety programs will be \n     funded by a direct authorization, rather than as a set-aside \n     of the surface transportation program.\n       Subsection (d) amends paragraph 133(e)(2) to scale back the \n     current quarterly, project-by-project State certification and \n     notification requirements to annual, program-wide approval of \n     each State's project agreement. Administrative procedures \n     would be established to support the obligation by identifying \n     the projects to be advanced during the period.\n       Subsection (e) strikes the second sentence in paragraph \n     133(e)(3) which required that payments made by the Secretary \n     to the States under section 133 could not exceed the Federal \n     share of costs incurred as of the date the State requested \n     payments.\n       Subsection (f) revises subsection 133(f) regarding the \n     allocation of obligation authority to urbanized areas to \n     extend this provision through the life of the \n     reauthorization. Current FHWA guidance provides that a State \n     is deemed to have complied with this provision if the target \n     amounts of obligation authority for individual areas have \n     been obligated or if the State and MPO agree and document \n     that the obligation authority was made available, but the \n     area was unwilling or unable to use it. Revised subsection \n     133(f) also requires that each State and MPO ensure the fair \n     and equitable treatment under 133(f)(1) of central cities of \n     over 200,000 in population.\n     Sec. 1015. Metropolitan Planning\n     Subsection (a). General Requirements\n       Subsection 134(a) of title 23, United States Code, sets \n     forth the general bases, goals, and functions of the \n     metropolitan planning process established under this section. \n     This subsection has been revised to emphasize system \n     management and operation (excluding maintenance) to \n     underscore the need to support existing transportation \n     systems and implementation of Intelligent Transportation \n     Systems. A reference to locally determined fair and \n     equitable treatment of all parts of the metropolitan \n     planning area within the planning process is added to \n     emphasize regional problem solving and resource \n     distribution.\n     Subsection (b). Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs)\n       Paragraph (1) establishes the process for designation \n     (creation) of metropolitan planning organizations. This \n     paragraph retains the current method for designation of MPOs \n     by agreement of the Governor and units of general purpose \n     local government, but requires that such local governments \n     represent 51 percent of the affected population (under \n     current law, such governments must represent 75 percent of \n     the affected population). This paragraph retains the \n     provision of current law that an MPO can only be designated \n     under this arrangement if the central city agrees to the \n     proposal. As revised, this paragraph also permits \n     designation, consistent with this provision, under procedures \n     established by State law. Under current paragraph 134(b)(1), \n     State or local law can govern.\n       Paragraph (2) replaces current paragraph 134(b)(5) and \n     establishes the process for redesignation of existing \n     metropolitan planning organizations. This paragraph retains \n     the current method for redesignation of MPOs by agreement of \n     the Governor and units of general purpose local government, \n     but requires that such local governments represent 51 percent \n     of the affected population (under current law, such \n     governments must represent 75 percent of the affected \n     population). This paragraph retains the provision of current \n     law that an MPO can only be redesignated if the central city \n     agrees to the proposal. This paragraph also permits \n     redesignation, consistent with this provision, under \n     procedures established by State law.\n       The special provisions for Los Angeles and Chicago to \n     request redesignation have been removed because they have not \n     been used by either area.\n       Paragraph (3) replaces current paragraph 134(b)(6) and \n     establishes the process for designating multiple metropolitan \n     planning organizations in a single metropolitan planning \n     area. Under current law, the Governor alone is responsible \n     for determining whether more than one MPO is needed. As \n     revised, this paragraph includes local officials acting \n     through the MPO and the Secretary of Transportation as key \n     participants in determining whether to create multiple \n     metropolitan planning organizations to serve a single \n     metropolitan area.\n       Paragraph (4) replaces current paragraph 134(b)(2). This \n     paragraph identifies the membership of the policy boards of \n     metropolitan\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\n     planning organizations serving areas designated as \n     transportation management areas. In this paragraph, specific \n     reference is made to the policy board of the MPO, rather than \n     the more general reference to the MPO, as provided in current \n     law, to make clear that these membership requirements are \n     meant to apply to the policy boards only.\n       The current paragraph 134(b)(4) ``grandfathering'' all MPO \n     structures existing and not redesignated after December 18, \n     1991, has been deleted to give State and local officials more \n     flexibility in structuring their MPOs.\n       Paragraph (5) replaces current subparagraphs 134(b)(3)(A) \n     and (B). This paragraph provides that nothing in subsection \n     134(b) shall interfere with a public agency's authority, \n     under State law, to develop plans and programs for adoption \n     by an MPO and to develop long range capital plans, coordinate \n     transit services and projects, and carry out other activities \n     under State law. No substantive revisions have been made to \n     this language.\n     Subsection (c). Metropolitan Planning Area Boundaries\n       This subsection establishes the basis for designating \n     metropolitan planning area boundaries. Such boundaries \n     include the existing urbanized area, the contiguous area \n     expected to become urbanized in the next 20 years, and any \n     areas in nonattainment for ozone, carbon monoxide or \n     particulate matter. This subsection differs from current \n     subsection 134(c) in several ways. It freezes the connection \n     between nonattainment areas and metropolitan planning areas \n     to the metropolitan planning area boundaries in existence as \n     of September 30, 1996, but allows the Governor and the MPO, \n     upon agreement, to expand the boundaries of a metropolitan \n     planning area. This paragraph also adds nonattainment areas \n     for particulate matter to this list of nonattainment areas to \n     be included in the boundaries of a metropolitan planning \n     area. Finally, this paragraph is revised to provide that for \n     urbanized areas designated after September 30, 1996, the \n     Governor and units of general purpose government must \n     establish metropolitan planning area boundaries that \n     appropriately address current areas in nonattainment for \n     ozone, carbon monoxide, or particulate matter.\n     Subsection (d). Coordination in Multi-State Areas\n       Paragraph (1) requires the Secretary to encourage the \n     coordination of metropolitan planning activities in \n     metropolitan planning areas divided by State boundaries and \n     served by multiple MPOs. Clarifying editorial changes have \n     been made.\n       Paragraph (2) authorizes two or more States to enter into a \n     compact to cooperate in implementing the planning activities \n     authorized under this section. This provision is unchanged \n     from current law.\n     Subsection (e). Coordination of MPOs\n       This subsection requires coordination between two or more \n     metropolitan planning organizations with authority within a \n     metropolitan planning area or a nonattainment area. This \n     subsection has been revised to include areas that are in \n     nonattainment for particulate matter. In addition, it \n     requires each MPO to coordinate their plans and programs \n     under this section with each other, where the current \n     provision requires that they consult with each other.\n     Subsection (f). Scope of the Planning Process\n       This subsection identifies the issues to be considered in \n     the planning process when developing plans and programs. This \n     subsection has been revised to create seven broad clusters \n     of issues, where current subsection 134(f) includes 16 \n     specific factors. These seven clusters encompass the 16 \n     factors included in current law, but are meant to give \n     planning officials greater flexibility, e.g., landside \n     port access planning could be conducted within the \n     metropolitan planning process under 134(f)(1)(E). The use \n     of these clusters must be reflected in their application \n     in transportation decisionmaking. These same clusters, \n     with minor modifications, are used in the Statewide \n     planning provision of 23 U.S.C. 135 for consistency and \n     clarity.\n     Subsection (g). Development of Transportation Plan\n       This subsection has been renamed, from ``Development of \n     Long-Range Plan'' to ``Development of Transportation Plan'' \n     to emphasize the comprehensive, multi-modal transportation \n     focus of the plan, rather than its time frame.\n       Paragraph (1) sets forth the requirement for a \n     transportation plan in each metropolitan area.\n       Paragraph (2) lists the minimum contents of the plan. This \n     paragraph eliminates the requirement that the plan be in a \n     form determined by the Secretary. These subparagraphs also \n     require consideration of strategies to address system \n     preservation and efficiency of use. The focus of this plan \n     has been broadened to emphasize all transportation \n     investments, including system management and operation \n     (excluding maintenance) and to eliminate the distinction \n     between transit systems and highways. In addition, the \n     reference to vehicular congestion has been modified.\n       Subparagraph (C) of this paragraph sets forth the \n     requirement for a financial plan based on resources that are \n     available or that can reasonably be made available. This \n     financial planning language has been slightly revised for \n     clarity. In addition, a new requirement for a cooperative \n     process, involving the MPO, public transit agency, and the \n     State, for estimating the resources available to support \n     implementation of a plan has been included.\n       Current subparagraph (D) requiring the plan to list \n     proposed transportation enhancement activities has been \n     eliminated as unnecessary because all federally supported \n     improvements are already required to be in a plan and \n     program.\n       Paragraph (3) is retitled and modified to revise the \n     coordination between transportation planning and air quality \n     agencies and to add coordination with other planning \n     processes. Subparagraph (A) requires that MPOs coordinate \n     with State air quality agencies in metropolitan areas that \n     are in nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide. \n     Subparagraph (A) also is revised to include areas in \n     nonattainment for particulate matter. Current paragraph (3) \n     requires State air quality agencies and MPOs to coordinate \n     the development of the long-range (now transportation) plan \n     with the development of transportation control measures of \n     the State implementation plan. The revised subparagraph \n     requires State air quality agencies and MPOs to ensure \n     cooperation in the development of air quality and \n     transportation plans. This strengthens the reciprocal \n     relationship between the planning processes beyond just the \n     development of transportation control measures. Subparagraph \n     (B) is added to support the relationship in metropolitan \n     areas between related planning activities and processes. \n     Development of transportation plans is expected to account \n     for related investments and program strategies developed \n     through other planning activities, e.g., economic development \n     and revitalization. Such coordination would ensure that \n     transportation projects and programs would consider, for \n     example, the needs of low income communities so that they \n     would be effectively integrated with transportation \n     investments.\n       Paragraph (4) requires that each MPO provide an opportunity \n     for public participation and involvement in the planning \n     process. This paragraph is revised to add freight shippers to \n     the list of interested parties to be provided a reasonable \n     opportunity to comment on the transportation plan.\n       Paragraph (5) requires that each MPO publish or otherwise \n     make readily available to the public its transportation plan. \n     This provision is unchanged from current law.\n     Subsection (h). Metropolitan Transportation Improvement \n         Program\n       Paragraph (1) of this subsection establishes the \n     requirement for each MPO to develop, in cooperation with the \n     State and affected public transit operators, a transportation \n     improvement program for its metropolitan area. This program \n     must be updated every two years, and interested parties must \n     be provided with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the \n     proposed program. This paragraph is revised to add freight \n     shippers to the list of interested parties.\n       Paragraph (2), retitled content, requires the \n     transportation improvement program to include a list of \n     federally funded surface transportation projects and \n     strategies to be carried out within the first 3 years of the \n     program. This paragraph also requires the program to include \n     a financial plan demonstrating how the program can be \n     implemented, indicating the resources that are reasonably \n     expected to be available to carry out the program and any \n     innovative finance techniques needed. This paragraph has been \n     revised to require the MPO, public transit agency, and State \n     to cooperatively develop estimates of funds that will be \n     available to support program implementation.\n       Paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) have been reordered from \n     previous statutory language for clarity.\n       Paragraph (3), included projects, replaces paragraph \n     (h)(5). [Current paragraph (h)(4), requiring the Secretary to \n     initiate a rulemaking within 6 months of enactment of ISTEA \n     on conforming NEPA review of transit projects with NEPA \n     review of highway projects has been deleted because this \n     requirement has already been met.] Paragraph (4) provides \n     that only those projects or identified project phases that \n     can be reasonably anticipated to be fully funded may be \n     included in a transportation improvement program.\n       Paragraph (4), notice and comment, replaces current \n     paragraph (h)(6). This paragraph requires MPOs to provide the \n     public and interested parties with reasonable notice of and \n     an opportunity to comment on a proposed transportation \n     improvement program before approving the program.\n       This paragraph has been revised to require the MPO to \n     cooperate with the State and public transit operators in \n     implementing this requirement.\n       Paragraph (5), project selection, clarifies the distinction \n     between project selection and TIP development as established \n     in ISTEA. TIP development is a cooperative process involving \n     the MPO, State and transit operators. Project selection, as \n     referred to in ISTEA, is the process for advancing projects \n     as scheduled in the TIP or moving projects between years \n     within an approved TIP. This language clarifies that project \n     selection is exercised once a TIP has been approved and does \n     not apply to TIP development. It may lead in some cases to \n     TIP amendments where significant changes have occurred after \n     TIP approval.\n     Subsection (i). Transportation Management Areas (TMAs)\n       This subsection requires the Secretary to designate a \n     special category of metropolitan\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\n     planning areas--those urbanized areas over 200,000 in \n     population--as transportation management areas and it sets \n     forth a special MPO structure and procedures for the planning \n     process serving those areas.\n       Paragraph (1) drops the current reference to inclusion of \n     the Lake Tahoe Basin, upon request, as a transportation \n     management area because it is ineffective. The area has not \n     benefitted from this provision, which allowed the area to be \n     designated as a transportation management area but did not \n     give it MPO status or make it eligible for planning funds.\n       Paragraph (2) requires the planning process in TMAs to be \n     based on continuous, cooperative, and comprehensive planning. \n     This provision is unchanged from current law.\n       Paragraph (3) requires the creation of a congestion \n     management system within a TMA. The language requiring the \n     Secretary to establish a phase-in schedule for this \n     requirement is deleted because this requirement has been \n     implemented.\n       Paragraph (4) establishes the process for selecting \n     projects for implementation to be carried out within the \n     boundaries of a TMA and with Federal financial participation.\n       Paragraph (5) establishes a process for triennial Federal \n     review of the metropolitan planning process in transportation \n     management areas and includes sanctions for failure to meet \n     Federal certification standards. The review process is in \n     addition to approval of the STIP and Unified Planning Work \n     program and Federal conformity determinations. FHWA and FTA \n     actions, when coupled together, can be strategically used to \n     induce improved planning by leveraging the consequences of \n     each action.\n       Where current paragraph (5) provides for withholding 20 \n     percent of only surface transportation program apportionments \n     attributed to a metropolitan area if it remains uncertified, \n     this revised paragraph provides that the Secretary may \n     withhold all or any part of the apportioned funds attributed \n     to the TMA under titles 23 and 49, United States Code, as the \n     Secretary deems appropriate. Based on this authority, the \n     Secretary has multiple options to apply sanctions to reflect \n     the severity of deficiencies in the planning process under \n     review. Further, this penalty can be applied to reinforce the \n     other approval actions mentioned in the preceding paragraph. \n     The withheld apportionments must be restored to the \n     metropolitan area once it is certified by the Secretary under \n     this paragraph.\n     Subsection (j). Abbreviated Plans and Programs for Certain \n         Areas\n       This subsection enables the Secretary to permit \n     metropolitan areas (other than transportation management \n     areas) to develop an abbreviated metropolitan transportation \n     plan and program that the Secretary determines to be \n     appropriate to achieve the purposes of this section. MPOs \n     that contain nonattainment areas cannot utilize this \n     provision. This subsection is substantially unchanged from \n     current law.\n     Subsection (k). Additional Requirements for Certain \n         Nonattainment Areas\n       Previous subsection (k) on transfer of funds has been moved \n     to 23 U.S.C. 104. Previous subsection (l) is redesignated as \n     (k).\n       This subsection requires single occupant vehicle (SOV) \n     capacity-increasing projects in TMAs classified as \n     nonattainment to be part of an approved congestion management \n     system before they may be federally funded. In addition, this \n     subsection has been revised to include areas that are in \n     nonattainment for particulate matter.\n     Subsection (l). Limitation on Statutory Construction\n       Previous subsection (m) is redesignated as (l).\n       Subsection (l), as so redesignated, provides that nothing \n     in 23 U.S.C. 134 shall be construed to confer on an MPO the \n     authority to impose legal requirements on any transportation \n     facility, provider, or project not eligible under title 23 or \n     chapter 53 of title 49. This subsection would be amended to \n     correct the reference to the restatement of the Federal \n     Transit Act as positive law in chapter 53 of title 49, United \n     States Code.\n     Subsection (m). Funding\n       Previous subsection (n) is redesignated as (m).\n       The source of federal funds to support metropolitan \n     transportation planning is identified. Additionally, this \n     section permits MPOs to make available to the State (for \n     funding Statewide planning under 23 U.S.C. 135) any funds set \n     aside under 23 U.S.C. 104(f) for metropolitan planning that \n     are not used to carry out such planning.\n     Sec. 1016. Statewide Planning\n     Subsection (a). General Requirements\n       Subsection 135(a) of title 23, United States Code, sets \n     forth the general bases, goals, and functions of the \n     Statewide planning process established under this section. \n     This subsection has been revised to emphasize system \n     management and operation (excluding maintenance) \n     to underscore the need to support existing transportation \n     systems and implementation of Intelligent Transportation \n     Systems. A reference to fair and equitable treatment \n     within the planning process for all areas of the State has \n     been added.\n     Subsection (b). Scope of the Planning Process\n       This subsection replaces current subsections 135(b), (c), \n     and (d). This subsection identifies issues to be considered \n     in the Statewide planning process. This subsection lists \n     seven broad clusters of issues to be considered. These \n     clusters encompass the 20 factors included in current \n     subsection 135(c) but are meant to give planning officials \n     greater flexibility, e.g., landside port access planning \n     could be conducted within the metropolitan planning process \n     under 135(b)(1)(E). The same clusters, with minor \n     modifications, are used in the metropolitan planning \n     provision. This subsection is also revised to require the \n     State to cooperatively determine with its planning partners \n     how these considerations are translated into State goals and \n     objectives. Finally, this subsection retains, with clarifying \n     edits, the requirements to coordinate Statewide planning with \n     metropolitan planning and for Statewide planning to consider \n     the concerns of Indian tribal governments and Federal lands \n     agencies. An addition is made to address the concerns of \n     elected local officials with jurisdiction over transportation \n     in non-metropolitan areas. An addition also is made to add \n     coordination with other planning processes. Development of \n     transportation plans is expected to account for related \n     investments and program strategies developed through other \n     planning activities, e.g., economic development and \n     revitalization. Such coordination would ensure that \n     transportation projects and programs would consider, for \n     example, the needs of low income communities so that they \n     would be effectively integrated with transportation \n     investments.\n     Subsection (c). Transportation Plan\n       This subsection replaces current subsection 135(e) and has \n     been renamed, from ``Long-Range Plan'' to ``Transportation \n     Plan'' to emphasize the comprehensive, multi-modal \n     transportation focus of this plan, rather than its time \n     frame. This subsection requires States to develop \n     transportation plans for all areas of the State. This \n     subsection has been revised to clarify that the Statewide \n     plan should cover at least a 20-year forecast period and that \n     it should provide for the development of operations and \n     management strategies, in addition to capital. This \n     subsection also is revised to call for consultation between \n     the State and local transportation officials outside of \n     metropolitan area boundaries when developing the Statewide \n     plan for such non-metropolitan areas. This subsection also \n     adds freight shippers to the list of interested parties to \n     which the State must provide a reasonable opportunity to \n     comment on the proposed plan.\n     Subsection (d). State Transportation Improvement Program\n       This subsection replaces current subsection 135(f) and has \n     been renamed from ``Transportation Improvement Program'' to \n     ``Statewide Transportation Improvement Program.''\n       Paragraph (1) of this subsection requires States to develop \n     transportation improvement programs for all areas of the \n     State. This subsection is also revised to call for \n     consultation between the State and local transportation \n     officials outside of metropolitan area boundaries when \n     developing the program for such non-metropolitan areas. This \n     section also adds freight shippers to the list of interested \n     parties to which the State must provide a reasonable \n     opportunity to comment on the proposed program.\n       Paragraph (2) requires the transportation improvement \n     program to identify all federally funded surface \n     transportation projects. This paragraph has also been revised \n     to provide that the projects included in the Statewide \n     program for metropolitan areas must be identical to the \n     approved metropolitan transportation improvement program .\n       Paragraph (3) provides for the selection of projects for \n     areas less than 50,000 in population. TIP development is a \n     cooperative process involving the MPO, State and transit \n     operators. Project selection, as referred to in ISTEA, is the \n     process for advancing projects as scheduled in the TIP or \n     moving projects between years within an approved TIP. The \n     proposed language clarifies that project selection is \n     exercised once a TIP has been approved and does not apply to \n     TIP development. It may lead in some cases to TIP amendments \n     where significant changes have occurred after TIP approval. \n     In the case of areas under 50,000 population the State must \n     consult with affected local officials.\n       Paragraph (4) requires the Secretary to biennially review \n     and approve States' transportation improvement programs. This \n     language is revised to direct the Secretary, before approving \n     a STIP, to find that it is consistent or substantially \n     consistent with this section and 23 U.S.C. 134.\n     Subsection (e). Funding\n       This subsection provides that funds made available under 23 \n     U.S.C. 329(a) shall be available to carry out the \n     requirements of this section. This subsection is revised to \n     also make funds set aside under 49 U.S.C. 5313(b) available \n     to carry out these requirements.\n       Current subsection 135(h), concerning treatment of State \n     laws pertaining to congestion management systems, has been \n     deleted because it is no longer applicable.\n     Sec. 1017. Research, Training, and Employment Opportunities\n     Subsection (a) Training\n       Paragraph (a)(1) The amendment made by this paragraph \n     encourages a State to establish a certain number of training \n     slots on its Federal-aid contracts for welfare recipients \n     residing in the State to help meet its annual goal for \n     placing recipients in work activities, as required by the \n     ``Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \n     Act of 1996'' (the ``Welfare Reform Act''). Under the\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\n     Welfare Reform Act, a State must demonstrate annually that it \n     has moved a certain percentage of families into ``work \n     activities.'' Work activities, with certain limitations, \n     include participation in job training programs. Failure to \n     meet these percentages will result in a reduction in the \n     block grant that the State is entitled to receive. The \n     Welfare Reform Act also imposes a maximum amount of time for \n     which individuals can stay on public assistance.\n       Subsection 140(a) of title 23, United States Code, \n     currently provides that the Secretary shall, where necessary \n     to ensure equal employment opportunity, require certification \n     by any State recipient that the state has in existence an \n     apprenticeship or skill improvement program. Pursuant to \n     this authority, FHWA issued regulations requiring States \n     to set goals for a minimum number of training slots to be \n     included on Federal-aid highway contracts (23 CFR Sec. \n     230.111). Annual training goals are submitted to FHWA \n     Division Administrators for approval. The State selects \n     the contracts on which these slots are to be included in \n     order to achieve the goal. Contractors bidding on the \n     contracts include the costs of the trainees (including \n     salaries) as part of their bids.\n       Under paragraph (a)(1), the State could reserve some of its \n     training slots for welfare recipients. The State could \n     require contractors on Federal-aid projects to fill some of \n     the training slots designated for the contract with welfare \n     recipients. To minimize the burden on the contractor, DOT \n     could require the State to identify eligible welfare \n     recipients in the guidance implementing the program.\n       Subparagraph (a)(2)(A) Subsection 140(b) currently provides \n     the authority for the FHWA's On-the-Job Training (OJT) \n     Supportive Services Program. Funds are authorized to be used \n     under this section to develop, conduct, and administer \n     highway construction training, including skill improvement \n     programs. Subparagraph (a)(2)(A) expands the scope of the OJT \n     program to include technology training. This change is \n     proposed so as to capitalize on training opportunities in \n     connection with Intelligent Transportation Systems and other \n     transportation-related technology. This subparagraph also \n     adds Summer Transportation Institutes to the types of \n     programs that can be funded under subsection 140(b). Summer \n     Transportation Institutes are programs that are sponsored by \n     colleges (mostly Minority Institutions of Higher Education) \n     to expose high school students to careers in transportation, \n     to assist them in developing skills that they would need to \n     pursue a career in transportation, and to familiarize them \n     with a college environment. Expanding the program to include \n     Summer Transportation Institutes allows States to provide \n     education, guidance, and motivation for disadvantaged and at-\n     risk youth and to develop a future pool of transportation \n     professionals.\n       Subparagraph (a)(2)(B) Under the current law, the Secretary \n     is authorized to reserve up to $10 million of the funds \n     authorized under 23 U.S.C. 104(a) to fund the OJT Supportive \n     Services Program. However, this provision was last funded by \n     Congress in 1995, and only at a level of $2 million. FHWA \n     used this funding to pay for ten pilot projects and \n     initiatives focusing on skill improvement and outreach \n     programs to minorities and women. The current legislation \n     also authorizes States to draw down up to \\1/2\\ of 1 percent \n     of funds apportioned to it for the surface transportation \n     program under subsection 104(b) and the bridge program under \n     section 144. Although there is a significant amount of \n     funding available to the States from this source, the use of \n     these funds has been limited. For example, in 1996, a total \n     of 12 states drew down only 12 percent (less than $4 million) \n     of the $32 million available to develop OJT Supportive \n     Services Programs.\n       Even though States are not extensively using these funds, a \n     need for training in highway construction and related work \n     continues to exist, especially for disadvantaged and \n     traditionally under represented segments of the population. \n     Women in particular are under-represented in highway \n     construction work: employment of women in highway \n     construction still has not even achieved the goal of 6.9 \n     percent established by the Department of Labor. Further, with \n     the enactment of the Welfare Reform Act, more unskilled \n     workers will be seeking jobs as they are moved off of welfare \n     assistance. Implementation of OJT Supportive Services \n     Programs by the States can help prepare individuals in these \n     groups to take advantage of job opportunities in highway \n     construction and technology.\n       The statutory language authorizing the States to draw down \n     these funds currently provides that the \\1/2\\ percent \n     drawdown ``may be available'' to States to implement OJT \n     Supportive Services programs. This subparagraph proposes to \n     change this language to provide that the \\1/2\\ percent \n     drawdown ``should be utilized'' by States to implement OJT \n     Supportive Services Programs. Although the proposed change \n     does not require that States use this draw down, it is \n     intended to more strongly encourage States to use this \n     funding to ensure that some measure of training is available \n     to increase job opportunities on highway construction and \n     related work.\n     Subsection (b) Employment\n       American Indians continue to experience unemployment at a \n     disproportionately high rate. On Indian reservations and in \n     Native communities, chronic unemployment ranges from 25 to 85 \n     percent. Subsection 140(d) of title 23, United States Code, \n     currently provides that States ``may'' implement a preference \n     for employment. Paragraph (b)(1) would change this subsection \n     to provide that States ``should'' implement a preference for \n     employment. Although the proposed change does not constitute \n     a mandate, it is intended to more strongly encourage States \n     to implement employment preferences of Indians on projects \n     carried out under title 23 near Indian reservations.\n       This subsection adds a new subsection to 23 U.S.C. 140 that \n     would encourage States to require a contractor on Federal-aid \n     highway projects to hire a certain number of qualified \n     welfare recipients residing in the State, or to hire a \n     certain number of residents of Empowerment Zones or \n     Enterprise Communities (areas of pervasive poverty, \n     unemployment, and general distress that have been designated \n     in accordance with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1993). This new subsection (140(e)) would provide a way for \n     the States to create job opportunities to move people from \n     welfare to work in order to meet their obligations under the \n     Welfare Reform bill. It would also allow States to create job \n     opportunities for people living in Empowerment Zones and \n     Enterprise Communities.\n       In the proposed program, protections for contractors, as \n     well as protections (such as appeal rights) for potentially \n     eligible welfare recipients, could be included in guidance \n     implementing the program.\n       This subsection also adds a definition of ``welfare \n     assistance.''\n       Also, this subsection adds a new subsection to 23 U.S.C. \n     140, concerning employment on Federal-aid highway projects in \n     the Virgin Islands. High and chronic unemployment continues \n     to depress the economy of the territory of the Virgin \n     Islands. Recent natural disasters have had an additional \n     negative impact on the economy. Job opportunities that \n     typically accompany federally-funded projects are \n     frequently taken by non-residents who are employed by \n     companies that are based outside of the Virgin Islands.\n       This subsection (140(g)) would permit the territory of the \n     Virgin Islands to require a contractor on a Federal-aid \n     highway project to give preferences in hiring to qualified \n     persons who regularly reside in the Virgin Islands. Allowing \n     such a preference gives the Virgin Islands a means to help \n     reduce unemployment and to recapture federal funds in its \n     local economy. As in the welfare recipient program described \n     in new subsection 140(e), implementing guidance could include \n     protections for the contractors as well as for potentially \n     eligible residents.\n     Subsection (c) Technical Corrections\n       This subsection makes several purely technical corrections \n     to update and correct the language of section 140.\n     Subsection (d). Minority Institutions of Higher Education\n       This subsection is intended to carry out one of the \n     objectives of Executive Orders 12982, ``Promoting Procurement \n     with Small Businesses Owned and Controlled by Socially and \n     Economically Disadvantaged Individuals, Historically Black \n     Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions.'' This \n     Executive Order requires Federal agencies to establish goals \n     for participation in federal procurement by Historically \n     Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority \n     Institutions of Higher Education (MIHEs) of not less than 5 \n     percent.\n       In the past, FHWA established various initiatives to \n     enhance the involvement of MIHEs in all aspects of its \n     federal and federal-aid funded programs. Beginning in FY 95, \n     FHWA set a goal of not less than 5 percent of its research \n     and technology funds to be awarded annually to MIHEs. \n     Although various grants and cooperative agreements have been \n     awarded to MIHEs, the competition requirements for research \n     and technology contracts are an obstacle in achieving the \n     goal. In 1995, FHWA achieved only 3 percent of its 5 percent \n     goal. MIHEs continue to face barriers to participation in the \n     Federal and Federal-aid highway program, particularly when \n     they are required to compete for grants and contracts with \n     majority institutions which have well-established physical \n     plants as well as advance technological expertise and \n     equipment.\n       Under this subsection, the Secretary is directed to develop \n     a program designed to remove barriers to participation by \n     MIHEs and help them gain the experience and expertise \n     necessary to be competitive with other educational \n     institutions. The Secretary would be able to carry out this \n     program through a variety of mechanisms, including expanded \n     outreach and technical assistance. In addition, \n     notwithstanding the competitive bidding requirements \n     contained elsewhere in title 23, the Secretary would also be \n     permitted limit competition to increase awards under this \n     section. However, such methods may only be used consistent \n     with any laws relating to affirmative action in Federal \n     procurement that apply to this program.\n     Sec. 1018. Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs)\n       This section continues the provisions regarding affirmative \n     action found in Sec. 1003(b)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of the \n     Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 \n     (ISTEA). Paragraph 1003(b)(1), now subsection 162(a), \n     requires that 10 percent of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated under four titles of the ISTEA be expended with \n     small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and \n     economically disadvantaged individuals, except to the extent\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\n     that the Secretary of Transportation determines otherwise. \n     Paragraph 1003(b)(2), now subsection 162(b), defines the \n     terms ``small business concern'' and ``socially and \n     economically disadvantaged individuals.'' Paragraph \n     1003(b)(3), now subsection 162(c), requires States to \n     annually survey and compile a list of DBEs. Paragraph \n     1003(b)(4), now subsection 162(d), requires the Secretary to \n     establish uniform criteria for State governments to use in \n     certifying whether a concern qualifies as a DBE under this \n     section.\n       This subsection has served the Department well in \n     administering its contracting programs. In FHWA's program \n     alone, the total dollar amount to DBEs in the form of prime \n     contract awards and subcontract commitments is $10.4 billion. \n     Significantly, prior to the enactment of the DBE program by \n     Congress in 1982, minority and women-owned firms participated \n     in approximately 3.5 percent of the Federal-aid highway \n     program.\n       In 1995, the Supreme Court decided Adarand v Pena, and \n     heightened the standard of judicial review applicable to \n     Federal affirmative action programs, requiring that they meet \n     a standard of ``strict scrutiny.'' The Adarand decision \n     involved the FHWA's Federal land highway program. The Federal \n     land program is carried out directly by FHWA. At issue was a \n     contract provision designed to encourage prime contractors to \n     utilize the services of small and disadvantaged business \n     enterprises through a compensatory incentive payment. The \n     Federal land highway program uses this provision as part of \n     its effort to comply with both ISTEA and the Small Business \n     Act.\n       Although deciding that strict scrutiny should henceforth \n     apply to all Federal affirmative action programs, the Supreme \n     Court did not strike down existing statutory requirements. \n     Instead, it remanded the case to the lower courts to \n     determine whether the program at issue meets the strict \n     scrutiny standard of review. By this action, the Supreme \n     Court implicitly recognized the continuing constitutionality \n     of properly structured affirmative action programs.\n       Indeed, the majority opinion in Adarand recognized the \n     ``unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering \n     effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in \n     this country.'' It emphasized that strict scrutiny was not to \n     be ``strict in theory, but fatal in fact.'' The President, in \n     charging Federal agencies to review their programs after the \n     Adarand decision, expressed his desire to ``mend, not end\" \n     affirmative action.\n       In order to comply with the Supreme Court's ``strict \n     scrutiny'' standard, there must be a ``compelling \n     governmental interest'' to create an affirmative action \n     program. The continued disparity, absent affirmative action \n     measures, in the amount of business actually done by \n     minority and women owned business in relation to the \n     number of individuals ready, willing and able to work in \n     various aspects of the construction and transportation \n     industries has been well documented. A preliminary survey \n     of evidence demonstrating a ``compelling governmental \n     interest'' for affirmative action in Federal procurement \n     was published on May 23, 1996, in the Federal Register by \n     the Department of Justice as an appendix to its ``Notice \n     of Proposed Reforms to Affirmative Action in Federal \n     Procurement.'' Information available to the Department of \n     Transportation, some of it considered by the Congress in \n     the past, attests to the continuing need of programs which \n     provide enhanced opportunities for disadvantaged business \n     enterprises.\n       Strict scrutiny requires more. In order to pass \n     constitutional muster, an affirmative action program must be \n     ``narrowly tailored'' to meet its objectives. The goals or \n     levels of DBE participation should reflect the capacity that \n     such businesses would have had to do the work, but for the \n     continuing effects of discrimination. The 10 percent goal set \n     forth in ISTEA has served the Department well, and has been \n     readily attainable throughout the United States. However, the \n     goal has never been more than a guidepost, even before the \n     Adarand decision. Both the current and proposed regulations \n     require each State and local recipient to establish an \n     overall goal for its program, based on information from its \n     particular jurisdiction. The goals may be higher or lower \n     than 10 percent, based on State and local contracting \n     conditions.\n       For all of these reasons, continuation of the existing law \n     makes sense. The law sets forth a general goal for the \n     country as a whole. It also gives broad discretion to the \n     Secretary to develop a program which responds to the strict \n     scrutiny standard, both in terms of specific program \n     provisions and higher or lower State or local goals where \n     appropriate. The Department has reviewed its program and is \n     confident that it would survive the strict scrutiny standard \n     required under Adarand. However, in order to improve the \n     program based on the President's direction to ``mend, not \n     end'' Federal affirmative action programs, and to further \n     clarify how the program complies with the Adarand decision, \n     the Department is proposing a number of changes to its \n     regulations implementing the program.\n       To this end, the Department will publish its proposed \n     revisions to its current DBE regulations shortly after \n     submitting this bill. It is our belief that these proposed \n     revisions illustrate the flexibility of the current law and \n     the wisdom of allowing the Department to deal \n     administratively with these exceedingly complex issues. \n     First, the revised regulations will set forth a new method by \n     which recipients will establish goals, consistent with the \n     post-Adarand guidance issued by the Department of Justice. \n     Secondly, the regulations will establish that race-neutral \n     measures (such as outreach programs, technical assistance, \n     and assistance in financing) should be used first by \n     recipients to reach their overall goals. Race- and gender-\n     conscious mechanisms, such as subcontracting goals, should \n     only be used to the extent that race-neutral mechanisms fail. \n     Finally, the regulations will propose alternatives to limit \n     the duration of firms' participation in the program, and to \n     reduce the concentration of DBE firms in certain types of \n     work. It is the intent of the Department to finalize these \n     regulations over the next few months after carefully \n     evaluating the many comments we receive.\n     Sec. 1019. Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation \n         Program\n       Subsection (a) of his section sets forth a new, revised \n     section 144 of title 23, United States Code, which provides \n     as follows.\n       Subsection 144(a) lists the purposes of the HBRRP, which \n     have been revised to reflect the expanded funding eligibility \n     under this revised section (see subsection 144(c) below).\n       Subsection 144(b) requires the Secretary, in consultation \n     with the States, to annually inventory certain highway \n     bridges on public roads. It also requires the Secretary to \n     consult with the Secretary of the Interior when inventorying \n     highway bridges on Indian reservation roads and park roads. \n     This subsection also permits the Secretary to inventory \n     highway bridges on public roads for historical significance.\n       Subsection 144(c) lists the types of projects that are \n     eligible for HBRRP funds under this section. Eligibility is \n     divided into two main categories: (1) replacement or \n     rehabilitation of deficient highway bridges, and (2) \n     preventive measures, i.e., seismic retrofitting, painting, \n     calcium magnesium acetate application, and installation of \n     scour countermeasures. This subsection expands current HBRRP \n     eligibility, adding scour countermeasures.\n       Under subsection 144(d), the current apportionment formula \n     for HBRRP funds is retained; these funds would be apportioned \n     between the States based on the square footage of deficient \n     bridges in each State. But the total cost of deficient \n     bridges in a State would be reduced in fiscal year 2003 by \n     the amount of HBRRP funds that the State transferred to its \n     NHS or STP accounts in the previous four fiscal year and did \n     not restore back to its HBRRP apportionment by the end of \n     fiscal year 2002. Subsection 144(d) also includes provisions \n     governing each State's annual share of the total \n     apportionment and the percentage of HBRRP apportionments that \n     each State must spend on projects on highway bridges on \n     public roads classified as local roads or rural minor \n     collectors.\n       Subsection 144(e) provides an exemption from the U.S. Coast \n     Guard's bridge permitting requirement for the replacement of \n     highway bridges.\n       The separate biennial reporting requirement on HBRRP \n     projects, bridge inventories, and recommendations for \n     improvements to the program has been deleted. Instead, this \n     report will be merged with and submitted as a part of the \n     FHWA's biennial conditions and performance report.\n       Subsection 144(f) provides that each State's apportionment \n     shall be made available for obligation throughout the State \n     on a fair and equitable basis.\n       Subsection 144(g) requires the Secretary to periodically \n     review the procedure used in approving or disapproving \n     States' applications for HBRRP funds and implement any \n     changes that would expedite this procedure.\n       Subsection 144(h) requires each State to inventory its \n     bridges to determine their historical significance. This \n     subsection also makes certain historical bridge projects \n     eligible for HBRRP funds and it establishes a process by \n     which a State, locality, or responsible private entity may \n     assume responsibility for a historic bridge that would \n     otherwise be demolished.\n       Subsection 144(i) states that State laws and standards \n     apply to any HBRRP-funded project not on the National Highway \n     System.\n       Subsection 144(j) defines the term ``rehabilitate'' to mean \n     major work necessary to restore the structural integrity of a \n     bridge and work necessary to correct a major safety defect.\n       Subsection 144(k) reauthorizes the current bridge \n     discretionary program at an annual funding level of $55 \n     million.\n       Subsection (b) of this section amends the bridge funds \n     transferability language in 23 U.S.C. 104(g) to enable a \n     State to transfer 50 percent of its HBRRP apportionment to \n     its NHS or STP apportionments only if none of the National \n     Highway System bridges in the State require posting under \n     National Bridge Inventory Item 70, bridge posting, which \n     evaluates the load-carrying capacity of a bridge. If the \n     maximum legal load produces a structural stress level above \n     the bridge operating capacity, the bridge must be posted at a \n     lower load level. Therefore, NHS bridges that must be posted \n     are the structures that the States should be replacing or \n     rehabilitating before any HBRRP funds may be transferred to \n     their NHS or STP apportionments.\n     Sec. 1020. Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement \n         (CMAQ) Program\n       Subsection (a) of this section amends subsection 149(a) of \n     title 23, United States Code,\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\n     to reflect that the congestion mitigation and air quality \n     improvement program provided for under this section has \n     already been established.\n       Subsection (b):\n       Areas in Nonattainment as of FY 1994: Subsection (b) \n     strikes the provision in 149(b) that ``froze'' the \n     nonattainment areas eligible for CMAQ funds as they were \n     during any part of fiscal year 1994.\n       Expansion to PM-10 Areas: Subsection (b) amends subsection \n     149(b) to expand CMAQ eligibility to expressly include \n     projects in nonattainment areas for particulate matter (PM-\n     10). FHWA has administratively interpreted subsection 149(b) \n     to include PM-10 projects; this language codifies this \n     eligibility.\n       Exclusion of Transitional, Submarginal, Not Classified, and \n     Unclassified Areas: Subsection (b) also limits CMAQ \n     eligibility to nonattainment and maintenance areas that were \n     classified as such under the Clean Air Act amendments of \n     1990, thereby excluding transitional, submarginal, not \n     classified and unclassified areas from CMAQ eligibility. This \n     provision codifies NHS Act conference report language that \n     accompanied amendments made by that act to the CMAQ program.\n       Expansion to Two Additional Transportation Control \n     Measures: Subsection (b) also expands CMAQ eligibility to \n     include two traffic control measures identified in the 1990 \n     amendments to the Clean Air Act: vehicle scrappage of pre-\n     1980 vehicles and extreme cold start programs.\n       Clarification of Nonattainment and Maintenance Area \n     Eligibility/Emissions Reductions: Subsection (b) also revises \n     subsection 149(b) to clarify that only projects that make \n     further improvements to current air quality standards are \n     eligible for CMAQ funding in both nonattainment and \n     maintenance areas. In the case of maintenance areas, \n     subsection (b) expressly provides that projects must reduce \n     emissions to be eligible for CMAQ funds.\n       Traffic Management and Control Projects: Subsection (b) \n     also consolidates current paragraphs 149(b)(3) and (4). In \n     doing so, this subsection also removes current paragraph \n     149(b)(4)'s reference to operating assistance for traffic \n     management and control projects. This would restore the \n     general 3-year cap on funding operating assistance, which has \n     been established administratively and which applies to all \n     other CMAQ projects, to traffic management and control \n     projects.\n       Subsection (c) simply designates the penultimate sentence \n     of subsection 149(b) as new subsection 149(c), and it \n     redesignates 149(c) and (d) as (d) and (e), respectively. The \n     final sentence of subsection 149(b), which addressed the \n     potential eligibility of PM-10 projects within certain \n     nonattainment areas, is deleted as unnecessary, since PM-10 \n     eligibility has been expressly included (see subsection (b) \n     above).\n       Current section 149(c) allows States that have never had a \n     nonattainment area for ozone, carbon monoxide, or PM-10 to \n     use CMAQ funds for any project eligible under the surface \n     transportation program. Such areas may also continue to fund \n     CMAQ-eligible projects.\n       Subsection (d) of this section would require that States \n     without nonattainment areas but with maintenance areas fund \n     first CMAQ-eligible activities in such maintenance areas with \n     their CMAQ funds, unless the State can show that its \n     transportation-related maintenance plan activities are fully \n     funded.\n       Subsection (e) of this section provides that, for purposes \n     of CMAQ funding, the boundaries of nonattainment and \n     maintenance areas will generally continue to be determined in \n     accordance with the classification scheme in the 1990 \n     amendments to the Clean Air Act. If the nonattainment \n     boundaries change as a result of new national ambient air \n     quality standards and any additional area newly designated as \n     a result of such standards has submitted to EPA a State \n     implementation plan, such boundaries would be used under this \n     section.\n       Subsection (f) amends subsection 120(c) of title 23, United \n     States Code, to exclude projects funded with CMAQ \n     apportionments from the list of certain safety projects \n     eligible for 100 percent Federal participation. As a \n     result, the standard 80 percent Federal share provision of \n     subsection 120(b) that applies to all other CMAQ projects \n     would apply to these projects as well.\n     Sec. 1021. Interstate Reimbursement\n       Subsection (a) updates the general authority provision of \n     23 U.S.C. 160 which directs the Secretary to allocate to the \n     States amounts determined under subsection 160(b) for \n     reimbursement of their original contributions to construction \n     of segments of the Interstate System which were constructed \n     without Federal financial assistance, to reauthorize this \n     provision for fiscal years 1998 through 2003.\n       Subsection (b) updates 23 U.S.C. 160(b) to render this \n     provision applicable in fiscal years 1998 through 2003. \n     Subsection 160(b) addresses the procedure for determining the \n     amount each State will receive for reimbursement under this \n     section.\n       Subsection (c) revises 23 U.S.C. 160(e), which directs that \n     provisions in 23 U.S.C. 133 regarding the allocation of STP \n     apportionments do not apply to half of the amount transferred \n     under to this section to each State's STP apportionment. \n     Subsection (c) makes a purely technical edit to subsection \n     160(e) to reflect the redesignation of 23 U.S.C. 133(d)(3) as \n     133(d)(2) in light of the elimination of the safety set-aside \n     (previously in 133(d)(1)) from the surface transportation \n     program. Safety programs will now be funded directly and not \n     as a take-down from the surface transportation program.\n       Subsection (d) revises subsection 23 U.S.C. 160(f) to \n     authorize the appropriation of $1 billion for each of fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2003 in accordance with this section.\n     Sec. 1022. State Infrastructure Bank Program\n       Subsection (a) of this section codifies in title 23, United \n     States Code, and thereby makes permanent the State \n     Infrastructure Bank (SIB) Pilot Program authorized for fiscal \n     years 1996 and 1997 in section 350 of the National Highway \n     System Designation Act of 1995 (NHS Act). In codifying this \n     language, references to ISTEA provisions and reporting \n     requirements which will be out of date upon reauthorization \n     of the surface transportation program were also removed. In \n     all other respects, this section is identical to section 350 \n     of the NHS Act, except where noted below.\n       Under subsection 162(a), States are permitted to enter into \n     agreements with the Secretary to create both single-State and \n     multi-State infrastructure banks. This provision eliminates \n     the 10-State limit on the number of participants in the SIB \n     program, which was included in section 350 of the NHS Act.\n       Under subsection 162(b), SIBs are required to maintain \n     separate highway account for funds apportioned to the \n     participating State or States under certain provisions of \n     title 23, United States Code and a separate transit account \n     for funds made available to the participating State or other \n     Federal transit grant recipient under certain provisions of \n     title 49, United States Code. A participating State may \n     contribute to the highway account up to 10 percent of its \n     annual apportionments of NHS, STP, Interstate Maintenance, \n     HBRRP, Interstate reimbursement, and minimum allocation \n     funds. A participating State may also contribute up to 10 \n     percent of the funds annually apportioned to metropolitan \n     regions if the metropolitan planning organization concurs \n     with such action in writing. Federal grant recipients in a \n     State may contribute up to 10 percent of their annual Section \n     3, Section 9, and Section 18 capital grants into the transit \n     account of its SIB.\n       Subsection 162(c) permits SIBs to make loans or provide \n     other assistance to a public or private entity and permits \n     such loans or other assistance to be subordinated to any \n     other debt financing for the project. This subsection \n     prohibits the initial Federal assistance from a SIB to be \n     made in the form of a grant.\n       Subsection 162(d) provides that any project eligible for \n     funding under title 23, United States Code, may be funded \n     from the highway account of a SIB, and that any capital \n     transit project may be funded from the transit account of a \n     SIB. This language expands highway account eligibility beyond \n     what was included in section 350 of the NHS Act. Under \n     section 350, funds in the highway account of a SIB could \n     finance the construction of Federal-aid highways only.\n       Subsection 162(e) lists the requirements a State must meet \n     to establish a SIB under this section. At a minimum, a State \n     must match 25 percent of the Federal contribution with funds \n     from non-Federal sources (except as provided by 23 U.S.C. \n     120(b)). This matching provision is the same as the \n     traditional Federal-aid highway matching requirement (which \n     is most often expressed as an 80/20 match). A State must also \n     ensure that its SIB maintains an investment grade rating on a \n     continuing basis or has a sufficient level of bond or debt \n     financing instrument insurance to maintain the viability of \n     the bank. Income generated by funds contributed to an account \n     of the bank will be credited to the account, invested in U.S. \n     Treasury Securities or other approved financing instruments, \n     and be made available for use in providing loans and other \n     assistance. Any loan from a SIB shall bear interest at or \n     below market rates, and each participating State must ensure \n     that repayment of any loan made by its SIB begins within 5 \n     years after the project has been completed, or, in the case \n     of a highway project, the facility has opened to traffic, \n     whichever is later. The term for repaying any loan may not \n     exceed 30 years after the date of the first payment. Finally, \n     the State shall require its SIB to annually report to the \n     Secretary.\n       Under subsection 162(f), the repayment of a loan or other \n     assistance provided by a SIB may only be used to fund \n     eligible projects under this section and may not be used to \n     pay the non-Federal share of the cost of any project.\n       Subsection 162(g) requires the Secretary to ensure that \n     Federal disbursements be made at an annual rate of 20 percent \n     of the amount requested by the State for the SIB. This \n     subsection differs from the disbursement provision in section \n     350 of the NHS Act, which required that Federal-aid highway \n     and Federal transit funds be disbursed at rates consistent \n     with their respective historical disbursement rates. Federal \n     requirements would apply to all projects receiving assistance \n     through the SIB. However, the Secretary may waive \n     requirements in titles 23 and 49, United States Code, when \n     the Secretary determines that such requirements are not \n     consistent with the purposes of this section, e.g., \n     provisions relating to project payments, except the \n     Secretary may not waive 23 U.S.C. 113 and 114 and 49 \n     U.S.C. 5333. This provision differs from the SIB pilot \n     program in section 350 of the NHS Act, where Federal \n     requirements only\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\n     applied to the amount of Federal funds in the SIB. The \n     Secretary shall revise cooperative agreements executed \n     with the States under the pilot program to bring them into \n     accord with the provisions of this section.\n       Some examples of provisions in title 23 which may be found \n     by the Secretary to be inconsistent with the administration \n     of SIBs are as follows. (1) Where SIBs require that \n     obligation and payment of Federal funds occur at the time of \n     capitalization (before a SIB has provided assistance to any \n     approved project), 23 U.S.C. 106 requires that Federal-aid \n     highway funds be obligated at the time a project is approved, \n     and 23 U.S.C. 121 requires payment to be made as costs are \n     incurred by the State. (2) Where SIBs require non-Federal \n     sources to match 25 percent of the total Federal \n     capitalization grant contributed to the bank, 23 U.S.C. 120 \n     establishes the Federal share on a project-by-project basis. \n     (3) Where SIBs require capitalization funds to be used as the \n     non-Federal match, 23 U.S.C. 323 allows donations to be \n     applied to individual projects to meet this matching \n     requirement. In the current SIB pilot program, the Secretary \n     has determined that Federal-aid highway projects on a toll \n     facility funded from a SIB are not required to comply with 23 \n     U.S.C. 129(a)(3), which imposes restrictions on the use of \n     toll revenues generated by the facility.\n       Subsection 162(h) clarifies that all requirements of \n     Federal law that apply to projects receiving assistance under \n     such titles shall apply to projects receiving assistance from \n     a SIB, except to the extent the Secretary may waive a Federal \n     law, other than sections 113 and 114 of title 23 and section \n     5333 of title 49, under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.\n       Subsection 162(i) provides that the contribution of Federal \n     funds into a SIB under this section shall not be construed as \n     a commitment, guarantee, or obligation on the part of the \n     U.S. to any third party, nor shall any third party have any \n     right against the United States for payment solely by virtue \n     of the contribution. This subsection also requires any \n     security or debt financing instrument issued by a SIB under \n     this section to include this same statement.\n       Subsection 162(j) exempts funds contributed to a SIB under \n     this section from the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3335 and \n     6503, which govern the manner in which funds are disbursed.\n       Subsection 162(k) permits a State to spend as much as 2 \n     percent of the Federal contributions to its SIB to pay the \n     reasonable costs of administering the SIB.\n       Subsection 162(l) defines, for purposes of this section, \n     the terms ``capital project,'' ``other assistance,'' and \n     ``State.''\n       Subsection (b) of this section authorizes annual \n     appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund (other than the \n     Mass Transit Account) for the SIB program at $150 million for \n     each of fiscal years 1998 through 2003 and provides that such \n     funds shall remain available until expended and shall have \n     contract authority.\n       Subsection (c) makes a conforming amendment to the analysis \n     for chapter 1 of title 23, adding a reference to this new \n     section 162.\n     Sec. 1023. National Scenic Byways Program\n       Subsection (a) of this section amends chapter 1 of title \n     23, United States Code, to add a new section, Sec. 163, \n     codifying the National Scenic Byways Program.\n       Subsection 163(a) directs the Secretary of Transportation \n     to carry out the National Scenic Byways program and designate \n     roads having outstanding scenic, historic, cultural, natural \n     or archeological qualities as National Scenic Byways or All-\n     American Roads. Criteria for designation have been defined in \n     an FHWA interim policy notice, which was published in the \n     Federal Register in May 1995.\n       Subsection 163(b) directs the Secretary to make grants and \n     provide technical assistance to the States to implement \n     National Scenic Byways, State scenic byways, and All-American \n     Roads projects and to plan, design, and develop State scenic \n     byways programs. A key aim of providing technical assistance \n     is to educate and increase awareness about the development, \n     management, and operation of scenic byways programs. \n     Paragraph 163(b)(2) lists the priorities that must be given \n     to eligible projects when making grants of scenic byways \n     funds under this section. These are: projects on routes \n     designated as either National Scenic Byways or All-American \n     Roads, projects that would make routes eligible for \n     designation as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads, \n     and projects that will assist States in developing their \n     State scenic byways programs.\n       Subsection 163(c) lists the eight categories of projects \n     eligible for scenic byways funding under this section.\n       Subsection 163(d) provides that the Federal share payable \n     on account of any project under this section shall be \n     determined in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 120(b), except that, \n     for projects on Federal or Indian Lands, a Federal land \n     management agency may contribute the non-Federal share \n     payable on such projects.\n       Subsection 163(e) authorizes $15 million for each of fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2003 for carrying out this scenic byways \n     program.\n       Subsection 163(f) enables the Secretary to authorize scenic \n     byways funds only for projects that protect the scenic, \n     historic, recreational, cultural, natural, and archeological \n     integrity of a highway and adjacent areas.\n       Subsection (b) of this section makes a conforming amendment \n     to the analysis for chapter 1, adding a reference to this new \n     section.\n     Sec. 1024. Infrastructure Safety Program\n       This section combines current sections 130 [Railway-highway \n     crossings] and 152 [Hazard elimination program] of title 23, \n     United States Code, into one section: 23 U.S.C. 164. Except \n     where noted below, these provisions are unchanged from \n     current law.\n       Paragraph 164(a)(1) sets forth the eligible railway-highway \n     crossing uses of funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 104. These \n     funds may be used to fund 90 percent of the cost of \n     construction of projects for the elimination of hazards of \n     railway-highway crossings, including the separation or \n     protection of grades at crossings, the reconstruction of \n     existing railroad grade crossing structures, and the \n     relocation of highways to eliminate grade crossings.\n       Paragraph 164(a)(2) sets forth the eligible uses of \n     railway-highway crossing funds apportioned under subsection \n     164(a). These uses include those listed in 164(a)(1) for \n     section 104 funds and also include the following new uses: \n     trespassing countermeasures, railway-highway crossing \n     education, enforcement of traffic laws, and projects at \n     privately owned railway-highway crossings if the project is \n     publicly sponsored and the Secretary determines that such \n     project would serve a public interest.\n       Paragraph 164(a)(3) authorizes the Secretary to classify \n     various types of projects involved in the elimination of \n     hazards of railway-highway crossings and to determine a \n     railroad's share of the cost of such projects, based on the \n     project's net benefit to the railroad.\n       Paragraph 164(a)(4) sets forth the payment and collection \n     methods of amounts representing the net benefits to any \n     railroad of a project for the elimination of hazards of \n     railway-highway crossings funded under title 23, United \n     States Code, or any prior Acts.\n       Paragraph 164(a)(5) requires each State to conduct and \n     maintain a survey of all highways to identify those railroad \n     crossings that may require separation, relocation, or \n     protective devices, and to establish and implement a schedule \n     to complete these projects. This paragraph also includes a \n     new requirement that States report to the Department on \n     completed railway-highway crossing projects funded under this \n     subsection and section 165, for inclusion in the DOT/AAR \n     National Grade Crossing Inventory.\n       Paragraph 164(a)(6) sets forth a new apportionment formula \n     for railway-highway crossing funds. Under current law, funds \n     are not apportioned in accordance with the apportionment \n     formula in 23 U.S.C. 130(f), but are distributed in \n     accordance with 23 U.S.C. 133(d)(1), which provides that each \n     State shall receive an amount at least equal to the amount of \n     funds made available to the State for carrying out railway-\n     highway crossing projects under this provision in fiscal year \n     1991. Under paragraph 164(a)(6), railway-highway crossing \n     funds would be apportioned as follows: 25 percent of the \n     funds would be apportioned in the ratio that each State's \n     most recent 3-year total of crashes at public railway-highway \n     grade crossings bears to such total in all States, 25 percent \n     are apportioned in the ratio that each State's most recent 3-\n     year total of fatalities involving rail equipment at public \n     railway-highway grade crossings bears to such total in all \n     States, 25 percent of the funds would be apportioned in the \n     ratio that each State's number of public railway-highway \n     grade crossings bears to such number in all States, and 25 \n     percent of the funds would be apportioned in the ratio that \n     each State's number of public railway-highway grade crossings \n     with passive warning devices bears to such number in all \n     States.\n       Paragraph 164(a)(7) requires that at least one-half of the \n     railway-highway crossing funds authorized under this \n     subsection be made available for the installation of, and \n     educational and enforcement efforts on, protective devices at \n     railway-highway crossings. This paragraph expands this \n     protective devices set-aside to include enforcement and \n     education efforts; current law (23 U.S.C. 130(e)) makes these \n     funds available only for the installation of protective \n     devices.\n       Subparagraph 164(a)(8)(A) provides that the Federal share \n     payable on any project financed with railway-highway crossing \n     funds under this subsection shall be 90 percent of the cost \n     thereof. Subparagraph 164(a)(8)(B) permits railway-highway \n     crossing funds to be used as the local match on projects \n     eligible under this section where State law conditions the \n     use of State funds on such projects on the provision of local \n     matching funds.\n       Paragraph 164(a)(9) authorizes each State to transfer funds \n     from its railway-highway crossing apportionment to its hazard \n     elimination apportionment in an amount equal to the \n     percentage by which the number of crashes in the State has \n     been reduced (in the most recent calendar year) below the \n     average annual number of crashes that occurred in such State \n     in calendar years 1994, 1995, and 1996.\n       Paragraph 164(a)(10) authorizes States to make incentive \n     payments to local governments upon the permanent closure of \n     railway-highway crossings under such local governments' \n     jurisdiction. This paragraph also prohibits a State from \n     making an incentive payment unless the railroad that owns the \n     tracks on which crossing that is to be closed is located \n     makes an incentive payment to the local government \n     responsible for permanently closing such crossing. In \n     addition,\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\n     this paragraph limits the amount of the State payment to the \n     lesser of the railroad's contribution or $7,500, and it \n     requires local governments to use any State payment made \n     under this section for transportation safety improvements.\n       Paragraph 164(b)(1) authorizes the use of hazard \n     elimination funds on any highway safety improvement project.\n       Paragraph 164(b)(2) requires each State to conduct and \n     maintain a survey of all public roads to identify hazardous \n     locations, sections, and elements that may constitute a \n     danger to motorists and pedestrians, assign priorities for \n     the correction of such areas, and establish and implement a \n     schedule to complete these projects.\n       Paragraph 164(b)(3) requires each State to establish an \n     evaluation process to assess the results achieved by highway \n     safety improvement projects carried out under this \n     subsection.\n       Paragraph 164(b)(4) provides that hazard elimination funds \n     shall be apportioned to the States in a manner similar to \n     that provided in 23 U.S.C. 402(c): 75 percent based on each \n     State's population and 25 percent based on each State's \n     public road mileage. This provision is the same as the \n     apportionment formula currently in subsection 152(e), \n     however, under current law, funds are not apportioned in \n     accordance with the apportionment formula in 23 U.S.C. \n     152(f), but are distributed in accordance with 23 U.S.C. \n     133(d)(1), which provides that each State shall receive an \n     amount at least equal to the amount of funds made available \n     to the State for carrying out hazard elimination projects \n     under this provision in fiscal year 1991.\n       Subparagraph 164(b)(5)(A) provides that the Federal share \n     payable on account of any hazard elimination project shall be \n     90 percent of the cost thereof. Subparagraph 164(b)(5)(B) \n     authorizes the use of hazard elimination funds made available \n     under this subsection on any public road other than a highway \n     on the Interstate System.\n       Paragraph 164(b)(6) authorizes each State to transfer as \n     much as 100 percent of its hazard elimination apportionment \n     to either its highway safety apportionment under 23 U.S.C. \n     402 or its motor carrier safety allocation under 49 U.S.C. \n     31104 upon a determination by the Secretary that the State \n     would be eligible to receive an integrated safety fund grant \n     under 23 U.S.C. 165. This language is new. It replaces the \n     transferability language currently found in the first two \n     sentences of 23 U.S.C. 104(g), which permits States to \n     transfer 40 percent of their railway-highway crossing, hazard \n     elimination, and highway bridge replacement and \n     rehabilitation program (HBRRP) apportionments among these \n     three categories upon a finding by the Secretary that such \n     transfer is in the public interest. Subsection 104(g) also \n     permits the transfer of 100 percent of the apportionment \n     under one such program to the apportionment under any other \n     of such programs if the Secretary finds that such transfer is \n     in the public interest and the State satisfactorily assures \n     the Secretary that the purposes of the program from which \n     such funds will be transferred have been met. Paragraph \n     164(b)(6) does not provide for the transfer of funds between \n     the highway safety programs authorized under this section and \n     the HBRRP under 144, as subsection 104(g) does, because this \n     transfer authority has not been used by any State.\n       Paragraph 164(b)(7) provides that, for purposes of \n     subsection 164(b), the term ``State'' shall have the meaning \n     given this term in 23 U.S.C. 401.\n       Section 165 authorizes the Secretary to make grants of new \n     integrated safety funds to any State that the Secretary finds \n     has an integrated State highway safety planning process and \n     has established integrated goals and benchmarks for safety \n     improvements.\n       The amount of any grant made under this section in any \n     fiscal year shall be an amount equal to the percentage that \n     each eligible State's apportionment under 23 U.S.C. 402 for \n     such fiscal year bears to the total apportionment under \n     section 402 to all States for such fiscal year, but in no \n     case could the grant amount exceed 50 percent of the amount \n     apportioned to such State for fiscal year 1997 under section \n     402.\n       Any grant made under this section may be used by a State to \n     implement any highway or motor carrier safety program or \n     project eligible for funding under sections 23 U.S.C. 164 and \n     402 or chapter 311 of title 49, United States Code. Upon \n     receipt of a grant allocation under this section, a State \n     would transfer such allocation to the appropriate \n     apportionment or allocation under 23 U.S.C. 164 or 402 or 49 \n     U.S.C. 31104, and would administer such funds in accordance \n     with the requirements of these programs.\n       Paragraph (a)(3) of this section amends 23 U.S.C. 104(g) to \n     strike the current transferability language for railroad \n     highway crossing and hazard elimination funds, because this \n     language would be replaced by 23 U.S.C. 164(b)(6).\n       Subsection (b) of this section amends the analysis for \n     chapter 1 of title 23 by striking the section names relating \n     to sections 130 and 152 and by inserting the section names \n     for new sections 164 and 165.\n     Sec. 1025. Fiscal and Administrative Amendments\n       Subsection (a) of this section removes three obsolete \n     provisions from 23 U.S.C. 115 which are no longer applicable \n     to the Federal-aid highway program. The eligibility of bond \n     interest for Federal-aid reimbursement, currently in \n     paragraphs 115(b)(2) and (3), has been superseded by section \n     122, which was added by section 311 of the National Highway \n     System Designation Act of 1995. Subsection (c), concerning \n     the treatment of a project built without Federal funds, has \n     no current application.\n       Subsection (b) of this section removes an outdated \n     provision from 23 U.S.C. 118 regarding total payments to a \n     State in any fiscal year. In its place, this subsection \n     reinstates a provision that was once in 23 U.S.C. 118 but \n     which was inadvertently omitted when section 118 was amended \n     by section 1020 of the ISTEA. This reinstated provision \n     permits obligations incurred in prior fiscal years that are \n     released in a current fiscal year to be made available for \n     re-obligation in such current fiscal year.\n       Subsection (c) of this section technically amends 23 U.S.C. \n     120, concerning the Federal share payable on account of \n     Interstate projects and other title 23 projects, to conform \n     subsections 120(a) and (b) to subsection 120(i), which allows \n     for an increased non-Federal share. The amendment to 120(b) \n     also conforms this subsection to 23 U.S.C. 121, relating to \n     payments made to States for the cost of construction. \n     Subsection (c) also codifies as new subsection 120(j) the \n     current ISTEA section 1044, which allows States to apply toll \n     revenues used for specified capital improvements to their \n     non-Federal share requirement for projects under title 23. \n     This new subsection 120(j) also requires States taking \n     advantage of this credit provision to maintain their current \n     level of expenditures for matching the Federal share of title \n     23 projects.\n       Subsection (d) of this section amends 23 U.S.C. 121 to \n     remove a restriction which applies the Federal/non-Federal \n     matching rate to each payment that a State receives. The \n     Federal share requirements for grant programs under the \n     common rule implementing uniform administrative requirements \n     for grants and cooperative agreements generally applies to \n     the total cost of projects, rather than to individual voucher \n     payments. This amendment will therefore make the Federal-aid \n     highway program more compatible with other Federal programs, \n     particularly the Federal mass transportation program, where \n     projects are often administered jointly by the FHWA and the \n     FTA. This subsection also amends 121 to provide more \n     flexibility in administering the Federal share requirement by \n     allowing for adjustments in the Federal share during the \n     development of the project. The remaining changes made by \n     this subsection remove outdated provisions from section 121.\n       Subsection (e) strikes 23 U.S.C. 124(b), concerning the \n     construction of toll routes necessary to complete the \n     Interstate System, thereby removing this out of date \n     provision that is no longer necessary because the Interstate \n     System has been completed.\n       Subsection (f) strikes 23 U.S.C. 126, thereby removing this \n     outdated provision concerning the use of motor vehicle taxes \n     to fund highway construction projects.\n       A long-standing interpretation of 23 U.S.C. 302 has \n     prohibited the reimbursement of certain indirect costs to the \n     States which are generally allowed for grant programs under \n     the common rule establishing uniform requirements for grants \n     and cooperative agreements. The Federal Highway \n     Administration policy has been a contentious issue with State \n     and local governments since other federal agencies permit \n     States to charge indirect costs. Some States have developed a \n     separate indirect costs rate for the highway program. This \n     interpretation creates a particular burden when projects are \n     administered jointly with other programs, such as the Transit \n     Program. Subsection (g) of this section amends section 302 to \n     clarify that section 302 does not limit reimbursement of \n     eligible indirect costs to State and local governments. \n     Subsection 302(b), concerning arrangements with county \n     personnel to supervise the construction of projects on the \n     Federal-aid secondary system, is stricken as obsolete.\n       Public Law 87-441 relates to bridge commissions and \n     authorities created by Act of Congress. It provides for \n     Federal approval of such commissions' memberships and \n     requires annual audits. A commission ceases to exist by \n     transferring ownership of the bridge to the States. \n     Initially, five bridge commissions were subject to the act. \n     Today, only one commission remains, the White County Bridge \n     Commission, which operates the New Harmony Bridge across the \n     Wabash River between Indiana and Illinois. While under this \n     act, the FHWA has the authority to appoint commissioners and \n     review the commission's financial operations, we believe that \n     these actions could be administered more effectively and \n     efficiently at the State or local level. Subsection (h), in \n     repealing this 1962 bridge commission act, would remove this \n     unnecessary Federal oversight of the White County Bridge \n     Commission.\n     Sec. 1026. Federal Lands Highways Program\n     Subsection (a). Definitions\n       This subsection amends 23 U.S.C. 101(a) to include a new \n     definition of public lands highways (which excludes forest \n     roads) and it strikes the two definitions currently of public \n     lands highways currently in subsection 101(a).\n     Subsection (b). Federal Share Payable\n       This section amends 23 U.S.C. 120 by adding a new \n     subsection (j) to enable Federal land managing agencies (such \n     as the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \n     and the U.S. Forest Service) to pay the non-Federal share of \n     any Federal-aid highway project where the Federal share of \n     such\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\n     project is funded under 23 U.S.C. 104 or 144, or under the \n     Federal scenic byways program. This section also adds a new \n     subsection 120(k) to allow Federal Lands Highways Program \n     funds to be used as the non-Federal share of any Federal-aid \n     project providing access to or within Federal or Indian lands \n     and where the Federal share of such project is funded under \n     23 U.S.C. 104 or 144, or under the Federal scenic byways \n     program.\n     Subsection (c). Allocations\n       Subsection (c) amends section 202 to direct the Secretary \n     to allocate funds for two separate categories: the \n     discretionary public lands program and the forest highway \n     program. These two categories replace the current public \n     lands category, which was comprised of discretionary and \n     forest highways elements. The discretionary public lands \n     highway allocation is contained in subsection 202(b), and a \n     new subsection 202(e) is added for forest highways; this is \n     consistent with the structure of the Federal Lands Highways \n     program prior to the enactment of ISTEA.\n     Subsection (d). Availability of Funds\n       Subsection (d) makes conforming amendments to section 203 \n     to reflect the separate forest highways program and revised \n     public lands highways program. This subsection also provides \n     that the point of obligation (at which the Federal Government \n     is contractually obligated to pay its contribution to a \n     project) for Federal Lands Highways Program projects shall be \n     at the time the Secretary authorizes engineering and related \n     work for any such project, or at the time the Secretary \n     approves the plans, specifications, and estimates for any \n     such project.\n     Subsection (e). Planning and Agency Coordination\n       Subsection (e) amends subsections 204(a) and (b) to reflect \n     the separate forest highways program and revised public lands \n     highways program and to more accurately reflect the roles of \n     the various Federal agencies in Federal Lands Highways \n     Program projects. It also streamlines the inclusion of \n     Federal Lands Highways Program projects in Statewide and \n     metropolitan transportation improvement programs, providing \n     that the Secretary shall approve the transportation \n     improvement programs. Only regionally significant Federal \n     Lands Highways Program projects will be required to be \n     developed in cooperation with States and metropolitan \n     planning organizations. The Federal Highway Administration's \n     Federal Lands Highways Office would then approve all Federal \n     lands highway transportation improvement programs and submit \n     these to the appropriate States and metropolitan planning \n     organizations for inclusion in their transportation \n     improvement programs without further action.\n       Subsection (e) also revises subsection 204(i) to reflect \n     the current public lands program structure and to allow funds \n     to be made available to Federal land managing agencies for \n     transportation planning.\n       Subsection (e) also amends section 204 by adding a new \n     subsection (k) to establish a national bridge program for \n     replacing or rehabilitating deficient Indian reservation road \n     bridges. A minimum of $5 million in funds is reserved from \n     the Indian reservation roads program authorization for these \n     bridges. This program has criteria very similar to those of \n     the FHWA's current Indian reservation bridge program under 23 \n     U.S.C. 144.\n     Sec. 1027. Bicycle Transportation and Pedestrian Walkways\n       Subsection 217(b) of title 23, United States Code, \n     currently permits States to use their NHS apportionments on \n     bicycle transportation facilities on land adjacent to \n     highways on the National Highway System, other than \n     Interstate routes. Subsection (a) of this section amends 23 \n     U.S.C. 217(b) to include the construction of pedestrian \n     walkways as an eligible use of States' National Highway \n     System apportionments under the same criteria by which \n     bicycle transportation facilities are eligible. Subsection \n     (a) of this section also amends 217(b) to eliminate the \n     restriction on the use of NHS funds apportioned under \n     104(b)(1) for the construction of bicycle transportation \n     facilities on land adjacent to the Interstate System.\n       Subsection 217(e) currently provides for the safe \n     accommodation of bicycles on highway bridges as part of the \n     replacement or rehabilitation of highway bridge decks, except \n     if the bridges are located on highways where access is fully \n     controlled. Subsection (b) of this section amends subsection \n     217(e) to remove this restriction against safely \n     accommodating bicycles on highway bridges located on fully \n     access-controlled highways.\n       Subsection (c) of this section revises subsection 217(g) to \n     provide that bicyclists and pedestrians be given due \n     consideration in the comprehensive Statewide and metropolitan \n     planning processes, and that the inclusion of bicycle and \n     pedestrian facilities be considered, where appropriate, in \n     conjunction with all new construction and reconstruction of \n     transportation facilities, except where bicycle and \n     pedestrian use are not permitted. Subsection (c) also \n     retains, with minor modification, the requirement currently \n     in subsection 217(g) that transportation plans and projects \n     give due consideration to the safety and continuity of \n     bicycle and pedestrian facilities.\n       Subsection 217(h) currently provides that motorized \n     wheelchairs are permitted on trails and pedestrian walkways \n     when both State and local regulations permit them. \n     Subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section amend \n     subsections 217(h) and (i) to specifically define the type of \n     motorized wheelchairs permitted on trails and pedestrian \n     walkways.\n       Subsection (f) redesignates subsection 217(j) as 217(i).\n       In addition to adding a definition of ``wheelchair'' to \n     section 217, subsection (g) of this section also retains the \n     current definition of ``bicycle transportation facility'' and \n     adds a definition of ``pedestrian.'' The definitions of \n     ``pedestrian'' and ``wheelchair'' are consistent with the \n     definitions of those terms in the Uniform Vehicle Code (a \n     model uniform law on traffic ordinances that has been adopted \n     in many States) and, in defining a pedestrian to include a \n     mobility impaired person using a manual or motorized \n     wheelchair, they help ensure that both manual and powered \n     wheelchair users have the same mobility rights as \n     pedestrians.\n     Sec. 1028. Recreational Trails Program\n       This section amends title 23 of the United States Code to \n     add a new section to chapter two. Most of the provisions in \n     this new section, 206, were originally enacted into law as \n     part of the National Recreational Trails Fund Act (NRTFA) \n     which is Part B of Title I of the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), and were \n     codified in title 16, United States Code. By moving these \n     provisions from title 16 to title 23, this section \n     incorporates the Recreational Trails Program into the \n     Federal-aid Highway Program which is administered by the \n     Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Highway \n     Administration (FHWA) under title 23, U.S.C. This section \n     also removes the Recreational Trails Program from title 16 \n     which addresses programs that are usually administered by the \n     Department of the Interior. The provisions in Part B of title \n     I of the ISTEA establishing the National Recreational Trails \n     Advisory Committee are not among the provisions being added \n     to title 23. These provisions are simply being removed and \n     the National Advisory Committee is thereby abolished.\n       Subsection (a) amends title 23, U.S.C., to add this new \n     section 206 which is entitled ``Recreational Trails Program\" \n     instead of ``National Recreational Trails Program'', its \n     former name.\n       The new subsection 206(a) amends the preexisting subsection \n     (a) of the NRTFA by adding the provision that the Secretary \n     of Transportation will also consult with the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, in addition to the Secretary of the Interior, in \n     administering this program because the U.S. Forest Service is \n     a major partner in the Recreational Trails Program.\n       The new subsection 206(b) substantially revises the \n     preexisting subsection (c). The original paragraph (c)(1), \n     the transitional provision, expired December 18, 1994, and is \n     eliminated. The former paragraph (c)(2), the permanent \n     provision, is amended to reflect that it is currently in \n     effect, and is redesignated as subsection (b). The \n     preexisting paragraph (c)(3), establishing the Federal share \n     of the cost of Trails Program projects, which was added to \n     the NRTFA by the National Highway System Designation Act of \n     1995 (NHS Act) is moved to subsection 206 (e).\n       The new paragraph 206(b)(1) requires a State to designate \n     the State agency or agencies which will be responsible for \n     administering apportionments received under this section. \n     This requirement was previously found in subparagraph \n     (c)(2)(B).\n       The new paragraph 206(b)(2) requires a State to establish a \n     State trail advisory committee. This requirement was \n     previously found in the original subparagraph (c)(2)(A), but \n     in the new paragraph 206(b)(2), the term ``board'' is changed \n     to ``committee'' to reflect the name used in most States and \n     to eliminate any confusion as to whether a ``board'' is \n     different than a ``committee.''\n       The new subsection 206(c) limits the types of trails and \n     trail-related projects on which funds made available through \n     this program may be obligated. To be eligible for funding, \n     trail projects must be planned and developed in accordance \n     with the laws, policies, and administrative procedures of the \n     State. Subsection (c) also requires States to include trail \n     plans or trail plan elements in metropolitan and/or statewide \n     transportation plans in addition to requiring that these \n     trail plans be consistent with their Statewide Comprehensive \n     Outdoor Recreation Plan required by the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act. These provisions emphasize that trails \n     may form part of the metropolitan and State transportation \n     infrastructure. In addition, subsection (c) provides an \n     illustrative list of permissible activities on which funds \n     made available through this program may be obligated. \n     Subsection (c) also includes a provision requiring that at \n     least 50 percent of the funds received annually by a State be \n     used to facilitate the use of trails for diverse recreational \n     purposes, and one activity specifically encouraged is the \n     renovation of trails to accommodate both motorized and \n     nonmotorized trail use.\n       The new subsection 206(d) was formerly located in paragraph \n     (e)(5). This new subsection 206(d) requires States to give \n     priority to project proposals that provide for the redesign, \n     reconstruction, non-routine maintenance, or relocation of \n     existing trails in order to benefit the natural environment \n     or to mitigate the impact on the natural environment. \n     Paragraph (1) amends the preexisting provision to extend this \n     requirement to all trail projects. This change strengthens \n     the environmental aspects of this program\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\n     and ensures that project proposals for existing trails are \n     given priority over new trail projects. Paragraph (2), \n     formerly at (e)(5)(B), directs the State advisory committees \n     to issue guidance to the States for the purpose of \n     implementing paragraph (1).\n       The new subsection 206(e) addresses the Federal share \n     payable for projects under the Recreational Trails Program. \n     This subject was previously addressed in paragraph (c)(3). \n     This new subsection 206(e) first provides generally that the \n     Federal share payable on these projects is not to exceed 50 \n     percent. Paragraph 206(e)(1) addresses the fact that the \n     prohibition on matching Federal funds with other Federal \n     funds presents a problem for States where much of the \n     recreational activity, especially motorized use, takes place \n     on Federal lands. Consequently, paragraph (e)(1) allows a \n     Federal agency sponsoring a project to provide funding for \n     that project without those funds being credited as part of \n     the Federal share to be covered by the Secretary of \n     Transportation. However, this provision still requires State, \n     local, or private sponsors to provide some matching funds. \n     The new paragraph (e)(2) allows seven specific Federal grant \n     programs to be used by project sponsors to meet non-Federal \n     matching fund requirements. Trails projects are excellent \n     training and work opportunities for participants in youth \n     corp programs and work training programs. This provision will \n     allow States to meet training and employment goals and the \n     goals of the Trails Program simultaneously.\n       The new paragraph 206(e)(3) establishes a new programmatic \n     non-Federal share that allows States to satisfy non-Federal \n     share matching requirements on a programmatic level rather \n     than on a project-by-project basis. The former subparagraph \n     (c)(3)(B) would have established a programmatic non-Federal \n     share beginning in fiscal year 2001 and would have resulted \n     in a Federal share of approximately 83 percent for \n     Recreational Trails projects. Under the new paragraph (e)(3), \n     the programmatic non-Federal share goes into effect \n     immediately and the Federal share is set at 50 percent. The \n     programmatic non-Federal share provision gives the States \n     flexibility to receive credit for the non-Federal matching \n     funds which they are able to raise in excess of the required \n     non-Federal matching share on some projects. This credit may \n     be used by the States to cover part of the non-Federal \n     matching share on other projects for which they have \n     difficulty raising enough matching funds.\n       The new paragraph 206(e)(4) establishes a Federal share \n     payable for State administrative costs which conforms with \n     the Federal share payable for State costs incurred in \n     administering projects under other Federal-aid highway \n     programs. This paragraph clarifies that the 50 percent \n     limitation on the Federal share payable for projects under \n     the Trails Program does not apply to State administrative \n     costs. This new paragraph establishes the Federal share \n     payable for State administrative costs at 80 percent or \n     higher in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 120(b). The Federal share \n     is set higher than the Federal share payable for project \n     costs in order to lessen the burden of the Federal mandates \n     associated with this program. However, this paragraph does \n     require the States to cover some of the cost because this \n     program is voluntary. In addition, this provision reflects \n     the intent of the Federal government not to cover 100 percent \n     of the cost of statewide trail planning efforts because non-\n     Federal funding sources are available for many trails.\n       The new subsection 206(f) lists different activities for \n     which a State may not use funds apportioned to it under \n     section 206. These provisions were, for the most part, \n     formerly found in paragraph (e)(2). However, the new \n     subsection (f) does include one new item. The new paragraph \n     (f)(5) adds to the list of uses not permitted, funding of \n     railroad right-of-way development that would encourage users \n     to engage in any form of recreational activity on or between \n     railroad tracks. The term ``railroad tracks'' is intended to \n     include active and inactive lines and snow-covered tracks. \n     The addition of this item to the list is intended to \n     discourage use of railroad tracks to engage in recreational \n     activity including walking, hiking, horseback riding, cross \n     country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, rail biking, and \n     use of a motor car.\n       The new subsection 206(g) is a new provision which \n     incorporates some of the program management elements of the \n     former subsection (e) and adds some other paragraphs to \n     clarify these provisions and facilitate program management. \n     Paragraph (g)(1) provides that a project sponsor may donate, \n     either from a private or public source, funds, materials, \n     services, or right-of-way for the purposes of a project \n     eligible for assistance under this section. Private donations \n     are allowed under 49 CFR 18.24 and 23 U.S.C. 323, as amended \n     by the NHS Act, but this new paragraph clarifies the \n     legislative authority regarding private donations to the \n     Trails Program and establishes authority regarding donations \n     from Federal project sponsors, as well.\n       New paragraph (g)(2) provides that a project funded under \n     this section is intended to enhance recreational opportunity \n     and, as such, is not subject to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. \n     303, establishing a U.S. policy on lands, wildlife, and \n     waterfowl refuges and historic sites, or 23 U.S.C. 138, \n     which addresses the preservation of parklands, because \n     implementation of a Recreational Trails project would not \n     qualify as ``using'' a public park, recreation area, \n     wildlife and waterfowl refuge, or historic site for \n     purposes of those laws. As a result, Recreational Trails \n     Program projects are exempt from the ``Section 4(f)'' \n     requirements calling for analyses as to whether a \n     reasonable and feasible alternative to a project exists.\n       New paragraph (g)(3) provides that a State may treat funds \n     apportioned to it under this section as Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund apportionments for the purposes of section \n     6(f)(3) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. This \n     provision was formerly located at paragraph (e)(8). Section \n     6(f)(3) requires that projects funded under the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund Act remain in use as public outdoor \n     recreational facilities in perpetuity. Any conversion would \n     require approval of the Secretary of the Interior.\n       The new paragraph (g)(4) requires that, before making \n     apportionments available for work on recreational trails, a \n     State obtain written assurances, from the owner of any land \n     that would be affected by the work, that the land owner will \n     cooperate with the State. In addition, new paragraph (g)(4) \n     requires that any use of a State's apportionments on private \n     lands must be accompanied by an easement or other legally \n     binding agreement that ensures public access to those \n     recreational trail improvements. This provision was \n     previously located in paragraph (f)(2).\n       The new subsection 206(h) provides definitions for terms \n     used in the new section 206. Formerly, the definition section \n     was located in subsection (g). The definition of ``Fund\" as \n     referring to the National Recreational Trails Trust Fund is \n     removed because the Recreational Trails Program is no longer \n     funded through this trust fund which is also being abolished. \n     The Recreational Trails Program will now be funded through a \n     direct authorization of funds from the Highway Trust Fund. \n     Subsection (h) also deletes the definition for ``Nonhighway \n     recreational fuel'' because it is no longer needed. The \n     definition of ``Recreational trail'' from the former \n     definitions section is included in the new subsection 206(h), \n     but is revised to reorganize the uses into a logical order \n     and to add several new uses. In addition, this revision of \n     the recreational trail definition removes a reference to the \n     National Recreation Trails designated under the National \n     Trails System Act because that reference is unnecessary. The \n     definition of ``Motorized recreation'' used in the former \n     subsection (g) is revised to clarify that motorized \n     wheelchair use is not motorized recreational vehicles use. \n     This new definition is consistent with the Uniform Vehicle \n     Code. The new subsection 206(h) also includes a definition \n     for the term ``eligible State'' for purposes of subsection \n     104(h) of 23 U.S.C. which establishes the formula to be used \n     in apportioning funds authorized to be appropriated for the \n     Recreational Trails Program. The definition for ``eligible \n     State'' is the same as was previously used except that \n     subsection (h) incorporates the title 23 definition of State.\n       Subsection (b) contains several conforming amendments. \n     First, this subsection strikes part B of title I of ISTEA, \n     since this part is replaced by new sections 206 and 207 of \n     title 23, United States code. In addition, subsection (b) \n     revises the analysis for Chapter 2 of 23 U.S.C. to reflect \n     the addition of new sections 206 and 207.\n     Sec. 1029. International Highway Transportation Outreach \n         Program\n       Subsection (a) amends section 325 of title 23, U.S.C., to \n     clarify that the Secretary is authorized to conduct \n     activities aimed at improving United States' firms access to \n     foreign markets. Examples of these activities include \n     gathering and disseminating information about foreign market \n     opportunities and foreign industries, and encouraging the \n     adoption abroad of U.S. technical standards.\n       Subsection (b) revises subsection 325(c) of such title to \n     specify that funds deposited in the current special account \n     with the Secretary of the Treasury and funds available to \n     carry out this section can be used to reimburse the FHWA for \n     the salaries of its employees and the costs incurred by them \n     in assisting U.S. firms, with technical services unavailable \n     in the U.S. private sector, to develop and carry out proposal \n     for foreign transportation projects. These funding sources \n     may also be used to cover other necessary promotional, \n     travel, reception, and representation expenses.\n       Subsection (c) adds a new subsection to 23 U.S.C. 325 to \n     enable States to use their State Planning and Research \n     Program funds for international highway transportation \n     outreach activities under section 325.\n     Sec. 1030. Trade Corridor and Border Crossing Incentive \n         Grants; Border Gateway Pilot Program\n       This section directs the Secretary to provide grants for \n     planning and project implementation to improve transportation \n     at international border crossings and along major trade \n     transportation corridors. The section authorizes $45,000,000 \n     annually from the Highway Trust Fund to support the \n     activities directed. With the exception of specific sums \n     authorized for planning and coordination purposes under \n     subsections (a) and (b) of this section, all remaining funds \n     authorized under this section shall be used for project \n     implementation.\n       Paragraph (a)(1) of this section directs the Secretary to \n     make annual incentive grants to States and MPOs that share a \n     common border with Canada or Mexico for the purpose of \n     performing planning for efficient movement of people and \n     goods at and through international border gateways.\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\n       Paragraph (a)(2) requires the recipient, as a condition of \n     receiving the grant, to assure the Secretary that it is or \n     will commit to be engaged in joint planning with its \n     counterpart agency in Canada or Mexico.\n       Paragraph (b)(1) directs the Secretary to make grants to \n     States for the purpose of performing planning for the \n     efficient movement of goods along and within international \n     and interstate trade corridors.\n       Paragraph (b)(2) requires grant recipients to submit to the \n     Secretary plans for corridor improvements. Corridor planning \n     must be coordinated with transportation planning being \n     done by the States and MPOs along the corridor and, where \n     appropriate, with transportation planning being done in \n     Mexico and Canada.\n       Paragraph (b)(3) authorizes 2 or more States to enter into \n     agreements for purposes of coordinated trade transportation \n     corridor planning and administration.\n       Subsection (c) establishes a new border gateway pilot \n     program by authorizing the Secretary to make grants to States \n     and others to fund the development and implementation of \n     coordinated and comprehensive border crossing plans and \n     programs. The intent of this subsection is to promote the \n     efficient and safe use of existing border crossings within \n     defined international gateways, prior to major new \n     infrastructure investment, and to focus all available \n     resources on implementation of a fully integrated and \n     cooperatively developed plan, with special emphasis on full \n     coordination with border inspection agencies, including those \n     in Canada and Mexico.\n       Gateways are defined in ``Assessment of Border Crossings \n     and Transportation Corridors for North American Trade, Report \n     to Congress pursuant to Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991 Public Law 102-240, Sections 1089 and \n     6015'' as ``groupings of border crossings defined by \n     proximity and similarity of trade.'' The gateways identified \n     in this report are: Maine; Montreal South; Eastern New York; \n     Niagara; Michigan; Upper Plains; Central Plains; Eastern \n     Washington/Rocky Mountains; Pacific Coast; South Texas; West \n     Texas; Arizona; and California. Other defined gateways may be \n     included at the discretion of the Secretary.\n       Paragraph (c)(1) authorizes the Secretary to make grants to \n     States and others sharing a common border with Canada or \n     Mexico for any project to improve the movement of people and \n     goods at and across such border.\n       Paragraph (c)(2) limits the maximum number of total grants \n     under this pilot program at eight (including at least two on \n     the U.S./Mexico border and two at the U.S./Canada border) and \n     limits the maximum dollar total of any single grant to $40 \n     million. Projects may vary in scope, with varying degrees of \n     Federal participation. Approval should not be given to fund \n     any one project which will exhaust the entire annual \n     authorization for this pilot program.\n       Paragraph (c)(3) lists the grant eligibility criteria for \n     this pilot program. In recognition of the potential delays \n     associated with border clearance and vehicle/driver review \n     processes, each project proposal shall reflect cooperation \n     and coordination with the U.S. Federal Inspection Services \n     and their counterparts across the Mexican or Canadian border, \n     as appropriate. Grants shall be made on the basis of the \n     expected reduction in commercial and other travel time \n     through a major international gateway as a result of the \n     project; improvements in vehicle safety at and approaching \n     the crossings within the gateway; the degree of funding \n     leveraging anticipated through this program, including the \n     use of innovative financing, and funding provided under other \n     sections of this Act (which shall not be subject to the \n     limits of this section); the degree of binational involvement \n     in the project; the degree of applicability of innovative and \n     problem solving techniques which might be applicable to other \n     border crossings; and a demonstrated local commitment to \n     implement and sustain continuing comprehensive border \n     improvement programs. Project proposals must be limited, to \n     the greatest extent possible, to improvements to existing \n     border crossings within defined gateways. Construction of new \n     facilities, including bridges, shall not be considered unless \n     and until all options for efficient use of existing \n     facilities has been demonstrated.\n       Subsection (d) authorizes $45 million in Highway Trust Fund \n     monies for this border crossing pilot program in each of \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2003. This subsection also sets the \n     annual amount of the grants for the purposes of performing \n     border gateway planning at $1,400,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2003. The maximum amount any State or MPO \n     may receive in grants under this section shall not exceed \n     $100,000. These planning grants should be used to supplement \n     State planning and research, planning, and other funds that \n     are used to support long-range planning and programming which \n     are to be implemented using the border gateway pilot program \n     funds and other funds such as State and local funds, NHS, and \n     STP. Subsection (d) also makes $3,000,000 available in each \n     of fiscal years 1998 through 2003 for trade corridor planning \n     incentive grants under this section.\n       Subsection (e) provides that border gateway funds \n     authorized under this section may be used as the non-Federal \n     match for any border gateway project funded with other \n     Federal-aid highway funds, provided that the amount of border \n     gateway funds cannot exceed 50 percent of project costs. \n     Subsection (e) also provides that the Federal share payable \n     on account of any border crossing or trade corridor planning \n     incentive grant shall be determined in accordance with \n     section 120 of title 23, United States Code.\n     Sec. 1031. Appalachian Development Highway System\n       This section amends 40 U.S.C. App. 201, the Appalachian \n     Regional Development Act of 1965, to authorize $2.19 billion \n     for fiscal years 1998 through 2003 to fund the continued \n     construction of the Appalachian development highway system in \n     the 13 States that comprise the Appalachian region.\n       Subsection (a) of this section amends subsection 201(a), \n     which currently provides that all provisions of title 23 \n     apply to the development highways funded under this \n     provision, to include an exemption from the title 23 \n     provision (23 U.S.C. 118) that all apportioned or allocated \n     funds that have not been obligated by the end of four years \n     shall lapse. As revised, subsection 201(a) provides that \n     funds not expended by a State within four years shall be \n     released to the Appalachian Regional Commission for \n     reallocation to States within the Appalachian region, rather \n     than lapsing.\n       Subsection (b) of this section amends subsection 201(g) to \n     authorize appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2003 (and also provides contract \n     authority), and an equivalent amount of obligation authority, \n     to fund the continued construction of the Appalachian \n     development highway system in accordance with section 201. \n     This subsection also limits eligibility for these funds to \n     the development highway system authorized as of September 30, \n     1996. However, the States of the Appalachian region, the \n     Secretary, and the Appalachian Regional Commission may \n     agree to make alterations to the September 30, 1996, \n     approved system, and such altered routes shall be eligible \n     for funding under this section.\n       Subsection (c) of this section amends paragraph 201(h)(1) \n     to raise the Federal share payable on account of any pre-\n     financed (i.e., advance construction) development highway \n     project to 80 percent of the cost of such project, which is \n     the same Federal share payable for conventionally funded \n     development highway projects under subsection 201(f). This \n     amendment enables States to use the advance construction \n     financing method of paragraph 201(h)(1) under the same \n     Federal matching ratio as for all other development highway \n     projects.\n       Subsection (d) of this section authorizes the deduction of \n     up to 3.75 percent of the funds authorized under new \n     paragraph 201(g)(2) for the expenses of the Appalachian \n     Regional Commission in administering such funds.\n     Sec. 1032. Value Pricing Pilot Program\n       Subsection (a) of this section amends subsection 1012(b) of \n     the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 \n     to reflect the change in the name of the congestion pricing \n     pilot program to the value pricing pilot program.\n       Subsection (b) increases the number of pilot programs \n     eligible for funding under subsection 1012(b) from 5 to 15.\n       Subsection (c) of this section amends paragraph 1012(b)(2) \n     to increase the Federal share payable on any project funded \n     under this provision from 80 percent to 100 percent.\n       Subsection (d) of this section further amends paragraph \n     1012(b)(2) to reflect administrative interpretations of this \n     paragraph that have made by the Federal Highway \n     Administration, shared with the appropriate congressional \n     committees, and published in the Federal Register. \n     Specifically, paragraph 1012(b)(2) is amended to provide that \n     the Secretary shall fund pre-implementation costs of value \n     pricing programs and that the 3-year funding limitation \n     included in this paragraph commences once the project is \n     implemented, and therefore does not apply to the pre-\n     implementation stage of a project (which could stretch out \n     for several years).\n       Subsection (e) makes necessary conforming amendments to \n     subsection 1012(b) to reflect that each cooperative agreement \n     entered into by the Secretary under paragraph 1012(b)(1) \n     would cover a specific value pricing program for the area \n     encompassed by the cooperative agreement. Each program could, \n     in turn, cover one or more specific value pricing projects \n     within that area. This subsection also makes a purely \n     technical correction to the list of items to be examined and \n     reported on to the Congress by the Secretary.\n       Subsection (f) amends paragraph 1012(b)(3) to expand the \n     eligible use of toll revenues generated by any pilot project \n     under this subsection from any eligible use under title 23, \n     United States Code, to any surface transportation purpose.\n       Subsection (g) removes the 3-program cap on the number of \n     value pricing programs on which the Secretary shall allow the \n     use of tolls on the Interstate System, thereby enabling State \n     and local governments and public authorities to collect tolls \n     on any value pricing pilot program funded under this section.\n       Subsection (h) adds one item, the effects of value pricing \n     projects on low income drivers, to the list of items on which \n     the Secretary is to report to the Congress under paragraph \n     1012(b)(5). This subsection also adds a new paragraph to \n     section 1012(b) to provide that any value pricing pilot \n     program funded under this subsection shall give full \n     consideration to the potential effects of value pricing \n     projects on drivers of all income levels\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\n     and shall develop mitigation measures to deal with potential \n     adverse effects on low income drivers, thereby making income \n     equity a key consideration in the development of pilot \n     projects.\n       Subsection (i) revises paragraph 1012(b)(6) to reauthorize \n     Federal-aid highway funding for this program at a level of \n     $14 million for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2003 out of \n     the Highway Trust Fund, and provides that, in the event such \n     funds remain unallocated or allocated and unobligated after \n     four years, a State's unallocated or unobligated amounts \n     shall be transferred to the State's STP apportionment. This \n     subsection also eliminates the current funding cap on \n     individual projects.\n       Subsection (j) provides an exemption from the HOV-2 \n     requirement of subsection 102(b) of title 23, United States \n     Code, by permitting single occupancy vehicles to operate in \n     high occupancy vehicle lanes if such vehicles are part of a \n     value pricing program funded under subsection 1012(b).\n       Subsection (k) ensures that this program will continue to \n     have contract authority.\n       Sec. 1033. Highway Use Tax Evasion Projects\n       Subsection (a) of this section technically amends \n     subsection 1040(a) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991 to correct the reference to the \n     funding provision of section 1040.\n       Subsection (b) strikes subsection 1040(d) to eliminate the \n     requirements for the Secretary of Transportation to annually \n     report to Congress on motor fuel tax enforcement activities \n     under this section and the expenditure of funds made \n     available to carry out this section, and for the Secretary of \n     the Treasury to annually report to Congress on the increased \n     enforcement activities to be financed with the funds \n     allocated by the Secretary of Transportation to the Internal \n     Revenue Service under subsection 1040(a). The Department has \n     found that other available avenues for reporting on program \n     successes, such as congressional hearings held on this \n     program, have been very effective. Subsection (b) also \n     strikes subsection 1040(e), which requires that the Secretary \n     of Transportation, in consultation with the Internal Revenue \n     Service, study the feasibility and desirability of using dye \n     and markers to aid in motor fuel tax enforcement activities \n     and report to Congress on this study by December 18, 1992. \n     This study has been completed and its results submitted to \n     Congress, so this subsection is no longer necessary. \n     Subsection (b) also deletes the out-of-date funding \n     authorization language for fiscal years 1992 through 1997, \n     which has been replaced by subsection (d) of this section.\n       Subsection (c) redesignates subsection 1040(g) as \n     subsection 1040(e).\n       Subsection (d) of this section amends section 1040 to \n     authorize $5 million annually in Highway Trust Fund monies \n     for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2003 to continue joint \n     Federal Highway Administration/Internal Revenue Service/State \n     motor fuel tax compliance projects across the country. The \n     multi-State nature of the enforcement and uniformity efforts \n     developed under this pilot project in ISTEA has been \n     important to its effectiveness. Continued Federal funding at \n     the same level authorized in ISTEA will help ensure that this \n     very successful, coordinated regional and national approach \n     to combating fuel tax fraud can continue.\n       Sec. 1034. Public Notice of Railbanking\n       This section would require that public notice be given once \n     an application for interim trail use of a railroad right-of-\n     way has been filed. Currently, a notice must be published in \n     local newspapers announcing a rail abandonment. However, \n     there is no notice requirement when a railroad right-of-way \n     is proposed to be converted to a trail. This provision would \n     allow all members of the community to work together as equal \n     partners in establishing such trails.\n\n\n                        TITLE II--HIGHWAY SAFETY\n\n       Sec. 2001. Short Title\n       Sec. 2001 provides that title II may be cited as the \n     ``Highway Safety Act of 1997''.\n       Sec. 2002. Highway Safety Programs\n       Sec. 2002 continues the existing State and community \n     highway safety program, established under Section 402 of \n     title 23, United States Code, and amends the program as \n     follows:\n       Subsection (a), ``Uniform Guidelines,'' and Subsection (b), \n     ``Administrative Requirements,'' make several technical and \n     conforming amendments to Sections 402(a) and (b).\n       Subsection (c), ``Apportionment of Funds,'' makes one \n     technical correction to Section 402(c) and one substantive \n     amendment. To increase the effective delivery of the Section \n     402 program to the more than 500 Federally recognized Indian \n     tribes, an amendment is provided to raise the minimum annual \n     apportionment to the Indians (through the Secretary of \n     Interior) from one-half of one percent to three-fourths of \n     one percent of the total apportionment under the section.\n       Subsection (d), ``Application in Indian Country,'' amends \n     Section 402 to allow Section 402 grants to be made to Indian \n     tribes in ``Indian Country.''\n       Subsection (e), ``Rulemaking Process,'' amends Section \n     402(j), which requires the periodic identification, by \n     rulemaking, of highway safety programs that are most \n     effective in reducing traffic crashes, injuries, and deaths. \n     Instead of requiring the States to direct the resources of \n     the national program to the fixed areas identified by this \n     rulemaking process, the amendment directs that the States to \n     consider these highly effective programs when developing \n     their highway safety programs.\n       Subsection (f), ``Safety Incentive Grants,'' proposes to \n     add four new safety incentive programs concerning alcohol-\n     impaired driving countermeasures, occupant protection, \n     highway safety data, and drugged driving countermeasures \n     (described below) to Section 402, together with a new \n     provision making various procedures applicable to each of \n     those programs.\n       Section 402(k), ``Safety Incentive Grants,'' replaces an \n     obsolete subsection (k) and makes the following applicable to \n     each of the four incentive programs: (1) the grants for the \n     incentive programs may only be used by the States to \n     implement and enforce, as appropriate, the programs for which \n     the grants are made; (2) no grant may be made to a State in \n     any fiscal year unless the State enters into an agreement \n     with the Secretary to ensure that the State will maintain its \n     aggregate expenditures from all other sources for the actions \n     for which a grant is provided at or above the level of such \n     expenditures in its two fiscal years prior to the date of \n     enactment of the subsection; and (3) basic or supplemental \n     grants applicable under the programs, in any one of these two \n     grant categories, would be available to the States for a \n     maximum of six years, beginning after September 30, 1997. \n     States that meet certain criteria would receive grants that \n     would be funded through a declining Federal share--75 percent \n     for the first and second years, 50 percent for the third and \n     fourth years, and 25 percent for the fifth and sixth years.\n       Section 402(l), ``Alcohol-Impaired Driving \n     Countermeasures,'' amends Section 402 to establish a \n     comprehensive drunk and impaired driving incentive program to \n     encourage States to increase their level of effort and \n     implement effective programs aimed at deterring the drunk \n     driver. The new program, which continues the Department's \n     strong emphasis on deterring drinking and driving, is similar \n     in structure to that of the existing Section 410 drunk \n     driving prevention incentive program, established under \n     Section 410 of Title 23, United States Code, and would \n     replace the Section 410 program when its terms expire at the \n     end of fiscal year 1997.\n       A State may establish its eligibility for one or more of \n     three basic alcohol- impaired-driving countermeasure grants--\n     A, B, and C--in the fiscal year in which the grant is \n     received, by adopting or demonstrating certain criteria, as \n     appropriate, to the satisfaction of the Secretary.\n       To establish eligibility for the first basic grant A under \n     paragraph (1), a State must adopt or demonstrate at least 4 \n     of 5 of the following: (1) an administrative driver's license \n     suspension or revocation system for drunk drivers; (2) an \n     effective system for preventing drivers under age 21 from \n     obtaining alcoholic beverages; (3)(A) a statewide program for \n     stopping motor vehicles on a nondiscriminatory, lawful basis \n     to determine whether the operators are driving while under \n     the influence of alcohol, or (B) a statewide impaired driving \n     Special Traffic Enforcement Program (STEP) that includes \n     heavy emphasis on publicity for the program; (4) effective \n     sanctions for repeat offenders convicted of driving while \n     intoxicated or driving under the influence of alcohol; and \n     (5) a three-tiered graduated licensing system for young \n     drivers that includes nighttime driving restrictions, \n     requiring that all vehicle occupants to be properly \n     restrained, and providing that all drivers under age 21 \n     are subject to zero tolerance at .02 percent BAC or \n     greater while operating a motor vehicle.\n       To establish eligibility for the second basic grant B under \n     paragraph (2), a State must adopt both an administrative \n     driver's license suspension or revocation system for drunk \n     drivers, and a law that provides for a per se law setting .08 \n     BAC level as intoxicated.\n       To establish eligibility for the third basic grant C under \n     paragraph (3), a State must demonstrate that its percentage \n     of fatally injured drivers with 0.10 percent or greater blood \n     alcohol concentration has both: (1) decreased in each of the \n     3 most recent calendar years for which statistics for \n     determining such percentages are available; and (2) been \n     lower than the average percentage for all States in each of \n     such calendar years.\n       States that meet the criteria for a basic grant under \n     paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) would receive, for each grant, up \n     to 15 percent (up to 30 percent if they qualify for two, and \n     up to 45 percent if they qualify for all three) of their \n     fiscal year 1997 apportionment under Section 402 of Title 23, \n     United States Code.\n       States that meet the criteria for any one or more of the \n     three basic grants also would be eligible to receive \n     supplemental grants for one or more of the following: (1) \n     making it unlawful to possess open containers of alcohol in \n     the passenger area of motor vehicles (excepting charter \n     buses) while on the road; (2) adopting a mandatory BAC \n     testing program for drivers in crashes involving fatalities \n     or serious injuries; (3) videotaping of drunk drivers by \n     police; (4) adopting and enforcing a ``zero tolerance'' law \n     providing that any person under age 21 with a BAC of .02 or \n     greater when driving a motor vehicle shall be deemed driving \n     while intoxicated or driving under the influence of alcohol, \n     and further providing for a minimum suspension of the \n     person's driver's license of not less than 30 days; (5) \n     requiring a self-sustaining impaired driving program; (6) \n     enacting and enforcing a law to reduce incidents of driving \n     with suspended licenses; (7) demonstrating\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\n     an effective tracking system for alcohol-impaired drivers; \n     (8) requiring an assessment of persons convicted of abuse of \n     controlled substances, and the assignment of treatment for \n     all DWI and DUI offenders; (9) implementing a program to \n     acquire passive alcohol sensors to be used by police in \n     detecting drunk drivers; and (10) enacting and enforcing a \n     law that provides for effective penalties or other \n     consequences for the sale or provision of alcoholic beverages \n     to a person under 21. For each supplemental grant criterion \n     that is met, a State would receive, in no more than two \n     fiscal years, an amount up to 5 percent of its Section \n     402 apportionment for fiscal year 1997. Definitions are \n     provided for ``alcoholic beverage,'' ``controlled \n     substances,'' ``motor vehicle,'' and ``open alcoholic \n     beverage container.''\n       Section 402(m), ``Occupant Protection Program,'' amends \n     Section 402 to establish a new occupant protection incentive \n     program to encourage States to increase their level of effort \n     and implement effective laws and programs aimed at increasing \n     safety belt and child safety seat use.\n       A State may establish its eligibility for one or both of \n     two basic occupant protection grants--A and B--in the fiscal \n     year in which the grant is received, by adopting or \n     demonstrating certain criteria, as appropriate, to the \n     satisfaction of the Secretary.\n       To establish eligibility for the first basic grant A under \n     paragraph (1), a State must adopt or demonstrate at least 4 \n     of the following: (1) a law that makes unlawful throughout \n     the State the operation of a passenger motor vehicle whenever \n     a person in the front seat of the vehicle (other than a child \n     who is secured in a child restraint system) does not have a \n     safety belt properly secured about the person's body; (2) a \n     provision in its safety belt use law that provides for its \n     primary enforcement or provides for the imposition of penalty \n     points against a person's diver's license for its violation; \n     (3) a law requiring children up to 4 years of age to be \n     properly secured in a child safety seat in all appropriate \n     seating positions in all passenger motor vehicles; (4) a \n     minimum fine of at least $25 for violations of its safety \n     belt use law and a minimum fine of at least $25 for \n     violations of its child passenger protection law; and (5) a \n     statewide occupant protection Special Traffic Enforcement \n     Program (STEP) that includes heavy emphasis on publicity for \n     the program.\n       To establish eligibility for the second basic grant B under \n     paragraph (2), a State must: (1) demonstrate a statewide \n     safety belt use rate in both front outboard seating positions \n     in all vehicle types covered by the State's safety belt use \n     law, of 80 percent or higher in each of the first three years \n     a grant is received, and of 85 percent or higher in each of \n     the fourth, fifth, and sixth years a grant is received; and; \n     (2) follow safety belt use survey methods which conform to \n     guidelines issued by the Secretary ensuring that such \n     measurements are accurate and representative.\n       States that meet the criteria for a basic grant under \n     paragraphs (1) or (2) would receive, for each grant, up to 20 \n     percent (up to 40 percent if they qualify for both) of their \n     fiscal year 1997 apportionment under Section 402 of Title 23, \n     United States Code.\n       States that meet the criteria for one or both of the two \n     basic grants also would be eligible to receive supplemental \n     grants for one or more of the following: (1) requiring the \n     imposition of penalty points against a driver's license for \n     violations of child passenger protection requirements; (2) \n     having no non-medical exemptions in effect in their safety \n     belt and child passenger protection laws; (3) demonstrating \n     implementation of a statewide comprehensive child occupant \n     protection education program that includes education about \n     proper seating positions for children in air bag equipped \n     motor vehicles and how to reduce the improper use of child \n     restraint systems; (4) having in effect a law that prohibits \n     persons from riding in the open bed of a pickup truck; and \n     (5) having in effect a law that requires safety belt use by \n     all rear-seat passengers in all passenger motor vehicles with \n     a rear seat. For each supplemental grant criterion that is \n     met, a State would receive an amount up to 5 percent of its \n     Section 402 apportionment for fiscal year 1997. Definitions \n     are provided for ``child safety seat,'' ``motor vehicle,'' \n     ``multipurpose passenger vehicle,'' ``passenger car,'' \n     ``passenger motor vehicle,'' and ``safety belt.''\n       Section 402(n), ``State Highway Safety Data Improvements,'' \n     amends Section 402 to establish a new incentive program to \n     encourage States to take effective actions to improve the \n     timeliness, accuracy, completeness, uniformity, and \n     accessibility of the data they need to identify the \n     priorities for State and local highway and traffic safety \n     programs, to evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, and \n     to link these data, including traffic records, together and \n     with other data systems within the State, such as medical and \n     economic data. Currently, much of the State data in these \n     areas are inadequate or unavailable. The Department believes \n     that the new incentive program under this subsection is vital \n     to the ability of the States to determine and achieve their \n     highway safety performance goals.\n       A State would be eligible for a first-year grant in a \n     fiscal year under paragraph (1)(A) of subsection (n) if it \n     demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that it \n     has (1) established a Highway Safety Data and Traffic Records \n     Coordinating Committee with a multi-disciplinary membership \n     including the administrators, collectors, and users of such \n     data (including the public health, injury control, and motor \n     carrier communities) of highway safety and traffic records \n     databases; (2) completed a recent (within the last five \n     years) highway safety data and traffic records assessment or \n     audit of its highway safety data and traffic records system; \n     and (3) initiated the development of a multi-year highway \n     safety data and traffic records strategic plan to be approved \n     by the Highway Safety Data and Traffic Records Coordinating \n     Committee that identifies and prioritizes the State's highway \n     safety data and traffic records needs and goals, and that \n     identifies performance-based measures by which progress \n     toward those goals will be determined.\n       A State also would be eligible for a first-year grant in a \n     fiscal year under paragraph (1)(B) of subsection (n) if it \n     provides, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, (1) \n     certification that it has established a Highway Safety Data \n     and Traffic Records Coordinating Committee with a multi-\n     disciplinary membership including the administrators or \n     managers of highway safety and traffic records databases and \n     representatives of the collectors and users of these data; \n     (2) certification that it has completed a recent (within the \n     last five years) highway safety data and traffic records \n     assessment or audit of their highway safety data and traffic \n     records system; (3) a multi-year plan that identifies and \n     prioritizes the State's highway safety data and traffic \n     records needs and goals, that specifies how its incentive \n     funds for the fiscal year will be used to address those needs \n     and the goals of the plan, and that identifies performance-\n     based measures by which progress toward those goals will be \n     determined; and (4) certification that the Highway Safety \n     Data and Traffic Records Coordinating Committee continues to \n     operate and support the multi-year plan described under \n     paragraph (1)(B).\n       A State that meets the criteria for a first-year grant \n     under paragraph (1)(A) would receive an amount equal to \n     $125,000, based on available appropriations. A State that \n     meets the criteria for a first-year grant under paragraph \n     (1)(B) would receive an amount equal to a proportional amount \n     of the amount apportioned to the State for fiscal year 1997 \n     under Section 402 of title 23, U.S. Code, except that no \n     State would receive less than $225,000, based on available \n     appropriations.\n       A State would be eligible for a grant in any fiscal year \n     succeeding the first fiscal year in which they receive a \n     State highway safety data and traffic records grant if the \n     State, to the Secretary's satisfaction: (1) submits or \n     updates a multi-year plan that identifies and prioritizes the \n     State's highway safety data and traffic records needs and \n     goals, that specifies how its incentive funds for the fiscal \n     year will be used to address those needs and the goals of the \n     plan, and that identifies performance-based measures by which \n     progress toward those goals will be determined; (2) certifies \n     that its Highway Safety Data and Traffic Records Coordinating \n     Committee continues to support the multi-year plan; and (3) \n     reports annually on its progress in implementing the multi-\n     year plan.\n       A State that meets the criteria for a succeeding-year grant \n     in any fiscal year would receive an amount equal to a \n     proportional amount of the amount apportioned to the State \n     for fiscal year 1997 under Section 402 of title 23, U.S. \n     Code, except that no State shall receive less than $225,000, \n     based on available appropriations.\n       Section 402(o), ``Drugged Driving Countermeasures,'' amends \n     Section 402 to establish a new incentive program to encourage \n     States to take effective actions to improve State drugged \n     driving laws and related programs. State drugged driving laws \n     are inconsistent and frequently difficult to enforce. They \n     often seriously hamper attempts by law enforcement and courts \n     to deter drugged driving. The Department believes that the \n     new incentive grant program under this subsection, modeled \n     after the Department of Transportation's successful Section \n     410 alcohol-impaired driving incentive grant program under \n     title 23 U.S. Code, is essential to improve State drugged \n     driving laws and related activities. This incentive program \n     is separate from subsection (l)'s incentive program for \n     alcohol-impaired driving, which revises and replaces Section \n     410, so that drugged driving laws and activities receive the \n     more focused attention they deserve.\n       A State would be eligible for a grant in a fiscal year \n     under subsection (o) if it demonstrates, to the satisfaction \n     of the Secretary, 5 or more of the following 9 criteria: (1) \n     enact zero tolerance laws that make it illegal to drive with \n     any amount of an illicit drug in the driver's body; (2) \n     establish that it\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\n     is illegal to drive while impaired by any drug (licit or \n     illicit); (3) allow drivers to be tested for drugs if there \n     is probable cause to suspect impairment; (4) suspend the \n     driver's license administratively (without criminal \n     proceedings) for persons driving under the influence of \n     drugs; (5) suspend the driver's license for persons convicted \n     of other drug offenses, even if not related to driving; (6) \n     incorporate drug use and drugged driving provisions into a \n     graduated licensing system for beginning drivers; (7) \n     actively enforce and publicize drugged driving laws; (8) \n     provide an intervention program for drugged drivers that \n     incorporates assessment and drug education, counseling, or \n     other treatment as needed; and (9) provide drug education \n     information to persons applying for or renewing drivers' \n     licenses and include drug-related questions on drivers' \n     license examinations.\n       A State that meets the criteria for a grant under \n     subsection (o) would receive an amount up to 20 percent of \n     its Section 402 apportionment for fiscal year 1997. \n     Definitions are provided for ``alcoholic beverage,'' \n     ``controlled substances,'' and ``motor vehicle.''\n       Subsection (g), ``Conforming Amendment,'' repeals Section \n     410 of title 23, U.S. Code (``Alcohol-impaired driving \n     countermeasures''), and the analysis pertaining to Section \n     410 under chapter 4 of this title.\n     Sec. 2003. National Driver Register\n       Sec. 2003 would add several provisions to the National \n     Driver Register (NDR) statute (chapter 303 of title 49, U.S. \n     Code) to make the program more effective and efficient. The \n     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) \n     manages the NDR, which was established by Congress in July \n     1960 as a central index of State reports on individuals whose \n     driving privileges have been suspended or revoked. \n     Applications for driver licenses are checked routinely by \n     States against the NDR to identify ineligible license \n     applicants, problem drivers, drivers in need of improvement, \n     and drivers under suspension or revocation.\n       Subsection (a), ``Transfer of Selected National Driver \n     Register Functions to Non-Federal Management,'' amends \n     Section 30302 of title 49, U.S. Code (``National Driver \n     Register''), by adding a new subsection (e). Under subsection \n     (e), the Secretary would be authorized to decide whether to \n     enter into an agreement with an organization that represents \n     the interests of the States to manage, administer, and \n     operate the National Driver Register's (NDR) computer \n     timeshare and user assistance functions.\n       NDR operations are divided into five main functions: (1) \n     data processing, accomplished by computer timeshare; (2) \n     external support services, accomplished by staff assistance \n     to NDR users; (3) development and maintenance of software for \n     data processing, accomplished by staff responsible for system \n     and applications support; (4) Federal Privacy Act \n     requirements support, accomplished by Federal staff; and (5) \n     overall management and supervision (including assistance to \n     non- State NDR users, manual preparation of needed data, \n     public information, and media relations), accomplished by \n     Federal staff. Legislation is required to permanently \n     transfer one or more of these functions, since existing \n     statutory provisions and government contracting regulations \n     do not permit one or more of these NDR functions to be \n     assigned to a designated non-Federal organization.\n       If the Secretary decides to enter into an agreement with an \n     organization that represents the interests of the States to \n     manage, administer, and operate the NDR's computer timeshare \n     and user assistance functions, subsection (e) directs that: \n     (1) the Secretary ensure any management of these functions is \n     compatible with chapter 303 of title 49, U.S. Code, and the \n     regulations issued to implement that chapter; (2) any \n     transfer of these functions begin only after the Secretary \n     makes a determination that all States are participating in \n     the NDR's ``Problem Driver Pointer System,'' the system used \n     by the NDR to effect the exchange of motor vehicle driving \n     records, and that this system is functioning properly; (3) \n     the agreement to transfer these functions include a provision \n     for a transition period to allow the States time to make any \n     budgetary and legislative changes needed in order to pay fees \n     for using these functions; (4) the total of the fees charged \n     by the organization representing the interests of the States \n     in any fiscal year for the use of these functions not exceed \n     the organization's total cost for performing these functions \n     in that fiscal year; and (5) nothing in subsection (e) be \n     interpreted to diminish, limit, or in any way affect the \n     Secretary's authority to carry out chapter 303 of title 49, \n     U.S. Code. The last provision affirms the Secretary's overall \n     responsibility for the NDR (which includes Privacy Act and \n     data security requirements), regardless of any transfer of \n     these functions.\n       Subsection (b), Access to Register Information, amends \n     Section 30305 (``Access to Register information'') of title \n     49, U.S. Code. Subsection (b)(1) amends Section 30305(b)(2) \n     to make two technical conforming amendments.\n       Subsection (b)(2) amends Section 30305(b) to add two \n     substantive provisions. The first would eliminate a \n     deficiency in the NDR by extending participation to Federal \n     departments or agencies, like the State Department, that both \n     issue motor vehicle operator's licenses and transmit reports \n     on individuals to the NDR about whom the department or agency \n     has such licensing authority and has (1) denied a motor \n     vehicle operator's license for cause; (2) revoked, suspended \n     or canceled a motor vehicle operator's license for cause; or \n     (3) about whom the department or agency has been notified of \n     a conviction of any of the motor vehicle-related offenses or \n     comparable offenses listed in subsection 30304(a)(3). The \n     reports on these individuals transmitted by the Federal \n     department or agency must contain the identifying information \n     specified in subsection 30304(b).\n       Subsection (b) also would reduce a burden on the States and \n     strengthen the NDR's efficiency by allowing Federal agencies \n     authorized to receive NDR information to make their requests \n     and receive the information directly from the NDR, instead of \n     through a State. The NDR statute currently requires \n     authorized NDR users, other than chief driver licensing \n     officials and the individuals to whom the information \n     pertains, to submit all NDR inquiries through a State.\n     Sec. 2004. Authorizations of Appropriations\n       Sec. 2004 contains provisions that would authorize \n     appropriations out of the Highway Account of the Highway \n     Trust Fund for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n     programs.\n       Paragraph (a)(1)(A), ``Consolidated State Highway Safety \n     Programs,'' would authorize appropriations to carry out the \n     State and Community Highway Safety Program under Section 402 \n     of title 23, United States Code, by the National Highway \n     Traffic Safety Administration, except for the Section 402 \n     incentive programs under subsections (l), (m), (n), and (o), \n     of $166,700,000 for each of fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, \n     2001, and 2002, and $171,034,000 for fiscal year 2003. This \n     paragraph consolidates the previously separate NHTSA and FHWA \n     authorizations for appropriations for the Section 402 program \n     under NHTSA, continuing a  process begun by Congress in \n     fiscal year 1997 to facilitate administrative efficiencies \n     in the program.\n       Paragraph (1)(B), ``Consolidated State Highway Safety \n     Programs,'' would authorize appropriations to carry out the \n     alcohol-impaired driving countermeasures incentive grant \n     provisions of subsection (l) of Section 402 of title 23, \n     United States Code, by the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration, of $44,000,000 for fiscal year 1998, \n     $39,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, \n     $49,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and $50,170,000 for fiscal \n     year 2003. Amounts made available to carry out subsection (l) \n     are authorized to remain available until expended, provided \n     that, in each fiscal year the Secretary may reallocate any \n     amounts remaining available under subsection (l) to \n     subsections (m), (n), and (o) of Section 402 of title 23, \n     United States Code, as necessary to ensure, to the maximum \n     extent possible, that States may receive the maximum \n     incentive funding for which they are eligible under these \n     programs.\n  Paragraph (1)(C), ``Consolidated State Highway Safety Programs,'' \nwould authorize appropriations to carry out the occupant protection \nprogram incentive grant provisions of subsection (m) of Section 402 of \ntitle 23, United States Code, by the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, of $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1998, 1999, \n2000, and 2001, $22,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and $22,312,000 for \nfiscal year 2003. Amounts made available to carry out subsection (m) \nare authorized to remain available until expended, provided that, in \neach fiscal year the Secretary may reallocate any amounts remaining \navailable under subsection (m) to subsections (l), (n), and (o) of \nSection 402 of title 23, United States Code, as necessary to ensure, to \nthe maximum extent possible, that States may receive the maximum \nincentive funding for which they are eligible under these programs.\n       Paragraph (1)(D), ``Consolidated State Highway Safety \n     Programs,'' would authorize appropriations to carry out the \n     State highway safety data improvements incentive grant \n     provisions of subsection (n) of title 23, United States Code, \n     by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, of \n     $12,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and \n     2001. Amounts made available to carry out subsection (n) are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.\n       Paragraph (1)(E), ``Consolidated State Highway Safety \n     Programs,'' would authorize appropriations to carry out To \n     carry out the drugged driving countermeasures incentive grant \n     provisions of subsection (o) of title 23, United States Code, \n     by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \n     paragraph (l) also would authorize $5,000,000 for each of \n     fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, and $5,130,000 for \n     fiscal year 2003. Amounts made available to carry out \n     subsection (o) are authorized to remain available until \n     expended, provided that, in each fiscal year the Secretary \n     may reallocate any amounts remaining available under \n     subsection (o) to subsections (l), (m), and (n) of Section \n     402 of title 23, United States Code, as necessary to ensure, \n     to the maximum extent possible, that States may receive the \n     maximum incentive funding for which they are eligible under \n     these programs.\n       Paragraph (2), ``NHTSA Operations and Research,'' would \n     authorize appropriations for the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration to carry out programs and activities \n     with respect to traffic and highway safety under (A) Section \n     403 of title 23, U.S. Code (Highway Safety Research and \n     Development), (B) Chapter 301 of title 49, U.S. Code\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\n     (Motor Vehicle Safety), and (C) Part C of Subtitle VI of \n     title 49, U.S. Code (Information, Standards, and \n     Requirements), of $147,500,000 for each of fiscal years 1998, \n     1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, and $151,335,000 for fiscal year \n     2003.\n       The authorizations under paragraph (2) would provide the \n     necessary funds for the agency to carry out essential traffic \n     and highway safety functions. Section 403 of title 23, U.S. \n     Code, provides for highway safety research and development \n     activities, including programs to improve highway safety \n     through human factors research, evolving initiatives such as \n     intelligent transportation systems, a comprehensive \n     assessment of the agency's data needs and the data priorities \n     of the highway safety community, public information programs, \n     and university research and training. Chapter 301 of title \n     49, U.S. Code, provides for the establishment and enforcement \n     of safety standards for new motor vehicles and motor vehicle \n     equipment, together with supporting research. In keeping with \n     the Department's policy that programs with identifiable users \n     be funded as much as possible through user fees, support of \n     the motor vehicle safety program, which clearly benefits \n     highway users, is shifted to the Highway Account of the \n     Highway Trust Fund. Part C of Subtitle VI of title 49, U.S. \n     Code, provides for the establishment of low-speed collision \n     bumper standards, consumer information activities, odometer \n     regulations, automobile fuel economy standards, and motor \n     vehicle theft prevention standards. In keeping with the \n     Department's policy that programs with identifiable users be \n     funded as much as possible through user fees, support of the \n     motor vehicle information and cost savings programs, which \n     clearly benefit highway users, is shifted to the Highway \n     Trust Fund's Highway Account.\n       Paragraph (3), ``National Driver Register,'' would \n     authorize appropriations for the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration to carry out chapter 303 of title 49, \n     U.S. Code (National Driver Register), appropriated under \n     section 30308(a) of chapter 303, of $2,300,000 for each of \n     fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, and $2,360,000 \n     for fiscal year 2003. The National Driver Register (NDR) \n     provides information needed by the States to identify \n     ineligible applicants for motor vehicle driver licenses, \n     problem drivers, drivers in need of improvement, and drivers \n     under license suspension or revocation.\n\n\n           TITLE III--MASS TRANSPORTATION AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n     Sec. 3003. Definitions\n       Section 3003 would amend section 5302, ``Definitions.''\n       Section 5302(a)(1), ``capital project,'' would be amended \n     by combining from other parts of the chapter all definitions \n     covering capital programs in this provision. This \n     consolidation would make the substantive change of applying \n     the broader definition to all capital grants made under this \n     chapter. Further, by amending existing subparagraph (A), it \n     would add as an eligible cost  three new cost categories: \n     associated pre-revenue startup costs, environmental \n     mitigation, and Intelligent Transportation Systems (as \n     defined in section 6052 of the National Economic \n     Crossroads Transportation Efficiency Act). The phrase \n     ``capital portions of rail trackage rights agreements'' \n     would be amended to ``payments for rail trackage rights'' \n     as a clarification. (For the Government's share of the \n     costs for the various categories of capital projects, see \n     section 3028 of this Act, ``Government's Share of \n     Costs.'')\n       A new subparagraph (E) would be added to the existing \n     ``capital project'' definition, to permit preventive \n     maintenance as an eligible capital cost to ensure proper \n     preservation of the Federal capital investment. This will \n     make eligibility of preventive maintenance for capital \n     program funds the same as in the Title 23 highway program.\n       New subparagraph (F) would add leasing to the definition. \n     This provision would be moved from section 5307(b)(3).\n       New subparagraph (K), a combination of provisions moved \n     from sections 5309(f)(2), 5309(a)(1)(E), 5307(b)(1), would \n     make joint development costs eligible for all capital \n     programs. Transit operators would be permitted to participate \n     more fully in joint development opportunities created by mass \n     transit projects. The change would provide additional local \n     revenue sources to meet transit capital and operating needs \n     without Federal subsidy. Participation in commercial \n     development would continue to be prohibited except where a \n     fair share of the proceeds were returned for use in meeting \n     mass transit needs.\n       Subparagraph (L) (moved from section 5309(a)(1)(F)) would \n     add to the definition mass transportation projects that meet \n     the special needs of the elderly and disabled individuals.\n       A new subparagraph (M) regarding the development of \n     corridors to support fixed guideway systems was moved from \n     section 5309(a)(1)(G).\n       A new subparagraph (N) would add to the definition, \n     vehicles and facilities, publicly or privately owned, that \n     are used to provide intercity passenger service by bus or \n     rail. This change would enhance intermodalism and facilitate \n     modal choices by local decision makers.\n       A new subparagraph (O) regarding access for bicycles to \n     mass transportation facilities was moved from section 5319.\n       A new subparagraph (P) would add to the definition the \n     repayment of the principal and interest of revenue bonds used \n     for capital projects. This change would increase the \n     financing options and sources of funds for recipients.\n       A new subparagraph (Q) regarding crime prevention and \n     security was moved from section 5321.\n       A new subparagraph (R) would allow the acquisition of non-\n     fixed route paratransit transportation service to comply with \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n       Subsections (a)(10) and (13) would be added to clarify that \n     both ``public transportation'' and ``transit'' mean ``mass \n     transportation.''\n     Section 3004. Metropolitan Planning\n       Section 3004 and section 1015 of this Act are intended to \n     make identical changes to 49 U.S.C. section 5303, \n     ``Metropolitan Planning'' and 23 U.S.C. section 134, \n     ``Metropolitan Planning,'' respectively.\n       Subsection (a), ``Development Requirements,'' would be \n     amended to require that transportation plans and programs for \n     State urbanized areas be developed in a ``fair and \n     equitable'' manner. It would also require that plans and \n     programs provide for the development and integrated \n     management and operation of transportation systems and \n     facilities that will function as an intermodal transportation \n     system for the metropolitan area, the State, and the United \n     States.\n       Subsections (b), ``Plan and Program Factors,'' paragraphs \n     (1) through (15) containing the existing 16 factors would be \n     deleted. New subsection (b)(1) would require that \n     Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) comply with seven \n     new goals, found in subparagraphs (A) through (G), in \n     developing plans and programs. These are: economic vitality; \n     safety and security; accessibility and mobility; environment, \n     energy conservation, and quality of life; integration and \n     connectivity; efficient management and operation; and \n     preservation of existing transportation system.\n       New subsection (b)(2) would require MPOs to cooperate with \n     States and transit operators in incorporating these goals \n     into the transportation plan.\n       Subsection (c), ``Designating Metropolitan Planning \n     Organizations.'' Paragraph (1)(A) would be amended to reduce \n     the threshold required for designating or redesignating an \n     MPO for an urbanized area with a population of more than \n     50,000. Representatives of local governments with 51 percent \n     of the affected population must support the designation of \n     the MPO, rather than 75 percent, as in current law. This \n     change would make it easier to redesignate an MPO and \n     recognizes the importance the MPO plays in local \n     transportation planning. Also permitted would be designation \n     under procedures established by State law.\n       Under subsection (c)(2), specific reference would be made \n     to the policy board of the MPO, rather than the more general \n     reference to the MPO for the purpose of specifying MPO \n     composition.\n       Subsection (c)(3) would be amended to add the MPO and the \n     Secretary of DOT as key participants, along with the chief \n     executive officer (existing law) in determining the need to \n     create multiple MPO's to serve a single metropolitan planning \n     area. It also would create balance with the lowered threshold \n     for local officials (51 percent) to request redesignation, \n     allowing the Secretary to temper local actions under \n     subsection (c)(4)(B)(i) and (c)(5).\n       Subsections (c)(5) (B) and (C) would be deleted because MPO \n     redesignated would be covered in subsection (c)(3) and (4). \n     Subsection (c)(5)(A) would be redesignated subsection (c)(5).\n       Subsection (d), ``Metropolitan Area Boundaries,'' would be \n     amended to freeze the connection to nonattainment boundaries \n     to those existing at the end of FY 1996 and would prevent an \n     automatic increase in the metropolitan planning area with \n     changes in nonattainment boundaries. Subsection (d) would \n     also allow the Governor and the MPO (including the central \n     city) to affirmatively increase the boundary to the \n     nonattainment limit rather than retroactively reduce it after \n     being forced to increase the boundaries. New urbanized areas \n     after FY 1996 would have their metropolitan planning \n     boundaries agreed to by the Governor and local officials and \n     particulate matter would be added as a consideration in the \n     designation of metropolitan planning area boundaries. \n     Regulations, guidance, or both will address the operational \n     issues. The practical effect will not materialize until after \n     the 2000 census.\n       Subsection (e), ``Coordination.'' Paragraph (3) would be \n     amended by substituting ``coordinate'' for ``consult'' \n     between MPO's where more than one MPO has authority within an \n     existing metropolitan planning area. It would also add \n     particulate matter to non-attainment areas.\n       The catchline of subsection (f) would be changed from \n     ``Developing Long-Range Plans'' to ``Development of \n     Transportation Plan'' to emphasize the transportation focus \n     rather than the time frame. In subsection (f)(1), ``long-\n     range plan'' would be changed to ``transportation plan.'' \n     Subsection (f)(1)(A) would be amended so that the plan \n     identifies transportation facilities that function as a \n     ``future'' integrated transportation system rather than as \n     ``an integrated metropolitan transportation system.'' New \n     subsection (f)(1)(B) would be added to require that the \n     planning process address the same seven planning goals in \n     subsection (b) of section 5303. Subsection (f)(1)(B) would be \n     redesignated (f)(1)(C), current (f)(1)(C) would be \n     redesignated as (f)(1)(D), and current (f)(l)(D)\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\n     would be deleted. Redesignated subsection (f)(1)(C)(iii) \n     would be amended to change financial techniques of value \n     capture, tolls, and congestion pricing to simply ``any \n     additional financing strategies,'' thus enhancing \n     flexibility. Redesignated subsection (f)(1)(D)(ii) would be \n     amended by deleting reference to ``vehicle'' congestion. New \n     subsection (f)(1)(D)(iii) would be added to enhance \n     transportation access for individuals without private \n     automobiles.\n       Subsection (f)(2) would be amended to require MPOs, transit \n     operators, and States to cooperate in developing estimates of \n     funds that could become available to implement the plan.\n       Subsection (f)(3) would be amended to require air and \n     transportation agencies to cooperate on both the State \n     Implementation Plan (SIP) development and transportation plan \n     development processes. Development of transportation plans is \n     expected to account for related investments and program \n     strategies developed through other planning activities, e.g., \n     economic development and revitalization. Such coordination \n     would ensure that transportation projects and programs would \n     consider, for example, the needs of low income communities so \n     that they would be effectively integrated with transportation \n     investments.\n       Subsection (f)(4) would be amended to add freight shippers \n     to the list of stakeholders that can comment on the \n     transportation plan.\n       The catchline of subsection (h) would be changed from \n     ``Balanced and Comprehensive Planning'' to ``Metropolitan \n     Planning Grants.''\n     Sec. 3005. Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Program\n       Section 3005 and section 1015 of this Act are intended to \n     make identical changes to 49 U.S.C. section 5304, \n     ``Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Program'' and 23 \n     U.S.C. section 134, ``Metropolitan Planning,'' respectively.\n       The title of section 5304 would be changed from \n     ``Transportation Improvement Program'' to ``Metropolitan \n     Transportation Improvement Program'' to clarify the focus on \n     the metropolitan program.\n       Subsection (a), ``Development and Update,'' would be \n     amended to add freight shippers to the list of stakeholders \n     that could comment on the program Transportation Improvement \n     Program (TIP) and to require the MPO, in cooperation with the \n     State and transit operators, to provide opportunities for \n     public comment on the proposed program.\n       Subsection (b), ``Contents.'' Paragraph (1) would change \n     the listing of projects included in the TIP to be more \n     inclusive. Paragraph (2) would be changed to require that \n     financial plans identify ``innovative financing techniques'' \n     rather than ``innovative financing, including value capture, \n     tolls, and congestion pricing,'' to give local authorities \n     greater flexibility. Paragraph (2) would also require a \n     cooperative process for developing financial estimates on \n     which to base TIP development.\n       Subsection (c), ``Project Selection'' would clarify that \n     States and recipients select projects from the TIP developed \n     by the MPO, rather than select projects to be included in the \n     TIP. The development of the TIP is the responsibility of the \n     MPO.\n       Subsection (d), ``Notice and Comment,'' would require the \n     MPO, ``in cooperation with the State and transit operators,'' \n     to provide opportunity for public comment prior to approving \n     the TIP.\n       Subsection (e), ``Regulatory Proceeding,'' requiring FTA to \n     adopt the FHWA environmental analysis process under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 would be \n     deleted because it has already been accomplished.\n     Sec. 3006. Transportation Management Areas\n       Section 3006 and section 1015 of this Act are intended to \n     make identical changes to 49 U.S.C. section 5305, \n     ``Transportation Management Areas'' and 23 U.S.C. section \n     134, ``Metropolitan Planning.''\n       Section 5305 (a), ``Designation.'' Paragraph (2) would be \n     amended to delete the reference to Lake Tahoe because the \n     area has not benefited from the existing provision, which \n     allowed the area to be designated as a Transportation \n     Management Area (TMA) but did not give them MPO status and \n     eligibility for planning funds.\n       Subsection (c), ``Congestion Management System,'' would be \n     amended to delete the requirement for a phase-in schedule for \n     congestion management systems because this has already been \n     accomplished.\n       Subsection (d), ``Project Selection,'' would be clarified \n     to provide that States and transit operators select projects \n     from the TIP developed by the MPO, rather than select \n     projects for inclusion in the TIP. Development of the TIP is \n     the responsibility of the MPO. Paragraphs (2)(A) and (B) \n     would be deleted as extraneous.\n       Subsection (e), ``Certification.'' Paragraph (1) would be \n     amended to clarify that the Secretary certifies the planning \n     process rather than the planning organization. Paragraph (2) \n     would be amended to eliminate date references that were \n     originally included to implement the new certification \n     requirements of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991 (P.L. 102-240) (ISTEA) and to \n     eliminate the mandatory penalty of 20 percent of Surface \n     Transportation Program (STP) attributable funds if an area is \n     not certified after September 30, 1996. The penalty for lack \n     of certification would no longer be limited to 20 percent of \n     STP attributable funds. It would be whatever portion of those \n     funds the Secretary determines to be appropriate.\n       Subsection (f), ``Additional Requirements for Certain \n     Nonattainment Areas,'' would be amended to add particulate \n     matter to ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment \n     classifications in TMAs for purpose of funding certain \n     projects.\n       Subsection (g), ``Areas Not Designated Transportation \n     Management Areas.'' Paragraph (2) would be amended to \n     prohibit the Secretary from allowing abbreviated \n     transportation plans and programs for metropolitan areas in \n     nonattainment status for particulate matter in addition to \n     ozone and carbon monoxide.\n       A new subsection (h), ``Transfer of Funds,'' would allow \n     the transfer of funds on the transfer of funds for highway \n     projects under FTA and for transit projects under FHWA. This \n     provision would be moved here from 23 U.S.C. section 104.\n       A new subsection (i), ``Limitation on Statutory \n     Authority,'' would be added to clarify that this section does \n     not give an MPO authority to impose legal requirements on any \n     transportation provider, facility, or project that is not \n     eligible for Federal transit assistance.\n       Sec. 3007. Statewide Planning\n       Section 3007 would amend section 5306 by moving the entire \n     section, ``Private enterprise participation in metropolitan \n     planning and transportation improvement programs and \n     relationship to other limitations,'' to subparagraph (K) of \n     section 5323, ``General Provisions on Assistance.'' This \n     change makes room for the new section 5306, ``Statewide \n     Planning.''\n       It is intended that new section 5306 parallel the current \n     requirement for ``Statewide Planning'' in title 23 (23 U.S.C. \n     section 135). This is not a substantive change because 23 \n     U.S.C. section 135 already applies to grants under chapter 53 \n     of title 49 by reference. The language included in chapter 53 \n     of title 49 would be identical to that contained in 23 U.S.C. \n     section 135, after the following substantive changes are \n     made.\n       Subsection (a) ``General Requirements.'' New subsection (a) \n     would add emphasis on operations and management to underscore \n     the need to maintain the existing transportation system and \n     to support implementation of Intelligent Transportation \n     Systems (ITS). The need for ``fair and equitable'' treatment \n     within the planning process for all areas of the State would \n     also be emphasized.\n       Subsection (b), ``Scope of the Planning Process,'' would be \n     amended to include seven broad clusters of goals found in \n     paragraphs (1)(A) through (G) which would encompass the 20 \n     planning factors in ISTEA. These include the broad categories \n     of the economic vitality; safety and security; accessibility \n     and mobility; environment, energy conservation, and the \n     quality of life; integration and connectivity; management and \n     operation; and preservation of the existing transportation \n     system. These are the same planning factors as in amended \n     section 5303(b).\n       Paragraph (2) would require the application of goals in \n     each State to be made through cooperative arrangements \n     between the State and those involved in the statewide \n     planning process. This would be demonstrated through \n     application in transportation decision making and is meant to \n     give planning officials greater flexibility.\n       New paragraph (3)(A) would incorporate existing language on \n     coordination.\n       Subsection (c), ``Transportation Plan'' would include \n     reordered and clarified language from that presently in 23 \n     U.S.C. section 135 concerning coordination of statewide \n     planning with metropolitan planning and the concerns of \n     Indian tribal governments. Subsection (c) would also clarify \n     that the statewide plan would cover a 20-year time frame. \n     Freight shippers would be added to the list of interested \n     parties to which the State must provide a reasonable \n     opportunity to comment on the proposed plan. Also added would \n     be new language calling for consultation between the State \n     and local elected officials outside the metropolitan planning \n     area boundaries when developing the Statewide plan for such \n     non-metropolitan areas. Development of transportation plans \n     is expected to account for related investments and program \n     strategies developed through other planning activities, e.g., \n     economic development and revitalization. Such coordination \n     would ensure that transportation projects and programs would \n     consider, for example, the needs of low income communities so \n     that they would be effectively integrated with transportation \n     investments.\n       Subsection (d), ``State Transportation Improvement \n     Program,'' would reflect the focus on the statewide program. \n     Freight stakeholders would be added to the list of parties \n     that the State must provide reasonable opportunity to comment \n     on the proposed State Transportation Improvement Program \n     (STIP). Paragraph (1) would require consultation between \n     State and local transportation officials outside the \n     metropolitan area when developing the program for such \n     non-metropolitan areas. Paragraph (2) would emphasize that \n     projects included in the STIP for metropolitan areas must \n     be identical to the approved metropolitan TIP for each \n     area. Paragraph (3) would clarify that for areas under \n     50,000 in population the projects would be selected from \n     the approved STIP and the State must consult with affected \n     local officials. Paragraph (4) would direct the Secretary, \n     before approving the STIP, to find\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\n     that the STIP was developed through a planning process \n     that was consistent with Federal transportation planning \n     requirements. Such approval would be required at least \n     every two years.\n       Subsection (e), ``Statewide Planning Grants,'' describes \n     the formula grant program for Statewide transit planning. \n     This provision would be moved from section 5313(b).\n       Subsection (f), ``Other Eligible Activities,'' would permit \n     States to use funds under this section to supplement \n     metropolitan planning grants under section 5303(h)(2)(A) and \n     grants under the Transit Cooperative Research Program under \n     section 5313(a).\n       Subsection (g), ``Period of Availability,'' would make \n     funds available for 3 years after the fiscal year of \n     apportionment, after which remaining funds would be \n     reapportioned among the States.\n       Subsection (h), Exclusion of Certain United States \n     Territories,'' would clarify that section 5306 would not \n     apply to the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, \n     or the Virgin Islands.\n\n                Sec. 3008. Urbanized Area Formula Grants\n\n       Section 3008 would change the title of section 5307 from \n     ``Block grants'' to ``Urbanized area formula grants'' to \n     better reflect the contents of this section.\n       Subsection (a), ``Definitions.'' Paragraph (1) would be \n     amended to delete the definition of ``associated capital \n     maintenance items'' because of the changes that would be made \n     to section 5302, ``Definitions;''; the expanded definition \n     for preventive maintenance would includes costs for \n     associated capital maintenance items, thus making this \n     definition extraneous.\n       Subsection (b), ``General Authority.'' Paragraph (1) would \n     allow the following eligible grant activities: capital \n     projects, under subparagraph (A); planning, under a new \n     subparagraph (B); financing the operating costs of equipment \n     used in mass transportation in urbanized areas with a \n     population of less than 200,000, under subparagraph (C); the \n     transportation cooperative research program, under a new \n     subparagraph (D); the university transportation centers, \n     under a new subparagraph (E); training, under a new \n     subparagraph (F); research, under a new subparagraph (G); and \n     technology transfer, under a new subparagraph (H). \n     Subparagraphs (A) through (C) are in existing subsection \n     (b)(1). Subparagraph (C) would be amended to limit operating \n     assistance to only areas under 200,000; new section \n     5302(a)(1)(E) allowing preventive maintenance is intended to \n     provide areas of over 200,000 with funds to maintain their \n     assets, thus offsetting the loss of operating assistance.\n       Subsection (b)(2) would be amended by adding subparagraph \n     (C), which was moved from current subsection (b)(5). This \n     subparagraph permits funds to be used for a highway project \n     only if local funds are eligible to finance either highway or \n     transit projects, i.e., are flexible.\n       Subsection (b)(3) would be deleted because leasing would \n     now be eligible under the consolidated section 5302(a)(1)(F), \n     ``Definitions.''\n       Subsection (b)(4) would be deleted because the new \n     definition of preventive maintenance in section 5302(a)(1)(E) \n     would include costs for associated capital maintenance items.\n       Subsection (c), ``Public Participation Requirements,'' \n     would be deleted because the public participation \n     requirements are included in the planning process under \n     sections 5303 through 5306 and are not needed as a separate \n     requirement under the urbanized area formula grant program.\n       Subsection (d) ``Grant Recipient Requirements'' would be \n     redesignated subsection (c). Redesignated subsection (c), \n     would eliminate the requirement for a separate program of \n     projects as a streamlining effort because one is already \n     required in the planning process. It would also require that \n     projects be selected only from those included in the STIP.\n       Redesignated (c)(1)(A) through (C) regarding the \n     certification of legal, financial, technical capacity, \n     continuing control over the use of equipment and facilities, \n     and maintenance of equipment and facilities would be moved \n     from section 5307 to section 5323(i) and (j) as general \n     conditions of assistance and would now apply program wide. \n     Redesignated subsection (c)(1)(E) would be deleted and moved \n     into a consolidated section 5325 ``Contract Requirements.'' \n     Redesignated subsection (c)(1)(F) would be deleted as \n     extraneous.\n       Subsection (e), ``Government's Share of Costs,'' would be \n     deleted because this requirement would be consolidated in a \n     new section 5328 and applied program-wide.\n       Subsection (g), ``Undertaking Projects in Advance,'' would \n     be deleted because advance construction requirements would be \n     consolidated for program-wide application in a new section \n     5319 ``Advance Construction Authority.''\n       Subsection (h), ``Streamlined Administrative Procedures,'' \n     would be deleted as extraneous.\n       Subsection (j), ``Reports,'' would be deleted as not \n     necessary.\n       Subsection (k), ``Submission of Certifications,'' would be \n     deleted because submissions of certifications would be moved \n     to and consolidated in section 5323(j) for program-wide \n     application as a streamlining effort.\n       Subsection (n), ``Relationship to Other Laws.'' Paragraph \n     (1) would be deleted and consolidated into section 5323(i). \n     Subsection (n)(2) would be redesignated subsection (h).\n     Sec. 3009. Mass Transit Account Block Grants\n       Section 3009 would delete current section 5308, ``Mass \n     Transit Account Block Grants'' because this section applied \n     to a one year capital program in Fiscal Year 1981 and has \n     been executed.\n     Sec. 3010. Major Capital Investments\n       Section 3010 would change the title of section 5309 from \n     ``Discretionary Grants and Loans'' to ``Major Capital \n     Investments'' because the fixed guideway modernization \n     program would be merged with the urbanized area formula \n     grants program (see section 3034 of this Act) and the bus \n     discretionary program would be eliminated.\n       Subsection (a), ``General Authority.'' All capital project \n     definitions contained in subparagraphs (1) (A) through (G) \n     would be moved to section 5302, ``Definitions.''\n       Paragraph (2) would be amended to remove the Secretary's \n     authority to make loans. Paragraph (2) concerning the \n     Secretary's authority to apply all appropriate terms, \n     conditions, requirements, and provisions to grants under \n     section 5309 does not provide the Secretary with authority to \n     waive statutory requirements, such as the application of \n     Federal labor standards, civil rights requirements, or \n     employee protective arrangements.\n       A new paragraph (3) would be added so that funds made \n     available under section 5309 may be transferred to section \n     5311 (Formula Program for Other than Urbanized Areas \n     recipient) and would be administered under the requirements \n     of section 5311.\n       Subsection (b), ``Loans for Real Property Interests'' would \n     be deleted.\n       Subsection (c), ``Consideration of Decreased Commuter Rail \n     Transportation'' would be deleted because this provision \n     applied to the establishment of Conrail as a private \n     corporation in 1986 and is obsolete.\n       Subsection (d), ``Project as Part of Approved State Program \n     of Projects'' would be redesignated subsection (b) and \n     retitled ``Project as Part of Approved State Improvement \n     Program,'' to be consistent with changes made to redesignated \n     5307(c)(1) (existing section 5307(d)(1)). Subsections (d)(1) \n     and (2) concerning the requirements for legal, financial, and \n     technical capacity and maintenance of equipment or facilities \n     that applied to section 5309 would be moved to section \n     5323(i) and (j) and would apply program-wide.\n       Subsection (e), ``Criteria for Grants and Loans for Fixed \n     Guideway Systems'' would be redesignated subsection (c) and \n     renamed ``Criteria for Grants for Fixed Guideway Systems.'' \n     Paragraph (1)(A) would be amended by deleting ``contract'' \n     and substituting ``grant agreement'' to reflect current \n     practice. Paragraphs (3)(A) and (B) would be deleted as \n     extraneous since these project approval requirements of \n     mobility improvements, environmental benefits, cost \n     effectiveness, and operating efficiencies would be covered in \n     paragraph (2)(B). Paragraph (6)(B) would be amended to \n     clarify which determinations made by the Secretary would be \n     expedited if the project was contained in a State Improvement \n     Program in a nonattainment area. Paragraph (6)(C) would be \n     amended by removing ``completely'' and substituting \n     ``substantially'' to provide greater flexibility in \n     application of this subsection to a part of a project \n     financed with flexible highway funds.\n       Subsection (f) ``Required Payments and Eligible Costs of \n     Projects that Enhance Urban Economic Development or \n     Incorporate Private Investment'' would be redesignated \n     subsection (d). Paragraphs (2)(A) and (B) would be moved and \n     consolidated into the definition of eligible capital project \n     costs contained in section 5302(a)(1)(K).\n       Subsection (h), ``Government's Share of Net Project Costs'' \n     would be moved and consolidated into the new section 5328 of \n     the same name.\n       Subsections (i)-(k) on loan term requirements would be \n     eliminated.\n       Subsection (m), ``Allocating Amounts.'' Paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) regarding allocations for FY 1993 through FY 1997 would \n     be deleted because section 5309 would now cover major capital \n     investments, rather than fixed guideway modernization and bus \n     discretionary funds. Paragraph (4) would be deleted as \n     extraneous because the amended section would no longer \n     include three different allocations. Paragraph (3) would be \n     redesignated subsection (g) and entitled ``Report to \n     Congress.''\n       Subsection (n), ``Undertaking Projects in Advance,'' would \n     be deleted because advance construction authority would apply \n     program wide under section 5319.\n       Subsection (o), ``Use of Deobligated Amounts,'' which \n     allowed deobligated funds to be used for any purpose under \n     this section would be deleted because the section would now \n     apply only to major capital investments.\n     Sec. 3011. Formula Grants for Special Needs of Elderly \n         Individuals and individuals with Disabilities\n       Section 3011 would change the title of section 5310 from \n     ``Grants and loans for special needs of elderly individuals \n     and individuals with disabilities'' to ``Formula grants for \n     special needs of elderly individuals and individuals with \n     disabilities.''\n       Subsection (a), ``General Authority,'' would be amended to \n     remove loan authority. Paragraph (1) would be deleted as a \n     streamlining effort because funds to local public transit \n     operators for service for elderly and disabled persons are \n     made available through the urbanized and nonurbanized area \n     formula programs. Paragraph (2) would be redesignated \n     paragraph (1). Redesignated paragraph\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\n     (1) would be amended to simplify the conditions of assistance \n     made to private nonprofit corporations and associations.\n       Subsection (b), ``Apportioning and Transferring Amounts,'' \n     would be amended to remove the 90-day limitation on the \n     transfer of funds from section 5310 to either section 5311, \n     ``Formula Program for Other than Urbanized Areas'' or section \n     5307, ``Urbanized Area Formula Grants.'' This change would \n     permit such transfers at anytime during the fiscal year, \n     providing enhanced flexibility and improved program \n     management.\n       Subsection (e) ``Application of section 5309.'' The \n     catchline and paragraph (1) would be deleted; thus no longer \n     requiring that a grant made under this section follow the \n     requirements of section 5309, ``Major Capital Investments.'' \n     It would require that grants be subject to requirements the \n     Secretary deems appropriate. Paragraph (2) would be \n     redesignated subsection (e) and entitled ``Grant \n     requirements.''\n       Subsection (f) ``Minimum Requirements and Procedures for \n     Recipients'' would be deleted as extraneous because both the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act and the planning process \n     already provide these minimum requirements and procedures for \n     grant recipients.\n       The remaining sections would be redesignated and would \n     remain unchanged.\n     Sec. 3012. Formula Program for Other than Urbanized Areas\n       Section 3012 would change the title of section 5311 from \n     ``Financial assistance for other than urbanized areas'' to \n     ``Formula program for other than urbanized areas'' for \n     clarification.\n       Subsection (b), ``General Authority.'' Paragraph (2) would \n     be amended to provide that four percent of the rural formula \n     program funds shall be available for the Rural Transportation \n     Assistance Program (RTAP). This streamlining change moves \n     RTAP from the Transit Planning and Research Program to the \n     formula program for other than urbanized areas.\n       Subsection (c) ``Apportioning Amounts'' would be amended to \n     remove the extraneous apportionment calculation based on \n     nonexistent Census estimates of nonurbanized population. The \n     number of years for obligation after the fiscal year in which \n     the amount is apportioned would be increased from two, to \n     three, to conform the nonurbanized area program with the \n     urbanized formula program under section 5307.\n       Subsection (e), ``Use for Administration and Technical \n     Assistance.'' Paragraph (1) would be amended to broaden the \n     availability and use of funds by allowing States to use the \n     rural formula funds now available to them for program \n     administration to be used, as well, to support the Transit \n     Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) and for training.\n       The catchline of subsection (f) would be changed from \n     ``Intercity Bus Transportation'' to ``Intercity Bus or Rail \n     Transportation'' to reflect the inclusion of rail as an \n     eligible activity. The first sentence of paragraph (1) would \n     be deleted to drop the requirement for intercity bus set-\n     asides; the remaining phrase of paragraph (1) would be \n     redesignated subsection (f). Subparagraph (A) would be \n     redesignated paragraph (1). Planning and marketing expenses \n     for intercity buses would still be eligible, and would be \n     expanded to include intercity rail.\n       Paragraphs (1)(B) and (1)(C) would be deleted as extraneous \n     because intercity bus shelters and joint use stops and depots \n     would be generally eligible under this section. Paragraph \n     (1)(D) would expand operating grants to include either bus or \n     rail and would be redesignated as paragraph (2). Paragraph \n     (1)(E) would be amended so that rural connections between \n     small mass transportation operators and intercity bus would \n     now include connections to rail or air carriers to enhance \n     intermodalism in nonurbanized areas and would be redesignated \n     as paragraph (3).\n       Subsection (f)(2) would be deleted because there would no \n     longer be a requirement for a specific amount to be spent on \n     intercity bus projects. The deletion of the requirement for a \n     specific set-aside for intercity bus services obviates the \n     need for a certification from the State that intercity bus \n     needs are met before the funds could be used for other \n     eligible purposes.\n       Subsection (g), ``Government's Share of Costs,'' would be \n     moved to and consolidated into section 5328. Subsections (h) \n     and (i) would be redesignated as subsections (g) and (h), \n     respectively.\n       A new subsection (i), ``Apportioning and Transferring \n     Amounts'' would be added to allow the transfer of funds from \n     section 5311 to section 5310 for use in the elderly and \n     disabled programs. This provision would be moved from \n     existing section 5336(g).\n     Sec. 3013. National Research Programs\n       Section 5312 would be renamed the ``National Research \n     Programs'' which would be moved from section 5314. Section \n     5312 on ``Research, Development, Demonstration, and Training \n     Projects'' would be moved to section 5314.\n       Subsection (a), ``Program.'' Paragraph (1) would provide \n     that funds made available to this section can be used for the \n     Transit Cooperative Research Program under section 5313; for \n     research, development, demonstration, and training projects \n     under section 5314; for the national transit institute under \n     section 5315; for bus testing under section 5318; and for the \n     human resource program under section 5322. Paragraph (2) sets \n     aside a minimum of $2 million to help transportation \n     providers comply with the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) \n     and would be moved without change from section 5314, \n     ``National Planning and Research Program.''\n       The only substantive change to section 5312 would be the \n     deletion of subsection (a)(4)(B) regarding the establishment \n     of an Industry Technical Panel. This provision is extraneous \n     because several other avenues exist to acquire advice from \n     the transit industry.\n       Subsection (b), ``Government's Share,'' provides that the \n     Secretary establish the government's share consistent with \n     the benefit provided.\n     Sec. 3014. Transit Cooperative Research Programs\n       Section 3014 would amend section 5313 by changing the title \n     from ``State Planning and Research Programs'' to ``Transit \n     Cooperative Research Program''.\n       Subsection (a), ``Cooperative Research Program'' would be \n     amended to include the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) \n     as a member of the governing board of the program.\n       Subsection (b), ``State Planning and Research,'' would be \n     deleted because the State planning requirements would be \n     consolidated under section 5306, ``Statewide Planning.'' \n     Because the funds would no longer be divided and allocated \n     directly, the fifty percent limit of section 5312, National \n     Planning and Research Programs, would be deleted.\n       Subsection (c), ``Government's Share,'' would be deleted \n     and would be moved to section 5306 ``Statewide Planning.''\n     Sec. 3015. Research, Development, Demonstration, and Training \n         Projects\n       The language of section 5314 would be replaced by and moved \n     to section 5312. Section 5314 would be renamed ``Research, \n     development, demonstration, and training projects.''\n       Subsection (a), ``Research, Development, Demonstration, and \n     Technical Assistance Projects.'' In paragraph (1), eligible \n     projects would be expanded to include those that improve \n     service, enhance safety or security, increase capacity, \n     reduce costs of services, equipment, or infrastructure, \n     improve intermodal connections, reduce the need for \n     transportation, overcome institutional barriers, disseminate \n     technical information, promote applications of innovative \n     technology, or advance the knowledge of mass transportation.\n       A new subsection (d), ``Joint Partnership Program for \n     Deployment of Innovation,'' would be added governing a joint \n     partnership program for transit innovation deployment. Under \n     paragraph (1), consortia would consist of public or private \n     organizations which provide mass transportation service to \n     the public, and businesses offering goods or services to mass \n     transportation providers. It may also include public or \n     private research organizations or state or local governmental \n     authorities. The program would, under paragraph (2), permit \n     entering into cooperative agreements, grants, contracts, or \n     other agreements with consortiums to promote the deployment \n     of innovation in mass transportation technology, services, \n     management, or operational practices. In paragraph (3), the \n     government's share of the cost would be limited to a maximum \n     of 50 percent of the net project cost. Paragraph (4) gives \n     the Secretary the authority to establish the solicitation and \n     award process. Paragraph (5) states that net revenues would \n     be credited to the future joint partnerships under this \n     subsection.\n       Subsection (e), ``International Mass Transportation \n     Program,'' authorizes an international mass transportation \n     program whereby the Secretary may develop and disseminate \n     information on international transportation marketing \n     opportunities to domestic operators; cooperate with foreign \n     public sector entities on research; advocate U.S. mass \n     transportation products and services in international \n     markets; participate in seminars to inform international \n     markets of the technical quality of mass transportation \n     products and services; and offer FTA technical services to \n     foreign public authorities on a cost reimbursement basis. The \n     Secretary would be authorized to cooperate with Federal \n     agencies, State and local agencies, public and private \n     nonprofit institutions, government laboratories, foreign \n     governments, or any organization deemed appropriate to carry \n     out this section. A special account would be established for \n     funds from any cooperating organization or person to pay for \n     promotional materials, travel, reception, and representation \n     expenses.\n     Sec. 3016. National Transit Institute\n       Section 3016 would amend section 5315 by changing the title \n     from ``National Mass Transportation Institute'' to the \n     ``National Transit Institute'' to reflect current practice. \n     It would also change the subsection (a), ``Establishment and \n     Duties,'' list of courses to include architectural design in \n     paragraph (5), construction management, insurance, and risk \n     management in paragraph (11), and innovative finance in a new \n     paragraph (15). Paragraph (7) would be amended to clarify \n     that turnkey approaches ``deliver'' mass transportation \n     system rather than ``carryout.''\n     Sec. 3017. University Research Institutes\n       Section 5316 would be repealed. The program would be \n     combined with the Transportation Centers program, section \n     5317, into an Intermodal Transportation Centers program \n     administered by the Research and Special Programs \n     Administration in a new chapter 52 of title 49.\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\n     Sec. 3018. Transportation Centers\n       Section 3018 would repeal section 5317. This program would \n     be combined with the University Research Institutes, section \n     5316, program into an Intermodal Transportation Centers \n     program administered by the Research and Special Programs \n     Administration in a new chapter 52 of title 49.\n     Sec. 3019. Bus Testing Facility\n       Section 3019 would amend section 5318 (b), ``Operation and \n     Maintenance,'' and (d), ``Availability of Amounts to Pay for \n     Testing,'' to permit, in addition to a contract, the use of a \n     grant or cooperative agreement to operate and maintain the \n     bus testing facility. This would enhance flexibility in \n     choosing and managing facility operators by FTA. Other mass \n     transportation vehicles such as paratransit vans would be \n     permitted to be tested at the facility in subsection (a), \n     ``Establishment.''\n     Sec. 3020. Advance Construction Authority\n       Section 3020 would delete section 5319, ``Bicycle \n     Facilities'' in its entirety. Eligibility for bicycle \n     facilities would be moved to, ``Definitions,'' section \n     5302(a)(1)(O), and its special 90 percent matching share \n     would be moved to section 5328, ``Government's Share of \n     Costs.'' A new section 5319, ``Advance Construction \n     Authority,'' consolidating the advance construction authority \n     in sections 5307(g) and 5309(n) would be substituted in its \n     place. The requirements of advance construction authority \n     would remain unchanged from their previous application to \n     sections 5307 and 5309, and would be expanded to apply to \n     section 5311.\n       The new section incorporates the requirement that the \n     interest eligible for reimbursement be based on the most \n     favorable interest terms available, as is now included in \n     section 5309(n), rather than the inflation-based approach \n     under section 5307(g), which proved to be unworkable in \n     practice. Preaward authorization to incur project costs would \n     be allowed. This would permit commencement of work at the \n     time funds are apportioned, rather than after grant award. \n     This change would incorporate in law a current practice.\n     Sec. 3021. Suspended Light Rail System Technology Pilot \n         Project\n       Section 3021 would delete section 5320, ``Suspended Light \n     Rail System Technology Pilot Project,'' in its entirety. This \n     section is unnecessary because the project is already \n     eligible under section 5312, ``National Planning and Research \n     Programs.'' A new 5320, ``Access to Jobs and Training'' would \n     be added.\n       Under subsection (a), ``General Authority,'' the Secretary \n     would make grants to assist States, local governments, and \n     private non-profit organizations to transport economically \n     disadvantaged persons to jobs and employment-related \n     activities.\n       Under subsection (b), ``Grant Criteria,'' the Secretary \n     would make discretionary grants to recipients based on \n     statutory criteria including severity of the welfare \n     transportation problem, existence of or willingness to create \n     a mechanism to coordinate transportation and human resource \n     services planning, the applicant's qualifications and \n     performance under other welfare reform activities, the extent \n     to which a partnership with human resource agencies exists, \n     and the applicant's application. The application would be \n     required to address the access to work transportation needs \n     and possible new service strategies, the coordinating of \n     existing service providers and possible new service \n     strategies, the promotion of employer-provided transportation \n     services, and long-term financing strategies to support the \n     program.\n       Under subsection (c), ``Eligible Projects,'' eligible grant \n     activities would include integrating transportation and \n     welfare planning, coordinating transit providers with human \n     resource service providers, operating and capital costs of \n     service start-up, promoting employer-provided transportation, \n     developing financing strategies, and related administrative \n     expenses.\n       Under subsection (d), ``Technical Assistance,'' the \n     Secretary may make grants, cooperative agreements, or \n     contracts for technical assistance and the evaluation of \n     projects funded under this section.\n       Under subsection (e), ``Government's Share of Costs,'' the \n     DOT share of costs would be 50 percent of the net cost and \n     the remainder will be cash from sources other than revenues \n     from providing transit service. Subsection (e) would allow a \n     recipient to use other Federal human services funds to fund \n     the non-governmental share. This subsection would not apply \n     to the grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts for the \n     provision of technical assistance; thus they could be funded \n     completely by the Government.\n       Under subsection (f), ``Planning Requirements,'' grants \n     would be required to be included in Metropolitan and \n     Statewide plans and Transportation Improvement Programs.\n       Under subsection (g), ``Grant Requirements,'' grants would \n     be subject to terms and conditions as determined by the \n     Secretary.\n       Under subsection (h), ``Availability of Amounts,'' funds \n     are available for three years after the fiscal year they are \n     made available.\n     Sec. 3022. Crime Prevention and Security\n       Section 3022 would amend section 5321, ``Crime Prevention \n     and Security,'' by moving its provisions to section \n     5302(a)(l)(Q), ``Definitions,'' thereby making crime \n     prevention and security eligible as a capital project.\n     Sec. 3023. General Provisions on Assistance\n       Section 3023 would amend section 5323, ``General Provisions \n     on Assistance.''\n       Subsection (a), ``Interests in Property.'' Paragraph (1)(A) \n     would be amended to clarify that a project must be contained \n     in a TIP rather than in a program of projects before a \n     recipient can acquire property with FTA funds.\n       Paragraph (1)(D) would be amended to clarify that an \n     employee protective arrangement certification under section \n     5333(b) applies only to projects under sections 5307 (except \n     planning), 5309, 5311, 5313 (for operational activities \n     only), redesignated 5314, and 5320 (except planning) and not \n     to all projects in the transit program.\n       Subsection (b), would be amended to change the catchline \n     from ``Notice and public hearing'' to ``Social, economic, and \n     environmental interests'' to clarify the nature and purpose \n     of the environmental public hearing. Paragraph (2), which \n     describes how the notice of hearing must be published, would \n     be removed due to its unnecessary prescriptive requirements. \n     New paragraphs (2)(A) and (B) would be added here to reflect \n     only those environmental requirements that are unique to FTA, \n     by moving them from section 5324(b); National Environmental \n     Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 4321 et seq.) (NEPA) \n     provides the overall environmental review requirements.\n       Subsection (d) would be renamed from ``Buying and Operating \n     Buses'' to ``Charter Bus Limitation'' to more accurately \n     reflect the meaning of the subsection. It would now only \n     apply to sections 5307, 5309, and 5311. The reference to \n     existing section 5308, which would be repealed, would be \n     deleted.\n       Subsection (e) ``Bus Passenger Seat Specifications\" would \n     be deleted. This ``housekeeping'' effort removes \n     unnecessarily prescriptive requirements and recognizes the \n     fact that specifications were never issued by the Secretary.\n       Subsection (i), ``Government's Share of Costs for Certain \n     Projects'' would be deleted and moved to section 5328 where \n     these requirements would be consolidated.\n       Subsection (j), ``Buy America,'' would be redesignated \n     subsection (h). Paragraph (7) would be deleted as extraneous \n     since the ``foreign entity purchases'' report to Congress has \n     been submitted.\n       Subsection (k) ``Application of Section 135 of Title 23,'' \n     would be deleted and moved to section 5303 where planning \n     requirements would be consolidated.\n       A new subsection (i), ``Submission of Certification'' moved \n     from section 5307(k), would be added to provide for a single \n     certification for all programs under this chapter.\n       A new subsection (j), ``Legal Financial, and Technical \n     Capacity,'' would be added which would consolidate all \n     requirements for legal, financial, and technical capacity for \n     all programs under this chapter.\n       A new subsection (k), ``Private Enterprise Participation'' \n     would be moved here from section 5606(a).\n       Subsection (l), ``Preaward and Postdelivery Review of \n     Rolling Stock Purchase'' would be deleted because this \n     requirement is costly and unnecessary.\n     Sec. 3024. Acquisition of Real Property Owned By The \n         Government\n       Section 3024 would delete as extraneous section 5324, \n     ``Limitations on discretionary and special needs grants and \n     loans,'' in its entirety. Subsection (a), ``Relocation \n     Program Requirements,'' are contained in the Surface \n     Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance of 1987 and \n     would be redundant if retained. The environmental \n     requirements contained in subsection (b), ``Economic, Social, \n     and Environmental Interests,'' are now included in NEPA with \n     the exception of the unique environmental requirements that \n     apply to FTA, which would be placed in section 5323(b), \n     ``General Provisions on Assistance.'' Subsection (c), \n     ``Prohibitions Against Regulating Operations and Charges,'' \n     would be moved to section 5334, ``Administrative,'' and would \n     now apply program wide, rather than only to section 5309 \n     recipients.\n       A new section 5324 would be named ``Acquisition of Real \n     Property Owned by the Government.'' This new section would \n     make surplus real property owned by the Government available \n     for a transit purpose or as a source of materials for the \n     construction and maintenance of a transit facility adjacent \n     to Government land. This section is patterned on 23 USC \n     section 317.\n     Sec. 3025. Contract Requirements\n       Section 3025 would amend section 5325, ``Contract \n     Requirements.''\n       Subsection (b), ``Acquiring Rolling Stock,'' would be moved \n     to section 5326, ``Special Procurements.'' New subsection \n     (b), ``Competitive Negotiation,'' would authorize the use of \n     a competitive negotiation procurement process when the sealed \n     bid procurement process is not suitable. Subsection (c), \n     ``Procuring Associated Capital Maintenance Items,'' would be \n     deleted because they would now be included as preventive \n     maintenance in section 5302(a)(l)(E), ``Definitions.''\n       Subsection (d), ``Architectural, Engineering, and Design \n     Contracts,'' would be moved to new subsection (b)(2).\n     Sec. 3026. Special Procurements\n       Section 3026 would amend section 5326, ``Special \n     Procurements.''\n       Subsection (a), ``Turnkey System Projects,'' would be \n     amended to expand the\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\n     definition of turnkey system projects to include an operable \n     segment of a transportation system and to expand from seller \n     operation to seller financing, designing, building, and \n     system operation, or any combination thereof. It would allow \n     the contractor to acquire, rather than construct, a mass \n     transportation system or segment. Paragraph (2) would require \n     a turnkey solicitation to be based on a two-phased \n     competitive procurement process where participation of small \n     and medium sized businesses would be encouraged in joint \n     ventures with large firms. Paragraph (3) would be deleted \n     because it is completed.\n       Subsection (c), ``Efficient Procurement'' would be amended \n     to remove references to dates and guidance requirements and \n     moved to subsection (e). New subsection (c), ``Acquiring \n     Rolling Stock'' would be moved here from section 5325(b) as a \n     ``housekeeping'' effort.\n       Subsection (d), ``Procuring Spare Parts'' would be amended \n     to permit a recipient to purchase spare parts directly from \n     the original manufacturer or supplier without prior FTA \n     approval if the manufacturer is the only source for the item \n     and the price reflects market conditions.\n     Sec. 3027. Oversight\n       Section 3027 would change the name of section 5327 from \n     ``Project Management Oversight'' to ``Oversight'' to reflect \n     the expansion of this section to include other oversight such \n     as financial oversight.\n       Subsection (c), ``Limitations on Use of Available \n     Amounts,'' would be amended to increase the percentage \n     takedown from .5 percent to .75 percent of section 5307. A \n     takedown would no longer be taken from section 5311. Taken \n     together, these changes would result in an increase in the \n     total funds available for oversight activities and focus the \n     source of funds to the programs with the most need for \n     oversight. Paragraph (2) would be amended to permit funds \n     under this section to be used to provide technical assistance \n     to correct deficiencies identified by compliance reviews and \n     audits. This change would facilitate implementation of needed \n     changes to recipient procedures and practices.\n     Sec. 3028. Government Share of Costs\n       Section 3028 would delete section 5328, ``Project review,'' \n     in its entirety. This section required specific timelines and \n     milestones for the various stages of fixed guideway projects.\n       Compliance with the section's requirements was problematic; \n     projects proceed at a pace determined primarily by local \n     actions, not by those of the FTA. Also, commitments have \n     already been made to the projects contained in subsection (c) \n     which would therefore no longer be needed.\n       This section would be renamed ``Government share of costs'' \n     and would contain a consolidation of most of the government's \n     share of costs requirements in this single section. \n     Subsection (a), ``Capital Projects,'' would establish the \n     Government's share of the costs for all capital projects \n     funded under chapter 53 of title 49. The Governments' share \n     for most capital projects would remain at 80 percent. \n     Paragraphs (1) (A) and (B) contain special Government share \n     ratios for certain kinds of projects.\n       Under paragraph (1)(A), the Government's share of a bicycle \n     facility, as defined in section 5302(a)(1)(O), would remain \n     90 percent of the cost of the project.\n       Under paragraph (1)(B), the Government's share of the costs \n     for a capital project that involves acquiring vehicle-related \n     equipment required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) or the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), would remain at 90 percent of the net \n     project cost of the equipment that is attributable to \n     complying with those Acts. The Secretary of Transportation, \n     through practicable administrative procedures, would still be \n     able determine the costs attributable to that equipment .\n       Under subsection (b), ``Operating Expenses,'' the \n     government's share of operating costs may not exceed 50 \n     percent and would be limited to projects under sections \n     5302(a)(1)(R), 5307, or 5311. In section 3008 of this Act, \n     operating assistance would be limited to only those areas \n     under 200,000 in population.\n     Sec. 3029. Investigation of Safety Hazards\n       Section 3029 would amend section 5329, ``Investigation of \n     Safety Hazards,'' by deleting the extraneous subsection (b), \n     ``Report.'' This report to Congress on safety has been \n     submitted.\n     Sec. 3030. Nondiscrimination\n       Section 3030 would amend section 5332, \n     ``Nondiscrimination.''\n       Subsection (b), ``Prohibitions,'' would be amended by \n     adding disability to the list of nondiscrimination factors, \n     and to replace ``creed'' with ``religion'', that now includes \n     race, color, creed, national origin, sex, or age. This \n     addition makes this section consistent with the requirements \n     of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n     Sec. 3031. Labor Standards\n       Section 3031 would amend section 5333, ``Labor Standards.''\n       Subsection (b), ``Employee Protective Arrangements,'' would \n     be amended to conform it to current practice and to apply it \n     to the section 5320 ``Access to Jobs and Training'' (except \n     planning). Section 5333(b) would apply to sections 5307 \n     (except planning), 5309, 5311, 5313 (operational activities \n     only), redesignated 5314, and 5320 (except planning). It \n     removes its incorrect application to bus testing, \n     administrative requirements, oversight, rail modernization \n     formula, and the authorization section caused by \n     codification.\n     Sec. 3032. Administrative\n\n       Section 3032 would amend section 5334, ``Administrative.''\n       Subsection (a), ``General Authority.'' Paragraph (10) would \n     be amended to permit FTA to charge fees to cover the costs of \n     training or conferences that promote mass transportation. \n     This change would increase FTA's flexibility in offering \n     courses, help defray the costs of such courses, and provide \n     additional revenues to expand course offerings.\n       A new paragraph (11) would be added that would clarify \n     FTA's participation with cooperating foreign countries on \n     various activities, such as research and technology. This \n     wording would be consistent with Federal highway law.\n       Subsection (g), ``Transfer of Assets No Longer Needed,'' \n     would be simplified to allow assets that are acquired by FTA \n     assistance and that are no longer needed for public \n     transportation purposes may be sold or transferred under \n     conditions determined by the Secretary. This change removes \n     unnecessary regulatory burdens, enhances flexibility in \n     making decisions regarding asset disposition, and facilitates \n     the undertaking of joint development projects.\n       Subsection (i), ``Authority of Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development,'' would be deleted as a ``housekeeping'' \n     change; it references pre-1967 authority of the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development (HUD) over the Federal transit \n     assistance program.\nSubsection (j), ``Relationship to Other Laws,'' would be redesignated \n    subsection (i).\n       New subsection (j), ``Prohibitions Against Regulating \n     Operations and Charges,'' which prohibits FTA from regulating \n     transit operations and charges would be moved here from \n     section 5324 (c) and would remain unchanged, except that it \n     would now apply to all programs, rather than to only section \n     5309. This would incorporate in law a current practice.\n       New Subsection (k), ``Test and Evaluation,'' would be added \n     to allow the waiver of all requirements except for labor \n     certification and environmental review under NEPA for grants \n     to test or develop any material, invention, patented article, \n     or process. This authority would be similar to that contained \n     in Federal highway law.\n     Sec. 3033. Reports and Audits\n       Section 3033 amends section 5335, ``Reports and Audits.''\n       Subsection (a) would be amended to change the catchline \n     from ``Reporting system and uniform system of accounts and \n     records'' to ``National transit database'' to more accurately \n     reflect the contents of this subsection.\n       Subsection (a)(2) would be redesignated subsection (b) and \n     entitled ``Inclusion of Grant Recipients in Database.''\n       Subsection (b), ``Quarterly Reports,'' would be deleted, \n     removing the requirement for quarterly reports to Congress on \n     State obligations and grants executed. This information is \n     readily available elsewhere through normal distribution so \n     that a Congressional report is extraneous and not cost \n     effective.\n       Subsection (c), ``Biennial Needs Report,'' would also be \n     deleted, removing the requirement for a biennial needs report \n     to be submitted by the Comptroller General. The General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) concurs that this report is redundant \n     because a comparable report to Congress is required by 49 \n     U.S.C section 308.\n       Subsection (d), ``Biennial Transferability Report'' would \n     also be deleted. The GAO agrees that this report is not \n     needed, since the information on the amount of mass \n     transportation money transferred for non-mass transportation \n     purposes is readily available elsewhere.\n     Sec. 3034. Apportionment of Appropriations for Formula Grants\n       Section 3034 would amend section 5336 by changing the name \n     from ``Apportionment of Appropriations for Block Grants'' to \n     ``Apportionment of Appropriations for Formula Grants'' to \n     more accurately reflect the purpose of this section.\n       Subsection (a), ``Access to Jobs and Training,'' would \n     provide $100 million annually until 2003 for the ``Access to \n     Jobs and Training Program'' under section 5320.\n       Subsection (b), ``Allocation For Urbanized Area, Other Than \n     Urbanized Area, Special Needs of Elderly Individuals and \n     Individuals With Disabilities Formula Programs,'' would \n     provide for distribution of funds among the formula programs \n     as follows: 94.5 percent of the funds for ``Urbanized Area \n     Formula Grants'' (section 5307); 1.75 percent of the funds \n     for ``Formula Grants for Special Needs of Elderly Individuals \n     and Individuals with Disabilities'' (section 5310); and 3.75 \n     percent of the funds for the ``Formula Program for Other than \n     Urbanized Areas'' (section 5311). In the urbanized area \n     formula grants program, the changes to this section would \n     merge the formula fixed guideway program into the program \n     without change in the formula. The amount apportioned by the \n     current fixed guideway formula would be equal to the amount \n     available for major capital investments. The remainder would \n     be apportioned by the current urbanized area formula.\n       Subsection (c), ``Fixed Guideway Tier,'' would provide \n     funds to the fixed guideway systems listed in existing \n     section 5337.\n       Subsection (d), ``Operating Assistance,'' would be \n     redesignated subsection (f) and\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\n     would provide that urbanized areas under 200,000 in \n     population could use their entire apportionment for operating \n     assistance, eliminating the former statutory cap (areas over \n     200,000 would not be able to use funds for operating \n     assistance).\n       Subsections (e) through (i) would be redesignated (g) \n     through (k), respectively. Redesignated subsection (i), \n     ``Transfers of Apportionments'' would be amended to permit \n     transfers of apportionments from the urbanized area formula \n     program to either the ``Formula Grants for Special Needs of \n     Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities \n     program'' (section 5310) or the ``Formula Program for Other \n     than Urbanized Areas'' (section 5311).\n       Former subsection (j), ``Application of Other Sections,'' \n     would be deleted as extraneous. Application of other sections \n     is not relevant since this section covers only urbanized area \n     formula grants (section 5307).\n       Former subsection (k), ``Certain Urbanized Areas \n     Grandfathered,'' would be deleted. Grandfathering urbanized \n     areas designated under the 1980 census and not designated \n     under the 1990 census for FY 1993 is obsolete.\n     Sec. 3035. Apportionment of Appropriations for Fixed Guideway \n         Modernization\n       Section 3035 would delete section 5337 in its entirety \n     because the current formula would be merged into section \n     5336(c).\n     Sec. 3036. Authorizations\n       Section 3036 would amend and completely rewrite section \n     5338 by providing new authorization levels for fiscal years \n     1998 to 2003.\n       Formula programs under subsection (a) would be funded from \n     the Mass Transit Account for ``Urbanized Area Formula \n     Grants'' (section 5307) (including Access to Jobs and \n     Training (section 5320)), ``Formula Grants for Special Needs \n     of Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities'' \n     (section 5310), and ``Formula Program for Other than \n     Urbanized Areas'' (section 5311) at $3,970.5 million for \n     fiscal years 1998-2002 and $4,077,704,000 for fiscal year \n     2003. No General Funds would be provided.\n       Under subsection (b), ``Major Capital Investments,'' the \n     following levels would be authorized:\n       FY 1998--$800 million.\n       FY 1999--$950 million.\n       FY 2000-2002--$1,000 million per year for each fiscal year.\n       FY 2003--$1,026 million.\n       Subsection (c), ``Metropolitan Planning,'' would authorize \n     appropriations of not more than $39.5 million per year for FY \n     1998-2002 and $40.527 million for FY 2003 for metropolitan \n     planning grants under sections 5303-5305.\n       Subsection (d), ``Statewide Planning,'' would authorize \n     appropriations of not more than $8.25 million per year for FY \n     1998-2002 and $8.465 million for FY 2003 for statewide \n     planning grants under section 5306.\n       Subsection (e), ``National Transit Research,'' would \n     authorize appropriations of not more than $38.050 million in \n     FY 1998-2002 and $39,039,000 for FY 2003 for national transit \n     research under section 5312 (including the Transit \n     Cooperative Research Program, the National Transit Institute, \n     and the Bus Testing Facility).\n       Subsection (f), ``University Transportation Centers,'' \n     would authorize not more than $6 million for FY 1998-2002 and \n     $6.156 million for FY 2003 for the University Transportation \n     Centers under chapter 52 of title 49.\n       Subsection (g), ``Administrative Expenses,'' would \n     authorize appropriations of such sums as necessary for \n     administrative expenses.\n       Subsection (h), ``Grants as Contractual Obligations,'' \n     would provide that grants under subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 5338 constitute contract authority.\n       Subsection (i), ``Availability,'' would provide that funds \n     made available under subsections (a) through (f) of section \n     5338 are available until expended.\n       Subsection (j), ``Transfer of Prior Year Funds Remaining \n     Available,'' would provide a ``housekeeping'' change by \n     allowing the transfer of any appropriated funds to the most \n     recent appropriations heading for the same purpose; these \n     funds would be administered in accordance with the provisions \n     of the heading into which they were transferred. This will \n     allow for the elimination of the need to account for expired \n     programs separately.\n       Sec. 3037. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\n       Section 3037 would amend the National Capital \n     Transportation Act of 1969 to change the source of funding \n     for the final two years. Section 17(c) would be amended to \n     repeal the authorization for general fund appropriations for \n     fiscal years 1998 and 1999, and would reduce the total amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by $250,000,000. In its place, \n     a new subsection (d) would be added authorizing a like amount \n     to be appropriated from the Mass Transit Account, \n     $200,000,000 in fiscal year 1998 and $50,300,000 in fiscal \n     year 1999.\n\n\n                     TITLE IV--MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY\n\n       Sec. 4001. State Grants and Other Commercial Motor Vehicle \n     Programs\n       Subsection (a) amends 49 U.S.C. 31101 by adding a new \n     subsection (a) to provide a detailed description of the \n     objectives of subchapter I, State Grants. This new subsection \n     (a) emphasizes that the grants authorized under section 31102 \n     are to be used by the Secretary, States, and other political \n     jurisdictions working in partnership to improve commercial \n     motor vehicle and driver safety. This new subsection (a) also \n     provides some detail on the new performance-based approach \n     grant recipients are to take by explaining that the funds \n     authorized by this section are to be used to establish \n     program baselines and benchmarks to evaluate overall motor \n     carrier safety program effectiveness. The new subsection \n     31101 (a) further clarifies the performance-based grant \n     concept by describing some of the other activities eligible \n     for funding under this section and the safety goals these \n     activities will provide the means to achieve.\n       Paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) and (c)(9) amend 49 U.S.C. 31102 \n     to authorize the Secretary to encourage State implementation \n     of performance-based activities to improve motor carrier \n     safety. Section 31102 had already authorized grants to \n     support State enforcement of Federal regulations, standards, \n     and orders and compatible State regulations, standards, and \n     orders. As a result of this amendment, section 31102 \n     authorizes grants to fund traditional Motor Carrier Safety \n     Assistance Program (MCSAP) activities, including uniform \n     roadside driver and vehicle safety inspections, traffic \n     enforcement, compliance reviews, safety data collection, and \n     also new performance-based activities and analyses to \n     identify Statewide safety problems, establish benchmarks, \n     implement activities to address unique problems, and measure \n     program effectiveness. States are still required to submit a \n     State Motor Carrier Safety Plan to qualify for the MCSAP \n     grants and the performance-based incentives. It is envisioned \n     that all States will implement performance-based activities \n     by the end of fiscal year 2003.\n       Subsection (c) amends section 31102 by adding references to \n     hazardous materials transportation safety to perpetuate the \n     long-standing policy that motor vehicle safety encompasses \n     hazardous materials transportation safety as well.\n       Subsection (d) amends various provisions in section \n     31102(b), 49 U.S.C., which describe required components of \n     the plan each State must develop and submit to the Secretary \n     in order to qualify for funding under section 49 U.S.C. \n     31102.\n       Paragraph (d)(1) amends 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1)(J) to clarify \n     that the activities referred to in that subparagraph are \n     those activities described in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) \n     of section 31102, 49 U.S.C. This amendment thus explains that \n     a State plan must ensure that State ``enforcement of \n     commercial motor vehicle size and weight limitations at \n     locations other than fixed weight facilities, at specific \n     locations such as steep grades or mountainous terrains where \n     the weight of a commercial motor vehicle can significantly \n     affect the safe operation of the vehicle, or at ports where \n     intermodal shipping containers enter and leave the United \n     States'' (49 U.S.C. 31102(c)(1)) will not diminish the \n     effectiveness of the State commercial motor vehicle safety \n     programs funded through subsection (a) of 49 U.S.C. 31102.\n       Paragraph (d)(2) revises 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1)(K) to \n     provide States with more flexibility in establishing \n     consistent and effective sanctions for violations of \n     commercial motor vehicle safety regulations. The maximum fine \n     schedule published by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance \n     is too prescriptive. As a result of this change, States will \n     no longer be limited in their ability to use a range of fines \n     to ensure compliance and address their unique safety \n     problems.\n       Paragraph (d)(3) revises 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1)(L) to expand \n     the preexisting requirement that each State coordinate the \n     development and implementation of its Motor Carrier Safety \n     Plan with the development and implementation of its Section \n     402 highway safety plan. This revision directs the States to \n     also coordinate their Motor Carrier Safety Plans with \n     other agencies responsible for highway safety in the State \n     including FHWA and NHTSA highway grant recipients. This \n     change also requires the State to provide for coordination \n     of data collection and information systems with these \n     other agencies.\n       Paragraph (d)(4) revises 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1)(M) to \n     require that State plans ensure that all jurisdictions \n     receiving funding participate in SAFETYNET, not just the 48 \n     contiguous States. This revision also deletes the January 1, \n     1994, deadline for meeting this requirement.\n       Paragraph (d)(5) strikes 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1)(N), and \n     thereby deletes the requirement that a State's plan emphasize \n     and improve enforcement of traffic safety laws regarding \n     commercial vehicle safety. This requirement is being removed \n     because it is overly prescriptive and unnecessary; if a \n     State's unique problems can best be addressed by other \n     actions, such as public education, this requirement would \n     cause the State to spend grant receipts on activities not \n     best designed to solve that State's problems.\n       Paragraph (d)(6) revises 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1)(O) to remove \n     the requirement that a State plan promote enforcement of \n     requirements related to the licensing of commercial motor \n     vehicle (CMV) drivers and the requirement that a State plan \n     promote enforcement of hazardous material transportation \n     regulations by encouraging more inspections of shipper \n     facilities affecting highway transportation and more \n     comprehensive inspections of the loads of CMVs transporting \n     hazardous materials. Removal of these State plan requirements \n     does not in any way diminish the obligation of the States \n     participating in this program to enforce commercial driver's \n     licensing requirements and hazardous materials transportation \n     regulations.\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\n      Paragraph (d)(6) retains the requirement that a State plan \n     promote activities to remove impaired CMV drivers from the \n     highways through adequate enforcement of regulations on the \n     use of alcohol and controlled substances and the requirement \n     that a State plan provide an appropriate level of training to \n     State motor carrier safety assistance program officers and \n     employees on recognizing drivers impaired by alcohol or \n     controlled substances. Paragraph (d)(6) moves from \n     subparagraph 31102(b)(1)(P) to 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1)(O) the \n     requirement that a State plan promote interdiction activities \n     affecting the transportation of controlled substances by CMV \n     drivers and provide training on appropriate strategies for \n     carrying out those interdiction activities. In addition, \n     paragraph (d)(6) amends subparagraph (O) to specify that a \n     State plan must promote activities that further national \n     safety priorities and performance goals.\n       Paragraph (d)(7) strikes 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1)(P), thereby \n     deleting the requirement that a State plan ensure that the \n     State will use trained and qualified officers and employees \n     of political subdivisions and local governments to enforce \n     commercial motor vehicle and hazardous material \n     transportation safety regulations. This requirement is being \n     removed because it duplicates language in the subsection \n     31104(f) as revised by this section. Clause (i) of 49 U.S.C. \n     31102(b)(1)(P) requiring that a State plan promote \n     interdiction activities affecting the transportation of \n     controlled substances by CMV drivers is retained, but is \n     moved to clause (iii) of 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1)(O). Paragraph \n     (d)(7) also redesignates subparagraph 31102(b)(1)(Q) as \n     subparagraph 31102(b)(1)(P).\n       Paragraph (d)(8) redesignates subparagraphs (A) through (M) \n     of 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1) as subparagraphs (B) through (N). \n     This redesignation is necessary because of the addition of a \n     new element at the beginning of the list of required State \n     motor carrier safety plan components.\n       Paragraph (d)(9) amends 49 U.S.C. 31102(b)(1) to add a new \n     required element of the State Motor Carrier Safety Plan to \n     the beginning of the list of requirements. This new criterion \n     requires the State to propose in its plan to implement \n     performance-based programs by the year 2003. The requirement \n     that performance-based programs be in place by a certain date \n     ensures that State safety activities which were formerly \n     based on inputs are replaced by activities focused on \n     attaining solutions to existing problems.\n       Subsection (e) amends section 31103 of 49 U.S.C. by adding \n     a new subsection to authorize the Secretary to reimburse \n     State agencies, local governments, or other persons for up to \n     100 percent of the cost of the activities specified in 49 \n     U.S.C. 31104(f)(2). The activities referred to in that \n     paragraph are border enforcement and other high priority \n     activities. The preexisting language of 49 U.S.C. 31103 is \n     also redesignated as subsection (a).\n       Paragraphs (f)(1) through (6) revise section 31104 of 49 \n     U.S.C. to authorize that $83,000,000 be appropriated from the \n     Highway Trust Fund in each of fiscal years 1998 through 2003 \n     to carry out section 31102 of 49 U.S.C., i.e., to provide \n     States with grants to develop or implement programs for \n     improving motor carrier safety and the enforcement of Federal \n     and State regulations, standards, and orders regarding \n     commercial motor vehicle safety.\n       Paragraph (f)(7) revises 49 U.S.C. 31104(b)(2) by replacing \n     the reference to section 404(a)(2) of the Surface \n     Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 with a reference to \n     paragraphs 4002(e)(1) and (2) of the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, to change an October \n     1, 1991, deadline to October 1, 1996, and to change an \n     October 1, 1992, deadline to October 1, 1997. These changes \n     remove out of date references and revise this paragraph to \n     provide that amounts made available under paragraphs \n     4002(e)(1) and (2) of the ISTEA prior to October 1996 that \n     are not obligated on October 1, 1997, are available for \n     reallocation and obligation.\n       Paragraph (f)(8) revises 49 U.S.C. 31104(f) by deleting the \n     language authorizing the Secretary to designate specific \n     eligible States for an allocation of funds to be used for \n     research, development, and demonstration of technologies, \n     methodologies, analyses, or information systems designed to \n     implement programs for the enforcement of Federal and State \n     regulations, standards, and orders. The removal of this \n     specific allocation of funds will increase flexibility and \n     enable States to design programs to target their unique \n     problems. In addition, the language in subsection 31104(f) \n     authorizing the Secretary to allocate funds for education of \n     the motoring public on how to share the road safely with \n     commercial motor vehicles is also deleted by the revision in \n     paragraph (f)(8). Instead of the provisions described \n     above, paragraph (f)(8) substitutes a provision \n     authorizing the Secretary to designate up to 12 percent of \n     the funds available to improve motor carrier safety under \n     section 31102, to reimburse States for border enforcement \n     and other high priority activities and projects. This new \n     provision specifies that the Secretary may allocate this \n     12 percent, in coordination with State motor vehicle \n     safety agencies, to State agencies and local governments, \n     that use trained and qualified officers and employees, and \n     also to other persons for use in improving commercial \n     motor vehicle safety.\n       Paragraph (f)(9) revises 49 U.S.C. 31104 by deleting \n     subsection (g). Subsection (g) required the Secretary to \n     allocate funding authorized under section 31104(a) for very \n     specific State activities. Eliminating these specific \n     allocations provides State grantees with more flexibility to \n     develop the best combination of activities to address their \n     unique safety concerns.\n       Paragraph (f)(10) makes a technical amendment to 49 U.S.C. \n     31104(j) to remove the word ``tolerance'' as a descriptive \n     term to qualify the kinds of guidelines and standards which \n     the Secretary was directed by subsection (j) to prescribe.\n       Paragraph (f)(11) revises 49 U.S.C. 31104 to strike \n     subsection (i) and thereby eliminate the requirement that the \n     Secretary prescribe regulations to develop an improved \n     formula and process for allocating amounts made available for \n     grants under section 31102(a) because the Secretary has \n     promulgated these regulations. A formula will be maintained \n     in these regulations.\n       Subsection (g) revises 49 U.S.C. 31106 to include more \n     comprehensive provisions regarding motor carrier information \n     systems including the Commercial Vehicle Information System \n     (CVIS) and other motor carrier information systems and data \n     analysis programs which the Secretary is directed, in the \n     revised section 31106, to establish to facilitate the motor \n     carrier safety, regulatory, and enforcement activities \n     required under this title. Implementation of these \n     information systems and programs will provide the Secretary \n     and the States with the data and tools necessary to develop a \n     more analytical approach to motor carrier safety: these \n     systems and programs will enhance the focus on problem \n     companies, drivers, and employers by identifying safety \n     problems and potential countermeasures, determining the cost \n     effectiveness of State and Federal compliance, enforcement \n     programs, and other countermeasures, and providing the tools \n     and data necessary for evaluating the safety fitness of motor \n     carriers and drivers. The CVIS is to serve as a clearinghouse \n     and repository of information related to State registration \n     and licensing of commercial motor vehicles and the safety \n     system of the commercial motor vehicle registrants or the \n     motor carriers operating the vehicles. Under subparagraph \n     31106(a)(2)(C), the CVIS will link the Federal motor carrier \n     safety systems with State driver and commercial vehicle \n     registration and licensing systems. Paragraph 31106(a)(2) \n     also provides that the CVIS will be designed to enable States \n     to ascertain the safety fitness of a registrant or motor \n     carrier when issuing license plates, to allow States to \n     decide the types of sanctions, conditions, or limitations \n     that may be imposed on a registrant or motor carrier, to \n     monitor the safety fitness of a registrant or motor carrier, \n     and to require States, as a condition of participation in the \n     system, to possess or seek authority to impose commercial \n     motor vehicle registration sanctions on the basis of a \n     Federal safety fitness determination. Subparagraph \n     31106(a)(2)(D) provides that no more than $6,000,000 of the \n     funds authorized to carry out this section may be used in \n     each fiscal year to carry out paragraph 31106(a)(2). This \n     subparagraph also provides that the Secretary may authorize \n     the operation of the information system by contract, through \n     an agreement with one or more States, or by designating, \n     after consultation with the States, a third party, \n     representing the interests of the States.\n       The new subsection 31106(b) of 49 U.S.C. authorizes the \n     Secretary to establish a program focusing on ways to improve \n     commercial motor vehicle driver safety. Approaches to be \n     taken in achieving this objective include enhancing the \n     exchange of licensing information among States, the Federal \n     government, and foreign countries, providing information to \n     the judicial system on the licensing program, and evaluating \n     any aspect of driver performance and safety as deemed \n     appropriate by the Secretary. The funds authorized to carry \n     out this section may be used to initiate pilot programs and \n     to support research studies. These funds will be made \n     available through grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, \n     or direct purchase.\n       Subsection (c) of 49 U.S.C. 31106 authorizes the Secretary \n     to develop these information systems and carry out these \n     initiatives either independently or in cooperation with other \n     Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities or by \n     making grants to and entering into contracts and cooperative \n     agreements with States, localities, associations, \n     institutions, or corporations. To the maximum extent \n     practicable, the information systems and data collection \n     efforts conducted under 49 U.S.C. 31106 should be coordinated \n     with similar activities of other highway safety programs \n     authorized under title 23, U.S.C.\n       Subsection (h) revises title 49, U.S.C., to remove a \n     preexisting section 31107, which authorized the Secretary to \n     make grants to States which agree to adopt or have adopted \n     the recommendations of the National Governors' Association \n     related to police accident reports regarding truck and bus \n     accidents. Subsection (h) replaces this provision with a new \n     section 31107 which authorizes that $17 million be \n     appropriated annually from the Highway Trust Fund to carry \n     out section 31106 for fiscal years 1998 through 2003.\n       Subsection (i) amends the heading for Subchapter I of \n     Chapter 311 of 49 U.S.C. The heading as amended reads as \n     follows: ``STATE GRANTS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE \n     PROGRAMS''.\n       Subsection (j) revises the analysis for Chapter 311 of 49 \n     U.S.C. to reflect the new headings for sections 31106 and \n     31107.\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\n               TITLE V--INFRASTRUCTURE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT\n\n     Sec. 5001. Short Title\n       This section identifies a new Federal surface \n     transportation program as the Transportation Infrastructure \n     Credit Enhancement Act of 1997.\n     Sec. 5002. Findings\n       This section recites Congressional findings that current \n     public sector resources are insufficient to meet the Nation's \n     transportation infrastructure investment needs in both urban \n     and rural areas. These include building new facilities as \n     well as renovating or expanding existing facilities. The \n     funding gap is particularly acute for large projects of \n     National significance, due to their scale and complexity. A \n     new Federal credit enhancement program for transportation \n     infrastructure will help address these projects' special \n     needs by supplementing existing Federal programs and \n     leveraging private capital investment.\n       This title is designed to encourage the development of \n     large, capital-intensive infrastructure facilities through \n     public-private partnerships consisting of a State or local \n     governmental project sponsor and one or more private sector \n     firms involved in the design, construction or operation of \n     the facility. The Federal credit enhancement program is \n     targeted to those projects whose financings are payable in \n     whole or in part by user charges, such as tolls, or other \n     dedicated funding sources. By taking advantage of the \n     public's willingness to pay user fees to receive the benefits \n     and services of transportation infrastructure sooner than \n     would be possible under traditional grant-based financing, \n     the program will result in a more efficient and equitable \n     allocation of the Nation's resources.\n       The program should result in additional surface \n     transportation facilities being developed more quickly and at \n     a lower cost than would be the case under conventional public \n     procurement, funding and operation. In addition to the \n     benefits of enhanced accessibility in moving goods and \n     people, such transportation facilities should provide \n     benefits to the Nation in terms of stimulating job creation \n     and enhancing the Nation's economic competitiveness overseas.\n     Sec. 5003. Definitions\n       This section sets forth the definitions for terms used in \n     this title. Key terms are listed below: A ``Project'' is \n     defined as any publicly-owned surface transportation facility \n     eligible under the expanded provisions of title 23 as well as \n     chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code. Permitted \n     Projects would include free or tolled highways, bridges and \n     tunnels; mass transportation facilities and vehicles; inter-\n     city passenger rail facilities and vehicles (including \n     Amtrak); publicly owned freight rail facilities; and various \n     intermodal facilities.\n       The term ``Eligible Project Costs'' is defined to include \n     those costs of a capital nature incurred by a Project Sponsor \n     in connection with developing an infrastructure Project. \n     These costs fall into three categories: (i) pre-construction \n     costs relating to planning, design, and securing governmental \n     permits and approvals; (ii) hard costs relating to the design \n     and construction (or rehabilitation) of a Project; and (iii) \n     related soft costs associated with the financing of the \n     Project, such as interest during construction, reserve \n     accounts, and issuance expenses. It would not include \n     operation or maintenance costs.\n       The term ``Project Obligation'' means any debt instrument \n     issued by a Project Sponsor in connection with the financing \n     of a Project.\n       A ``Project Sponsor'' is defined as any entity (whether a \n     State or local governmental unit, a private entity authorized \n     by such governmental unit to develop a Project, or a public-\n     private partnership) that is an issuer or obligor of debt \n     obligations used to finance a Project.\n       A ``Revenue Stabilization Fund'' is defined as a reserve \n     account capitalized with Federal grants pursuant to this \n     title or contributions from other entities, which may be used \n     for the payment of principal of and interest on Project \n     Obligations.\n     Sec. 5004. Determination of Eligibility and Project Selection\n       This section defines the threshold eligibility criteria for \n     a Project to receive Federal credit enhancement and outlines \n     the basis upon which the Secretary will select among \n     potential candidates. The Secretary's determination of a \n     Project's eligibility will be based on both quantitative and \n     qualitative factors, and the Secretary should consult with \n     the Secretary of the Treasury in making this determination.\n       Of prime importance, the Project must be deemed by the \n     Secretary to be ``nationally significant'' in terms of \n     facilitating the movement of people and goods in a more \n     efficient and cost-effective manner, resulting in major \n     economic benefits.\n       Also, the Project sponsor must demonstrate that it cannot \n     obtain adequate financing on reasonable terms and conditions \n     from other sources in order to be eligible for Federal credit \n     enhancement. The Federal government's assistance is designed \n     to assist Projects which otherwise would have difficulty in \n     accessing the private capital markets to obtain the required \n     financing.\n       To ensure that the Project enjoys both State and local \n     support, it must be included in the State's transportation \n     plan and program and, if the Project is in a metropolitan \n     area, it must satisfy all metropolitan planning requirements \n     of 23 U.S.C. 134. The State or a State-designated entity will \n     be responsible for forwarding the Project application to the \n     Secretary.\n       In terms of size, the Project must cost at least \n     $100,000,000 or an amount equal to 50 percent of the State's \n     annual Federal-aid highway apportionments, whichever is less. \n     This two-fold test is designed to allow small and rural \n     States to accommodate Projects otherwise too large for their \n     transportation programs. Based on fiscal year 1997 \n     apportionments, 18 States could qualify Projects costing less \n     than $100 million, with the minimum amount equaling \n     approximately $40 million.\n       In addition, a Project must be supported at least in part \n     by user charges, such as tolls, or other dedicated revenue \n     sources to encourage the development of new revenue streams \n     and the participation of the private sector.\n       Project applicants meeting the threshold eligibility \n     criteria then will be evaluated by the Secretary based on a \n     number of other factors. Among them are: the likelihood that \n     the Federal assistance will enable the Project to proceed at \n     an earlier date; the degree to which the Project leverages \n     non-Federal resources, including private sector capital; the \n     degree to which public benefits exceed public costs; and the \n     Project's overall creditworthiness.\n       This section also provides that all requirements of titles \n     23 and 49, United States Code, shall apply to funds made \n     available under this title and Projects assisted with such \n     funds unless the Secretary determines that any such \n     requirement is inconsistent with any provision of this title. \n     This section provides, however, that the Secretary cannot \n     waive 23 U.S.C. 113, the provision that applies Davis Bacon \n     Act wage requirements to title 23 projects, 23 U.S.C. 114, \n     concerning convict labor, and the labor protection provisions \n     which are found in 49 U.S.C. 5333. This section does not \n     affect the Secretary's responsibilities under any other \n     Federal law.\n     Sec. 5005. Revenue Stabilization Funds\n       This section authorizes the Secretary to make grants to \n     Project Sponsors to capitalize Revenue Stabilization Funds. A \n     Project's Revenue Stabilization Fund could be drawn upon if \n     needed to pay debt service on the Project's debt obligations \n     in the event of revenue shortfalls. The Revenue Stabilization \n     Fund may be used to secure junior lien debt or other \n     obligations requiring credit enhancement, as determined by \n     the Secretary. Limiting the Revenue Stabilization Funds to \n     these types of obligations is designed to maximize the \n     Project's ability to leverage private capital, and assist it \n     in obtaining investment grade ratings on its senior debt.\n       The principal amount of the deposit could not exceed 20 \n     percent of Eligible Project Costs. Moneys in the Fund are to \n     be invested in U.S. Treasury securities or other prudent \n     investments approved by the Secretary, with interest earnings \n     credited to the Revenue Stabilization Fund. Beginning five \n     years after the Project is completed, amounts in the Fund in \n     excess of the level needed to secure the Project Obligations \n     may be applied to pay other Eligible Project Costs, with the \n     approval of the Secretary.\n       This section also provides that Project Obligations secured \n     by the Revenue Stabilization Fund are not considered \n     federally guaranteed under the tax code, enabling the Fund to \n     back both taxable and tax-exempt debt.\n       The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of the \n     Treasury in devising rules for the implementation of this \n     section.\n     Sec. 5006. Rules and Regulations\n       Program guidelines will be established by the Secretary in \n     order to ensure the program operates prudently and \n     efficiently, including requiring Project Sponsors to provide \n     annual audits.\n     Sec. 5007. Funding\n       The sum of $100 million per year between FY 1998 and FY \n     2003 is authorized to fund the Transportation Infrastructure \n     Credit Enhancement Program.\n\n\n                           TITLE VI--RESEARCH\n\n                    PART A--PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES\n\n     Sec. 6001. Research, Development, and Technology\n       This section adds a new chapter 52 to subtitle III of title \n     49, United States Code. Among the critical challenges the \n     Department faces is the need for strategic investment in the \n     Nation's surface transportation infrastructure. Chapter 52 \n     addresses this challenge by strengthening the Department's \n     efforts in intermodal and multimodal research and \n     development. It recognizes that improvements in the surface \n     transportation infrastructure require attention to \n     crosscutting research in areas such as nondestructive \n     testing, information technologies, urban transportation, the \n     future transportation workforce, and the environment.\n       New chapter 52 is divided into subchapters. Subchapter I \n     supplements existing administrative authorities. New section \n     5201 provides the Secretary general authority to enter into \n     grants, cooperative agreements, and other transactions with \n     states, industry, educational or other non-profit \n     institutions, and other entities to further the objectives of \n     the chapter. The Department strives to leverage its research \n     dollars through cost-sharing with the private sector. Major \n     disincentives to cost-sharing in the research\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\n     area have been the allocation of data rights and the \n     limitations of standard financial management and intellectual \n     property provisions. Cooperative agreements and other \n     transactions provide needed flexibility to achieve cost-\n     sharing in the Department's research programs. This provision \n     would fill gaps in existing Departmental authority.\n       New section 5202 streamlines the procurement process for \n     transportation research and development to be conducted by \n     institutions of higher education that have already competed \n     for transportation grants under this chapter. This approach \n     follows the example of the successful pilot developed by the \n     Federal Aviation Administration under the National \n     Performance Review Laboratory, whereby universities which had \n     prevailed in full and open competition for award of grants as \n     Aviation Centers of Excellence were eligible to receive sole \n     source contracts for related activities. This provided \n     additional incentive to prospective proposers in the \n     competition and facilitated the Department's ability to take \n     advantage of its investment in the national centers of \n     excellence. Additional grants and contracts authorized by \n     section 5202 will be limited to work that is consistent with \n     the original grant. These additional awards would not require \n     specific justification under the Competition in Contracting \n     Act.\n       New subchapter II provides for the planning necessary for \n     the success of long-term research  and development. New \n     section 5221 requires the Secretary to establish a \n     strategic planning process to determine national \n     priorities for transportation research and development, \n     coordinate Federal activities in the area, and evaluate \n     the impact of the Federal investment. In planning, the \n     Secretary must consider the concept of seamless \n     transportation, innovation, and the need to compete \n     globally. The Secretary has broad discretion in \n     implementation and may, if appropriate, use an interagency \n     executive council or a board of science advisors.\n       New subchapter III establishes a research and technology \n     program within the Department to concentrate on intermodal \n     and multimodal issues. The program recognizes that much of \n     the research sponsored by the Department focuses on \n     individual modes of transportation and that there is a need \n     for research and technology development that is truly \n     intermodal or multimodal in nature.\n       New subchapter IV addresses both current research needs and \n     the need for a transportation workforce capable of meeting \n     the challenges of transportation in the future. New section \n     5241 consolidates and modifies the two programs currently \n     authorized by sections 5316 and 5317 of title 49: the \n     University Research Institutes and the University \n     Transportation Centers. It would continue the ten regional \n     university transportation centers. The current array of \n     national centers and institutes, each of which concentrates \n     on a particular transportation issue specified in statute, \n     would be consolidated into a single system. This system \n     authorizes the Secretary to fund up to ten national centers \n     whose themes are designated by the Secretary to meet national \n     transportation needs. Selection of all centers would be by \n     open competition. The centers conduct transportation research \n     that is widely disseminated. The centers also conduct \n     education and training, not only to attract highly qualified \n     graduate and undergraduate students into transportation-\n     related fields, but also to expose current transportation \n     practitioners to developments in transportation theory and \n     practice. The new authorizing language incorporates existing \n     practice and provides needed flexibility for the program. For \n     example, centers which perform transit-related research would \n     now be allowed to meet requirements for the ``match'' of \n     grant funds provided under this section with operating funds \n     provided by mass transit authorities whose potential for \n     sponsoring such research might otherwise be limited.\n     Sec. 6002. Bureau of Transportation Statistics\n       Subsection (a)(a1). The provision relating to the term of \n     the first Director of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics \n     is stricken as being obsolete.\n       Subsection (a)(2). The list of topics to be covered by \n     statistics compiled by the Bureau is expanded to include \n     transportation-related variables influencing global \n     competitiveness, recognizing the growing importance of \n     international trade to the nation's economy, the impact of \n     international trade on domestic transportation facilities and \n     services, and the impact of transportation on the ability of \n     domestic U.S. businesses to reach foreign markets.\n       Subsection (a)(3). The Director's responsibilities for long \n     term data collection are to be coordinated with other efforts \n     in support of the Government Performance and Results Act \n     (GPRA), which was passed subsequent to ISTEA and extends \n     beyond the efforts to develop surface transportation system \n     performance indicators under 23 USC 307(b)(3). The Director \n     is to ensure that the long term data collection is made \n     relevant to States and metropolitan planning organizations in \n     recognition of their increased role in transportation \n     decision making.\n       Subsection (a)(4). Also in support of the GPRA, BTS will \n     report to the Secretary on the sources and reliability of \n     statistics from DOT modal Administrations required by the Act \n     and for other purposes.\n       Subsection (a)(5). This amendment provides that the \n     Director's responsibilities for providing statistics is \n     specifically tied to the support of transportation decision \n     making. This assures that the Bureau's activities are \n     relevant and provides a basis for evaluating the Bureau under \n     the Government Performance and Results Act.\n       Subsection (a)(6). This paragraph would amend section 111 \n     by deleting an obsolete subsection relating to functions \n     performed by the first Director of BTS and by adding four new \n     subsections. New subsection (d) would clarify the content of \n     the Intermodal Transportation Data Base, originally specified \n     in section 5002 of ISTEA (now codified at 49 U.S.C. 5503(d)). \n     That provision will be repealed by a conforming amendment \n     (see below). In response to a General Accounting Office \n     concern with a lack of universally accepted definitions of \n     intermodal transportation, the data base is made inclusive of \n     movements by competing and complementary modes of \n     transportation as well as by intermodal combinations. The \n     original requirements for data on patterns of passenger and \n     commodity movements are clarified to include international \n     and local movement as well as intercity movements, since all \n     levels of movement affect transportation facilities of \n     national significance. The original requirement for \n     information on public and private investments in intermodal \n     transportation facilities and services was open to many \n     interpretations, particularly with respect to the level of \n     geographic specificity. Initial experience with developing \n     the data base demonstrated that facility-level data was \n     obtainable and useful for locational characteristics, but \n     that investment-related data was cost-effective to develop \n     only for national and industry aggregates. The requirement is \n     clarified to include locational and connectivity data for \n     facilities and services, and national data on expenditures \n     and capital stocks.\n       New subsection (e) codifies in law the goals and purpose of \n     the Bureau's existing National Transportation Library, as \n     referenced in the Senate Report of the FY 1997 DOT \n     appropriations bill. The goals and purpose are consistent \n     with other national libraries, such as the Library of \n     Medicine.\n       New subsection (f) codifies the general content of the \n     Bureau's National Transportation Atlas Data Base (NTAD), \n     developed in response to needs of the transportation \n     community and to the National Spatial Data Infrastructure \n     (NSDI) under Executive Order 12906. The NTAD is to be capable \n     of integration with other government maintained \n     transportation databases, such as the Census TIGER files and \n     the U.S. Geological Survey DLG files. BTS also will assume  \n     leadership for the development of a national ground \n     transportation data base as an Executive Order 12906 \n     framework data layer for the NSDI and will coordinate with \n     the Census Bureau, the Geological Survey, and other \n     appropriate Federal agencies.\n       New subsection (g) would authorize the Bureau to establish \n     grants and cooperative agreements with public and not-for-\n     profit private organizations to conduct research and \n     development in support of the Bureau's major activities, \n     including the Transportation Statistics Annual Report, data \n     collection, the National Transportation Library, and the \n     National Transportation Atlas Data Base.\n       Subsection (a)(7). This subsection would enhance the \n     current provision governing the protection of confidentiality \n     of data provided to the Bureau. General protections provided \n     by the ISTEA were not specific to statistical agencies, and \n     are not adequate to protect the privacy of respondents. \n     Stronger protections are necessary to enhance the \n     respondent's confidence that sensitive information will not \n     be compromised, thus ensuring respondent cooperation with the \n     Bureau's data collection efforts. The confidentiality \n     provisions are based on those applicable to the Bureau of the \n     Census.\n       Subsection (a)(8). The January 1, 1994 due date for the \n     initial Transportation Statistics Annual Report is removed as \n     obsolete and the requirement that BTS file its report by \n     January 1 of each year is deleted. The Bureau obtains most \n     data for its report each year by December, and prepares most \n     analyses of the data by January. However, because editing and \n     production of the report require additional time, the January \n     1 deadline is impractical.\n       Subsection (a)(9). This paragraph add two new subsections \n     to section 111. New subsection (k) is based on the provisions \n     in the FY1996 and FY1997 DOT Appropriations Acts that allow \n     the Bureau to retain funds from the sale of products. New \n     subsection (l) provides for funding of the Bureau's \n     activities in the amount of $31 million from the Highway \n     Trust Fund per fiscal year for fiscal years 1998 through \n     2003, with a limitation of $500,000 per year for grant \n     activities under new subsection (g). As under ISTEA, it also \n     provides contract authority for such funds.\n       Subsection (b). This paragraph makes a conforming amendment \n     to 49 U.S.C. 5503 regarding the responsibility of the Bureau \n     to establish an intermodal transportation data base. This \n     requirement is clarified and incorporated into section 111 by \n     the amendment contained in subsection (a)(5).\n     Sec. 6003. Research and Technology Program\n        This section revises 23 U.S.C. 307 as indicated below.\n       Preamble: Subsection (a)(1) is a new preamble defining the \n     Secretary's general authority under the section to develop \n     and administer programs for research, technology, and \n     education.\n       Authority of the Secretary; In General: Subsection \n     (a)(2)(A) grants authority to the Secretary to engage in \n     research, \n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\n     development, and technology transfer activities with respect \n     to motor carrier transportation and all phases of highway \n     planning and development. This is the same as current law at \n     23 U.S.C. Sec. 307(a)(1)(A), but renumbered.\n       Cooperation, Grants, and Contracts: Subsection (a)(2)(B) \n     authorizes the Secretary to carry out the research and \n     technology program independently or through cooperative \n     agreements, grants, contracts, and other transactions. This \n     is similar to current 23 U.S.C. Sec. 307(a)(1)(B).\n       Technical Innovation: Subsection (a)(2)(C) requires the \n     Secretary to develop and administer programs to facilitate \n     the application of the products of research and technical \n     innovations to improve the safety, efficiency, and \n     effectiveness of the highway system. This program may \n     encompass products from all available sources, including the \n     private sector and both the domestic and international \n     communities.\n       Funds: Subsection (a)(2)(D) replaces the provision \n     currently at 23 U.S.C. Sec. 307(a)(3)(A), expands it to \n     include a ``use of funds'' clause that opens up use of funds \n     for activities necessary to interact with, or deliver \n     technology to, DOT customers and partners, and drops 23 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 307(a)(3)(B), Minimum Expenditures on Long-Term \n     Research Projects, which is covered under a separate section.\n       Collaborative Research and Development: Subsection (a)(3), \n     currently 23 U.S.C. Sec. 307(a)(2), authorizes the Secretary \n     to undertake and continue, on a cost-shared basis, \n     collaborative research and development with non-Federal \n     entities for the purposes of encouraging innovative solutions \n     to highway problems and stimulating the marketing of new \n     technology by private industry.\n       Mandatory Contents of Program: Proposed subsection (b) \n     consolidates current law at 23 U.S.C. Sec. 307(b), dropping \n     subsection (b)(2), SHRP Results, which is recaptured in a new \n     section; dropping subsection (b)(4), Short Haul Passenger \n     Transportation Systems, which required a report to Congress \n     by January 15, 1993; and dropping (b)(5)(C) which required \n     submission to Congress by July 1, 1992, a report with \n     recommendations regarding the need for a construction \n     equipment research and development program.\n     Sec. 6004. National Technology Deployment Initiatives\n       This new section establishes a National Technology \n     Deployment Initiatives Program to significantly expand the \n     adoption of innovative technologies by the surface \n     transportation community in seven goal areas. Progress \n     reports to the Congress are required at 18 and 48 months. \n     More specifically:\n       Establishment: Subsection (a) directs the Secretary to \n     develop and administer a National Technology Deployment \n     Initiatives program to significantly expand the adoption of \n     innovative technologies by the surface transportation \n     community. Deployment Goals: Subsection (b) outlines the \n     deployment goals of the program to be carried out under \n     this subsection. For each of these goals, described in (1) \n     through (7), the Secretary will work with representatives \n     of the transportation community to develop strategies and \n     initiatives to achieve the goal.\n       Reporting: Subsection (c) mandates reports to the House of \n     Representatives and Senate on progress and results or \n     activities carried out under this section not later than 18 \n     months after enactment and then another at 48 months.\n       Funding: Subsection (d) directs the Secretary to expend \n     from the Highway Trust Fund (other than the mass transit \n     account) $56,000,000 per fiscal year for each of the fiscal \n     years 1998, 1999, and 2000, and $84,000,000 for years 2001, \n     2002, and 2003. The Secretary is authorized to allocate the \n     funds to States for their use.\n       Leveraging of Resources: Under subsection (e), the \n     Secretary is directed to give preference to projects that \n     leverage Federal funds against resources from other sources.\n       Contract Authority: Subsection (f) makes funds authorized \n     by this subsection applicable for obligation in the same \n     manner as if apportioned under chapter 1 of title 23, U.S.C.; \n     except that the Federal share of the cost of any activity \n     shall be determined in accordance with this section and such \n     funds shall be available for obligation for a period of three \n     years after the last day of the fiscal year for which such \n     funds are authorized. Furthermore, the Secretary may waive \n     application of any provision of title 23 that is a barrier to \n     the use of new technology if he determines such waiver is not \n     contrary to the public interest and will advance technical \n     innovation. Any waiver shall be published in the Federal \n     Register with reasons for such waiver.\n     Sec. 6005. Professional Capacity-Building and Technology \n         Partnerships\n       This new section brings together technology transfer \n     programs and activities, including education and training \n     efforts, that focus on equipping people to use new \n     technologies. Private agencies, international and foreign \n     entities, and individuals shall pay the full cost of any such \n     training, education, technical assistance, or other support \n     provided through these programs and activities in accordance \n     with this section.\n       Local Technical Assistance Program: Subsection (a) provides \n     significant changes to this program. First, contractors \n     working for local and tribal governments are specifically \n     called out as customers of the program. Then the number of \n     tribal centers is changed from 2 to 4 to better reflect the \n     number of centers able to benefit from this program. The \n     major change is in funding. The new proposed amount is \n     $12,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2003 from \n     the Highway Trust Fund.\n       Local Technical Assistance Program: This section authorizes \n     the Secretary to carry out a transportation assistance \n     program to provide modern highway technology to highway and \n     transportation agencies in urbanized areas with populations \n     between 50,000 and 1,000,000 and in rural areas, and to the \n     contractors doing work for them. This is similar to current \n     law at 23 U.S.C. Sec. 326(a), but adds contractors.\n       Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts: Subsection \n     (a)(2) allows the Secretary to make grants and enter into \n     cooperative agreements and contracts for education and \n     training. This is similar to current law at 23 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 326(b), and provides the option for cooperative \n     agreements.\n       Subsection (a)(2)(A) defines the training grants, \n     cooperative agreements, and contracts allowed as those that \n     assist rural local transportation agencies and tribal \n     governments, and the consultants and construction personnel \n     working for them, to develop and expand their expertise in \n     specific areas. This is similar to current law at 23 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 326(b)(1), but adds an option for training in \n     intergovernmental transportation planning and project \n     selection, in place of development of a tourism or \n     recreational travel program, which has been completed. This \n     provision also adds reference to the consultants and \n     construction personnel employed by local agencies.\n       Subsection (a)(2)(C) allows grants, cooperative agreements, \n     and contracts that will operate, in cooperation with State \n     transportation agencies and universities (i) technical \n     assistance program centers to provide technology transfer to \n     rural areas and urban areas of more than 50,000 people, and \n     (ii) not fewer than four centers designated to provide \n     transportation technology assistance to American Indian \n     tribal governments. This is similar to current law at 23 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 326, but specifies grants, agreements, and \n     contracts that will operate, rather than establish, the \n     centers that are described in (i) and (ii).\n       Subsection (a)(2)(D) allows grants, cooperative agreements, \n     and contracts with local transportation agencies and tribal \n     governments and the private sector to enhance new technology \n     implementation.\n       Funding: Under subsection (a)(3), the sum of $12,000,000 \n     per fiscal year is authorized from the Highway Trust Fund to \n     provide funding for the program and for technical and \n     financial support to the technology transfer centers. This is \n     similar to current law at 23 U.S.C. Sec. 326(c), but raises \n     the funding level to $12,000,000 per fiscal year of the \n     period of authorization and directs the funds to be deducted \n     from the Highway Trust Fund.\n       Contract Authority: Subsection (a)(4) is new and defines \n     the applicability of title 23 to these funds, thereby \n     providing contract authority.\n       National Highway Institute: Section (b) codifies current 23 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 321 as a separate section, with several changes. \n     The basic change raises the set-aside for State training \n     programs from 1/16 to\\1/4\\ of 1 percent. Fees may still be \n     collected from States, but are not required.\n       Subsection (b)(1)(A) and (B) describe the establishment, \n     duties, and programs of the NHI. This is the same as current \n     law, except that subsection (b)(1)(B) expands current law to \n     acknowledge that the Institute's programs with industry are \n     growing, and that the Institute administers education, as \n     well as training programs.\n       Set-Aside; Federal Share: Subsection (b)(2) directs that \n     not more than\\1/4\\ of 1 percent of all funds apportioned to a \n     State under 104(b)(3) for the surface transpor- \n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\n     tation program shall be available for the State \n     transportation agencies' payment for up to 80 percent of the \n     cost of their employees' educational expenses. This is \n     similar to current law at 23 U.S.C. Sec. 321(b), but raises \n     the percentage of set-aside funds from 1/16 of 1 percent.\n       Federal Responsibility: Subsection (b)(3) permits education \n     and training of Federal, State, and local highway employees \n     be provided (A) by the Secretary at no cost; or (B) by the \n     State through grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts; \n     except that private agencies, international entities, and \n     individuals shall pay the full cost of education and training \n     unless the Secretary determines a lower cost to be in the \n     best interest of the United States. This is similar to \n     current law, but subsection (b)(3)(A) is expanded to apply to \n     all training the current provision that training in ``those \n     subject areas which are a Federal Programs Responsibility'' \n     may be provided without charge to States and local \n     government. Subsection (b)(3)(B) allows education and \n     training to be paid by the State through cooperative \n     agreements, in addition to grants and contracts, and adds \n     international entities to those that must pay the full cost \n     of education and training. An added clause allows the \n     Secretary to reduce charges to private agencies, \n     international entities, or individuals when in the U.S. \n     interest to do so. The Secretary shall use this authority \n     very sparingly, and any reduction in costs should be done \n     only upon strong justification that such reduction is in the \n     national interest, such as in conjunction with NAFTA.\n       Training Fellowships; Cooperation: Subsection (b)(4) \n     authorizes the Institute to engage in all phases of contract \n     authority, including the granting of training fellowships, \n     independently or in cooperation with other entities. This is \n     the same as current law at 23 U.S.C. Sec. 321(d).\n       Collection of Fees: Subsection (b)(5)(A) through (C) \n     describes the Institutes collection of fees, including \n     limitations, persons subject to fees, and the amount of fees \n     allowed. This is the same as current law at 23 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 321(e).\n       Funds: Subsection (b)(6) authorizes funds to support the \n     NHI from the Highway Trust Fund in the amount of $8,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2000, and $14,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003.\n       Contract Authority: Subsection (b)(7) defines the \n     applicability of title 23 to funds, providing contract \n     authority for this program. This is a revision of current \n     law.\n       Contracts: Under subsection (b)(8), the provision of \n     section 3709 of the Revised Statutes shall not be applicable \n     to contracts or agreements made under this section. This is \n     similar to current law at 23 U.S.C. Sec. 321(g).\n\n\n       Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship Program\n\n       Subsection (c) law is currently at 23 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 307(a)(1)(C)(ii).\n       General Authority: Subsection (c)(1) allows the Secretary \n     to make grants for research fellowships for any purpose for \n     which research, technology, or capacity building is \n     authorized by this section. This is the same as current law, \n     but adds references to technology and capacity building.\n       Subsection (c)(2) provides for the implementation of the \n     Eisenhower Transportation fellowship for the purpose of \n     attracting qualified students to the field of transportation. \n     Further, fellowships are to be offered at the junior through \n     postdoctoral levels of college education, and recipients must \n     be U.S. citizens. This is similar to current law, but \n     provides for the implementation of the fellowship, rather \n     than establishment and implementation. The program's purpose \n     is to attract students to the general field of \n     transportation, rather than specifically attracting \n     transportation engineering and research students. Reference \n     to proposed funding level has been cut, and students eligible \n     for the fellowships have been defined as those U.S. citizens \n     in their junior through postdoctoral levels of college.\n       Funding: Subsection (c) also authorizes $2,000,000 from the \n     Highway Trust Fund for each of fiscal years 1998 through \n     2003, and provides contract authority for such program.\n\n\n                 Technology Implementation Partnerships\n\n       This provision sets forth, as a separate subsection, \n     language that is similar to 23 U.S.C. Sec. 307(b)(2) that \n     essentially provides for continued support of efforts to \n     implement the products of the Strategic Highway Research \n     Program and to begin to address the new technical innovations \n     coming out of the Long-Term Pavement Performance program.\n       Authority: Subsection (d)(1) directs the Secretary to \n     continue close partnerships established through the Strategic \n     Highway Research Program and administer a program to move \n     technology and innovation into common practice.\n       Subsection (d)(2)(A) through (D) authorizes the Secretary \n     to make grants and enter into cooperative agreements and \n     contracts to foster alliances and support efforts to bring \n     about technical change in high-payoff areas through defined \n     approaches.\n       Funding: Subsection (d) also authorizes $11,000,000 per \n     fiscal year out of the Highway Trust Fund for each of fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2003 to carry out this section.\n     Sec. 6006. Long-Term Pavement Performance and Advanced \n         Research\n       This section sets forth a new, revised section continuing \n     and revising the Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) \n     program currently codified at 23 U.S.C. Sec. 307(b)(3), and \n     establishes a new Advanced Research program.\n       Authority: Subsection (a)(1) directs the Secretary to \n     continue the LTPP, now at the mid-point of its 20-year \n     schedule, to completion.\n       Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts: Subsection \n     (a)(2) identifies elements of the program for which \n     procurement arrangements may be initiated.\n       Funding: Subsection (a)(3) and (4) provide for funding the \n     program from the Highway Trust Fund at $15,000,000 each of \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2003.\n       Advanced Research; Authority: Subsection (b)(1) requires \n     the Secretary to establish a program to address longer-term, \n     higher-risk research.\n       Subsection (b)(2) identifies, but does not limit, areas for \n     advanced research.\n       Funding: Subsection (b)(3) funds the program at $10,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2000, and $20,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2001 through 2003, from the Highway \n     Trust Fund.\n     Sec. 6007. State Planning and Research Program (SP)\n       This section sets forth a new section in title 23, which \n     incorporates, with revisions, subsection 307(c) of title 23, \n     United States Code.\n       Subsection (a)(1) defines the general rule, which directs \n     that 2 percent of the funds apportioned for the National \n     Highway System, congestion management and air quality \n     improvement program, surface transportation program, \n     Interstate reimbursement, Interstate maintenance, and highway \n     bridge replacement and rehabilitation programs for each \n     fiscal year of the period of authorization be available for \n     expenditure by the State transportation agency for specified \n     purposes. Language has been added to correct an oversight in \n     ISTEA that resulted in SP funds not being set aside from \n     the Interstate reimbursement program which replaced the \n     Interstate construction program from which SPR funds were \n     previously set aside.\n       Subsection (a)(1) of this section makes SP funding \n     available for engineering and economic surveys, same as \n     current law.\n       Subsection (a)(2) makes SP funding available for \n     metropolitan, statewide and non-metropolitan planning, \n     including planning for highway, public transportation, and \n     intermodal transportation systems. It revises current law by \n     adding metropolitan and non-metropolitan planning, which is a \n     technical change because these funds are currently eligible \n     for planning and research for these areas.\n       Subsection (a)(3) makes SP funding available for \n     development and implementation of management systems, similar \n     to current law, with added reference to section 303 of title \n     23 where the management systems are described.\n       Subsection (a)(4) makes SP funding available for studies \n     of the economy, safety, and convenience of highway, public \n     transportation, and intermodal transportation usage, same as \n     current law.\n       Subsection (a)(5) makes SP funding available for \n     necessary studies, research, development, and technology \n     transfer activities. It is similar to existing law, with \n     revisions to clarify that States may use SP funds to \n     support training on engineering standards and construction \n     materials, including evaluation and accreditation of \n     inspection and testing of engineering standards and \n     construction materials.\n       Subsection (b) requires minimum expenditures on research, \n     development, and technology transfer activities of not less \n     than 25 percent of the apportioned funds, unless the State \n     certifies otherwise to the Secretary and the Secretary \n     accepts such certification. It also includes an exemption for \n     SP research funds from the assessment under the\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\n     Small Business Research and Development Act (Public Law 102-\n     564).\n       Subsection (c) requires that the Federal share shall be 80 \n     percent with discretion for the Secretary to adjust the non-\n     Federal share if it is in the interests of the Federal-aid \n     highway program, same as existing law.\n       Subsection (d) requires that, while the SP funds are \n     derived from those program apportionments to each State \n     specified in subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall combine \n     and administer the funds as single fund.\n     Sec. 6008. Use of BIA Administrative Funds\n       This section corrects a section reference.\n\n\n         PART B--INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ACT OF 1997\n\n       Sections 6051-6058 replace the sections 6051-6059 of Title \n     VI, Part B of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991 (``ITS Act of 1991''), Public Law 102-\n     240. Reference is made to provisions of these sections which \n     are being retained, modified, or deleted.\n     Section 6051. Short title and Preamble\n       Subsection 6051(b) designates the name of title VI as the \n     Intelligent Transportation systems Act of 1997 (ITS Act).\n       Subsection 6051(b) sets forth the purpose of the ITS Act of \n     1997: to provide for accelerated deployment of proven \n     technologies and concepts and increased Federal commitment to \n     improving surface transportation safety.\n     Section 6052. Definitions: Conforming Amendment\n       Consistent with new program directions, the definitions in \n     section 6058 of the ITS Act of 1991 are continued and \n     expanded to add the following newly-defined terms: \n     Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure, National \n     Architecture, NHS (National Highway System), National \n     Program Plan, CVO (Commercial Vehicle Operations), CVISN \n     (Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks), \n     ARTS (Advanced Rural Transportation Systems), and ITS \n     Collision Avoidance Systems. This section also amends \n     ISTEA to strike part B of title VI.\n     Section 6053. Scope of Program\n       Subsection 6053(a) in part extends the expiring provisions \n     of the ITS Act of 1991 with respect to research, development \n     and operational testing of intelligent transportation systems \n     (ITS), and in part adds a new focus on deployment.\n       Subsection 6053(b) restates and updates the goals and \n     related authorities of the ITS Act of 1991. The changes make \n     explicit the existing authorities in titles 23 and 49 of the \n     United States Code under which broad ITS program goals, \n     including research and provision of technical and financial \n     assistance, may be undertaken as part of the general \n     programs. The subsection restates program goals to reflect \n     current priorities, including optimizing existing facilities \n     to meet future transportation needs, emphasizing safety, \n     improving the economic efficiency of surface transportation \n     systems, improving public accessibility to goods and \n     services, and developing standards and protocols.\n     Section 6054. General Authorities and Requirements\n       Subsection 6054(a) modifies the provisions of the ITS Act \n     of 1991 which seeks to foster cooperation between State and \n     local governments and the private sector by increasing the \n     emphasis on the widespread deployment of intelligent \n     transportation systems (ITS), while continuing Federal \n     leadership in research and technical assistance. A reference \n     to involving Historically Black Colleges and Universities and \n     other Minority Institutions of Higher Education in work \n     undertaken by the program is added.\n       Subsection 6054(b) restates and extends the ITS Act of 1991 \n     by directing the Secretary not only to continue to develop \n     and implement national standards and protocols but also to \n     act to secure permanent spectrum allocation for Dedicated \n     Short Range Communications, recognizing the importance of \n     ensuring availability of a common vehicle-to-wayside wireless \n     communications capability for ITS applications.\n       Subsection 6054(c) directs the Secretary to provide \n     independent and objective evaluation of field and related \n     operational tests in order to ensure credible results and \n     avoid actual or apparent conflicts-of-interest.\n       Subsections 6054(d) and 6054(e) continue the provisions of \n     the ITS Act of 1991 as they relate to the Information \n     Clearinghouse and Advisory Committees.\n       Subsection 6054(f) is added to make explicit the authority \n     of States and eligible local entities to utilize funds \n     authorized under certain existing sections of titles 23 and \n     49 of the United States Code to carry out implementation, \n     modernization and operational activities involving \n     intelligent transportation infrastructure and systems as \n     mainstream program activities.\n       Subsection 6054(g) is added to require conformity with the \n     National Architecture and ITS-related standards and \n     protocols. It is envisioned that the Secretary will establish \n     on an annual basis which standards and protocols are required \n     to be used. This subsection also provides an exception from \n     this requirement for DOT-sponsored research project, to \n     enable the Department to explore and test a wide range of \n     activities, including non-conforming approaches.\n       Subsection 6054(h) seeks to assure that flexibility \n     provided under NEXTEA to allow Federal-aid funding of \n     operations and maintenance costs for ITS projects is \n     effectively used by requiring life-cycle cost analyses when \n     Federal funds are to be used to reimburse operations and \n     maintenance costs and the estimated initial cost of the \n     project to public authorities exceeds $3,000,000.\n       Subsection 6054(i) directs the Secretary to develop \n     guidance and technical assistance on appropriate procurement \n     methods for ITS projects, including innovative and non-\n     traditional methods.\n     Section 6055. ITS National Program Plan, Implementation and \n         Report to Congress\n       Subsection 6055(a) mandates the updating of the ITS \n     National Program Plan on an as-needed basis, and details the \n     scope of the Plan, which reflects a new focus on deployment \n     and monitoring, development of standards, and achieving \n     desired surface transportation system performance levels.\n       Subsection 6055(b) provides for accelerated development and \n     operational testing, in cooperation with industry, of \n     demonstration advanced vehicle control systems and, in \n     particular, for equipping one or more fleets for field \n     evaluations of safety benefits and user acceptance by 2002.\n       Subsection 6055(c) requires an implementation report on the \n     National Program Plan no later than one year after the date \n     of the enactment of the ITS Act of 1997 and biennially \n     thereafter. Two reports on the Nontechnical Constraints to \n     the deployment of intelligent transportation systems called \n     for by the ITS Act of 1991 have been completed and future \n     updates can be incorporated as part of the National Program \n     Plan Report, therefore separate reports on these issues are \n     discontinued.\n     Section 6056. Technical, Training, Planning, Research and \n         Operational Testing Project Assistance\n       Subsection 6056(a) permits the Secretary to provide \n     technical assistance, including training, to state and local \n     government agencies interested in effectively considering, \n     planning, implementing, operating, and maintaining ITS \n     technologies and services. Technical assistance may include \n     guidance on incorporating ITS into Statewide and metropolitan \n     area transportation plans, revising State and local laws and \n     ordinances to enable ITS services, use of innovative \n     financing and acquisition strategies, and a wide range of \n     other activities designed to assist State and local \n     government agencies to effectively deploy ITS in an \n     integrated, interoperable fashion.\n       Subsection 6056(b) authorizes the Secretary to provide \n     financial assistance and technical support for planning and \n     consideration of metropolitan and statewide ITS operations \n     and management issues.\n       Subsection 6056(c) continues eligibility of commercial \n     vehicle regulatory agencies, traffic management entities, \n     independent authorities, and other entities contracted by a \n     State or local agency for ITS project work, to receive \n     Federal assistance under this part.\n       Subsection 6056(d) ties operational testing to specific \n     national research objectives and authorizes the Secretary to \n     provide funding to Federal agencies as well as to non-Federal \n     entities, including HBCU's and other Minority Institutions of \n     Higher Education. The Secretary is to provide highest \n     priority to projects that (A) contribute to the goals of the \n     National Program Plan under Sec. 6055, (B) will minimize the \n     relative percentage and total amount of Federal \n     contributions, (C) conform to the National Architecture and \n     ITS standards and protocols, (D) emphasize collision \n     avoidance products, (E) demonstrate innovative public-private \n     partnering arrangements, and (F) validate the effectiveness \n     of ITS in enhancing the safety and efficiency of surface \n     transportation in both rural and metropolitan areas.\n     Section 6057. Applications of Technology\n       Subsection 6057(a) discontinues the designated IVHS \n     Corridors Program and replaces it with one-time, limited-term \n     ITI Deployment Incentives to promote deployment of \n     integrated, multi-modal transportation systems throughout the \n     Nation. Currently designated Priority Corridors are eligible \n     for the Deployment Incentives Program. In metropolitan areas, \n     the funding provided under this section would be used \n     primarily to fund activities designed to integrate existing \n     intelligent transportation infrastructure elements or those \n     installed with other sources of funds, including Federal-aid \n     funds. For commercial vehicle projects and projects outside \n     metropolitan areas, funding provided under this section could \n     be used to also install, as well as integrate, intelligent \n     transportation infrastructure elements.\n       Subsection 6057(b) establishes priorities for funding \n     projects under this section. At least 25 percent of the funds \n     made available are to be allocated for implementation of \n     border crossing applications and commercial vehicle \n     information systems; and at least 10% is to be made available \n     for ITI deployment outside metropolitan areas. Projects are \n     to accelerate deployment and commercialization of ITS, \n     realize the benefits of regionally integrated, intermodal \n     applications, including commercial vehicle operations and \n     electronic border crossing applications, and demonstrate \n     innovative approaches to overcoming nontechnical constraints.\n       Subsection 6057(c) mandates that projects designated for \n     funding under this section shall (1) contribute to national \n     goals outlined in the ITS National Program Plan, (2) \n     demonstrate through written agreements a commitment to \n     cooperation among public agencies, multiple jurisdictions and \n     the private sector, (3) demonstrate commitment to a \n     comprehensive plan of fully integrated ITS deployment in \n     accordance with the national ITS architecture and established \n     ITS standards and protocols, (4) be part of approved\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\n     State and metropolitan plans for transportation and air \n     quality implementation, (5) catalyze private investment and \n     minimize Federal contributions under this section, (6) \n     include a sound financial plan for continued long-term \n     operations and maintenance, without continued reliance on \n     Federal ITS funds, and (7) demonstrate the capability or \n     planned acquisition of capability to effectively operate and \n     maintain the systems implemented.\n       Subsection 6057(d) establishes annual award funding \n     limitations as follows: $15 million per metropolitan area; $2 \n     million per rural project; $5 million per CVISN project; and \n     no more than $35 million within any State.\n     Section 6058. Funding\n       The requirement for reports in section 6058 of the ITS Act \n     of 1991 has been fulfilled and is not extended.\n       Section 6058 authorizes funding and provides under contract \n     authority for fiscal years 1998 through 2003:\n       (1) subsection 6058(a), for the ITI Deployment Incentives \n     Program, $100 million per year from the Highway Trust Fund \n     for fiscal years 1998-2003;\n       (2) subsection 6058(b) for ITS Research and Program Support \n     Activities - $96 million per year from the Highway Trust Fund \n     for fiscal years 1998-2000, $130 million per year thereafter.\n       Of the funds made available for Research and Program \n     Support Activities, the Secretary should use $25 million for \n     purposes of 6055(b) (demonstration and evaluation of \n     intelligent vehicle systems).\n       These replace the requirements of the ITS Act of 1991 under \n     which 5 percent of the funds were to be available only for \n     high-risk innovative tests with significant potential to \n     accomplished long-term goals, which did not attract \n     substantial non-Federal commitments.\n       Subsection 6058(c) continues the limitation in the ITS Act \n     of 1991 that the Federal share on account of activities \n     carried out under this part shall not exceed 80 percent of \n     the cost of the activities, except that the Secretary may \n     waive this limit for innovative activities under subsection \n     6058(b). In addition, the Federal share payable under the new \n     Deployment Incentives Program in subsection 6058(a) is \n     limited to 50 percent of the project cost, although the \n     matching funds can include funds from other Federal sources. \n     Subsection 6058(c) also provides that, for long range \n     research activities with private entities concerning the \n     demonstration of integrated intelligent vehicle systems under \n     subsection 6055(b) of this part, the Federal share is limited \n     to 50 percent of project costs.\n       Subsection 6058(d) extends an expiring provision of the ITS \n     Act of 1991 confirming applicability of title 23 to funds \n     authorized under this part, and providing that the funds \n     authorized under this part shall remain available for \n     obligation for a period of 3 years after the last day of the \n     fiscal year for which such funds were authorized.\n\n\n                           TITLE VII--REVENUE\n\n     Sec. 7001. Short Title: Amendment of 1986 Code\n       This section designates this title as the Surface \n     Transportation Revenue Act of 1997 and provides that \n     references in this title to a section or other provision are \n     references to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (title 26, \n     United States Code).\n     Sec. 7002. Extension of Highway Related Use Taxes, \n         Exemptions, and Trust Fund\n       This section provides a 6-year extension, through September \n     30, 2005, of Highway Trust Fund fuel taxes at their current \n     rates: 18.3 cents per gallon for gasoline and special fuel \n     and 24.3 cents per gallon for diesel fuel. Truck related \n     taxes--heavy vehicle use tax, truck tire tax, and retail tax \n     on heavy trucks and trailers are also extended at their \n     current rates.\n       All existing refunds and exemption provisions are extended \n     through September 30, 2005. These include reduced rates for \n     intercity bus fuel, gasohol, and other alcohol fuels. The \n     exemption provision for gasohol and other alcohol fuels were \n     extended so that their expiration dates would conform with \n     all other fuel tax provisions. Note that most refund or \n     exemption provisions such as farm gasoline, off-road business \n     gasoline, nonhighway diesel fuel, transit use, and State and \n     local government use have no expiration dates and do not \n     require extension.\n       Authority for the transfer from the general fund to the \n     Highway Trust Fund of amounts equivalent to the Highway Trust \n     Fund share of the highway fuel and truck taxes is extended \n     through September 30, 2005. Amounts equivalent to tax \n     liabilities incurred before October 1, 2005, may be \n     transferred into the Trust Fund through June 30, 2006.\n       Authorization to expend funds from the Highway Trust Fund \n     for to meet obligations incurred authorized in National \n     Economic Crossroads Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997 or \n     earlier highway authorization acts is extended through \n     September 30, 2003.\n       The provision for charging the Highway Trust Fund for its \n     share of fuel tax refunds and credits and for all truck tax \n     refunds and credits is extended through June 30, 2006.\n       Transfers of receipts from motorboat fuel taxes to the \n     Aquatic Resources Trust Fund and the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund are extended through September 30, 2003.\n       Subsection (c) of this section amends the Internal Revenue \n     Code to eliminate section 9511, which establishes the \n     National Recreational Trails Trust Fund. While section 9511 \n     was enacted in 1991, no funds have ever been credited to this \n     fund. Therefore this legislation has been stricken as \n     unnecessary.\n       Subsection (d) addresses the use of motorboat fuel taxes \n     transferred from the Highway Trust Fund to the Boat Safety \n     Account (BSA) in the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which \n     provides funds for the State Recreational Boating Safety \n     grant program administered by the Coast Guard. The statutory \n     authority for making expenditures from the BSA, which expires \n     March 31, 1998, is extended to October 1, 2004.\n       For fiscal year 1998, the amount that would be transferred \n     into the BSA is $35,000,000. This assumes that $20,000,000 \n     will be furnished under the Clean Vessel Act for Fiscal Year \n     1998, for a total of $55,000,000. Thereafter, the amount of \n     motorboat fuel taxes transferred to the BSA would be \n     $55,000,000, annually.\n       Under the legislation, the entire amount transferred would \n     be available for expenditure to carry out the State \n     Recreational Boating Safety grant program. Permanent budget \n     authority is provided, so that the amounts transferred each \n     year are available without further appropriation.\n       Currently, one-half of the amount transferred each year to \n     the Boat Safety Account is available for expenditures of the \n     Coast Guard for recreational boating safety services. The \n     conforming amendment would strike this distribution formula.\n       Subsection (e) makes a necessary technical amendment of \n     section 4041(a)(1)(D)(i) to preserve the existing 1999 \n     expiration date for motorboat diesel fuel taxes. Without this \n     amendment, the changes made to extend highway taxes in \n     section 4081 of the Code would, due to a cross-reference, \n     inadvertently extend the motorboat diesel fuel tax as well.\n     Sec. 7003. Commuter Benefit\n       26 U.S.C. section 132(f) exempts up to $165 per month for \n     parking and up to $65 per month for transit benefits or \n     commercial vanpool services from Federal and most State \n     income and payroll taxes, provided the employer offers only \n     these benefits and nothing else, such as taxable cash salary, \n     in lieu of the benefit. To qualify for the exemption, parking \n     must be provided by the employer, either accepted or not by \n     the employee, with no other options, including any taxable \n     options. This amendment would limit the choice to parking or \n     other taxable compensation.\n     Sec. 7004. Mass Transit Account\n       Section 7004 would amend 26 U.S.C. section 9503(e) to \n     extend the Mass Transit Account through September 30, 2003, \n     and to permit funding of all eligible purposes under the \n     Federal Transit assistance program, not just capital \n     projects, to receive funding from the Mass Transit Account. \n     In addition, it would change the test of Mass Transit Account \n     liquidity to the same test as is applied to the Highway \n     Account. At present the Mass Transit Account must meet a more \n     stringent test.\n     Sec. 7005. Motor Vehicle Safety and Cost Savings Programs\n       This section provides for Highway Trust Fund expenditures \n     for qualified projects and for motor vehicle safety and cost \n     savings programs.\n     Sec. 7006. General Fund Transfers for Transportation-Related \n         Programs in Fiscal Years 1998-2003\n       This section sets forth directions to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to transfer amounts from the Highway Trust Fund \n     (other than the Mass Transit Account) to the general fund as \n     reimbursement for annual appropriations made for selected \n     transportation-related programs. The amount transfered each \n     year would equal the amount that Congress appropriates for \n     the listed accounts (transportation-related portion only). \n     The programs involved are: Department of Energy, ``Energy \n     Conservation'' account; Department of the Interior, U.S. Park \n     Service, ``Construction'' account; Department of the \n     Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, ``Construction'' account; \n     Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, \n     ``Reconstruction and Construction'' account, Department of \n     Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, ``National Forest System'' \n     account; Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n     ``Community Development Block Grant''; Environmental \n     Protection Agency, ``Environmental Programs and Management'' \n     account; Appalachian Regional Commission, ``Appalachian \n     Regional Commission'' account; and costs associated with the \n     procurement of Federal Alternative Fuels Acquisition.\n       The consolidated annual amounts sought by the President's \n     FY 1998 Budget Request for transportation-related portions of \n     these programs are: FY98--$646 million; FY99--$583 million; \n     FY00--$583 million; FY01--$467 million; FY02--$467 million; \n     FY03--$467 million.\n\n\n                  TITLE VIII--RAIL PASSENGER PROGRAMS\n\n     Sec. 8001. Authorization of Appropriations\n       This section revises section 24104 of the title 49, United \n     States Code, which authorizes appropriations to support the \n     various activities undertaken by Amtrak. Subsection (a) \n     authorizes appropriations for Amtrak's operating grants for \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2003 which will be derived from the \n     Highway Trust Fund (other than from the Mass Transit \n     Account). These authorizations reflect decreasing Federal \n     financial support for Amtrak's operating expenses. After \n     2001, the operating grant would no longer be available to \n     offset Amtrak's operating losses\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\n     other than for certain payments into the railroad retirement \n     and railroad unemployment trust fund.\n       Subsection (b) authorizes appropriations for Amtrak's \n     capital programs (including the Northeast Corridor \n     Improvement Project) in the amount of $423,450,000 for each \n     of the fiscal years 1998 through 2003. Capital grant funds \n     would also be derived from the Highway Trust Fund (other than \n     the Mass Transit Account). Sufficient capital funding is a \n     key component of Amtrak's program to eliminate its dependence \n     on Federal operating subsidies after fiscal year 2001.\n       Subsection (c) contains a new authorization for \n     supplemental capital funding which represents additional \n     capital funding that would be made available to Amtrak \n     through the Secretary if the Secretary determines that Amtrak \n     is managing the corporation so as to operate within available \n     resources, including revenues, state, local and private \n     sector contributions, and Federal operating subsidies (in the \n     years for which a Federal operating subsidy is authorized). \n     The purpose of this program is to provide a strong incentive \n     for Amtrak to take the necessary actions to reduce spending, \n     increase revenues and operate in the most efficient and \n     effective manner. Amtrak could use the supplemental capital \n     funding to continue to make improvements in the capital \n     plant. The availability of the supplemental capital funding \n     would be tied to two specific tests. For the first year of \n     the program, fiscal year 1999, the funding would become \n     available only if the Secretary determined that Amtrak has \n     taken specific and measurable actions to reduce expenses and \n     increase revenues consistent with a plan to achieve the \n     operating subsidy reductions contemplated by the \n     authorizations for operating expenses included in subsection \n     (a) above. For fiscal years 2000-2003, the test would involve \n     a determination, based upon a report from Amtrak's \n     independent auditor, that during the penultimate fiscal year, \n     Amtrak's revenues plus the amount of operating assistance \n     authorized for that year equals or exceeds Amtrak's operating \n     expenses for that year. Therefore, the test of whether Amtrak \n     receives the funds in fiscal year 2000 would be based upon \n     its performance in fiscal year 1998. This two year lag is \n     made necessary because of the cycle of the appropriations \n     process. Fiscal year 1998 would be the last year for which \n     complete financial records are available during the \n     consideration of the fiscal year 2000 budget request by the \n     President and the Congress.\n       Subsection (d) provides an avenue for determining the \n     appropriate expenditures that are included within the \n     definition of capital investment. With the exception of the \n     inclusion of specific statutory authority to use capital \n     funds to cover debt service associated with long-term capital \n     investments, the terms ``operating expenses'' and ``capital \n     investments'' are to be defined and applied by Amtrak and the \n     Secretary in a manner consistent with the traditional \n     practices of the railroad industry as provided for in the \n     findings of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\n       Subsection (e) provides contract authority for the Amtrak \n     operating, railroad retirement/unemployment payments, capital \n     investment, and supplemental capital investment accounts by \n     specifically providing that the approval by the Secretary of \n     a grant or contract with funds made available for Amtrak is \n     to be deemed a contractual obligation of the United States.\n       Subsection (f) provides that appropriated amounts remain \n     available until expended.\n       Subsection (g) states that funds provided to Amtrak for \n     intercity rail passenger service may not be used to fund \n     operating losses for rail freight services or commuter rail \n     services.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Chafee, to introduce the Clinton administration's \nlegislation to re-authorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991, or ISTEA.\n  I applaud the administration's proposal as a sincere effort to \nreauthorize ISTEA under the principles of intermodalism, environmental \nprotection, sound community planning, and safety, that have made this \ninnovative transportation act work so well these past 6 years. I do not \nagree with all of the details of administration plan--the formulas used \nto distribute funds to each State based on the Federal fuel taxes \ncollected in that State are an unfortunate departure from the need-\nbased formulas in all other Federal programs. The President's proposal, \nhowever, preserves the basic ISTEA framework and represents a good \nstarting point as we begin considering the reauthorization of ISTEA.\n  I also intend to join with a bipartisan group of colleagues later \nthis month to introduce our own proposal to re-authorize ISTEA. This \nproposal would reauthorize the key provisions of ISTEA--which was \ncrafted to promote intermodal, economically efficient, and \nenvironmentally sound incentives in Federal transportation policy--\nthrough more fully needs-based formulas.\n  ISTEA has worked, and its reauthorization will be more important for \nthe economy than any other transportation bill since the Federal-Aid \nHighway Act of 1956. Our goal should be now to make a good law better.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 469. A bill to designate a portion of the Sudbury, Assabet, and \nConcord Rivers as a component of the National Wild and Scenic River \nSystem; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        SUDBURY, ASSABET, AND CONCORD WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in introducing the \nSudbury, Assabet and Concord [SuAsCo] Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. \nCongressman Marty Meehan will introduce the companion bill today in the \nHouse. His bill will be cosponsored by the entire Massachusetts \ndelegation as well as colleagues from New Hampshire and Connecticut.\n  The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers area is rich in history and \nliterary significance. It has been the location of many historical \nevents, most notably the Battle of Concord in the Revolutionary War, \nthat gave our great Nation its independence. The Concord River flows \nunder the North Bridge in Concord, MA where, on April 18, 1775, \ncolonial farmers fired the legendary ``shot heard around the world'' \nwhich signaled the start of the Revolutionary War.\n  In later years, this scenic area was also home to many of our \nliterary heroes including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and \nLouisa May Alcott; their writing often focused on these bucolic rivers. \nThoreau spent most of his life in Concord, MA where he passed his days \nimmersed in his writing and enjoying the natural surroundings. He spoke \nof the Concord River when he wrote ``the wild river valley and the \nwoods were bathed in so pure and bright a light as would have waked the \ndead, if they had been slumbering in their graves, as some suppose. \nThere needs no strong proof of immortality.'' This area was held close \nto many an author's heart. It was a place of relaxation and inspiration \nfor many.\n  The SuAsCo bill would amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to include \na 29-mile segment of the Assabet, Concord, and Sudbury Rivers. Based on \na report authorized by Congress in 1990 and issued by the National Park \nService in 1995, these river segments were determined worthy of \ninclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Program. In its report, the \nSuAsCo Wild and Scenic Study Committee showed that this area has not \nonly the necessary scenic, recreational and ecological value, but also \nthe historical and literary value to merit the wild and scenic river \ndesignation. All eight communities in the area traversed by these river \nsegments are supporting this important legislation.\n  Our legislation is of minimal cost to the Federal Government, but by \nusing limited Federal resources we can leverage significant local and \nState effort. Provisions in the bill limit the Federal Government's \ncontribution to just $100,000 annually, with no more than a 50 percent \nshare of any given activity. This is a concept that merits the support \nof Congress. Should our bill become law, the SuAsCo River Stewardship \nCouncil, in cooperation with Federal, State, and local governments \nwould manage the land.\n  We now have the opportunity to protect the precious 29-mile section \nof the Assabet, Sudbury, and Concord Rivers. This area is not only rich \nin ecological value but also in historical and literary value. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill and through it to preserve this wild \nriver valley for the enjoyment and instruction of all who live and work \nthere, for visitors from throughout the Nation and, perhaps most \nimportantly, for generations yet to come.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Kerry \ntoday in sponsoring legislation to designate a 29-mile segment of the \nSudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts as a component of \nthe National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This proposal has the \nbipartisan support of the full Massachusetts congressional delegation--\nCongressmen Martin T. Meehan, John F. Tierney, Edward J. Markey, J. \nJoseph Moakley, Joseph P. Kennedy II, William D. Delahunt, Richard E. \nNeal, James P. McGovern, Barney Frank, and John\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\nW. Olver--as well as Representatives Christopher Shays and Nancy L. \nJohnson of Connecticut and Charles F. Bass and John E. Sununu of New \nHampshire, who are introducing an identical bill in the House of \nRepresentatives today.\n  The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers have witnessed many \nimportant events in the Nation's history. Stone's Bridge and Four \nArched Bridge over the Sudbury River date from pre-Revolutionary War \ndays. On Old North Bridge over the Concord River, the ``shot heard \n'round the world'' was fired on April 19, 1775, to begin the \nRevolutionary War. At Lexington and Concord, the colonists began their \narmed resistance against British rule, and the first American \nRevolutionary War soldiers fell in battle.\n  In the nineteenth century, the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers \nearned their lasting fame in the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson, \nNathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau, all of whom lived in this \narea and spent a great deal of time on the rivers. Emerson cherished \nthe Concord River as a place to leave ``the world of villages and \npersonalities behind, and pass into a delicate realm of sunset and \nmoonlight.''\n  Hawthorne wrote ``The Scarlet Letter'' and ``Mosses from an Old \nManse'' in an upstairs study overlooking the Concord River. He also \nenjoyed boating on the Assabet River, of which he said that ``a more \nlovely stream than this, for a mile above its junction with the \nConcord, has never flowed on Earth.''\n  Thoreau delighted in long, solitary walks along the banks of the \nrivers amidst the ``straggling pines, shrub oaks, grape vines, ivy, \nbats, fireflies, and alders,'' contemplating humanity's relationship to \nnature. His journals describing his detailed observations of the flora \nand fauna in the area have inspired poets and naturalists to the \npresent day, and helped to give birth to the modern environmental \nmovement. By protecting the rivers, a future Thoreau, Emerson, or \nHawthorne may one day walk along their shores and gain new inspiration \nfrom these priceless natural resources.\n  In 1990, Congress authorized the National Park Service to issue a \nreport to determine whether the three rivers are eligible for \ndesignation as wild and scenic rivers. Under the National Park \nService's guidelines, a river is considered eligible for the \ndesignation if it possesses at least one ``outstanding remarkable \nresource value.'' In fact, the three rivers were found to possess five \noutstanding resource values--scenic, recreational, ecological, \nhistorical, and literary. The report also concluded that the rivers are \nsuitable for designation based upon the existing local protection of \ntheir resources and the strong local support for their preservation.\n  Our bill will protect a 29-mile segment of the Sudbury, Assabet, and \nConcord Rivers that runs through or along the borders of eight \nMassachusetts towns--Framingham, Sudbury, Wayland, Concord, Lincoln, \nBedford, Carlisle, and Billerica. A River Stewardship Council will be \nestablished to coordinate the effort of all levels of government to \nstrengthen protections for the river and address future threats to the \nenvironment. The legislation also requires at least a one-to-one non-\nFederal match for any Federal expenditures, and contains provisions \nwhich preclude Federal takings of private lands. It is designed not to \nresult in any additional Federal regulatory burden to private property \nowners along the protected river segments.\n  Thoreau wrote in 1847 that rivers ``are the constant lure, when they \nflow by our doors, to distant enterprise and adventure* * * . They are \nthe natural highways of all nations, not only levelling the ground and \nremoving obstacles from the path of the traveller, but conducting him \nthrough the most interesting scenery.'' Standing on the banks of the \nSudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers, as Thoreau often did, citizens \ntoday gain a greater sense of the ebb and flow of the Nation's history \nand enjoy the benefit of some of the most beautiful scenery in all of \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, so that \nthese three proud rivers will be protected for the enjoyment and \ncontemplation of future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 470. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make a \ntechnical correction relating to the depreciation on property used \nwithin an Indian reservation; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    TECHNICAL CORRECTION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of Senator Moynihan \nand myself to introduce a bill that would correct a technical error \noriginally contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. \nSpecifically, the bill would correct the definition of the term \n``Indian reservation'' under section 168(j)(6) of the Internal Revenue \nCode. This definition of the term ``Indian reservation'' applies for \npurposes of determining the geographic areas within which businesses \nare eligible for special accelerated depreciation (sec. 168(j)) and the \nso-called Indian employment tax credit (sec. 45A) enacted in 1993. As I \nexplain in further detail below, the bill corrects the definition of \n``Indian reservation'' for purposes of these special tax incentives so \nthat, as Congress originally intended, the incentives are available \nonly to businesses that operate on Indian reservations and similar \nlands that continue to be held in trust for Indian tribes and their \nmembers. It is my intent to incorporate the provisions of this bill \ninto a larger bill, which I plan to introduce later this session, \ncontaining technical corrections to other recently enacted tax \nlegislation.\n  Section 168(j)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the term \n``Indian reservation'' means a reservation as defined in either (a) \nsection 3(d) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452(d)), \nor (b) section 4(10) of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. \n1903(10)). The cross-reference to section 3(d) of the Indian Financing \nAct of 1974 includes not only officially designated Indian reservations \nand public domain Indian allotments, but also all ``former Indian \nreservations in Oklahoma'' and all land held by incorporated Native \ngroups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the \nprovisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Thus, contrary \nto Congress' intent in enacting the special tax incentives for Indian \nlands in 1993, the reference to ``former Indian reservations in \nOklahoma'' in the Indian Financing Act of 1974 results in most of the \nState of Oklahoma being eligible for the special tax incentives, even \nthough parts of such ``former Indian reservations'' no longer have a \nsignificant nexus to any Indian tribe. For instance, it is my \nunderstanding that the entire city of Tulsa may be located within a \n``former Indian reservation,'' such that any business operating in \nTulsa qualifies for accelerated depreciation under present-law section \n168(j). Providing such a tax benefit to commercial activities with no \nnexus to a tribal community would frustrate Congress' intent to target \nspecial tax incentives to official reservations and similar lands that \ncontinue to be held in trust for Indians. Businesses located on \nofficial reservations and similar lands held in trust for Indians were \nprovided special business tax incentives in order to counter the \ndisadvantages historically associated with conducting commercial \noperations in such areas, which were expressly excluded from \neligibility as empowerment zones or enterprise communities under the \n1993 act legislation (see Internal Revenue Code sec. 1393(a)(4)).\n  The bill I am introducing today would modify the definition of \n``Indian reservation'' under section 168(j)(6) of the Internal Revenue \nCode by deleting the reference to section 3(d) of the Indian Financing \nAct of 1974. Consequently, the term ``Indian reservation'' would be \ndefined under section 168(j)(6) solely by reference to section 4(10) of \nthe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, which provides that the term \n``reservation'' means ``Indian country as defined in section 1151 of \nTitle 18 and any lands, not covered under [section 1151], title to \nwhich is either held by the United States in trust for the benefit of \nany Indian tribe or individual or held by an Indian tribe or individual \nsubject to a restriction by the United States against alienation'' (25 \nU.S.C. 1903(10)). Section 1151 of Title 18, in turn, defines the term \n``Indian country'' as meaning ``(a) all land within the limits of any \nIndian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\nStates Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, \nincluding rights-of-way running through the reservation, (b) all \ndependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States \nwhether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, \nand whether within or without the limits of a state, and (c) all Indian \nallotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, \nincluding rights-of-way running through the same'' (18 U.S.C. 1151).\n\n  Accordingly, amending section 168(j)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code \nto define the term ``Indian reservation'' solely by reference to the \nIndian Child Welfare Act of 1978 would carry out Congress' original \nintent in enacting the special Indian tax incentives in 1993 by \neliminating from eligibility those areas in Oklahoma which formerly \nwere reservations but no longer satisfy the definition of a \n``reservation'' under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. It is my \nunderstanding that, even after amending section 168(j)(6) in this \nmanner, numerous areas within Oklahoma will remain eligible for the \nspecial tax incentives because, even though such areas are not \nofficially designated reservations, such areas nonetheless qualify as \n``Indian country'' under section 1151 of Title 18. Similarly, it is my \nunderstanding that lands held by Native groups under the provisions of \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act also would qualify as ``Indian \ncountry\" under section 1151 of Title 18. Thus, if section 168(j)(6) \nwere amended to define ``Indian reservation'' solely by reference to \nthe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, lands held under the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act would continue to be eligible for the \nspecial Indian tax incentives. In this regard, it is my intent that, if \nit is brought to the attention of the tax-writing committees that there \nare any Indian lands that technically do not fall within the definition \nof ``Indian reservation'' under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 \nbut which could be made eligible for the special Indian tax incentives \nconsistent with Congress' intent in 1993, then consideration will be \ngiven to further modifying the bill I am introducing today when it is \nincorporated into a larger technical corrections bill.\n  The technical correction made by the bill would be effective as if it \nhad been included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \n(that is, the technical correction would apply to property placed in \nservice and wages paid on or after January 1, 1994). As a general \nmatter, I oppose retroactive changes to the Internal Revenue Code. \nHowever, technical corrections to fix drafting errors in previously \nenacted tax legislation traditionally refer back to the original \neffective date to prevent taxpayers from receiving an unintended \nwindfall. This bill corrects such a drafting error.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing \nlegislation with the chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator \nRoth, to correct an unintended item contained in the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993. I want to thank the chairman for his \nleadership on this issue and associate myself with his statement.\n  Mr. President, it recently came to our attention that Internal \nRevenue Code section 168(j), a provision intended to help attract \nprivate industry investment to Indian reservations and similar lands \nthat continue to be held in trust for Indian tribes and their members \nis benefitting private investment on ``former Indian reservations'' \nhaving no current connection to any Indian tribe. As a result, we are \nintroducing legislation today that would correct the definition of \n``Indian reservation,'' under Internal Revenue Code section 168(j)(6), \nso that these tax incentives are available only for businesses \noperating on Indian reservations and similar lands.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note, as Chairman Roth did, that we \nwish to take into consideration any Indian lands that may technically \nnot fall within the definition of ``Indian reservation,'' under the \nIndian Child Welfare Act of 1978, but which should be made eligible for \nthese special investment incentives. Such situations should be brought \nto the attention of the tax-writing committees, and we will then \nconsider further modifications as the bill moves through the \nlegislative process.\n\n

Res. 65\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       Whereas spending on federal election campaigns has \n     increased to an estimated $2.65 billion in the most recent \n     election cycle, a three-fold increase over campaign spending \n     just 20 years ago, even after adjusting for inflation;\n       Whereas in the 1995-1996 election cycle, the Democratic \n     party committees raised $332 million, a 73% increase over the \n     $192 million raised four years earlier and the Republican \n     party committees raised $549 million, a 74% increase over the \n     $316 million they raised four years earlier;\n       (3) overall campaign spending for congressional races has \n     risen from $99 million in 1976 to $626 million in 1996, a \n     more than six-fold increase;\n       (4) since 1992, when political parties were first required \n     to report soft money contributions to the Federal Election \n     Commission, these contributions, which are raised outside \n     federal election law, have tripled, from $86 million in 1992 \n     to over $263 million in the last election cycle;\n       (5) there has been a proliferation of negative ``issue'' \n     ads paid for by political parties and interest groups to \n     influence federal elections, further increasing the cost of \n     campaigns;\n       (6) as political campaigns have become longer, costlier and \n     more negative, voter apathy has increased and voter \n     participation in presidential elections has declined from 60% \n     in 1948-1968, to 53% from 1972-92, to all-time low of 49% in \n     1996;\n       (7) these trends will continue if Congress fails to enact \n     comprehensive campaign finance reform;\n       (8) the more than 6,700 pages of hearing records, 49 days \n     of testimony before 8 different congressional committees, 15 \n     committee reports from 6 different committees and 113 Senate \n     floor votes, constitute a sufficient Senate record on \n     campaign finance reform; and\n       (9) campaign finance reform has been filibustered in the \n     Senate 17 times in the last ten years.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should proceed to the consideration of \n     comprehensive campaign finance reform that reduces spending \n     on political campaigns and curtails the influence of special \n     interest money in federal elections by no later than May 31, \n     1997 and adopt as a goal the final enactment of such \n     legislation by no later than July 4, 1997.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the 1996 election cycle, unprecedented \namounts of money freely flowed into and out of the campaign coffers of \ncandidates for Federal public office. The time required to raise funds \nis excessive, and increasingly more expensive election campaigns have \nfostered the view that spending is out of control.\n  Campaign finance reform is long overdue. The fact that we are \nembarking upon an intensive scrutiny of past campaign practices should \nnot impede our effort to move swiftly and concurrently to correct \ndeficiencies in the present system.\n  We must do more than just point out the errors of the past. We must \nmake changes for the future.\n  Today, Senator Byron Dorgan and I submitted a resolution stating that \nit is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should proceed to \nconsideration, by no later than May 31, 1997, of comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform that reduces spending on political campaigns and \ncurtails the influence of special interest money in Federal elections, \nand that the Senate should adopt as a goal the final enactment of such \nlegislation by no later than July 4, 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2481-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 committee on labor and human resources\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Senator Mitchell spoke \nabout the peace process in Northern Ireland and his own efforts to \nfacilitate reconciliation in that troubled land.\n  I commend Senator Mitchell's remarks to all Senators, and I ask that \nthe text be printed in the Record.\n  The text follows:\n\n Excerpts from remarks by Senator George J. Mitchell, American-Ireland \n              Fund Dinner, Washington, DC, March 13, 1997\n\n       I'm grateful for this award. The American-Ireland Fund is \n     an important force for good in Ireland. I commend you for \n     your efforts and I encourage you to continue them.\n       As you know, I've spent most of the past two years in \n     Northern Ireland. On my trips back to the U.S., I've been \n     asked two questions, over and over again, by Americans who \n     care about Ireland: Why are you doing this? And, What can I \n     do to help?\n       Tonight, I'll try to answer both of those questions.\n       Why am I doing this?\n       I've asked myself that question many times. To answer it, I \n     must go back nearly 20 years, before I'd ever been to \n     Ireland, before I'd ever thought seriously about Northern \n     Ireland.\n       Before I entered the United States Senate I had the \n     privilege of serving as a Federal Judge. In that position I \n     had great power. The power I most enjoyed exercising was when \n     I presided over what are called naturalization ceremonies. \n     They're citizenship ceremonies. A group of people who'd come \n     from every part of the world, who'd gone through all the \n     required procedures, gathered before me in a federal \n     courtroom. There I administered to them the oath of \n     allegiance to the United States and, by the power vested in \n     me under our constitution and laws I made them Americans.\n       It was always emotional for me, because my mother was an \n     immigrant from Lebanon, my father the orphan son of \n     immigrants from Ireland. They had no education and they \n     worked hard all their lives at difficult and low-paying jobs. \n     But because of their efforts, and, more importantly, because \n     of the openness of American society, I, their son, was able \n     to become the majority leader of the United States Senate.\n       After every naturalization ceremony, I spoke personally \n     with each new American, individually or in family groups. I \n     asked them where they came from, how they came, why they \n     came. Their stories were as different as their countries of \n     origin. But they were all inspiring, and through them ran a \n     common theme, best expressed by a young Asian. When I asked \n     why he had come, he replied, in slow and halting English, ``I \n     came because here in America everybody has a chance''.\n       A young man who'd been an American for just a few minutes \n     summed up the meaning of our country in a single sentence. \n     Here, everybody has a chance.\n       I was one of those who had a chance, and I thank God for my \n     good fortune. Now, by an accident of fate, in a way that I \n     did not seek or expect, I have been given the opportunity to \n     help others to have a chance. That they are in Ireland, the \n     land of my father's heritage, is just a fortuitous \n     coincidence. That I am able to help, even if in just a small \n     way, is what matters.\n       No one can really have a chance in a society dominated by \n     fear and violence. And so I, who have been helped by so many, \n     now must do what I can to help others to try to end the \n     violence, to banish the fear, to hasten the day when all the \n     people of Northern Ireland can lead lives of peace, \n     reconciliation and opportunity.\n       Let me say, as clearly and as emphatically as I can: There \n     will be peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. I don't \n     know exactly when it will come. But I am convinced that it is \n     inevitable, for one over-riding reason: It is the will of the \n     overwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland.\n       They remain divided along sectarian lines, and they \n     mistrust each other. But they share a fervent desire not to \n     return to the violence which for so long has filled their \n     lives with fear and anxiety.\n       It will take a very long time for the mistrust to end. But \n     it need not take a long time for the violence to end. Once it \n     does, once people can live free of fear, then gradually the \n     walls of division will come down. Walls that exist on the \n     ground, and in people's minds, will come down, brick by \n     brick, person by person, slowly but inevitably.\n       Over the past two years I've come to know the people of \n     Northern Ireland. They're energetic, Intelligent and \n     productive. I admire and like them. They deserve better than \n     the troubles they have. But there is only one way to achieve \n     that better life.\n       There is no alternative to democratic, meaningful, \n     inclusive dialogue. For that to come about, there must be an \n     end to violence and to intransigence. They are the twin \n     demons of Northern Ireland--violence and intransigence. They \n     feed off each other in a deadly ritual in which most of the \n     victims are innocent.\n       There are those who don't want anything to change, ever. \n     They want to recreate a past that can never be recreated. But \n     their way will only guarantee never-ending conflict. It will \n     insure that the next half century is as full of death and \n     fear as was the past half century.\n       The people of Northern Ireland must make it clear to their \n     leaders that they oppose intransigence, that they want \n     meaningful negotiation. Not capitulation; not the surrender \n     of conviction. But good-faith negotiation that places the \n     interest of the people, the interest of peace, above personal \n     or political considerations. Good faith negotiation can \n     produce an agreed settlement that will command the support of \n     the majority in Northern Ireland, including the majority in \n     each\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n\n     community. I know in my heart that it can be done.\n       With an end to intransigence must come a total and final \n     repudiation of violence. There is no justification for \n     violence, or the threat of violence. To those of you who ask; \n     what can I do? Here is my answer: You, the leaders of the \n     Irish-American community, must say that you condemn violence, \n     that you demand its end, that you will not support those who \n     engage in or support or condone violence. You must say it \n     publicly, you must say it loudly, you must say it forcefully. \n     And you must say it over and over again.\n       Violence is wrong. It is counter productive. It deepens \n     divisions. It increases hatred. It hurts innocent people. It \n     makes peace and reconciliation more difficult to attain. It \n     must end.\n       Let me be clear on one more point. They may be twin demons \n     but there is no moral equivalence between intransigence and \n     violence. They are both wrong. But as bad as intransigence \n     is, violence is worse. Intransigence takes away people's \n     hopes. Violence takes away their lives.\n       There exists an historic opportunity to end centuries of \n     conflict in Northern Ireland. If it is not seized now, it may \n     be years before it returns, and the failure could cost many \n     their lives.\n       Peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland is a worthy \n     cause. It deserves your attention and support. You can make a \n     difference. What you say is heard, what you do matters.\n       As you leave tonight, ask yourself this question: Wouldn't \n     it be a wonderful thing if, on St. Patrick's day next year, \n     rather than praying for peace and reconciliation in Northern \n     Ireland, we were celebrating its existence?\n       If you agree, then beginning tomorrow, do all you can to \n     make it happen. When you do, you will reap the greatest of \n     all rewards: You will have earned the title of peacemaker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2482-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO CHARLES H. WEBB, DEAN, INDIANA UNIVERSITY, SCHOOL OF MUSIC\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is with great privilege that I \nrise today to honor Charles H. Webb, an outstanding administrator and \nmusician who is retiring after 24 years of service as Dean of the \nIndiana University School of Music in Bloomington, IN.\n  Since his appointment in 1973, the Indian University School of Music \nhas enjoyed a world-wide reputation for excellence. The Indiana \nUniversity School of Music has been ranked No. 1 among schools of music \nin the country, and is the first and only school to bring an opera \nperformance to the stage of the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\n  Dean Webb's accomplishments have been hailed by Indiana University \nand the State of Indiana. He received the Thomas Hart Benton Medal from \nIndiana University in 1987 and the Governor's Award for the Arts in \n1989. He is also a two-time recipient of the Sagamore of the Wabash \naward, which is the highest award given by the State of Indiana for \nmeritorious service.\n  In addition to his responsibilities at Indiana University, Charles \nWebb has maintained an active performance schedule as a conductor, \npianist, and organist. Hailed as one of today's finest accompanists, he \nhas appeared with some of the world's best musicians. He currently \nserves as the organist for the First United Methodist Church in \nBloomington, IN.\n  Charles Webb's contributions to the art of music and his support for \neducation will continue long after his retirement, as his students \nenrich our lives with performances in orchestras, bands, opera, and \ntheater companies, and schools around the world. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in congratulating him for his years of tireless service, \nand in wishing him and family all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2483-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2483-S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nAgriculture Week and to pay tribute to the farmers of this nation whose \ndedication and diligence throughout our history have not only served to \nfeed our families, but have also provided a strong framework for the \neconomic prosperity of this country.\n  At the 1896 Democratic National Convention, it was William Jennings \nBryan who recognized the importance of farmers, not only as the \nindividuals who provide our sustenance, but as integral parts of the \nAmerican business community. He said, ``The farmer who goes forth in \nthe morning and toils all day, who begins in spring and toils all \nsummer, and who by the application of brain and muscle to the natural \nresources of the country creates wealth, is as much a business man as \nthe man who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of \ngrain.'' Today, when technology like weather trackers and cellular \nphones plays as important a role on the fields as it does on Wall \nStreet, Bryan's words ring true.\n  Bryan's other comment about farmers reminds us of a fact too often \nforgotten: ``The great cities,'' he said, ``rest upon our broad and \nfertile prairies.'' Indeed, the productivity of America's farmers not \nonly keeps Americans fed, it also enables the rest of our citizens to \nembark upon their daily tasks and diverse careers without concern that \nthe grocery's shelves will be empty.\n  Our farmers are so productive that they sustain the lives of more \nthan 250 million Americans every day and still have enough left over to \nmake agriculture our nation's leading export. In 1930, 1 American \nfarmer produced enough food to feed 24 people. Today, that same 1 \nfarmer is feeding 129 people. In fact, our farmers are so efficient \nthat Americans spend approximately 9 percent of their income on food, \ncompared with much higher figures in other countries, such as 17 \npercent in Japan and 27 percent in South Africa.\n  Yet the agricultural industry's contributions to our economy often go \nunrecognized. I grew up on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where my \nparents owned and operated a local restaurant. I spent much of my \nchildhood working in that restaurant, and one of my clearest memories \nis of Saturday evenings, when the farmers would come to town to stock \nup on supplies after a hard week's work. Every Saturday, my parents \nwould keep the restaurant open late, waiting for the farmers to arrive. \nOver the years, I gained a good understanding of the successes and \nhardships related to agriculture. In my house, we knew that if the \nfarmers were successful, our own business would prosper.\n  Since then, and the beginning of my career in public service, my \ncontact with farmers from across the State of Maryland has confirmed my \nstrong view that we cannot have real prosperity in this country if the \nfarm sector itself is not sharing in and laying the foundation for that \nprosperity.\n  Farmers bear a weighty burden. At the same time that their work feeds \nmillions and includes efforts to cleanse a polluted environment, that \nwork is also part of a very modern industry, which generates billions \nof dollars in revenue and employs more than 15 percent of our citizens. \nYet unlike many other billion-dollar businesses, almost 90 percent of \nAmerican farms are owned by individuals or families. Family farmers are \nthe backbone of America's agricultural industry and we must ensure that \nthey remain a vital part of American society.\n\n  All of this is relevant, I believe, to this year's National \nAgriculture Week theme, ``Growing Better Every Day--Together.'' Indeed, \nwe all must remain committed to working on behalf of our farmers at all \nlevels of government. Only through such cooperation can we look forward \nto a future in agriculture which is even more successful than our \npresent.\n  In the State of Maryland, our attempts at such cooperation are indeed \npaying off. Recently, I have worked closely with State and local \nofficials to support the efforts of farmers seeking to increase \nproduction by bolstering their existing export capabilities and \nidentifying ways in which additional Maryland agribusinesses can enter \nforeign markets. Maryland is the eastern seaboard's fastest growing \nexporter. And with a strong and growing trade infrastructure--which \nincludes the port of Baltimore, the World Trade Center, Baltimore-\nWashington International Airport and other aggressive export-enhancing \ninitiatives--we are hopeful that agriculture, as Maryland's number-one \nindustry, will be able to further tap into the State's increasing \nnumber of international opportunities. New forums across Maryland--\nwhich we have initiated together with the Maryland Department of \nAgriculture and our terrific Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Lewis \nRiley--are helping farmers take full advantage of our expanding \ncapabilities and possibilities in this regard.\n  We in Maryland take much pleasure in the achievements of our farmers. \nGenerating more than $1.6 billion a year, agriculture employs about 14 \npercent, or 350,000 of Maryland's workers.\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\nMaryland's agricultural industry truly helps the State live up to its \noften used nickname, ``America in miniature.'' From vegetable \nproduction and horticulture in southern Maryland, to the dairy \noperations and horse farms of central Maryland, to the beef cattle, \nforestry products and tree fruit in western Maryland, to poultry \ngrowing on the eastern shore, Maryland agriculture is indeed diverse \nand provides a showcase for the nation's agricultural capabilities.\n  Mr. President, we in Maryland and our nation are very proud of our \nagricultural industry. There is still much work to be done to ensure a \nbright future for America's farmers, but as this week's theme suggests, \nthrough a strong commitment at all levels of government--together--we \ncan help continue to build such a future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2483-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CAPITOL LIONS CLUB\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, ever since the pioneer \ndays, when entire communities would gather to help in the building of a \nbarn, Oregon has had a rich tradition of neighbor helping neighbor. \nThis heritage of neighbor helping neighbor is alive and well in \ncountless Oregon cities and towns.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding example of the \ndifference that can be made through volunteerism. The Capitol Lions \nClub, along with other Lions Clubs in the Salem-Keizer area, are \nhelping our young people learn about patriotism through a project where \nsmall flags are presented to first-grade students.\n  Capitol Club members buy lumber, cut it into small blocks, drill \nholes in the blocks, put Lions' decals on them, and place small 4- by \n6-inch flags in them. Lions members then go in to classrooms, to \npresent the flag to students, along with a presentation on the \nimportance of a flag, and a brochure on flag history and etiquette.\n  This year, 2,575 first-graders and their teachers in Oregon public \nand private schools will benefit from this outstanding program. As one \nSalem first grade teacher said, ``The children are very excited to have \ntheir own little flags to take home. They have their special little \nplaces for them, I know that it is still real important to them.''\n  Mr. President, I'm proud to be one of those Americans who feel \nsomething stir in my heart everytime I see our flag flying in the wind. \nWhat better way to ensure a bright future for our country than by \nensuring that the timeless value of patriotism is alive and well in our \nyoung people.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to salute the Capitol Lions Club of Salem, \nOR, for a job well done. I ask that an article from the Salem \nStatesman-Journal detailing this project be printed in the Record, in \nthe hopes that other organizations around the country might undertake a \nsimilar project.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   Lions Club Offers Lesson On Flags\n\n                            (By Hank Arends)\n\n       The members of area Lions clubs have a community project \n     that they believe is worth saluting.\n       For more years than anyone can remember, club members \n     annually have presented a program on the U.S. flag to first-\n     graders. They give the students their own flag on a wooden \n     base with the Lion's insignia and a brochure on flag history \n     and etiquette.\n       This year, 2,575 first-graders and their teachers in area \n     public and private schools received the 4-by-6-inch flags, \n     said Ralph Jackson, community coordinator. And the kids loved \n     them.\n       ``They were very excited to have their own little flags to \n     take home,'' said Katie Keisey, a first-grade teacher at Lake \n     Labish Elementary School.\n       ``They have their special little places at home for them. I \n     know that it is still real important to them.''\n       Those who do the distribution love it, too.\n       ``It makes me feel so good that those little kids were so \n     receptive,'' said Viola Laudon of the Keizer club.\n       ``They give us such comments as, `Oh, I love you. Thank you \n     for the flag. I'm taking good care of my flag.' '' Laudon \n     said of a large card she received from students at the Keizer \n     Christian School.\n       ``This is an idea that started in Arizona, and somehow we \n     heard about it and thought it might be OK,'' Jackson said.\n       The club members try to make their school visits in \n     February, around the birthdays of presidents Washington and \n     Lincoln.\n       The local clubs and a lot of others get their flag sets \n     from the Capitol Lions Club. Joe Carson is chairman of the \n     production and marketing of 26,000 to 27,000 flags a year in \n     Oregon and as far away as Pennsylvania.\n       ``It is kind of an Americanization project. We came up with \n     the idea 15 to 17 years ago as a fund-raising project,'' \n     Carson said.\n       The Capitol members sell the sets at 65 cents each to other \n     clubs and make $6,000 to $7,000 annually for such Lion's \n     projects as assistance to the hearing impaired and blind, \n     Carson said.\n       Capitol Club members buy the lumber, cut it into small \n     blocks, drill the holes, put Lion's decals on them and finish \n     them. They also reproduce the brochure that goes with each \n     set.\n       The participating clubs are Capitol, Keizer, Salem \n     Downtown, Northeast, South Salem and West Salem. Frank \n     VonBorstel was area chairman of the flag distribution for at \n     least 10 years.\n       ``We want to interest the young people and provide the \n     chance for them to learn something about patriotism and the \n     flag,'' Von-Borstel said.\n       Lion Kelly Freels tells of Lions members who served in the \n     Korean War and try to tell the first-graders what the flag \n     means to them.\n       ``They tell them how when they came back to base and saw \n     the U.S. flag flying, they knew they were safe. It also gives \n     us an opportunity to get out in the schools and see what is \n     going on,'' Freels said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2484-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      KOREAN WAR VETERANS MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, From 1950 to 1953, the United States \nwas in the midst of a bitter war on the Korean peninsula. As the \ninscription at the base of the Korean War Memorial says, our Nation's \nsons and daughters answered the call ``to defend a country they never \nknew and a people they never met.'' And they did so honorably. Today, \nthough, the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice is honored \nonce again.\n  Earlier today, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Honor Roll Kiosk was \nofficially unveiled in a ceremony by representatives of the American \nBattle Monuments Commission, the National Parks Service, the Samsung \nGroup, and IBM. The Honor Roll Kiosk houses a high technology \ninteractive computer base which contains all the verifiable names from \nthe Korean war theater of those killed in action, still listed as \nmissing in action, and those captured as prisoners of war. Touch \nscreens allow visitors, friends, and family to research the service \nrecord of their loved one, and obtain a certificate of honor in the \nname of that soldier. This was made possible in large part through the \ngenerous donation from the Samsung group of companies.\n  As part of the July 1995 Korean War Veterans Memorial dedication \nceremonies, Samsung made a significant contribution to the memorial \nfund. It was with great honor and appreciation that Samsung recognized \nthe sacrifice and commitment of the United States to the security of \nthe Korean peninsula. It is a commitment America maintains today. We \nhave worked together to establish close relations in defense of common \nprinciples and it is because of these shared beliefs that the United \nStates and South Korea remain partners in peace today.\n  In addition to contributing to the memorial, Samsung also created an \neducational endowment with the American Legion. Their gift of $5 \nmillion to the American Legion will be used to fund collegiate \nscholarships for the descendants of America's veterans. I commend and \ncongratulate Samsung on their generosity and willingness to recognize \nthe origin in which their success today is rooted. I am proud to have \ntheir North American headquarters located in Ridgefield Park, NJ. \nLastly, I recognize the honor and dignity with which America's service \nmen and women fought on the harsh Korean field of combat. As the \ndedication ceremonies remind us, your service--and your sacrifice--was \nnot forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2484-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2484-S2486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PATIENT RIGHT TO KNOW\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this week my colleagues, Senators \nKyl, Kennedy and Hutchinson, and I have introduced S. 449, the Patient \nRight to Know Act of 1997. This legislation outlaws so-called gags in \ncontracts between managed care companies and their licensed \npractitioners which have limited what doctors can tell patients about \ntheir medical condition and all treatment appropriate to their care.\n  Plain and simple, such gags have been used to limit appropriate \nmedical care. While this is a dollars-and-cents issue for health care \norganizations and insurers, for patients and their doctors\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\nsuch restrictions on the usual free flow of communication--held sacred \nsince ancient times--literally may be a matter of life or death.\n  I was pleased to join Mr. Kennedy in offering legislation on the \nfloor last session which would have ended such restrictions. I also \nwish to thank Mr. Kyl for his support of our legislation last year, and \nfor his diligent efforts in the intervening months to prepare this bill \nfor re-introduction.\n  I also wish to acknowledge support for this legislation from \norganizations including the Consumer's Union and the American Medical \nAssociation.\n  We have this broad range of support because the need for this \nlegislation is clear and documented. Three in four Americans now \ncovered by private health insurance receive their care from managed \ncare organizations. Increasingly, Medicaid enrollees and seniors in \nMedicare are covered by managed care plans through their respective \nFederal health insurance programs.\n  Residents of my home State of Oregon boast the highest penetration of \nmanaged care in the Nation. The State's Medicaid Program for the most \npart is organized through private managed care companies. And in \nPortland, managed care plans service almost 60 percent of the Medicare \npopulation.\n  In Oregon and elsewhere, the managed care presence has grown for \nreasons that are quite wholesome. Managed care helps enrollees stay \nhealthy through illness prevention programs. They assure coordination \nof services for persons with multiple ailments. And through systematic, \nquality-conscious gate-keeping, they work to reduce unnecessary \ntreatments which drive up health care costs.\n  At the same time, however, some managed care providers have tried to \nenhance their profit margins by limiting what doctors may tell patients \nregarding all appropriate treatments, thereby reducing services \npatients may actually receive. These gags in my view are outrageous. \nThe President through administrative order during the last few months \nhas made such gags illegal in managed care plans operating under \nMedicare and Medicaid. He has pledged his support for legislation \neliminating these restrictions in private health plans as well.\n  Mr. President, while I am convinced that we need a single Federal \nstandard on this matter to protect patients in managed care plans I am \nmuch encouraged by the voluntary efforts to end such gags recently \nannounced by the managed care insurance industry. My long association \nwith these companies has convinced me that coordinated care providers \nas a group often are on the cutting edge of developing both efficient \nand high-quality care for their enrollees. It is entirely appropriate \nfor this provider group to try to police their members on the issue of \ngag provisions and the protection of doctor-patient communications.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in today's Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Patient \n     Right to Know Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Patients need access to all relevant information to \n     make appropriate decisions about their health care.\n       (2) Open medical communications between health care \n     providers and their patients is a key to prevention and early \n     diagnosis and treatment, as well as to informed consent and \n     quality, cost-effective care.\n       (3) Open medical communications are in the best interests \n     of patients.\n       (4) Open medical communications must meet applicable legal \n     and ethical standards of care.\n       (5) It is critical that health care providers continue to \n     exercise their best medical, ethical, and moral judgment in \n     advising patients without interference from health plans.\n       (6) The offering and operation of health plans affect \n     commerce among the States.\n       (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a \n     Federal standard that protects medical communications between \n     health care providers and patients.\n\n     SEC. 2.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Health care provider.--The term ``health care \n     provider'' means anyone licensed or certified under State law \n     to provide health care services who is operating within the \n     scope of such license.\n       (2) Health insurance issuer.--The term ``health insurance \n     issuer'' has the meaning given such term in section \n     2791(b)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (as added by the \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996).\n       (3) Health plan.--The term ``health plan'' means a group \n     health plan (as defined in section 2791(a) of the Public \n     Health Service Act (as added by the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)) and any \n     individual health insurance (as defined in section \n     2791(b)(5)) operated by a health insurance issuer and \n     includes any other health care coverage provided through a \n     private or public entity.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, except that section 2(a)(3) shall take effect 180 days \n     after such date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Wyden in \nintroducing this gag rule legislation and I commend him for his \nleadership. Last year, a majority of the Senate voted for similar \nlegislation but it was defeated on a procedural technicality.\n  Gag rules have no place in American medicine. Americans deserve \nstraight talk from their physicians. Physicians deserve protection \nagainst insurance companies that abuse their economic power and compel \ndoctors to pay more attention to the health of the company's bottom \nline than to the health of their patients.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has strong support from both the \nAmerican Medical Association and Consumer's Union--because it is a \ncause that unites the interests of patients and doctors.\n  One of the most dramatic changes in the American health care system \nin recent years has been the growth of health maintenance \norganizations, preferred provider organizations, point of service \nplans, and other types of managed care. Today, 75 percent of all \nprivately insured Americans are in managed care. Even conventional fee-\nfor-service plans have increasingly adopted features of managed care, \nsuch as ongoing medical review and case management.\n  In many ways, this is a positive development. Managed care offers the \nopportunity to extend the best medical practice to all medical \npractice. It emphasizes helping people to stay healthy, rather than \nsimply caring for them when they become sick. It helps provide more \ncoordinated care and more effective care for people with multiple \nmedical needs. It offers a needed antidote to incentives to provide \nunnecessary care--incentives that have contributed a great deal to the \nhigh cost of care in recent years.\n  At its best, managed care fulfills these goals and improves the \nquality of care. Numerous studies have found that managed care compares \nfavorably to fee for-service medicine on a variety of quality measures, \nincluding use of preventive care, early diagnosis of some conditions, \nand patient satisfaction. Many HMOs have made vigorous efforts to \nimprove the quality of care, gather and use systematic data to improve \nclinical decision-making, and assure an appropriate mix of primary and \nspecialty care.\n  But the same financial incentives that enable HMOs and other managed \ncare providers to practice more cost-effective medicine also can lead \nto under treatment or inappropriate restrictions on care, especially \nwhen expensive treatments or new treatments are involved.\n  Too often, insurance companies have placed their bottom line ahead of \ntheir patient's well-being and have pressured physicians in their plans \nto do the same. These abuses include failure to inform patients of \nparticular treatment options; barriers to reduce referrals to \nspecialists for evaluation and treatment; unwillingness to order \nappropriate diagnostic tests; and reluctance to pay for potentially \nlife-saving treatment. It is hard to talk to a physician these days \nwithout hearing a story about insurance company behavior that raises \nquestions about quality of care. In some cases, insurance company \nbehavior has had tragic consequences.\n  In the long run, the most effective means of assuring quality care in \nHMOs is for the industry itself to make sure that quality is always a \ntop priority. I am encouraged by the industry's development of ethical \nprinciples for its members, by the growing trend toward accreditation, \nand by the increasingly widespread use of standardized quality \nassessment measures. But I also believe that basic Federal regulations \nare necessary to assure that every plan meets at least minimum \nstandards.\n  Medicare has already implemented such a prohibition. All Americans \nare entitled to this same protection.\n  A gag rule provision is also included in a more comprehensive managed \ncare bill that I introduced earlier this session. That bill addresses a \nnumber of other issues as well. This prohibition of gag rules is such a \nsimple need and cries out for immediate relief.\n  This legislation targets the most abusive type of gag rule--the type \nthat forbids physicians from discussing all treatment options with \npatients and makes the best possible professional recommendation, even \nif the recommendation is for a non-covered service or could be \nconstrued to disparage the plan for not covering it.\n  This bill specifically forbids plans from prohibiting or restricting \na provider from any medical communication with his or her patient.\n  This is a basic rule which everyone endorses in theory, even though \nit has been violated in practice. The standards of the Joint Commission \non Accreditation of Health Care Organizations require that ``Physicians \ncannot be restricted from sharing treatment options with their \npatients, whether or not the options are covered by the plan.''\n  We need to act on this legislation promptly. The Senate has the \nopportunity to protect patients across the country from these abusive \ngag rules. Action on this legislation is truly a test of the Senate's \ncommitment to the rights of patients and physicians across the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2484-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter \nsubmitted by Anthony Lake to the President involving his nomination to \nbe Director of Central Intelligence be printed in the Congressional \nRecord at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 17, 1997.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to ask that you withdraw \n     my nomination to be Director of Central Intelligence.\n       I do so not because of concern that the nomination would be \n     defeated if it ever came to a vote. In fact, there are \n     sufficient votes for confirmation--in both the Select \n     Committee and the Senate.\n       And not because of concern about further personal attacks. \n     That gauntlet has been run. Every question has been answered.\n       I do so because I have regretfully concluded that it is the \n     right thing to do.\n       While we have made great progress in the nomination process \n     over the past month and during last week's hearings. I have \n     learned over the weekend that the process is once again faced \n     by endless delay. It is a political football in a game with \n     constantly moving goal posts.\n       After more than three months, I have finally lost patience, \n     and the endless delays are hurting the CIA and NSC staff in \n     ways I can no longer tolerate.\n       I am told that the Chairman of the committee, having now \n     reviewed the positive FBI materials underlying the report on \n     my background investigation, may want other members of the \n     committee to read them. I had doubts about the precedent we \n     have already set in allowing him and the Vice Chairman such \n     access. To bend principle further would even more discourage \n     future nominees to this or other senior positions from \n     entering public service.\n       I am also told that his committee staff will again insist \n     that NSC staff meet with the committee on terms that White \n     House Counsel will find unacceptable, leading to a further \n     stalemate on that issue as well.\n       In addition, the story today about the activities of Mr. \n     Roger Tamraz is likely to lead to further delay as an \n     investigation proceeds.\n       All of this means a nomination process that has no end in \n     sight. We have been proceeding on the assumption that there \n     would be a vote this week. It now seems certain the committee \n     deliberations will extend past the recess until after Easter, \n     and probably longer. In addition, even after the nomination \n     receives a vote in committee, whenever that might be, there \n     is no prospect for a near-term vote on the floor and every \n     chance it will be extended as long as your political \n     opponents can do so.\n       I have gone through the past three months and more with \n     patience and, I hope, dignity. But I have lost the former and \n     could lose the latter as this political circus continues \n     indefinitely. As Senator Richard Lugar, perhaps the most \n     respected member of the Senate, has said with regard to my \n     nomination and its treatment, ``The whole confirmation \n     process has become more and more outrageous.'' It is nasty \n     and brutish without being short.\n       If this were a game, I would persist until we won. My \n     colleagues tell me to stay the course, lest I be perceived \n     the loser or scared of a further fight. I'm not.\n       But this is not a game. And this process is not primarily \n     about me. It is about the future of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency. The Agency, once again, is becoming politicized. The \n     longer this goes on, the worse the damage. The controversy \n     and its effects could linger on after my confirmation. The \n     men and women of the CIA deserve better than this.\n       The process is also impugning, through a new form of guilt \n     by association, the names of NSC staff members who have done \n     nothing wrong. So long as my nomination is mired in partisan \n     politics their reputations will be, as well. It is ironic \n     that the staff, which in every case took the right positions \n     in keeping national security decisions and domestic politics \n     separate, as I had encouraged them to do, is now the staff \n     bearing the brunt of criticism because it didn't go beyond \n     its own responsibilities to manage others' business as well. \n     This is a staff that was doing its job properly. There was \n     never any disguise of wrong-doing; they were consistently \n     doing right in the advice they offered, while concentrating \n     on the large daily agenda of important national security \n     issues before us. I am very proud of our work on these issues \n     and very proud of our staff members.\n       In unprecedented fashion the nomination is also \n     politicizing the Senate committee.\n       And I have noticed that, in numerous ways, it is poisoning \n     the attitude of members of the Agency towards the committee.\n       Most of all, the way this process has been conducted would \n     make it difficult for me to work with the committee in the \n     ways that a Director of Central Intelligence must do--and as \n     I had hoped to do.\n       I am deeply grateful to you for your strong support, for \n     your encouragement over these difficult months, and--most of \n     all--for the opportunity to serve over the past four years. I \n     am very proud of your foreign policy record and of whatever \n     contributions I made to it.\n       I have greatly appreciated the support of Senators McCain, \n     Lugar, Lieberman, Kerrey, Kerry, Kennedy and many others, \n     like John Deutch. I have been moved by the principled \n     position of a large number of Republicans like John McCain, \n     Warren Rudman, Richard Lugar, Robert Gates and Peter King. \n     And I am especially grateful to the volunteers from the NSC \n     who have put so much into this, as well as officials of the \n     CIA. I am sorry that their efforts were not better rewarded.\n       I have believed all my life in public service. I still do. \n     But Washington has gone haywire.\n       I hope that, sooner rather than later, people of all \n     political views beyond our city limits will demand that \n     Washington give priority to policy over partisanship, to \n     governing over ``gotcha.'' It is time that senior officials \n     have more time to concentrate on dealing with very real \n     foreign challenges rather than with the domestic wounds that \n     Washington is inflicting on itself.\n       This is a very difficult decision. I was excited about this \n     new opportunity to serve. I had developed firm ideas on how \n     to bring further reform to the Agency and had no doubt about \n     my capacity to implement them. I was ready to devote four \n     years to a tough new challenge. I truly regret that I will \n     not have the opportunity to seize it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Anthony Lake.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do so simply to comment on the very \nunfortunate set of circumstances that led to the decision by Mr. Lake \nto submit this letter.\n  I have had the opportunity to work with Tony Lake now for some time; \nfirst, as a Senator; and, second, as leader. I must say that I do not \nknow that I have ever met anybody more decent, more committed, more \ndedicated to public service than is Tony Lake. Our Nation owes him a \nbig debt of gratitude for his contributions, and a great level of \nappreciation for the many ways in which he has already served his \ncountry. I only hope that he will continue to choose to do so in spite \nof these extraordinary circumstances.\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\n  Mr. Lake was asked to be the Director of Central Intelligence by the \nPresident of the United States. It has been the prerogative of the \nPresident to name people within his administration, going all the way \nback to George Washington. Of course, there are times when the Senate \nin its role as a body to serve with advise and consent that it has \ndisagreed with the President about a particular nomination, or about a \nparticular member of a given administration. But I must say in all of \nhistory I challenge somebody to come up with more flimsy evidence with \nwhich to destroy the character of a candidate for public office \nappointed by the President as grievously as what I see has happened to \nTony Lake in the last several months.\n  Mr. Lake was not even given the opportunity to be voted on, never \npresented an opportunity for a vote in the committee, never presented \nwith an opportunity to be voted on on the floor.\n  I was asked this morning if this is some retribution for John Tower, \nor Robert Bork. My answer was that I hope our Republican colleagues are \nnot that cynical. I hope there is some other motivation for doing to \nTony Lake what they did over the last couple of months. It is very \nunfortunate. And it is sad, Mr. President. A man of his integrity, his \ncharacter, was treated so shabbily by the committee that is supposed to \nbe as devoid of politics as any in this institution. I think they owe \nhim an apology. At least they owed him a vote.\n  Under these circumstances, I think he made the right decision. But I \nam deeply troubled. I am troubled by the way it was handled. I am \ntroubled by the insinuations and allegations all printed on the front \npage of every newspaper as fact. I am troubled by his inability to be \ngiven the opportunity to defend himself adequately against this never-\nending list of additional allegations and questions going over old \nmaterial time and time again almost as if it was an inquisition.\n  So, Mr. President, it is a sad day for this body. It is a sad day for \nthe Intelligence Committee. And it certainly is a sad occasion for \nthose seeking to serve our country in the capacity and the level as \nDirector of Central Intelligence.\n  I don't know what recommendation I would give to some other candidate \nwho now may consider this particular position. What advice do you give \nsomeone who puts himself forward knowing full well that there will be \nraw FBI data available to Members, and, if the chairman of the \ncommittee had his way, to all Members? What do you tell someone who has \nlaid himself out? What do you tell the next person who is expected not \nto subject himself or herself to the same set of circumstances?\n  Mr. President, this institution needs to restore civility, needs to \ncome up with a way with which to take the meanness out of our process, \nwhether it is a legislative issue or a nomination. Civility has to be \nbrought back into this process. I hope we will start soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2487-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2488-S2489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INDEPENDENT COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I don't know that I will have an \nopportunity tomorrow morning to discuss another matter, and I want to \ndo so just briefly.\n  We will have the opportunity to vote, as the distinguished majority \nleader has indicated, on two resolutions tomorrow. My colleagues have \ndone a good job of explaining what the circumstances are. But I hope \neveryone who will watch the debate tomorrow will try to understand the \ncircumstances involving the two resolutions and what this issue is all \nabout.\n\n  There are four factors here that I want to briefly mention.\n  The first factor is the timeliness of this resolution. I am deeply \ndisturbed that on the very day that the President found himself on the \noperating table, our colleagues chose to file a resolution demanding \nthat there be an independent counsel investigating the President. \nMoreover, on the very day the President leaves for Helsinki to begin \nnegotiating extraordinarily important matters with heads of state, this \nbody has chosen to vote on the independent counsel resolution. Taste \nand timeliness were certainly not factors in making the decision to \nbring about the resolutions under these circumstances.\n  The second issue involves necessity. Certainly necessity wasn't a \nmatter of concern here either. In accordance with the law, the \nJudiciary Committee may send a letter to the Attorney General. In good \nfaith I think both sides worked to try to find a mutually acceptable \nletter, and that was impossible. So, as I understand it, three letters \nwere actually sent. But that started the process under law. That is \nwhat is required. But that wasn't good enough for some of our \ncolleagues. For whatever reason, our colleagues then chose to say, \n``Well, in addition to the legal requirements, we are now going to do \nsomething extralegal. We are going to do something that was actually \ncriticized on this floor when the independent counsel legislation was \ndebated.''\n  We considered whether we ought to have a debate on the floor about \nrequiring or asking for an independent counsel. And the decision was \nmade on a bipartisan basis. In fact, Senator Dole was very involved at \nthat point in this debate, and the agreement was that having Congress \nvote on the need for an independent counsel for a particular \ninvestigation would politicize the process.\n  So, for that reason, we agreed that it should not be a function of \nthe Senate floor, but that it ought to be a legal process confined to \nthe Judiciary Committee. That is the way the law was passed.\n  Yet, what do we do now? What do we find ourselves faced with? Not \njust a resolution calling for the Attorney General to consider under \nthe law the available evidence; the Republican resolution goes even \nbeyond that. It says, first of all, that the Judiciary Committee letter \nis not adequate, and, second, that we are going to use a resolution to \ndictate to the Attorney General that she ought to appoint an \nindependent counsel--in total violation of the intent and the spirit of \nthe law we passed just a few years ago. So the intent, Mr. President, \nis questionable to say the least.\n  The third issue is scope. We had a good debate about scope last week, \nand it became clear that a significant majority of the Members on both \nsides of the aisle said if anything is going to be investigated, then \nwe better investigate everything. And that, indeed, is what is called \nfor in the independent counsel law, which includes the alleged misdeeds \nof senior executive branch officials and Members of Congress.\n  Curiously, once more, the Republican resolution, just as it did last \nweek initially, specifically limits the scope of the requested \ninvestigation to the President. Our resolution calls for a review of \nall of the reported improprieties to determine the severity of the \nproblem. Our resolution calls for the scope to be as broad as the one \nthat was set out in the Governmental Affairs resolution last week and \nadopted in the Senate by a vote of 99 to 0.\n  So we will have an opportunity tomorrow to vote on scope, to vote on \nwhether or not we limit the independent counsel's investigation just to \nPresidential activity or whether--in the name of fairness, balance, and \nthe real intent of the law--everything is on the table. To vote no on \nthe Democratic resolution is to say, ``No, we do not want an \nindependent counsel to look at Congress.'' So scope is a very critical \nissue, and that will be the subject of a good deal of debate and \nscrutiny as we go forth in the coming weeks.\n  Finally, there is the question of whether or not it ought to be our \npurpose to dictate at all what direction the Attorney General should \ntake. How is it that we put ourselves in a position to say we know \nbetter than she does the circumstances that might dictate the \nappointment of yet another special prosecutor? She has 25 FBI agents \nand a grand jury investigating all of this. She is reviewing the \nmatters, I am sure, on a daily basis. What do we have? So far, we only \nhave newspaper reports and the reports on all of the nightly networks. \nIt is on that basis that some of our colleagues have already concluded \nan independent counsel is warranted.\n  It is arrogant in the least to say we know better than the Attorney \nGeneral on this issue and to dictate to her that she should appoint a \nspecial prosecutor in spite of whatever facts she may have available to \nher today.\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, with regard to all four of these questions, I hope \nour colleagues will take great care as they vote tomorrow morning.\n  There is one other procedural matter unrelated to substance that I \nthink is also curious. The resolution offered by our colleagues on the \nRepublican side is a congressional resolution requiring a vote in the \nHouse and a signature by the President of the United States. That is \ncurious. Why is it that this body would offer a resolution asking for \nan independent counsel and then put it in a form which requires a \nPresidential signature? I am skeptical about the motivation in that \nregard as well.\n  For all these reasons--taste, timeliness, scope, attitude, not to \nmention the resolution itself in the form that it takes--I certainly \nhope my colleagues will vote against the very maligned, poorly worded, \nextraordinarily ill-timed, narrowly drawn resolution offered by our \ncolleagues and simply join us in restating what current law already \nrequires. It is for the Attorney General to make that determination \nand, if she makes it, to recognize that scope ought to be as broad as \nshe needs to make it, even including Congress, if that may be required.\n  I yield the floor and I, given the resolution already adopted, call \nupon the Chair for the final issuance of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/18/senate-section/article/S2488-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
