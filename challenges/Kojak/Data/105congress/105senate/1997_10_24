Your fairness is the \nresult of Your righteousness and justice. Today, we pray for the \ncharacter pillar of fairness, of fairness for our own lives. Help us to \nplay by Your rules of absolute honesty, purity, and love. We not only \nwant to do to others what we would want them to do to us, but we want \nto treat others as You have treated us.\n  Thank You that we have Your commandments and Your truth in the Bible \nas our guide. You have taught us not only to meet but to go beyond the \njust standard. May we be distinguished for our generosity in exceeding \nwhat is expected.\n  May our expression of the character trait of fairness also include \nour judgments of other people and what we say about them. Forgive us \nwhen our evaluations of people are polluted by pride, envy, or \ncompetitiveness. Remind us of the power of words to assassinate other \npeople's characters. When we can say nothing positive, may we say \nnothing.\n  Lord, You know the strength of this pillar of character called \nfairness. It is tested when people are unfair in what they say about us \nor are unfair in their dealings with us. Our temptation is to \nretaliate, but we know that resentment fired by retaliation usually \nresults in recrimination. Help us break that cycle by being fair by \nYour standards and with Your strength. Through our Lord and Saviour. \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11173-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will just use this time to make a \ncomment about a resolution that is soon to be introduced in a \nbipartisan fashion, dealing with trade practices between our country \nand the country of Japan. As many may have recognized recently in the \nnews, we have been involved in a very long and very serious dispute \nwith the country of Japan regarding access, opening up their ports to \nour industries the same way that our American ports are open to \nJapanese ships when they call on United States ports here in this \ncountry. This dispute has been going on for a number of years. It has \ngotten to be very, very serious.\n  We will soon be introducing a resolution. We have talked to Chairman \nHelms and Majority Leader Lott and our Democratic leader, Tom Daschle. \nI know Senator Hollings is very interested in this as well. We worked \non a resolution, which will be introduced, which will commend the \nadministration and also the Federal Maritime Commission for their \nefforts to date in bringing this 15-year problem with the Japanese port \npractices to a successful conclusion. Since the press and many of my \ncolleagues have already adequately described the history of the \nJapanese port practices, I am not going to repeat it here. But I would \nlike to make a few comments on what has happened.\n  First, I think it is very important from this Senator's perspective \nto recognize that we have been able to work for a successful and \nsatisfactory conclusion of this problem because of the strong, \nindependent action that the Federal Maritime Commission was able to \ntake. As an independent agency, the Federal Maritime Commission has the \nflexibility to carry out policies that are good for America without \nhaving to go through a number of steps and consultations with agencies \nwithin our Government that sometimes actually impede the process of \nquickly and appropriately making decisions that must be made. Because \nof its independent status, it was able to take this action in a way \nthat should bring about what I think will be a satisfactory conclusion.\n  The second point I would like to make is I think it is appropriate at \nthis time to recognize the decision of our U.S. Trade Representative, \nCharlene Barshefsky, last year, to refuse to commit the United States \nto an inadequate GATS maritime agreement. Had the United States \naccepted that proposal last year, which was a so-called standstill \nproposal, these same Japanese port barriers would have been \ngrandfathered in and would have been recognized as the international \nlaw of the land. The Federal Maritime Commission, including the rest of \nthe U.S. Government, would have then been powerless to do anything \nabout them except to try to negotiate them away during subsequent \nrounds of talks with the WTO starting in the year 2000. No agreement is \nbetter than a bad agreement. This is a clear example that what the U.S. \nTrade Representative did at that time was appropriate and proper.\n  Finally, I believe any agreement on the port practices dispute \ninvolving the United States and the country of Japan must include two \nfundamental points: First, a collection of fines to the extent it shows \nother countries around the world, not only Japan, that the United \nStates is very serious about reciprocal market access and compliance \nwith our laws; and, second, a vigilant, continued monitoring and \nenforcement by the Federal Maritime Commission of the changes in port \npractices promised by the Government of Japan. Both of these two \nelements are absolutely essential for any type of credible agreement. \nThe Federal Maritime Chairman, Hal Creel, the Federal Maritime \nCommissioners, Ming Hsu, Del Won, Joe Scroggins and their staffs are to \nbe commended for their extraordinary efforts to resolve this matter in \na firm and fair manner. Likewise, I commend our State Department \nUndersecretary for Economic Affairs Stu Eisenstadt and his staff. They \nare to be commended for their perseverance in this matter.\n  Now is not the time, however, for congratulations. We are not quite \nthere yet. Negotiations are continuing. But with additional fortitude, \nconsumers and carriers and their customers, both in Japan and the \nUnited States, will soon enjoy the fruits of our labors. We have come \ntoo far to settle for any type of mediocre agreement. We cannot and \nshould not give up now. I think a solid resolution of this issue is \nfeasible and I expect one to be concluded in a reasonable amount of \ntime.\n  Mr. President, if no one else is seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11174-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11174-S11175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE INVESTITURE OF ERIC CLAY\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an event that \nwill be taking place in Detroit, MI, a little later on this morning. \nUnfortunately, because of our votes today, it was not possible for me \nto attend what will be the investiture of Eric Clay, of Michigan, to \nbecome a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. I worked on \nbehalf of Mr. Clay during the nomination process. It was a long and \narduous one. Although his nomination was first sent up here in 1996, \nbecause of various factors we did not complete action on his nomination \nduring the 104th Congress. Therefore, his\n\n[[Page S11175]]\n\nnomination was sent up again at the beginning of the 105th Congress. \nHappily, after another hearing and after once again being able to seek \nand receive unanimous support on the Judiciary Committee, he was \nconfirmed by the full Senate in July of this year.\n  Mr. Clay has been an able advocate of his profession. He has been a \nvery successful attorney. He is one of the cofounders of one of the \nNation's largest minority-run law firms, and a very successful one in \nour State. He is well respected by people throughout the legal \ncommunity. So, for those reasons and for a variety of others, I was \ndelighted to support his nomination and to work for his confirmation.\n  Unhappily, as I say, I will not be able to be at the investiture \ntoday, but I know his many friends and colleagues are with him and will \ncelebrate his official swearing in to the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. As I indicated at the hearing, in any case where people might \nnot necessarily agree, as we find ourselves perhaps occasionally in \ndisagreement on matters that come before the court, or before the \nSenate for that matter, I think he will bring strength and competence.\n  He served at one time as a clerk to Judge Damon Keith, who is \ncurrently on the sixth circuit and has just recently taken senior \nstatus. And, although not directly filling Judge Keith's spot, he, I am \nsure, will carry on Judge Keith's legacy on the bench and I think will \nbe a fine advocate for the State of Michigan on the sixth circuit, and \nalso, I think, will bring to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals a great \ndeal of talent and will make a valuable contribution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to a story that appeared last week in the Cincinnati Post. \nThis is the story. The headline is: ``Woman Torched Nephew, Police \nSay--Youngster's Burns Untreated for Weeks''\n  Mr. President, the article tells the story of the awful abuse of an \n8-year-old child in the Cincinnati area. The boy was set on fire--set \non fire--with nail polish remover, and then sent to school for 3 weeks \nwith his burns unattended.\n  Cincinnati police investigated what happened to this little boy. They \nhave now charged his aunt with child endangering. They charged his aunt \nwith setting him on fire--and also with abusing him with a belt, an \nextension cord, and shoes.\n  Mr. President, this is an obscene crime. After this woman's arrest, \nit was revealed that she had been charged with a similar crime \ninvolving the same little boy 2 years before. Don't we have to ask, Mr. \nPresident, what on Earth was that woman doing taking care of that child \nor any child? Why in the world was that child put back into that same \nhome, put back with that abusive woman?\n  Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, I rose on the Senate floor to tell a \nsimilar tragic story. That story took place in Washington, DC. It was \nthe story of a little 4-year-old girl named Monica Wheeler who was \nfound dead, beaten to death in the bathroom of a man who was an \nacquaintance of her mother. Three years ago, one of Monica's siblings, \nher brother Andre, then aged 2, was also found dead in the same man's \nbathroom.\n  Mr. President, as I have come to the floor and cautioned before, it \nis up to the police and the courts to find out the truth about these \nparticular cases. And we should not be interested in prosecuting anyone \nhere on the Senate floor, no matter what we think. That certainly is \nwhat the courts are for. But I cannot stress enough that these awful \ncrimes point to a responsibility that lies with us here in Congress, \nthe responsibility to make sure we do all we can to stop these crimes \nfrom ever happening.\n  One thing we know for certain about these two cases--the Cincinnati \ncase and the Washington case, and far too many other cases--is that \nthere are too many children in this country today being returned to the \ncare of people who have already abused and battered them, people who \nshould not be allowed to take care of these children. Children are \nbeing returned to homes that are homes in name only and to parents who \nare parents in name only.\n  Every day in this country, three children actually die of abuse or \nneglect at the hands of a parent or their caretakers. That is \napproximately 1,200 children a year who die. And almost half of these \nchildren, shockingly, Mr. President, are killed after--after--their \ntragic circumstances have come to the attention of the child welfare \nagencies.\n  At the end of 1996, Mr. President, over 525,000 children were in \nfoster homes across this country. Over a year's time, it is estimated \nthat 650,000 children will be in a foster home for at least a portion \nof that year. And shockingly, roughly 25 percent of the children in the \nfoster care system at any one time will languish in foster care longer \nthan 4 years. And 10 percent of these children will be in foster care \nlonger than 7 years.\n  Mr. President, this problem has been growing for many years. It is at \nleast in part the very unintended consequence of a law passed by \nCongress in 1980, a law that I have spoken on this floor I suppose at \nleast a dozen times about since I came to the Senate. It is a law that \nwas passed in 1980 that requires that reasonable efforts always be made \nto reunify families. In practice, Mr. President, this law has resulted \nin unreasonable efforts, unreasonable efforts being made to reunite \nfamilies that are families in name only, families that never should be \nreunited. Children are being sent back to abusive parents, abusive care \ngivers, and many times the result is death.\n  Mr. President, I have been working to change this for almost 3 years \nnow. Last month, along with Senators Chafee, Craig, and Rockefeller, \nand others, I introduced a bill that I hope will represent the \nculmination of this effort. The PASS Act--the Promotion of Adoption \nSafety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act--would make a \ndifference. It would save young lives. It would change this 1980 law \nthat I referenced. It would put an end to a tragic policy that has put \nparents' interests above the health and safety and even the survival of \ninnocent children.\n  It would help child welfare agencies move faster to rescue these \nchildren. Mr. President, every child deserves a better fate than being \nshuttled from foster home to foster home for years on end.\n  That is why, Mr. President, we are working to pass this very \nimportant bill. Let us work together, after we pass the bill, then on \nthe next step, which will be to continue to try to improve the system.\n  But the work that is in front of us today, Mr. President, is to pass \nthe PASS Act, a bill that has been worked on extensively, a bill that \nwill in fact benefit children in two ways: One, by moving them quickly \nthrough the system once they are in fact in foster care so that they do \nnot languish in foster care for years on end so that they can have what \nevery child needs, which is a caring and loving family; and the second \nthing the bill would do is save lives. We will never know what child's \nlife will be saved or how many, but I am convinced, after talking with \ncaseworkers throughout the State of Ohio, children service agencies, \nand after having talked to many people throughout this country, that \nthe 1980 law that\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\nour bill will amend will in fact, by amending that law, save lives.\n  So I urge my colleagues, when this bill is brought to the floor, as I \nhope it will be in the next several weeks, to look at this bill, to \npass it, and to move on so that we can make a very strong statement and \ndo something very positive for America's children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio very much for the work he has done on this legislation, the \nsupport he has given it, the kind things he has had to say about my \npart in it.\n  I think it is very important to stress that the Senator from Ohio has \nlong been active in children's matters, particularly this area that we \nare involved with, namely, adoption and foster care. He knows the \nexisting problems in this system and has been very, very helpful in the \nmeetings we have had in putting this legislation together.\n  So I thank the Senator from Ohio very much for his work. And I share \nhis enthusiasm and his desire to see this legislation come up this \nyear, before we leave hopefully. So certainly both of us will do \neverything we can. We have had some fine meetings with the majority \nleader on it. Next week, we will be meeting with the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. Hopefully this legislation can come before us before \nwe leave.\n  If there is nobody else desiring to speak, Mr. President, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Faircloth pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1313 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to draw the attention \nof my colleagues to a very sad, unnecessary controversy involving the \nGovernment of the United States and the Government of China, a \ncontroversy which also involves a little 3-year-old girl.\n  Mr. President, this is the sad story. A Chinese woman living in \nCleveland was diagnosed with schizophrenia. For many reasons, including \nthis diagnosis, it was clear that this woman was not capable of taking \ncare of her daughter. In fact, they had both been evicted from a \nSalvation Army shelter because of concerns that the mother was \nmistreating the daughter. Evidence showed that the child had been \nseriously neglected. So the court stepped in and sent this child into \nfoster care. By the time this little girl was 16 months old, \ntragically, she has been in four foster homes.\n  The natural mother was allowed visiting rights. During one of these \nvisits she abducted the child and took her to the People's Republic of \nChina. In June 1997, Mr. President, the Ohio court permanently \nterminated the birth mother's rights and awarded legal custody of Mei \nMei--this little girl's name--to Mei Mei's foster mother. Since last \nOctober, the foster mother, the legal guardian of this child, has been \ntrying, naturally, to get Mei Mei back. She wants to adopt Mei Mei, but \nher efforts thus far have not been successful.\n  Mr. President, I urge President Clinton to raise the issue of this \nlittle child with the Chinese President when they meet. There is an \nadoptive family waiting in Ohio for Mei Mei. They love her and they \nwill be able to take good care of her. I hope this problem can be \nresolved in a positive and expeditious way. Therefore, I urge the \nPresident to raise this at the highest level between our countries.\n  A few minutes ago on the floor I circulated a letter--and a number of \nmy colleagues have already signed it--to send to President Clinton \nurging him to bring the matter up.\n  Mr. President, sometimes it is easy, as we debate issues, to lose the \npersonal sense about these horrible cases. Sometimes we hear about \nstatistics and sometimes we hear about stories of bad things occurring, \nsuch as I have just related.\n  To try to bring it home, though, and put a more personal face on it, \nlet me read just one paragraph that was written by the foster mother \nwho wants to adopt Mei Mei. This is what she writes:\n\n       We have been applauded for our dedication and uninterrupted \n     love for Mei Mei. I can honestly tell you, however, that it \n     was not difficult. When a child enters your life and needs to \n     be held, you hold them. You teach them to laugh, you teach \n     them that you are there, you teach them to be gentle, you \n     teach them that everything in life is beautiful. And then \n     when they start to see that life is not something to be just \n     tolerated but rather to be enjoyed, they develop a sparkle in \n     their eye, which fuels your love further for them. That's \n     what happened with us and with Mei Mei.\n\n  So I urge, again, Mr. President, that our President, President \nClinton, bring this matter up with the Chinese. It is a small matter, I \nsuppose. But it is a little girl; it is her life. She has an \nopportunity for a loving family to raise her. She was snatched away \nfrom that opportunity by a woman who has clearly demonstrated that she \nis unfit to take care of this little girl. So I urge the President, as \nhe discusses issues with the Chinese, to raise the issue of Mei Mei.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and at this point I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11176-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11176-S11177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FDA REFORM\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I want to discuss today an important issue \ninvolving the FDA. First, let me congratulate my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson, for his fine work on the legislation \nthat he has just introduced. This bill that Senator Hutchinson has \nintroduced would prevent the FDA from implementing a proposed rule that \nis harmful and unnecessary.\n  Mr. President, this is the story. Earlier this year, the Food and \nDrug Administration issued a proposed rule to accelerate the phaseout \nof metered-dose inhalers that are propelled by chlorofluorocarbon \ngases, commonly known as ``CFC's.'' Essentially, Mr. President, the FDA \nhas proposed to ban from the market safe and effective medicines that \nmillions of Americans use to help them breathe. For many patients, \nthese medicines mean, quite literally, the difference between life and \ndeath.\n  This FDA proposed ban is not based on concerns of safety, but rather \nthe ban on these inhalers was put forward on the grounds that inhalers \nthat use CFCs deplete the Earth's ozone layer. Now, the fact is, Mr. \nPresident, that these inhalers have only a minimal effect on ozone \ndepletion. Asthma inhalers account for only a very small part of this \nproblem. It is estimated that asthma inhalers account for less than 1.5 \npercent of the total problem.\n  Perhaps more important, Mr. President, the companies that make these \ninhalers have already agreed to develop new CFC-free devices by the \nyear 2005--the deadline that was previously set forth in the \ninternational Montreal Protocol. These companies are working hard to \nbring these products to the market quickly and, in fact, they think \nthey will beat the 2005 year deadline.\n  So I think, Mr. President, it's clear that the FDA's proposed rule to \naccelerate the phaseout of these products yields no significant benefit \nto the global environment. What it will do, however, is take away \nessential medications from Americans who depend on these inhalers to \nmanage serious respiratory illnesses.\n  Mr. President, over 30 million Americans suffer from some type of \nrespiratory disease, including asthma.\n\n[[Page S11177]]\n\n Many of these patients rely on a combination of inhalers to be able to \nfunction normally. The FDA's proposed policy would limit their \ntreatment options and force them to switch from proven treatment \nregimens that have been carefully adjusted to control their symptoms.\n  Mr. President, asthma is a serious national health problem. The \nmorbidity and mortality rates from asthma continue to increase in the \nUnited States, particularly among minority and inner-city children. Mr. \nPresident, I think we have to question the FDA's judgment in putting \nforth a proposal that puts these patients at further risk. I hope \nothers will agree with me as well.\n  Mr. President, the FDA has already received over 10,000 letters from \npatients, providers, and health care organizations expressing concern \nabout this issue. In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary \nDonna Shalala, Dr. C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon General of this \ncountry, wrote the following:\n\n       This proposal will adversely impact patient health, while \n     providing negligible environmental benefit.\n\n  Dr. Koop went on to state:\n\n       Any efforts to limit the medications available to asthma \n     patients and their physicians would be a serious mistake that \n     would lead to severe consequences for American asthmatics.\n\n  Mr. President, there is another aspect to this whole issue. Under the \nproposed guideline, the FDA would remove from the market products that \nhave been tested and labeled for use in children and replace them with \nCFC-free versions that while containing the same active ingredients \nhave not been tested or approved for use by children. They have not \nbeen tested or approved for pediatric use. Mr. President, asthma is the \nleading cause of chronic illness among children--5 million children \nsuffer from asthma today. How in the world can the FDA remove products \nfrom the market which are proven to be safe and effective for children \nwhile at the same time the FDA laments the lack of adequately labeled \nproducts for children? It just doesn't make sense.\n  Mr. President, the Food and Drug Administration is charged with \nprotecting the health and well-being of American citizens. It seems \nincomprehensible to me that it could put forth a proposal that secures \nreally negligible environmental benefits at a potentially steep cost to \nhuman lives and health. I urge the FDA to reconsider its proposal. The \nhealth of millions of Americans who depend on metered-dose inhalers is \ntoo important.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the question before the Senate and \nwhat is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been intrigued--modestly, if I may \nsay, so as not to exaggerate--at the plethora of complaints that are \nbeing in some instances stridently expressed about the President's use \nof the line-item veto. I suppose what amazes me so much about this \nmatter is that all of this vast panorama of problems that could be \nexpected to occur in the train of passage of the Line-Item Veto Act \nhave been addressed time and time and time again on this Senate floor \nby me; by my colleague, Senator Moynihan; by my colleague, Senator \nLevin; by my colleague, Senator Reid; and many other colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, including, of course, former Senator Mark Hatfield. \nWe spoke to the galleries here and across the land repeatedly about \nwhat could be expected from the use of a President's line-item veto pen \nshould such legislation be passed. We also spoke of the constitutional \nramifications of a line-item veto. At the time, I felt that in all \nprobability our expressions of concern were falling upon deaf ears.\n  So of late it has been brought home to me very clearly that although \none may speak with stentorian voice, as with the combined voices of 50 \nmen or as if his lungs were of brass, there will nonetheless be ears \nthat will not hear, there will be eyes that will not see, and there \nwill apparently be minds that will not think.\n  So one is left with very little consolation other than to know that \nwhat he or she said as a warning in days past was on point, and that \nhistory will prove that the point was well taken.\n  Mr. President, I see my dear friend, Senator Moynihan, who is a great \nteacher. I wish I would have had the opportunity to sit in his \nclasses--a man who is noted in the Congressional Directory as having \nreceived 60 honorary degrees. That will make one sit up and take \nnotice--60 honorary degrees! I have never counted my honorary degrees. \nBut I suppose that if I have been the recipient of ten or a dozen, that \nwould certainly be the limit.\n  But Senator Moynihan has foreseen the ramifications of this unwise \nlegislative action by the Congress--and it is now coming home to \nroost--the so-called ``Line-Item Veto Act.'' He has joined with me \npreviously many times in discussing the act here and elsewhere. He has \njoined with me, as did Senator Levin and former Senator Hatfield and \ntwo of our colleagues in the other body, in a court challenge against \nthe Line-Item Veto Act. And he joins with me today in cosponsoring this \nbill to repeal the line-item veto.\n\n  So I am going to yield to him. I have legislation that I have \nprepared to repeal this act. Senator Moynihan has joined with me in the \npreparation of the legislation. And I am going to yield to him because, \nas I understand it, he needs to get to another appointment right away. \nSo I gladly yield to my friend for as long as he wishes. I ask that I \nbe permitted to yield to Senator Moynihan without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is again an honor and a privilege to \njoin with one of the great constitutionalists in the history of the \nU.S. Senate, Robert C. Byrd, who has written the history of the Senate.\n  I can so well remember the occasion on which that great volume was \nintroduced. One of our finest American historians was present saying \nthat it is difficult to understand and very hard to forgive that there \nhas been so little scholarly attention given to this body, to the \nCongress, as against the Presidency, and suggesting that it is not hard \nto explain. There is only one President, and there are 435 of us--a \nmore complicated subject that comes later in our historymaking.\n  But I think it may be said that in the history of relations between \nthe Congress and the Presidency there has never been an issue equal in \nimportance to the constitutional challenge we face with the Line-Item \nVeto Act.\n  I think of difficulties in the past. There have been clashes between \nthe Executive and the legislative. There are meant to be, sir, I \npresume to tell you.\n  Madison and Hamilton, when they explained the Constitution to the \npeople of New York in that series of essays that became the Federalist \nPapers, said citizens might well ask. At that time people knew the \nhistory of classical Greece and Rome, and they knew how turbulent it \nwas. Madison had the solicitous phrase of speaking of the ``fugitive \nexistence'' of those republics. And they asked: What makes anyone \nsuppose that we will have a better understanding, a better, a more \ndurable existence than those of the past? And the answer was, ``We have \na new science of politics.'' That was their phrase, `` * * * a new \nscience of politics.'' Because in the past, theories of government \ndepended on virtue in rulers. We have made up a different arrangement, \nan arrangement by which the opposing forces, the checks and balances, \nset off one group against another. And the result is that in the end \nyou have outcomes that make up for--again, a wonderful line of \nMadison's--``the defect of better motives.'' And, in that regard the \nFramers very carefully\n\n[[Page S11178]]\n\ndefined in article I and article II this distinction.\n  If I may say, again because it is so important, the framers of the \nConstitution presumed conflict. They did not assume harmony. They did \nnot assume common interests. They assumed conflict. When they were \nasked, Why should we expect this Republic to survive given the \n``fugitive existence'' of republics of classical Rome and Greece?, they \nreplied ``Because we have a new science of politics.'' We can have one \ninterest balance another interest. And they devised it because they \nknew there were conflicting interests.\n  I believe it would surprise us, Mr. President, to know the extent to \nwhich--until the American Constitution came along--political theory \nassumed virtue and harmony in rulers and in government. We have seen it \nin our time, sir, in its most notorious form in the dictatorships of \nthe proletariat in the Soviet Union, in the Republic of China, now in \nNorth Korea, if you like. The dictatorship of the proletariat is a \nwonderful way of saying rule by the virtuists, and rule by the \nvirtuists turned out in reality to be rule by tyrants, by monsters. \nIndeed, Mr. Pol Pot is just now being interviewed by Mr. Thayer in the \nFar Eastern Review, and in the name of virtue, in the name of the \npeople's republic, Mr. Pol Pot murdered perhaps as many as 2 million \nCambodians. All in the name of virtue.\n\n  Well, this Constitution does not assume virtue. It assumes self-\ninterest. And it carefully balances the power by which one interest \nwill offset another interest and in the outcome make up, again in that \nwonderful phrase of Madison, ``the defect of better motives.''\n  In the judgment of this Senator, shared of course by our revered \nleader in this regard, nothing could violate that constitutional design \nmore clearly than the Line Item Veto Act. On January 2 of this year, \nthe first business day after the Line Item Veto Act took effect, I \njoined Senator Byrd, Senator Levin, and our never-to-be-forgotten \nfriend from the State of Oregon, the former chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, in a lawsuit challenging \nthe constitutionality of that Act on the ground that it violates \narticle I, section 7, clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, known as the \npresentment clause.\n  Mr. President, the issue of this Act's constitutionality has now been \ncommented upon by two Federal judges. In the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Columbia, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson took exactly 3 \nweeks from the date of oral argument to conclude that it is \nunconstitutional. He wrote in his April 10, 1997 opinion that by \npassing the Line Item Veto Act, ``Congress has turned the \nconstitutional division of responsibilities for legislating on its \nhead.''\n  The Justice Department appealed that decision, and we went to the \nSupreme Court where, in a manner that I think is generally understood, \nthe Court is a little shy about getting into arguments between Members \nof Congress and the President. I could use the image, sir, that the \nCourt likes to see someone before it with a broken arm saying, let me \ntell you how it happened to me and why. And they held that we did not \nhave standing--seven Justices did. Justice Breyer thought we had \nstanding. But most importantly, sir, Justice Stevens dissented. He said \nwe did have standing, and what is more, that this measure is \nunconstitutional. He is the one Supreme Court Justice who has commented \non the question of this statute's constitutionality. In his opinion he \nwrote:\n\n       The same reason that the respondents have standing provides \n     a sufficient basis for concluding that the statute is \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  I quote, Sir, from the case of Franklin D. Raines, Director, Office \nof Management and Budget, et al., Appellants, versus Robert C. Byrd, et \nal.\n  Now, this is a constitutional question. There is another more subtle \none. It goes directly to the constitutional intention of the separation \nof powers and the balance of powers, and that is the idea of the shift \nin power from the Congress to the executive that this legislation makes \npossible.\n  In this morning's Washington Post there is an article about the \nPresident's recent exercise of this authority. And rather to my \ndistress, if I may say it, a number of Senators on this floor and a \nnumber of Members on the House floor have discovered that there is \npolitics being played in the White House. Politics, Mr. President? I am \nshocked to hear that there are politics in the Presidency. Of course, \nthere are--ever have been. In today's story in the Post a very \ndistinguished scholar, Stanley E. Collender, who is an expert on \nspending issues, says, ``The line-item veto is never going to be a \ndeficit reduction tool and you would think they''--the Congress--\n``would have realized it when they gave it to the President. It's a raw \nexercise in power.'' Mr. President, if you want to shift power from the \nCongress to the executive, fine. Amend the Constitution. Do not abuse \nit by statute. And if it came to amending it, I am not sure we would.\n  I talked earlier about the ``Federalist,'' which was written as \nessays in New York State newspapers in support of ratification by New \nYork State of the Constitution, which was a very close matter. Rhode \nIsland, as the distinguished sometime President pro tempore knows, was \nthe last to ratify it. It took them years. But they didn't have Madison \nand Hamilton and Jay to read at the time, and we did.\n\n  Now, there has just appeared a wonderful small volume called the New \nFederalist Papers, a twentieth century fund book written by Alan \nBrinkley, Nelson Polsby and Kathleen Sullivan. They try to make their \nessays about the length of the original Federalist. Nelson Polsby has a \nsuccinct and devastating essay on the line-item veto.\n  Nelson Polsby, who happens to be a friend of many years, is Professor \nof Government at the University of California, Berkeley, and his many \nbooks include, most importantly in my view, his book ``Congress and the \nPresidency.'' And he writes here on the line item veto. He says:\n\n       The line-item veto would make Congress severely dependent \n     on Presidential good will. A shrewd President would not veto \n     everything but would use the line-item veto selectively, in \n     effect bribing legislators into cooperating. Americans have a \n     stake in preserving the independent judgment of Congress on \n     issues of public policy. This is not the way to do it.\n\n  ``Americans,'' I say again, ``have a stake in preserving the \nindependent judgment of Congress on issues of public policy. This is \nnot the way to do it.''\n  I should say that Mark Hatfield, our coplaintiff, is using this text \nin his seminars back in Oregon just now.\n  Early on in our deliberations--and I hope I will not take any liberty \nwhen I say it--a most distinguished and admired colleague, ``Mac'' \nMathias, a Senator from Maryland, who was with us so long, when this \nfirst came up commented from his long experience, ``The President won't \nveto any great number of items. He will just let it be known that he \ncan.'' And the conversation goes as follows: Senator, I know how much \nthis radiation laboratory means to that fine hospital you have worked \nso hard to develop. I know how much it means to the health of the \nAmerican people, to science, to medicine. But, you know, Senator, \nexpanding NATO is a very important issue to me. And I hope that if I \nunderstand your needs, and I feel your needs, you will understand mine, \nand surely you will. Can we have that understanding as responsible \npersons in Government?\n  Well, that kind of trading goes on and is meant to go on. That's what \nchecks and balances are about. But not with the threat of an \nunconstitutional act to change a bill passed by this body and the other \nbody and sent to the President, take something out of it, and the bill \nthat in consequence never passed either body becomes law. That violates \nthe Constitution's ``single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered \nprocedure,'' as the Court in INS versus Chadha called the presentment \nclause of article I.\n  Now if you want to do that, fine. Amend the Constitution. But you \ncannot amend the Constitution by statute.\n  I do not want to go on because there are so many distinguished \npersons in the Chamber, and the Senator from West Virginia, our teacher \nin these matters, is being very patient. But simply to say, as Mr. \nCollender says in this morning's Washington Post, this will never save \nany money. What will happen is, as Mr. Polsby says in his essay, it \nsimply shifts power from the legislative branch to the executive \nbranch. And it does so in a manner that Justice Stevens in the Supreme \nCourt not 4 months ago said is unconstitutional. More I do not know \nwhat need\n\n[[Page S11179]]\n\nbe said. The Congress could do itself a great service by passing \nSenator Byrd's legislation. Then we would have a real test of political \nreality. Would that bill be signed or vetoed? We do not know, but one \ngood way to find out is simply to adopt this direct and simple \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I will not go on, but I ask unanimous consent that at \nthis point in my remarks, that there be printed in the Record the text \nof the four pages by Nelson W. Polsby on the line-item veto as \npublished in the New Federalist Papers.\n  There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the ``New Federalist Papers'']\n\n        On the Distinctiveness of the American Political System\n\n                         (By Nelson W. Polsby)\n\n       Americans of a certain age will remember that at the first \n     opportunity after the Allied victory in World War II, the \n     voters, fed up, so it was said, with meat shortages and the \n     privations of war, threw out a large number of incumbent \n     congressmen and elected a new majority. The nation embarked \n     upon a decade or so of jitters focused upon problems of \n     domestic security. The Truman administration, under severe \n     Republican pressure, launched a loyalty/security program. \n     Senator Joseph McCarthy, with his careless charges of \n     communism in government, flourished.\n       This, evidently, is the way Americans celebrate global \n     victories. Neither the dismantling of the Soviet empire nor \n     the meltdown of the Soviet Union itself seems to have \n     convinced Americans of the possible virtues of their own \n     political system. Rather, complaints about the way the United \n     States is governed have never been louder or more insistent, \n     as ``malaise'' has given way to ``gridlock,'' and gridlock to \n     ``funk'' as the most fashionable way to describe a system the \n     chief feature of which is held to be an inability to cope. If \n     presidents and leaders of Congress, Democrats and \n     Republicans, talk this way, never mind advocates of one or \n     more third parties, must they not be right? After all, a key \n     test of the viability of any political system surely must be \n     the willingness of political elites to defend it.\n       On these grounds alone, the American political system is in \n     plenty of trouble. But a nagging doubt intrudes. One wonders \n     whether the bashing of the political system has been used for \n     narrow partisan purposes and whether, also, it is simply ill-\n     informed.\n       The American government is not easy to grasp. Most nations \n     are much smaller than the United States, with less space, \n     fewer people. The Western democracies with which the United \n     States is most commonly compared have one-third (Germany) to \n     one-fifth (United Kingdom, France) the population of the \n     United States, and some comparison nations (Sweden, 9 million \n     people; Switzerland, 7 million; Denmark or Israel, 5 million) \n     are even smaller. Only a few of the world's political \n     systems--China, India, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil--have \n     anywhere near the population of the United States, and most \n     of the larger nations--perhaps half our size, like Nigeria, \n     Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Mexico--are governed by tiny groups \n     of bureaucrats, military leaders, families, or cliques of the \n     educated. Thus, even when the political system embraces many \n     people, only a few inhabit the top in the nations as large or \n     larger than the United States. Most democracies of medium \n     size have political classes that are by U.S. standards small.\n       In the United States, responsibilities for public policy \n     are not concentrated in a few hands but are spread to dozens \n     of different places. Take transportation policy. Roads and \n     their policing are devolved functions of the several states, \n     and the fifty states parcel large chunks of authority out \n     even further to cities, towns, and boroughs within their \n     jurisdictions. To be sure, some transportation policy is made \n     in Washington, for example, the rules governing Amtrak or air \n     traffic control. But the licensing of vehicles, the control \n     of on-street parking, the maintenance of roads and ports, the \n     routing of buses, the building of subways--in short the vast \n     bulk of the gigantic enterprise of American public \n     transportation policy--can be fathomed only by traipsing \n     around the country and looking at the disparate detailed \n     decisions and varied decisionmakers who fix the prices of \n     taxi medallions in New York City and plow the snow off the \n     roads in Minnesota and provide for the coordination of rapid \n     transit routes and schedules in the San Francisco Bay area.\n       Transportation is only one policy area. There are dozens \n     more, some the responsibility exclusively of national \n     government, some all local, some mixed. These matters are \n     much easier to sort out, and to track, in smaller and less \n     heterogeneous nations, and in nations with unitary \n     constitutions. Federalism, just illustrated in the field of \n     transportation, is embedded in the American Constitution and \n     is one source of the spread of governmental authority, but \n     only one source.\n       Consider next the separation of powers, a means of \n     organizing government at the center of the political system \n     where power is shared among executive, legislative, and \n     judicial branches, all for some purposes mutually dependent, \n     for other purposes independent of one another. Consider \n     Congress, the world's busiest and most influential national \n     legislature. Proposals go in the door of Congress and \n     regularly emerge transformed by exposure to the complexities \n     of the lawmaking process. Unlike parliamentary bodies that \n     run on the Westminster plan, Congress is an entity \n     independent of the executive branch. Its members are elected \n     state by state, district by district, by voters to whom they \n     are directly responsible. Members are expected to have \n     opinions about public policies, to respond to the concerns of \n     their constituents, and to participate as individuals in the \n     making of laws.\n       To be sure, Congress has its division of labor; not every \n     member sits on every committee. And who within Congress gets \n     what primary responsibilities is orchestrated by partisan \n     caucuses and party leaders. So the fate of any particular \n     proposal depends greatly on where it is sent--to which \n     subcommittees and committees, superintended by which members. \n     Congress cannot have strong party responsibility without \n     sacrificing some of the advantages of this division of labor, \n     which allows committee specialists to acquire authority over \n     the subject matter in their jurisdictions by learning over \n     time about the substance of public policy. Federalism \n     supports the separation of powers by giving members of \n     Congress roots in their own communities, where local \n     nominating procedures for Congress lie mostly beyond the \n     reach of the president, and of central government.\n       Beside these two interacting constitutional features--\n     federalism and separation of powers--sits a strong judiciary, \n     fully empowered to review acts of political branches and to \n     reject those acts contradictory to the provisions of the \n     written constitution. The strength of the judiciary evolved \n     as a natural consequence of the existence of enumerated, \n     explicit rights--a Bill of Rights, in fact--that ordinary \n     citizens possess, mostly phrased as restraints on the \n     government. How can an individual citizen assert these rights \n     except through appeal to the courts? Once courts respond to \n     the piecemeal invocation of the Bill of Rights by citizens, a \n     strong and independent judiciary, and a political system \n     dominated by lawyers, is given a strong evolutionary \n     preference.\n       Many political systems have one or more of these \n     distinctive features of the American constitutional order: \n     federalism, a separation of powers, a Bill of Rights. All \n     three features, working together in the very large American \n     arena, produce a decentralized party system with its devolved \n     nominations and highly localized public policy preferences, a \n     vibrant, hard to coordinate, independent legislative branch, \n     and lawyers and lawsuits galore.\n       Giving up any or all of these distinctive features of the \n     American ``real-life constitution'' is urged mostly in the \n     interests of centralized authority and hierarchical \n     coordination. Most modern democracies, it is pointed out, do \n     without distinctively American constitutional trappings. Why \n     cannot the United States do the same? Perhaps we could if the \n     government of a smaller, more homogeneous nation were at \n     stake. But when the governed are spread far and wide, and are \n     deeply divided by race, religion, and national origin, civil \n     peace may well require political instruments sufficiently \n     decentralized to produce widespread acceptance of national \n     policies and tolerance of national politicians. Although the \n     American system is weak in forward motion, it is strong in \n     its capacity to solicit the marks of legitimacy: acceptance \n     of decisions, willingness to go along, loyalty in time of \n     emergency.\n       It is, according to this interpretation of the emergent \n     design of the Constitution, thus no accident that the one \n     major period of constitutional breakdown into civil war could \n     be understood as a matter of a failure of center-periphery \n     accommodation. Civil War-era theories of nullification, \n     states' rights, and concurrent majorities were all attempts \n     to fashion an even more developed constitution, one that \n     could contain the enormity of slavery. As this episode \n     teaches, and as observers of events in the modern world from \n     Beirut to Bosnia might attest, obtaining the consent of the \n     governed when the body politic is heterogeneous is no mean \n     feat.\n       American democracy, on this reading, is more democratic \n     than any of the large, complex nations in the world, and \n     larger and more complex than all of the other democratic \n     nations (save India). Proposals for change that appreciate \n     the size and complexity of the system have a better chance of \n     success than proposals that merely complain that the system \n     is sizable and complicated. Judging from the success of \n     smaller democratic nations, Madison was clearly wrong in \n     arguing that a large, extended republic was necessary to \n     prevent tyranny. But he was undoubtedly right in observing \n     that an extended republic is what the United States would \n     become. In 1787, soon after the Constitution was written, it \n     is recorded that ``a lady asked Benjamin Franklin, `Well, \n     Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy.' `A \n     republic,' replied the Doctor, `if you can keep it.' ''\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Moynihan, our most learned Member, for his eloquent statement \nin support of the legislation that I am introducing on behalf of myself \nand the\n\n[[Page S11180]]\n\nSenator from New York and the Senator from Michigan. He has never \nfaltered in his opposition to the passage of legislation that would \ngive this President, any President, Democrat or Republican, line-item \nveto authority. And as he has said so many times, if this is something \nthat is going to be done, it ought to be done as the framers made \nprovision for, and that is by way of a constitutional amendment which \nwill constitute the judgment, hopefully the considered judgment, of the \nAmerican people from whom all power and authority in this Republic \nsprings. I think Senator Moynihan's reference this morning to the ``New \nFederalist Papers'' essays is timely. He was kind enough to give me a \ncopy of that volume which I have not yet had the opportunity to read \nbut which I shall very soon. And he has printed in the Record today one \nof the essays from that volume. I shall look for it in the \nCongressional Record with great interest.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I had a question----\n  Mr. BYRD. I have the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I had a couple questions for the Senator from New York \nwhenever the proper time is.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island for the purpose of his \npropounding those questions, if I may do so without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? If not, the \nSenator may proceed.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the remarks by the \nSenator from New York. I am on the other side on this issue. But \nnonetheless, it was very edifying to hear the comments that the Senator \nfrom New York had to make. Several times the Senator from New York \nsaid, if I understood correctly, that this measure, this line-item \nveto, is unconstitutional. My question is, has it been so tested? Or is \nthere anything underway to so test it? In other words, is there a case \nworking its way up through the system to challenge the \nconstitutionality of the line-item veto--which I guess we passed, was \nit last year? Was it in 1996?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. May I respond to that particular question?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Surely.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate passed the so-called Line-Item \nVeto Act on March 23, 1995. The legislation went to conference where it \nlay dormant for something like a year, and I am told that the standard \nbearer of the Republican Party in last year's Presidential election \nprevailed upon the leadership in both Houses to get this matter out of \nconference and get it passed into law so that, I assume, he, Mr. Dole, \nwould then feel that he would become the first wielder of the pen under \nthis act.\n  So the leadership went to work and on March 27--these dates are so \netched in my gray matter between my two ears that I will never forget \nthe dates. If anything ever happens to my mind and I lose my memory, I \ndaresay this will be one of the last things that will be lost. So, on \nMarch 27, 1996, the Senate stabbed itself in the back by adopting that \nconference report.\n  I have answered the Senator's question.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I might reply to my distinguished friend and \nchairman who asked, ``Who has agreed? If we assert this is \nunconstitutional, who has agreed?'' May I just read a passage from the \nopinion of the one Justice of the Supreme Court who has commented on \nthe constitutionality question? It was John Paul Stevens, 26 June, \n1997. Our complaint had been filed on January 2, the first business day \nof this year after the act took effect. He says:\n\n       The line-item veto purports to establish a procedure for \n     the creation of laws that are truncated versions of bills \n     that have been passed by the Congress and presented to the \n     President for signature. If the procedure were valid, it \n     would deny every Senator and every Representative any \n     opportunity to vote for or against the truncated measure that \n     survives the exercise of the President's cancellation \n     authority. Because the opportunity to cast such votes is a \n     right guaranteed by the text of the Constitution, I think it \n     clear that the persons who are deprived of that right by the \n     act [meaning the plaintiffs] have standing to challenge its \n     constitutionality.\n       Moreover, because the impairment of that constitutional \n     right has an immediate impact on their official powers, in my \n     judgment they need not wait until after the President has \n     exercised his cancellation authority to bring suit.\n       Finally, the same reason that the respondents have standing \n     provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the statute \n     is unconstitutional.\n\n  Now, on October 16 of this year--this month--the city of New York \nfiled suit with respect to a vetoed item in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997. New York City was joined by the Greater New York Hospital \nAssociation and two labor groups that represent hospital workers. I \nhave asked to file an amicus brief. The case is now pending in the \ndistrict court and we will hear presently from them.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator from New York for that description. \nBecause it is interesting. So, now, there is underway an appeal, \nseeking a court determination.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. By persons I described as standing before the court \nwith a broken arm.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I remember when we had the debate on this. I wasn't \ndeeply involved but I supported it. I always have. But I can only \nbelieve that there must be a stack of constitutional opinions by \nlearned lawyers, and maybe judges for all I know but certainly many \nfrom the legal profession, saying that this, indeed, is constitutional. \nIn other words, the suggestions of the difficulties and constitutional \nproblems, as outlined by the distinguished Senator from New York and \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia, are not new. In other \nwords, they foresaw what was going to happen and raised those points on \nthe floor. So I can only assume that there was all kinds rebuttal \ninformation prepared. I will confess I can't remember the debate with \nthat clarity. I certainly remember the Senator from West Virginia was \nagainst it right from the word go, that was clear, and spoke \neloquently, as did the Senator from New York.\n\n  But my question is, there must be a quantity of information or \nopinion on the other side? I can only assume.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I respond to my learned and good friend, there are \nno judicial pronouncements to the effect that this is constitutional, \nfor the simple reason that it is rather new. It was enacted by Congress \nfor the first time in 1996. But although it has never been adjudicated \nby the courts, it has been the subject of scholarly commentary. At the \ntime we debated the measure in the Senate, I cited several such \nscholarly opinions, including those of Lawrence H. Tribe of the Harvard \nLaw School, and Michael J. Gerhardt, then of the Cornell Law School, \nnow dean of Case Western Reserve Law School. I noted that in Professor \nTribe's treatise ``American Constitutional Law,'' he writes:\n\n       Empowering the President to veto appropriation bills line \n     by line would profoundly alter the Constitution's balance of \n     power. The President would be free, not only to nullify new \n     Congressional spending initiatives and priorities, but to \n     wipe out previously enacted programs that receive their \n     funding through the annual appropriations policy.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Congress, which the Constitution makes the master of the \n     purse, would be demoted to the role of giving fiscal advice \n     that the executive would be free to disregard. The framers \n     granted the President no such special veto over \n     appropriations bills, despite their awareness of the \n     insistence of colonial assemblies that their spending bills \n     could not be amended once they passed the lower house had \n     greatly enhanced the growth of legislative power.\n\n  As the conference report on the Line Item Veto Act came back to the \nSenate in 1996, we asked Professor Tribe for his opinion, as Senator \nByrd will recall. He read the conference report and telephoned in the \nmorning, and he gave us this statement:\n\n       This is a direct attempt to circumvent the constitutional \n     prohibition against legislative vetoes, and its delegation of \n     power to the President clearly fails to meet the requisites \n     of article I, section 7.\n\n  I say to my friend once again, if you want to give the President this \npower, do so in the mode the Constitution provides. That is by \nconstitutional amendment. But you cannot do it by legislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend from Rhode Island. I thank my leader.\n\n[[Page S11181]]\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank again my friend, the Senator from \nNew York.\n  I have been trying to get in touch with Senator Levin, but I have \nbeen unable to do that today, so I will not add his name at this point \nuntil I can be reassured by him that he wishes to be a cosponsor. I \nhave no doubt that he will be. But I shall in due time add his name, \nand others', if they so wish.\n  Mr. President, the legislation which I am introducing is very simple. \nIt reads as follows:\n\n       The Line Item Veto Act, (Public Law 104-130), and [any] \n     amendments made by that Act [would be] repealed.\n       The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 shall be applied and \n     administered as if the Line-Item Veto Act had not been \n     enacted.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will proceed to have hearings on this \nlegislation that I am introducing on behalf of Mr. Moynihan and myself, \nand that we can generate some interest on the part of Members to \ntestify on the bill.\n  Even though there will undoubtedly be more and more cases in the \ncourts resulting from the line-item vetoes that have already occurred, \nand those that will occur in the future, I think that the legislative \nbranch should proceed to correct the grievous error that it made in \npassing the act.\n  In the meantime, I hope that the courts will also proceed. I hope \nthey will not withhold their judicial power and fail to exercise their \njudicial responsibility simply because Congress, at some point in time, \ncan itself repeal the Line-Item Veto Act.\n  The point is that, if I am correct in the way I feel about this \nlegislation, our Government is operating under an unconstitutional act \nwith respect to the appropriations process. The President is acting \nunder the presumed authority that he has been given by this nefarious \nlegislation.\n  But the act itself, I maintain, is unconstitutional. And so, feeling \nas strongly as I do about the act, I believe that I have a \nresponsibility to offer legislation to repeal it. And that is what I am \ndoing.\n  In one way or the other, hopefully, the act will be stricken by the \nCourt or repealed by the Congress. And I hope that neither body will \nwait on the other, that neither department will wait on the other to \nperform the action that would be necessary.\n  In offering this legislation, I am attempting to restore the kind of \nGovernment, with its separation of powers and checks and balances, that \nthe American people have enjoyed for over 200 years. Never before has \nCongress enacted legislation that would disturb that separation of \npowers, those checks and balances.\n  There has been some talk about it over the years. President Grant \nfirst advocated the line-item veto. And the first resolution or the \nfirst bill that was ever introduced in the Congress to provide for a \nline-item veto was introduced, interestingly enough--or perhaps \nironically enough--by a West Virginian--Charles J. Faulkner--a West \nVirginia Congressman, well over 100 years ago.\n  And since President Grant's first advocacy, most Presidents, or \nperhaps all with the exception of President Taft, have advocated the \nline-item veto.\n  President Washington, the first President of the United States, \nindicated unequivocally--unequivocally--that any President, under the \nConstitution, had to accept legislation in toto. The President had to \nsign it in toto or veto it in its entirety. He could not pick and \nchoose provisions in a bill.\n  There have been hundreds of pieces of legislation introduced over the \nyears since the administrations of President Grant that would provide \neither for a constitutional amendment or provide legislation, such as \nwas the case in this instance, to give the President the line-item veto \nauthority.\n  I have listened to the arguments over the years. And what I said \nwould happen has come true. There is considerable turbulence now. I \nsaid that the outcome of this legislation, if it ever became law, would \nbe that the relations between the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch would be hurt, that it would prove to be bad for the country, \nthat tensions which normally exist and were expected to exist between \nthe branches of Government--expected by the framers to exist--those \ntensions would be intensified, and they have been.\n  There has been considerable turbulence on Capitol Hill as a result of \nthe President's having exercised his line-item veto--this new tool, \nthis new and polished, sharp-edged Damocles' sword that now hangs by a \nslender hair over the head of every legislator on Capitol Hill.\n  We have given the President a political tool. We have given him a \nweapon by which he can expect to cower any or all of us and by the \nthreat of the use of that sword which hangs over our collective heads, \nhe will expect to get what he wants, not only on a particular \nappropriations bill but also in connection with a particular nomination \nor treaty.\n  I have said these things time and time and time again. I have said \nthat Senators would rue the day, rue the day that they enacted \nlegislation giving to this President or any President line-item veto \nauthority. The chickens are coming home to roost. Members are already \nruing the day on which they voted to give the President this line-item \nveto. I have said time and time again that the President would use it, \nthat Members would be intimidated by it, and that, to a degree, it \nwould have an impact on our freedom of speech in this body. I am sure \nthat there are Members who will now hesitate in some instances to speak \nout against the administration because they must always carry in the \nback of their minds a remembrance that the President may exact \nretribution for words spoken in this Chamber or outside the Chamber by \nMembers in criticism of the administration. They will hesitate because \nthey will understand that the President now can wreak some vengeance. \nHe can threaten to cancel this project or to cancel that program that \naffects a particular constituency or region. It does not have to be one \nState or one congressional district, it can be an entire region and the \nveto can be used politically.\n  I am amazed at the expressions of surprise that the line-item veto is \n``being used as a political weapon.'' We need not be surprised that a \nPresident will use the item veto as a political weapon. Who is to \nblame? Not the President. We are to blame. We are supposed to be grown-\nup men and women. I am amazed, absolutely amazed, that grown-up men and \nwomen--who are expected to know something about the Constitution, are \nexpected to have read it at some point in their lives, and who should \nbe expected to retire to it from time to time and read it again or read \nportions of it--I am amazed that Members who have stood at the desk in \nfront of this Chamber and with upheld right hand, and the left hand on \nthe Bible, literally or figuratively speaking, have sworn an oath to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all \nenemies, foreign and domestic, would hand the President such a weapon \nto be used against themselves.\n  Then they have turned right around and taken that oath lightly by \nemasculating the Constitution passing the Line Item Veto Act. \nObviously, lightly.\n  Montesquieu said, when it came to the oath, the ancient Romans were \nthe most religious people in the world. They honored their oath.\n  The first consul, Lucius Junius Brutus, took office in the year 509 \nB.C., that being the date when the Roman republic was first \nestablished. Lucius Brutus was purported to be a distant ancestor of \nMarcus Brutus, who was involved in the conspiracy to assassinate \nCaesar. Lucius Junius Brutus required the people of Rome to swear on \noath that never again would they be ruled by a king. Tarquin the Proud \nhad just been vanquished and run out of Rome, and so Lucius Junius \nBrutus, the first consul--there were two consuls but he was one of the \ntwo, and he was most responsible for the driving out of Tarquin the \nProud--felt so strongly about the matter that he required an oath on \nthe part of the Roman people that they would never again be ruled by a \nking.\n  But it wasn't long until there came to his attention information that \nhis own two sons, Titus and Tiberius, were conspiring to bring back a \nking, an Etruscan king to rule over Rome.\n  Upon receiving this information, Brutus called the people to come \ntogether in an assembly, and in the midst of the people he had his two \nsons,\n\n[[Page S11182]]\n\nTiberius and Titus, executed--his own sons--because they had violated \ntheir oaths and conspired to reinstitute the monarchy.\n  The Romans were religiously attached to the oath. They took it \nseriously. When Marcus Atilius Regulus was sent by the Carthaginians as \na prisoner back to the Roman Senate in the year 249 B.C., he went as a \nprisoner of the Carthaginians. He was a Roman consul and had been taken \nprisoner by the Carthaginians. In their efforts to secure peace and to \nhave the Romans relinquish Carthaginian prisoners, the Carthaginians \nsent an envoy to Rome to attempt to work out some arrangements whereby \nthe Carthaginian prisoners would be released and a peace pact could be \nagreed upon. The Carthaginian Government thought that if they sent this \nimprisoned Roman consul it would give the delegation more stature and \nthat the Romans would be more likely to come to an agreement.\n\n  When Marcus Atilius Regulus reached the Roman Senate he was called \nupon for his opinion concerning the matter and he told the Roman Senate \nthat in his judgment Rome would not benefit by such a treaty. And he \nsaid ``I am a chattel of the Carthaginian Government. I am their \nprisoner and I know that they will hear about what I have stated to the \nRoman Senate. I know they won't be pleased. Nevertheless, I think it \nwould not benefit my government. I'm with you in spirit. I am a Roman \nat heart. Even though I am a Carthaginian chattel, I am with you in \nspirit.''\n  The Roman Senate offered to protect him and proposed that he not \nreturn to Carthage, but he said, ``I took an oath that I would return. \nI swore to the Carthaginian Government that I would return.'' He said, \n``When I make an oath, even to an enemy, I will keep that oath.'' He \nwas conscious upon leaving Rome of the tears of his wife and children \nwho clung to him and who begged him not to return to Carthage. \nNevertheless, he felt so strongly about keeping his oath that he went \nback.\n  As he had predicted, the Carthaginians tortured him. They cut away \nhis eyelids and prepared an enclosure in which there were spikes upon \nwhich he was forced to lie, at all times, day and night. With his \neyelids cut away, the heat and light from the Sun bore fiercely upon \nhim. He lay upon his back on those spikes, and soon perished. This was \nan example of a Roman who believed in giving his life rather than break \nhis oath.\n  I am reminded again of what Montesquieu said: When it came to keeping \nthe oath, the Romans were the most religious people in the world. What \nabout us? How faithful are we in keeping our oath to support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States? Time and time again I have \npondered on this, I have reflected on this, and I have wondered as to \nhow often have Members of the Senate gone back and reread the \nConstitution, the charter of our liberties?\n  Mr. President, we should keep that oath. It is not something to be \ntaken lightly. I think if we take it seriously, we will struggle with \nour conscience and on matters such as the line-item veto and say to \nourselves: How does that fit into this Constitution? Where do I find in \nthis Constitution that the President of the United States has any \nlegislative power? Where is it?\n  Let me read for the Record section 1 of article 1, the very first \nsentence in the Constitution of the United States, in the operative \nsection. Article 1, section 1: ``All legislative powers herein granted \n* * *''\n  All legislative powers--not just some, not a few, not most \nlegislative power, but ``All legislative powers herein granted.'' Well, \nif legislative powers are not ``herein granted,'' they don't exist.\n  ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested * * *'' Not \nmay be, but ``shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.'' Not \nin the House of Delegates of West Virginia, but in ``a Congress of the \nUnited States which shall consist of a Senate and House of \nRepresentatives.''\n  There it is. It is not because I said so, but there it is in the \nConstitution. And yet with English words plainly written and with those \nwords meaning precisely what they say, we nevertheless have ears and \ncannot hear, eyes that cannot see, and apparently minds that cannot \nthink when we cavalierly give to the President of the United States a \nline-item veto with its legislative powers.\n  Now, can we do that? Can we give to the President legislative power? \nCan we give to the President legislative powers that the Constitution \nsays shall be vested only in one place--the Congress of the United \nStates? Can we, as Members, give away something that is a legislative \npower? Is it a legislative power? In the Line Item Veto Act, the \nPresident is authorized to sign a bill into law, and then, after \nsigning that bill into law, he can ``cancel,'' or repeal, parts of that \nlaw.\n  The Constitution says that the President shall faithfully execute the \nlaw. But he has just signed this bill into law and he is allowed, under \nthis nefarious piece of legislation, to go back and pick up the same \npen with which he signed an appropriation bill into law and he can \nstrike an item, he can strike two items, or he can strike many items. \nHe can strike away 5 percent of the bill, 10 percent of the bill, 90 \npercent of the bill. Of course, it is a law by then. He can strike it. \nHe can amend it. He can repeal it.\n  It is a legislative power to strike an item from an act. When a \nSenator moves to strike an item from a bill, that is a legislative act. \nHe moves to amend or he moves to strike, and that is a legislative act. \nThat is an action in the legislative process. He is exercising a \nlegislative power. That Senator will have to have a majority of the \nMembers of the Senate join in support of his motion to strike, else his \nmotion will be lost. ``Those in favor of the motion will say aye, those \nopposed to the motion will say no. In the opinion of the Chair, the \nayes have it, the ayes do have it, and the motion is agreed to.'' If \nsomebody asks for a rollcall or a division, the Chair will proceed \naccordingly. But a single Member cannot single-handedly strike any item \nfrom any bill. He has to go according to the legislative process, which \nrequires a majority of the votes--except in some few instances, which \nare set forth, in which supermajorities are required. But we are \ntalking here about the normal legislative process.\n  That Member has not yet succeeded. He can get a headline in the \npaper, but he has not yet succeeded in striking, or amending, or \ncanceling, or repealing that item.\n  He has to also have a majority of the other body, and if the other \nbody is in full attendance, as sometimes it is--there are 435 Members \nthere and he has to have 218 Members supporting him in that other body, \nand 51 in this body, with all 100 Senators present. He has to have a \ntotal of 269 votes in both Houses.\n  That is the legislative process. That is majority rule. And yet to \nthink that grown-up, intelligent, educated, responsible men and women, \nwho are the elected representatives of the people, would come here and \ncavalierly vote in such a way as to give this President, or any \nPresident, Republican, Democrat, Independent, or whatever, the power to \nunilaterally, with the stroke of a pen, strike out an item in a law; \nunilaterally, with the stroke of a pen, to amend a law; unilaterally, \nwith the stroke of a pen, to repeal what is in that law that was passed \nby a majority of the Members of both Houses of Congress--to give all \nthat power to one man, or woman, as the case may be, the President of \nthe United States is beyond all credulity.\n  It is the acme of ridiculosity to even imagine that an intelligent \ngroup of men and women in a civilized body, working under a written \nConstitution, would even think of doing it. I cannot comprehend what \nmotive may have guided a majority of men and women in these two bodies \nto prostrate themselves before any President and willingly and \nvoluntarily cede away the power over the purse that has been vested by \nthe Constitution in these two bodies, to the President of the United \nStates.\n  Men and women have died in past centuries to have that power vested \nin the hands of the elected representatives of the people. There was \nthe struggle of Englishmen, which extended over centuries of time, \nagainst tyrannical monarchs, to wrest the power of the purse away from \nthe kings and entrust it to the elected representatives of the people. \nAnd we cavalierly handed it away to the President.\n\n[[Page S11183]]\n\n  The Roman Senate was not required to yield power to Sulla. The Roman \nSenate voluntarily handed the power over the purse to Sulla and to \nCaesar. It made Caesar dictator for 10 years; then it made Caesar \ndictator for life, with all of the power of the executive and the \nlegislative and the judicial branches in his control. The Roman Senate \nwasn't required or forced to give Caesar that power; it willingly and \nvoluntarily ceded that power to him. And all of the centuries of time \nthat have come and gone since that fatal act have borne testimony to \nthe unwisdom of the Roman Senate. And history was changed as a result. \nIt had far-reaching consequences when the Roman Senate lost its nerve, \nlost its vision, lost its way, and willingly and voluntarily ceded over \nto the dictators, and later to the emperors, the power over the purse. \nFor hundreds of years the Roman Senate had had complete and \nunchallenged control over the public moneys.\n  We can also read the history of England--and we will find, as I have \nalready indicated, that Englishmen, for centuries, struggled with \nmonarchs who believed that they ruled by divine right, struggled for \nthe prize--the power over the purse. It was at the point of the sword \nthat Englishmen took from the Kings the power over the purse and vested \nit in Parliament.\n  We can see in our own colonial experience the continuing thread of \nrepresentative government, with the control of the purse being vested \nin the hands of the elected representatives of the people in the \nvarious State assemblies during the colonial period, and later when the \ncolonies became States.\n  So I am chagrined, I am puzzled, and I am disappointed that Members \nof Congress would willingly give to any President this power. That is \nwhat Congress did.\n  In looking at the letter I received from the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, Mr. Raines, yesterday, I bemusedly pondered \nagain over these words. I will insert this letter into the Record in \nits entirety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: I am writing to provide the \n     Administration's views on S. 1292, the bill Disapproving the \n     Cancellations Transmitted by the President on October 6, \n     1997.\n       We understand that S. 1292 would disapprove 36 of the 38 \n     projects that the President canceled from the FY 1998 \n     Military Construction Appropriations Act. The Administration \n     strongly opposes this disapproval bill. If the resolution \n     were presented to the President in its current form, the \n     President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the \n     bill.\n       The President carefully reviewed the 145 projects that \n     Congress funded that were not included in the FY 1998 Budget. \n     The President used his responsibility to cancel projects that \n     were not requested in the budget that would not substantially \n     improve the quality of life of military service members and \n     their families, and that would not begin construction in 1998 \n     because the Defense Department reported that no design work \n     had been done on it. The President's action saves $287 \n     million in budget authority in 1998.\n       While we strongly oppose S. 1292, we are committed to \n     working with Congress to restore funding for those projects \n     that were canceled as a result of inaccuracies in the data \n     provided by the Department of Defense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Franklin D. Raines,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. We will recall that the President had disapproved various \nprojects that had been included in the Fiscal Year 1998 Military \nConstruction Appropriations Act. The President, under his newly gained \nauthority, had disapproved 38 of the projects, In the letter, Mr. \nRaines states: ``The President used his authority responsibly to cancel \nprojects that were not requested in the budget.'' He doesn't have any \nauthority that I know of to cancel projects solely on the basis that \nthey were not requested in his budget. He can do it, of course. He has \nthe veto pen. But he is not acting on any ``authority'' that I know \nabout. It is not in the Constitution. He doesn't get any authority \nthere.\n\n  He doesn't get his authority from the Line-Item Veto Act to ``cancel \nprojects that were not requested in the budget.'' That Line Item Veto \nAct sets forth certain criteria for the guidance of the President in \nexercising the line-item veto pen. But nowhere in those criteria will \nthere be found a criterion which says that the President may ``cancel \nprojects that were not requested in the budget.'' Yet, Mr. Raines \nrefers to such authority in his letter. ``The President used his \nauthority responsibly to cancel projects that were not requested in the \nbudget.''\n  Well, I say, as I have said many times, that the administration--\nwhatever administration is in power--will see that Line Item Veto Act \nas it wishes to see it. It will read into it whatever it wants to read \ninto it. It will hear whatever it wants to hear from anonymous \nbureaucrats working in the subterranean tunnels of the White House who \nwill advise the President as to what should be stricken by the veto \npen. We can trust them to expand upon the power that has been given \nthem in the act. And they will read into it and interpret the words, \nand constantly be expanding their power. I predicted that that would be \nthe case.\n  Mr. President, I hope with this legislation to be able to remove that \nsword of Damocles that we ourselves helped to suspend over our unlucky \nand graying heads. But we have nobody to blame except ourselves. I am \nnot going to blame the President if he uses that authority that we have \ngiven to him. We gave it to him without a whimper; no resistance. \nResistance? No. We eagerly gave it to him. ``Take it, Mr. President. \nTake it. Take this authority. Take this legislation. Use your veto \npen.''\n  President Reagan said we had the line item veto in every State \ngovernment. ``They have it at the State level. Give it to me. If the \nStates can have it, why can't I have it?'' I have heard that argument \nad nauseam--that if the States have the line item veto power, \ntherefore, why not have it at the Federal level? Why not let the \nPresident have the line-item veto? The Governors have it. They balance \ntheir budgets. Of course, I argued time and time again that they don't \nreally balance their budgets. They go into debt just as the Federal \nGovernment goes into debt. But we were told, ``The States have the line \nitem veto. The President should have it.''\n  Mr. President, that kind of an argument signifies and reveals a lack \nof knowledge on the part of those who use the argument. This is the \nConstitution of the United States. It is not the constitution of the \nState of West Virginia or the State of New York or the State of Alabama \nor the State of Tennessee. It is the Constitution of the United States \nof America. And this Constitution, while it contains some inhibitions \nupon certain actions by the States, does not attempt to tell the State \ngovernments how they shall legislate. It assures the States of having \nrepublican forms of government. But it does not say to any State, \n``Thou shalt not have the line item veto.''\n  The Constitution, with reference to legislative powers, speaks of the \nCongress. ``All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \nCongress of the United States which shall consist of a Senate and House \nof Representatives.''\n  There are 50 States. There are 50 State constitutions, and whatever \nany State wishes to write into its constitution as to a line-item veto \npower, there is no prohibition in this Federal Constitution against the \nState's doing it.\n  The theory and the system of separation of powers and checks and \nbalances are more finely drawn at the Federal level than at the State \nlevel. Under our Federal system, we have the separation of powers. We \nhave mixed powers. We have checks and balances. That is at the Federal \nlevel.\n  I heard a Senator say the other day, ``Well, I am disappointed that \nwhen the President exercised this veto, he didn't do as we are \naccustomed to seeing done at the State level with the line-item veto.'' \nBut, Mr. President, that Senator was talking about two entirely \ndifferent things--apples and oranges, black and white. This is a \nFederal Constitution that was meant to guide the Congress and the \nFederal departments and officers of government, and the framers very \nwisely provided a scheme whereby there would be checks and\n\n[[Page S11184]]\n\nthere would be balances. There would be the separation of powers, and \nthere would be the interweaving and overlapping of powers between and \namong the departments. That is at the Federal level.\n  The State constitutions are different. The State of West Virginia may \nhave the line-item veto. The State of West Virginia has a constitution, \nand in its legislative branch it is governed by that State constitution \nuntil and unless the State takes actions that violate the Federal \nConstitution. But as to how the State will legislate and as to how the \nGovernor of the State will exercise his veto pen, that is entirely up \nto the State under its constitution. There can be 50 State line-item \nvetoes. But those are State constitutions. Those are State governments.\n  We are talking about the Federal Constitution. Why Senators haven't \nbeen able to distinguish between the State and Federal governments. I \ncan't understand. I thought they would have learned that in their \ncivics classes long, long ago. But they should have learned it back in \nthe elementary schools. There are 50 State governments. There is one \nFederal Government. Each is supreme in its own sphere of actions. But \nif there is any conflict, the Federal Government--the Federal \nConstitution--will then prevail. It is that simple. One doesn't have to \nbe a Phi Beta Kappa to know that. Yet, Senators, many of them, and many \nMembers of the other body, in explaining their support for this ill-\nadvised, unwise piece of legislation, took the stand and said, ``My own \nState has it. It works well there. I think that the Federal Government \nshould have it''--thus displaying an amazing lack of knowledge of the \nConstitution, an amazing lack of knowledge of constitutional history, \nan amazing lack of knowledge of American history and the history of \nEngland.\n  The Framers of the Constitution were very well aware of the colonial \nexperience and what had happened in England. They knew that a king had \nhad his head severed from his body on January the 30th of 1649. Imagine \nthat. Parliament created the High Court of Justice which concluded that \nCharles I was a tyrant, a traitor, and an enemy of the good people of \nEngland, and that he should have his head severed from his body. That \ncourt was created on January 6, 1649, and 24 days later King Charles \nwas dead. He was executed in front of his palace at White Hall before \nthousands of people. He and his father, James I, had believed that \nkings ruled by divine might and that they were above Parliament and \nabove the people.\n\n  So it is out of that history that the liberties and freedoms of the \nAmerican people were born. And they are written down and guaranteed in \nthis Constitution.\n  But I have said these things many times, and, no doubt, if the Lord \nlet's me live and keep my voice, I shall have the opportunity to say \nthem again on several occasions.\n  I feel so strongly about this. The Congress of the United States has \nnever, never committed such an act as it committed in enacting the \nline-item veto. That action flew in the face of the plain English words \nthat are in this Constitution. And Congress did it nonchalantly; \ncavalierly. Was it being guided by the Constitution? No. Was it being \nguided by the polls? Apparently. Because it was a popular thing. The \nAmerican people believed by a tremendous majority that the line-item \nveto was to be desired.\n  It won't reduce the national debt. I say to Senators, take a good \nlook at the budget after this year and after next year, if, God forbid, \nthis ill-advised piece of legislation still governs the legislative \nprocess. The savings that accrue from the line-item veto will indeed be \nmeager\n  I read in the newspapers where the President said he was saving X \namount of dollars by these vetoes. Well, he cut out a little item in \nWest Virginia. ``Ah, that's why Senator Byrd is against the line-item \nveto. There it is. He likes his pork. That's why he is opposed to \nthis.''\n  Well, I am not going to ask the President for it back, and if I did, \nhe could not put the vetoed item back. He has cut off its head. He \ncannot breathe new life into that stiff and cold corpse. After having \ncommitted the act of execution, after having wielded the ax, he cannot \nput it back. I have seen something here and there in the newspapers to \nthe effect that the administration would be willing to negotiate with \nSenators to restore such vetoed projects. Well, Mr. President, use your \npen. Veto the item in West Virginia. There will be other bills coming \nto you. There will be other items for West Virginia.\n  The President's advisers may say, perhaps you can get Senator Byrd to \nnegotiate with you if you tell him you won't veto that piece of pork. \nPerhaps he will vote for your nominee for such and such a position or \nhe will vote for such and such a treaty or he will vote with you on the \nfast-track bill. Just tell him that you don't want to line-item veto \nthose West Virginia items, that West Virginia pork. Senator Byrd may \nthen come to his senses.\n  Well, I say go to it. ``Lay on, Macduff; and damned be him that first \ncries `hold, enough.''' I am not negotiating with any administration \nover any item for West Virginia.\n  So much for that. So much for the suggestion that Senator Byrd's pork \nfor West Virginia is why he is against this line-item veto. Well, \nperish the thought. That has never guided my thinking. I feel more \nstrongly about what the Congress has done in enacting this piece of \ntrash, the line-item veto, than I do about all of the pork that those \nhollows could possibly hold among the high and majestic mountains of \nwhat I consider to be the greatest State in the Union, whose motto is \n``Moutaineers are always free.''\n  Mr. President, could the Senate of the United States give away its \nadvice and consent power? No. Could the Senate of the United States \ngive away its power to try impeachments? No. There are other powers in \nthe Constitution that this Senate and the Congress, as the case may be, \ncannot give away. And I maintain that the same is true with the \nlegislative power that is set forth in the first sentence of the \nConstitution.\n  There are those who would be willing to sit down with the White \nHouse, with the representatives of the President, on items that he may \nthreaten to veto. There are Senators, there are Members of the House, \nwho may be willing to sit down and negotiate with the White House, to \ncome to terms, as it were, to yield to the administration on this \nmatter or that matter, or some aspect of the appropriation which he has \nthreatened to veto. There will be those who may very well be lured by \nthe siren call of negotiation in order to save the project of a \nparticular Member of the Senate or House of Representatives.\n  I say to my colleagues, don't negotiate, because when an item has \nreached the stage of conference, I think that we have reached a stage \nwhen it is too late to negotiate.\n  Some subcommittees spend weeks and months in studying appropriations \nbills that come under their jurisdiction. The people who sit on a \nparticular subcommittee that has jurisdiction over a particular \nappropriation bill are, for the most part, experts in the subject \nmatter of that appropriations bill. Some have had experience for years \nand years, perhaps even decades, in dealing with that particular \nappropriation. They know the subject matter well. They have worked over \nit. They have had their staffs work on it. They have received the \nbudgets that have been submitted by the President. They already know \nwhat the wishes of the administration are. And from time to time they \nreceive further guidance as to the wishes of the administration with \nrespect to a particular project or program, or with respect to all of \nthe items in the President's budget that are within the jurisdiction of \nthat subcommittee. They have had all that guidance all along and it has \nbeen good. And we welcome that guidance.\n  But once the subcommittees go through all of these months of labor, \nand with their staffs working hard on legislation, it is too late when, \nat the last minute, the White House sends its representatives up to \nCapitol Hill and says, ``This is veto bait. That item is veto bait. \nThat project is veto bait. The White House will not accept it. The \nWhite House wants thus and so. That wasn't in the President's budget.''\n  Where in the Constitution are we told that the Congress may only \nconsider items that are in the President's budget? Is that inscribed in \nany law,\n\n[[Page S11185]]\n\nthat Congress may only consider items that are in the President's \nbudget; that Members of Congress can't add items of their own, based on \nthe needs of their own constituents, needs which they, the elected \nrepresentatives, know best? Where is it written that Congress has to be \nconfined only to the items that are in the President's budget? Where is \nthat set down in stone? I have never seen it in stone or in bronze, or \ninscribed upon any piece of granite. It just isn't there.\n  I am not willing at that point, then, to sit down and be jerked \naround by any administration, Republican or Democrat. They are all the \nsame, as far as I am concerned, when it comes to this matter that we \nare discussing.\n  I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee for 6 years. I said, \n``There will be no politics in here, no partisanship.'' When Senator \nHatfield was chairman of the committee there was no partisanship. When \nSenator Stennis was chairman of the committee we didn't have politics \nin the committee. As far as I am concerned, there are no Democrats and \nno Republicans on the Appropriations Committee. We are all Members of \nthe Senate and there is no partisanship. If they want to argue over \npolitics they can do it on the floor, but we don't do it in that \ncommittee.\n  And I feel that Members have just as much right under the \nConstitution and laws of this land, its customs, traditions and \nregulations--just as much right as any administration has to request \nappropriations for projects and programs that are deemed to be in the \ninterests of the constituencies of the elected representatives.\n  So I will not hear--I have ears, but will not hear those who exhort, \n``That little item you have in West Virginia is veto bait.'' I say, \n``Go ahead, go ahead, veto it. Lay on, Macduff.'' That's the way I feel \nabout the projects of other Members.\n  I want to help the President where I can help him. I want to help the \nadministration where I can help it. There have been times when I have \nhelped Republican administrations and Republican Presidents. But this \nis one Senator who will not be persuaded or swayed by threats that, \n``That item is veto bait. You'll have to modify it, you'll have to do \nit our way or the President will veto it.''\n  So, Senators, don't negotiate. In so doing we legitimize what I \nconsider to be an illegitimate end run around the Constitution of the \nUnited States. We legitimize it. That's where the administration wants \nus. That's where they would like to have us--under their thumb. ``Oh, \nwe've got them now, they are negotiating.''\n  Finally, just a word more about the letter that I received yesterday \nfrom Director Raines, the Executive Office of the President. It says in \nthe last paragraph, ``While we strongly oppose S. 1292''--we? Who is \n``we''? I wish the President would have signed the letter himself. But \nI understand he can't sign all the mail that goes out of his office. I \nknow who is purportedly the author of the letter. But, nevertheless it \nsays:\n\n       While we strongly oppose S. 1292, we are committed to \n     working with Congress to restore funding for those projects \n     that were canceled as a result of inaccuracies in the data \n     provided to the Department of Defense.\n\n  Now, in saying that, the President, through his surrogate, admits \nthat some of the projects were canceled based on errors, based on \ninaccuracies, based on data that were inaccurate and provided by the \nDepartment of Defense. The administration was mistaken in exercising \nthe veto pen, and they admit it there.\n\n  I would like for any Senator within the range of my voice, or anybody \nelse, to tell me how Mr. Raines, or the President, or anybody in the \nadministration, expects to, ``restore funding for those projects that \nwere canceled as a result of inaccuracies in the data provided by the \nDepartment of Defense.'' Mr. Raines says that we--I assume that he \nmeans by ``we,'' the personal pronoun ``we,'' I assume he means the \nPresident and the administration, ``we''--``While we strongly oppose \n[this disapproval resolution] * * * we are committed to working with \nCongress to restore funding for those projects that were canceled. * * \n*''\n  Now, how is the funding going to be restored? Those projects are \ndead. The head has been severed, the corpse has been laid out on a \npiece of cold marble and every drop of blood has been drained from the \nveins of those projects. How, then, do they propose to restore funding? \nHow is it going to be done? The item has been canceled. The President \nhas unilaterally exercised a legislative act and unilaterally repealed \nthat legislation. It is dead. That project is dead. The line-item veto \ndoes not give the President the authority to restore it. It may have \nbeen an item that he canceled 5 minutes after he had signed the bill \ninto law. He may have slept on it a while and then overnight thought, \n``Well, I think it might be a good idea to cancel a few more of those \nitems,'' and he cancels a few more. And the third day after the bill \nhas become law, some of his aides come to him and say, ``Mr. President, \nwe think we have found some more. We didn't find it written in the four \ncorners of the appropriations bill, we found it in a table. We found it \nin a committee report.''\n  These aides will say to the President, ``You know what? We have been \nworking 36 hours and we find projects on these tables that are not in \nthe bill. Don't look in there, Mr. President. But there are tables that \nwere used in some hearings, or used during markup. And in those tables \nwe have found some more items that we think you ought to consider \nvetoing,'' and the President goes back and he vetoes them. Then along \ncomes the 5th day, the 23rd hour and the 59th minute, and the President \nthinks, ``Ah, that Bob Byrd, he said one day, he wouldn't negotiate. \nCan you find another item for me? I want to strike one of his projects. \nI'll make him rue the day he said those words.''\n\n  In any event, those items are gone. The President cannot go back and \nrestore them, no matter how sorry he may be. He finds from the \nDepartment of Defense data that he was mistaken; the data were wrong. \nIt is too late.\n  So how does Mr. Raines intend to work with Congress to restore \nfunding for those projects that were cancelled? Tell me how? How do \nthey intend to restore funding? They can't be restored by inoculation, \nby the use of a needle. How do they intend to restore funding?\n  As I was saying earlier, they claimed that they saved x millions of \ndollars through these cancellations, but Senators should watch. That \nproject that they struck out of that bill for West Virginia this year, \nI intend to try to put it back next year, because it can be justified. \nIt is important to the defense of this country. It is in the 5-year \nplan of the Department of Defense. I intend to put it back in.\n  That may be a year away. So, have they saved money? How much does one \nsubtract from the figures that they say they save through their \nactions, through the President's actions in line-item vetoing these \nprojects? As we look back a year from now, how much will they have \nsaved when some or most of the items will have been put back into the \nbills we pass next year\n  Many of the projects will be put back, so the President's veto of \nprojects really won't constitute savings after all. What it will result \nin is perhaps increased costs because of inflation or other reasons; \nthe items will cost more when they are put back.\n  Therefore, while it warms the cockles of my heart to see in the \nletter from Mr. Raines that ``the administration is committed to \nworking with Congress to restore the funding for those projects that \nwere canceled,'' I shall go home wondering what is meant by that, how \nthey will work with Congress to restore the funding. How will they do \nit?\n  Mr. President, I hope that by introducing legislation today to \nrestore the legislative branch to the standing and the stature that it \nhas had for over 200 years, I hope to contribute to the welfare of my \ncountry, the well-being of our people, the perpetuation of the dream of \nAmerica and the dream of a system that has its roots, not just in \nPhiladelphia in the year 1787, but also in the colonial experience, and \nthe history of England, roots that extend back, yes, as Montesquieu \nthought, even to the ancient Romans.\n  I hope that we will restore the system which was given to us by our \nforebears and which they expected us to hand on to our sons and \ndaughters.\n\n       Who saves his country saves all things, saves himself and \n     all things saved do bless him.\n       Who let's his country die let's all things die, dies \n     himself ignobly, and all things dying curse him.\n\n\n[[Page S11186]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, let us act and let us work to save our country!\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article in the Washington Post titled \n``Line-Item Veto Tips Traditional Balance of Power'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 1997]\n\n Line-Item Veto Tips Traditional Balance of Power--Capitol Hill Plots \n                  Strategy To Counter President's Pen\n\n                   (By Guy Gugliotta and Eric Pianin)\n\n       On Oct. 6, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) invited President \n     Clinton to lunch at Montana's Malmstrom Air Force Base's \n     dining hall, a broken-down wreck whose ``serving areas,'' he \n     said later, ``would be borderline'' on a health inspection.\n       Clinton had just used his new line-item veto power to \n     strike the dining hall's proposed $4.5 million rehab from one \n     of the annual spending bills, and Burns, a senior member of \n     the Senate Appropriations Committee with enormous \n     responsibility for military construction projects, told \n     Clinton he was ``disappointed'' by the decision. He wanted to \n     discuss it ``and other important projects'' at ``your \n     convenience.''\n       The advent of the line-item veto has shaken the 200-year-\n     old power relationships in the federal government. While \n     presidents have always paid close attention to their own \n     priorities, the veto has given them an unprecedented ability \n     to micromanage the appropriations process.\n       White House sources say the line-item veto has provoked a \n     blizzard of letters and phone calls from Congress to Clinton, \n     touting the merits of tiny projects that until this year were \n     tucked so deeply into appropriations bills that they scarcely \n     merited a presidential glance.\n       Thus Burns, chairman of the Senate's military construction \n     subcommittee, lost his own project in his own bill. Burns \n     shrugged off the snub, but said, ``We haven't given up on \n     this.'' The Malmstrom rehab, he said, is included in \n     legislation to override the veto that the Appropriations \n     Committee approved yesterday.\n       Micromanaging projects may be the most obvious evidence of \n     the new executive presence in Congress's business, but many \n     experts and lawmakers believe it may be only the tip of the \n     iceberg. Both Republicans and Democrats worry presidents may \n     use the veto to extract promises of support on unrelated \n     legislation, exact revenge against political enemies or to \n     make policy, leaning on individual lawmakers where they are \n     most vulnerable--tending to their home town affairs.\n       ``It's not lost on me that this has political overtones, \n     but that's fine, it comes with the territory,'' said Sen. \n     Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), a conservative, who, like Burns, lost \n     a military construction project to the veto pen. ``If you're \n     a big boy, you take your lumps and go after them next year.''\n       But many lawmakers have decided not to sit still, and \n     budget mavens on Capitol Hill are brainstorming ways to \n     counter or cope with the veto. Some appropriators are talking \n     about legislative mechanisms to immunize particular items; \n     others are suggesting that obvious veto bait be jettisoned \n     from the final versions of bills.\n       Others see the veto as a precedent-setting escape mechanism \n     that could be used to break deadlock on controversial \n     appropriations bills. They say the president could veto \n     provisions he opposes, but let the rest stand, thus averting \n     the danger of a government shutdown or the need for an \n     interim spending measure based on the previous year's \n     expenditures. Congress has yet to clear six of the 13 annual \n     spending bills, three weeks after the start of the fiscal \n     year.\n       Still, cautioned House Appropriations Committee Chairman \n     Bob Livingston (R-La.), it is too early to predict what will \n     happen. ``When the president signed the line-item veto \n     legislation we were all shooting in the dark as far as how it \n     would work. We are still groping.''\n       One thing on which almost everyone interviewed could agree, \n     however, was that the line-item veto would not serve as a \n     significant brake on federal spending, even for parochial \n     ``pork-barrel'' projects. Of the five appropriations bills \n     signed so far, only $458 million in projects has been lined \n     out by Clinton, or less than a percentage point of the $291.3 \n     billion in the bills.\n       ``The line-item veto is never going to be a deficit \n     reduction tool, and you think they [Congress] would have \n     realized it when they gave it to the president,'' said \n     Stanley E. Collender, an expert on federal spending issues. \n     ``It's a raw exercise in power.''\n       The line-item veto, a pillar of the House Republicans' \n     ``Contract With America,'' passed both houses of Congress \n     overwhelmingly and was signed into law in early 1996.\n       It took effect during the budget year that began Oct. 1.\n       The law has been challenged in court for radically altering \n     the balance of power within the federal government without \n     the enactment of a constitutional amendment. Many experts \n     believe the law will be struck down, but until it is, the \n     president for the first time in history may delete individual \n     spending items from appropriations bills without vetoing the \n     entire bill.\n       Clinton first used the authority in August to veto three \n     provisions from the five-year omnibus budget agreement, but \n     it was not until Oct. 6, when he struck 38 projects worth \n     $287 million from Burns's military construction \n     appropriations bill, that he caught Congress's attention.\n       ``He had to convince everybody he was willing to use it,'' \n     Collender said.\n       Lawmakers were convinced. The vetoes touched off an uproad \n     among congressional leaders who had not been consulted in \n     advance. ``We're dealing with a raw abuse of political power \n     by a president who doesn't have to run again,'' thundered \n     Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-\n     Alaska).\n       But since the military construction vetoes, Clinton has \n     used the authority sparingly on three other appropriations \n     bills, prompting speculation in some quarters that he had \n     become gun shy after the initial upheaval.\n       Just yesterday, Office of Management and Budget Director \n     Franklin D. Raines acknowledged that several projects were \n     mistakenly crossed out of the military construction bill. In \n     a letter to Stevens, Raines said, ``We are committed to \n     working with Congress to restore funding for those projects \n     that were canceled as a result of inaccuracies in the data \n     provided by the Department of Defense.''\n       ``This is clearly evolving,'' said Senate Budget Committee \n     staff director G. William Hoagland. ``Maybe like the kid in \n     the candy store, his eyes were bigger than his stomach, and \n     now he sees he has to be careful not to jeopardize the \n     power.''\n       But OMB spokesman Lawrence J. Haas said there was no \n     ``pattern'' of political manipulation. The president, he \n     said, was trying to use the veto ``because of the substance \n     before him, not because of the politics.''\n       A crucial test may come next week when Clinton will examine \n     the Veterans Affairs-Housing and Urban Development and \n     independent agencies appropriations bill. Lawmakers \n     acknowledge it is full of special projects, and one White \n     House source described the bill as ``one of the most project-\n     based in years.''\n       Despite uncertainty about how Clinton will next use the \n     veto, it is clear that Congress is wary and mistrustful. \n     ``I've never seen a vote taken where more people wanted their \n     vote back,'' said House Appropriations Committee member Rep. \n     Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), who opposed the line-item veto.\n       Indeed, hundreds of lawmakers have been contacting the \n     White House since the military construction bill. Burns and \n     Santorum wrote to complain about vetoes already exercised and \n     to warn of adverse consequences to military readiness.\n       Florida Sens. Bob Graham (D) and Connie Mack (R), by \n     contrast, wrote a joint letter stressing the need for $1 \n     million to establish a Central Florida High Intensity Drug \n     Trafficking Area. ``We would request that you keep in mind \n     the importance of the Central Florida HIDTA to the national \n     war on drugs and to us personally as you consider the Fiscal \n     Year 1998 Treasury Appropriation,'' the letter said. The line \n     item survived.\n       Among those who lost favored projects, Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-\n     Calif.) was still steamed a week after Clinton vetoed his \n     district's $4 million breast cancer research grant. And he \n     spoke of exacting a penalty--suggesting he might oppose \n     Clinton in his efforts to obtain ``fast-track'' authority to \n     negotiate trade agreements. ``I don't like to link things,'' \n     he said, but ``there is a two-way street here.''\n       Collender cautioned that in the revenge game, ``the \n     president holds all the cards.'' A member may withhold one \n     vote, but he will lose on another bill or be embarrassed on \n     another line-item, Collender said. ``The president may lose a \n     battle, but he will win the war.''\n       Most lawmakers, however, agreed with former Congressional \n     Budget Office director Robert D. Reischauer, who described \n     veto gamesmanship as ``a two-edged sword. The more influence \n     the president tries to exert, the more of a backlash he will \n     see. We have already seen it.''\n       Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) used the line-item veto as his \n     state's governor, but voted against the federal line-item \n     veto. He said it gave the president too much power, \n     suggesting he could use it to trade projects for votes. ``Now \n     the president is going to say, `I want X,' would you help me? \n     And the answer will be, `Yes, but what are you going to do \n     for me this year?'''\n       This is one way the president can make policy with the \n     line-item veto. Another way is to veto items that effectively \n     eliminate entire programs. Clinton has already done this by \n     striking our $39 million for the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, \n     said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). ``They never wanted to keep \n     it.''\n       McCain, a dedicated cost-cutter who has criticized Clinton \n     for not being aggressive enough with the veto, nevertheless \n     cautions against ``politicizing'' the process and permanently \n     poisoning relations between the two branches of government.\n       As for those who complain about the veto, McCain noted that \n     many lawmakers spent years fighting for it when a Democratic \n     Congress remained adamantly opposed. ``To my Republican \n     colleagues, I say, `Be careful what you ask for. You may get \n     it.'''\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on the modified committee amendment to S. 1173, the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act:\n\n         Trent Lott, John Chafee, John Ashcroft, Larry Craig, Don \n           Nickles, Mike DeWine, Frank Murkowski, Richard Shelby, \n           Gordon Smith, Robert Bennett, Craig Thomas, Pat \n           Roberts, Mitch McConnell, Conrad Burns, Spence Abraham, \n           and Jesse Helms.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, I have just filed the \nlast cloture motion to the highway bill. This cloture vote will occur \non Tuesday. If cloture is not invoked on Tuesday, I will have to ask \nthe Senate then to move on to other items.\n  Needless to say, I hope cloture will be invoked on Tuesday. I know \nthere are some Senators who have voted against cloture three times who \nintend to vote for it if this is going to be the last one. I have, as \nmajority leader, basically given 2 weeks to opening statements and a \npreliminary discussion about the highway bill while we tried to see if \nother issues could be resolved. But unless we can get cloture invoked \nand I can unstack the tree of amendments and allow us to go forward \nwith full debate and amendments on ISTEA, if this matter is going to \ncontinue to be held up at the insistence of Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold because of the campaign finance reform issue, then I have no \nalternative but to stop.\n  I really think that is unfortunate. I think the Senate was showing \nleadership by moving on to the ISTEA highway bill. The Environment and \nPublic Works Committee came up with a good bill. It was reported \nunanimously from the committee. I think we would show leadership to \npass the 6-year bill whereas the House had only passed a 6-month \nextension. I think it would be better for the country if we did this \nbill now. I think it would be better for the Senate if we did it now. I \nthink that next spring or next summer or, heaven forbid, next fall, if \nwe are still working on the highway bill, it will get tougher and \ntougher and tougher as more problems are developed, more amendments are \nwritten and as we get closer to elections. Every State is going to \nbelieve it has to have a little bit more, a little bit more for \nhighways and bridges. That is fine. We all need that. But we need some \nkind of closure on how we deal with the formula and what funds are \ngoing to be available to our States.\n  I think this is very unfortunate. I do not see there is any process \nnow for there even to be a short-term extension. Everything seems to be \ntied to something on campaign finance reform that we have not been able \nto develop yet. I want to emphasize to all Senators that yesterday I \nbelieved Senator Daschle and I had come very, very close to having an \nagreement worked out whereby we would consider this other, unrelated to \nthe highway bill, campaign finance issue next March, by the end of the \nfirst week in March, and that amendments would be in order and that \nthere wasn't going to be an effort to fill up the tree and that \nSenators could offer amendments, first degree, second degree, and \nmotions to table would be in order. Everything would basically go the \nregular order. But for some reason, at the last minute, interested \nSenators could not agree to that, but a very good-faith effort was made \nby Senators on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the issue, \nand it did not come about.\n  I am willing to have the Senate have this issue before it and have \none more cloture vote, but then we will have to move on.\n  I also want to emphasize that next Monday we do intend to take up \nsome important issues, including the Interior appropriations conference \nreport we have finally completed action on. If we have to, we are going \nto call for a vote on the Federal Reserve nominees that the President \nhas sent to the Senate and the Senate committee has now reported to the \nfull Senate for action. And we are going to have to take up legislation \ndealing with the threatened Amtrak strike.\n  So we will have a full plate of things to do Monday and Tuesday, and \nwe hope other appropriations bills will be ready in short order next \nweek. In fact, we had meetings this morning on two of them, the Labor, \nHHS appropriations bill--we think maybe some good progress was made \nthere, I say to the Senator from West Virginia--and we are getting \ncloser, I believe, on the foreign operations appropriations bill. So we \nhave other business that we need to do and must do, and we cannot give \nthe balance of our time to the delay of the ISTEA bill based on the \ncampaign finance reform issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11187-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the state of \nUnited States-China relations as the summit with Chinese President \nJiang Zemin approaches. President Clinton is expected to give a speech \nthis afternoon on United States-China relations, a speech that will, no \ndoubt, continue to defend the administration's policy of so-called \n``constructive engagement'' with China. The policy generally posits \nthat there is no alternative for the United States but to accommodate \nChina in virtually any behavior in hope of establishing a good \nrelationship with Beijing.\n  I want to be clear that I certainly do hope that a stable and \npositive relationship can be established between our two countries, but \nthe administration's China policy of engagement gives little regard to \nthe behavior of China and is putting the prospect of a strong \nrelationship with Beijing at risk. Rather than constructively engage \nBeijing, this administration's China policy has been advanced at the \nexpense of discarded American principles and lost United States \ncredibility in the international arena. For instance, China has a \nweapons proliferation record that is unrivaled in the world, \ndistributing weapons of mass destruction in spite of previous \nnonproliferation commitments. Beijing also maintains trade barriers \nwhich continue to block United States goods and United States companies \nfrom being involved in the kind of free and open commerce we should \nhave with China. And in the last several years, Beijing has had a human \nrights record that has resulted in the most intense religious \npersecution in several decades, and in the silencing of all active \npolitical dissidents.\n  The latest State Department report on human rights noted that all \nChinese political dissidents had been detained and imprisoned. We have \nto remind\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\nourselves that there are 1.3 billion people in China and to be without \nany political dissent in a country that large is indeed a troubling \nmatter.\n  In spite of these distressing areas in our relationship with China, \nthere is near unanimity in the administration that China must be \nembraced, that it must be accommodated, that it somehow must be \nhonored. Betraying our country's history of leadership in defense of \nfreedom and a stable international environment is not a way to enhance \nour relationship with China.\n  I believe a strong relationship would be based on mutual respect and \ntrust, but when we constantly compromise, when we constantly \naccommodate, and when we constantly ignore violations by the Chinese of \ntheir responsibilities in the international community and their \nresponsibilities to respect human rights, I believe we don't provide a \nfoundation for a good United States-China relationship.\n  Nuclear cooperation with China is one of the issues for discussion \nduring the summit, and it is an issue of particular concern to me. If \nthe President allows nuclear cooperation with China to proceed, it may \nbe the clearest illustration yet of the appeasement-at-any-cost \napproach in our present United States-China policy.\n  The President is considering giving China advanced United States \nnuclear technology in spite of the fact that a CIA report identified \nChina as the world's worst proliferator of weapons-of-mass-destruction \ntechnology. This CIA report is not a stale document. This report \nindicates that the Chinese have been the worst proliferators of weapons \nof mass destruction, and this report came out last June.\n  The report says:\n\n       During the last half of 1996, China was the most \n     significant supplier of weapons-of-mass-destruction-related \n     goods and technology to foreign countries. The Chinese \n     provided a tremendous variety of assistance to both Iran's \n     and Pakistan's ballistic missile programs. China was also the \n     primary source of nuclear-related equipment and technology to \n     Pakistan and a key supplier to Iran during this reporting \n     period.\n\n  The period the CIA report covers is the last half of 1996. In May \n1996, just before the period for the CIA report was to commence, the \nChinese made a commitment to stop their proliferation activities.\n  In the face of one of their rather notable assurances that they were \ngoing to act differently, they continued to persist in their active \nnuclear technology proliferation and the proliferation of other weapons \nof mass destruction technologies. Of course, the definition of weapons \nof mass destruction includes nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. \nIf there is any doubt as to what kind of nuclear-related equipment was \nprovided, the CIA report goes on to state:\n\n       Pakistan was very aggressive in seeking out equipment, \n     material and technology for its nuclear weapons program with \n     China as its principal supplier.\n\n  The administration says China has honored its nonproliferation pledge \nof May 1996. But let me again make clear that the CIA report covers the \nlast half of 1996, the period after China made its so-called nuclear \nnonproliferation commitment. How the administration can expect to be a \ncredible actor in the international community by saying that the \nnonproliferation commitment of May 1996 was honored, when the CIA says \nthat after May, China was the principal supplier to Pakistan of \nequipment, material and technology for a nuclear weapons program--how \nthe administration can say that is consistent with the nonproliferation \ncommitment is beyond me.\n  Since 1985, no President has been able to certify that China's \nproliferation activities meet the legal requirements that would allow \nus to start designating them as a nuclear cooperator and to extend to \nthem nuclear exports from the United States. I certainly don't believe \nChina's recent activities warrant such certification now, not in the \nface of our own Government's report that they were the worst \nproliferators of components, equipment, and technology related to \nweapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n\n  I might point out that Ken Adelman, President Reagan's Director of \nthe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and a key official involved in \nthe formulation of the original 1985 agreement, also does not believe \nthat China's recent activities warrant the certification for nuclear \ncooperation to proceed.\n  China has made several nonproliferation promises in recent weeks to \nreassure the administration. While these commitments have the potential \nto improve China's proliferation record, China has made and broken \nnonproliferation commitments for a decade. I think we should first ask \nthat China at least keep its word for some interval of time rather than \nblindly accept China's most recent nonproliferation promises even \nthough the previous ones have been broken.\n  We all know the potential for this nuclear technology to be used in a \nvariety of settings and ways. I believe China must establish its \ncommitment to nonproliferation in deeds, not just words. Chinese \ncredibility should be established before nuclear-related trade takes \nplace between the United States and China.\n  The administration does not want Chinese President Jiang Zemin to \nreturn to Beijing emptyhanded. I think that is kind and generous and \nwarm hearted, but I question the need to give China nuclear technology \njust to make President Jiang happy.\n  Have we forgotten the summit itself is a major gift to President \nJiang, and why are we so anxious to make concessions to China? I hope \nthe President of the United States understands that at stake in the \nnuclear cooperation debate is the credibility of the United States in \ncombatting the global spread of weapons of mass destruction. Rather \nthan forcefully address this critical national security threat, our \nadministration apparently is downsizing our counterproliferation \napparatus and making life uncomfortable for key personnel who have \ndedicated their lives to protect our country from the spread of weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  The recent announcement of the retirement of Gordon Oehler from the \nCentral Intelligence Agency is, according to an article in the \nWashington Post, driven by the administration's disapproval of Mr. \nOehler's candor and his honesty in informing Congress of the weapons \nproliferation activity, not only of China but of other nations.\n  Is our administration so infatuated with charming China at any price \nthat we are willing to ignore the facts presented by our intelligence \npersonnel, and when the facts are troublesome to us, that we make these \nintelligence officers so uncomfortable that they resign?\n  Government personnel like Gordon Oehler should be praised and thanked \nfor helping defend our country and keeping Congress informed of rising \nthreats to our national security.\n  Mr. President, China potentially has broken every major commitment \nthat it has made concerning the production or proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction or the missile delivery systems to deliver such \nweapons. In light of China's behavior, it is difficult to understand \nwhy President Clinton is so eager to accept placebos and questionable \npromises in exchange for the transfer of valuable and potentially \ndangerous nuclear technology. The United States needs to be sober and \nvigilant in dealing with China.\n  A stable and truly constructive relationship with Beijing will be \nestablished only when our national security interests are defended and \nwhen our commitment to the principles of liberty and freedom is \npreserved.\n  There is something substantially different between our commitment to \nfreedom and liberty and what is occurring in China. President Jiang's \nremarks recently indicate that he does not believe that freedom is for \nall individuals, that freedom is something that is negotiable. He said, \n``The theory of relativity worked out by Mr. Einstein which is in the \ndomain of natural science, I believe, can be applied to the political \nfield.''\n  We in the United States believe in God-given rights that are not \nrelative, and our policy with regard to China should be a policy which \nis based on credibility and integrity. Appeasement or engagement \nwithout integrity is nothing more than a surrender of American \nprinciples.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle to which I referred earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\n                      The Aging Maoists of Beijing\n\n                           (By Michael Kelly)\n\n       It has been 12 years since the leader of the People's \n     Republic of China has honored the United States with a visit, \n     and in the meantime relations between us have become--as they \n     say--strained. It has seemed at times almost as if the aging \n     Maoists of Beijing were trying to flaunt their disdain for \n     American values and American interests. There was the ever-\n     ending campaign of torture and imprisonment against advocates \n     of political and religious liberty. There was, despite \n     Richard Gore, the continued occupation and subjugation of \n     Tibet. There was the unpleasantness at Tiananmen Square. \n     There were the arms sales and the nuclear assistance to \n     nations unfriendly to the United States. There was the \n     missile-rattling off the cost of Taiwan. There was the finely \n     calculated humiliation of Warren Christopher. There was the \n     cool, unblushing dismantling of democracy's infrastructure in \n     Hong Kong. Finally, it appears, there was the attempt to \n     subvert our very own democratic system by illegally funneling \n     PRC cash into the 1996 elections.\n       Now comes Jiang Zemin, president of China, \n     unapologetically. On the eve of his week-long American \n     journey, Jiang gave careful interviews to The Washington Post \n     and Time magazine. He told the reporters that the slaughter \n     of democracy's hopefuls at Tiananmen had been necessary for \n     China's economic boom (you can't make an omelet without \n     rolling a tank over a few hundred eggs); that Taiwan must \n     accept ``the principle that there is only one China,'' which \n     is to say rule by Beijing; that Chinese democratic activists \n     such as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan were languishing in prison \n     ``not because they are so-called political dissidents but \n     because they violated China's criminal law''; that the good-\n     hands people of Beijing would continue to hold Tibet in their \n     cossetting grasp; and that the United States must accept that \n     China has its own standards of what constitutes a proper \n     respect for democracy and human rights. ``The theory of \n     relativity worked out by Mr. Einstein, which is in the domain \n     of natural science,'' the old despot lectured, ``I believe \n     can also be applied to the political field.''\n       Quite so, say the Einsteinists in the Clinton \n     administration who are driving the China policy they call \n     ``engagement.'' Under the rules of this engagement, the \n     United States has during the past five years answered China's \n     slights and slurs with shows of affection. The Commerce \n     Department has had its way in maintaining trading status for \n     China as a most-favored nation. The State Department has kept \n     its complaints about the oppression of democrats and \n     Christians to a discreet murmur. The president himself has \n     most graciously entertained the friends of Mr. Johnny Chung \n     and Mr. John Huang. The approval for an official visit by \n     Jiang Zemin was the greatest engagement gift yet. The trip, \n     which will begin with Ziang laying a wreath for the slain of \n     1941 in Pearl Harbor, is planned as an elaborate exercise in \n     propaganda, and it is intended to serve both to ratify \n     China's post-Tiananmen diplomatic rehabilitation and to \n     solidify Ziang's domestic political status.\n       And yet, the nervous suitors at the White House fret, there \n     must be something more we can do, something really grand. \n     Indeed, it develops, there is. Jiang's government would like \n     to buy some of the new-generation nuclear reactors that have \n     been jointly developed by the American nuclear industry and \n     the government in an $870 million research project. The \n     moribund nuclear industry is desperate to sell to China, and \n     it has lobbied the administration heavily. The nuclear \n     industry has, of course, large sums at its disposal, and this \n     president is always willing to grant potential or actual big-\n     money donors what he has called ``a respectful hearing,'' so \n     there is naturally a desire at the White House to see the \n     sales go forward.\n       But there is a problem: China's impressive record in \n     spreading the advance of the bomb--a record that includes the \n     export of nuclear technology and materiel to Iran, Iraq, \n     Pakistan and India. In 1985, as Washington prepared for the \n     last Sino-American summit, the Chinese were found, in \n     violation of recent promises, to be assisting the Pakistani \n     nuclear program. As a result, Congress passed a law barring \n     implementation of the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement signed by \n     president Reagan and the then-Chinese President Li Xiannian, \n     to permit nuclear trade with China until the President \n     certified that China had stopped aiding the spread of the \n     bomb.\n       Such certification has never been given because China has \n     never changed its behavior. Gordon Oehler, the CIA's senior \n     official responsible for monitoring mass-weapons \n     proliferation, has testified to Congress that China has \n     provided Iran with large numbers of anti-ship missiles that \n     are considered a direct threat to U.S. naval forces in the \n     Persian Gulf. Oehler, by the way, resigned this week amid \n     reports that he had been under pressure from administration \n     policymakers over his unwelcome assessments.\n       The administration insists that China has--just in the nick \n     of time for a gift grand enough for a summit--changed its \n     ways. it points to two promises: one in 1996 to stop aiding \n     Pakistan's nuclear program; the other last week not to sell \n     any more anti-ship missiles to Iran. So, that's that, the \n     White House argues, it's time to certify China as a \n     respectable member of the nuclear club at last and get on \n     with the business of the United States, which is business. As \n     for human rights--if everything goes to their satisfaction \n     next week, the Chinese hint they might be willing to let Wang \n     Dan out of jail for a while.\n       This is policy so wrongheaded that it isn't even \n     interesting. It is possible that the Chinese are suddenly \n     serious about nonproliferation. And it would be nice to \n     provide some foreign business for the nuclear industry, so it \n     doesn't die from a lack of business at home. But the Chinese \n     have broken or bent most of their previous promises on issues \n     of nuclear exports, and their new promises are untested.\n       We are engaged for the moment. A responsible president must \n     not attempt to certify what he cannot know to be so; a \n     responsible Congress must stop, by a veto-proof two-thirds \n     majority, a president who puts the interests of Beijing and \n     Westinghouse ahead of national security. Let's verify before \n     we trust. And let's get something in return a little less \n     pathetic than the release of one well-beaten man from his \n     prison cell.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL assumed the chair.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11187-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11189-S11190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I noted that the White House recently \nreleased a strategy for climate change talks. The President said the \nUnited States would not assume binding obligations until developing \ncountries agree to participate meaningfully in the climate-change \nissue. White House officials said they expect requirements for \ndeveloping countries would be fleshed out in negotiations.\n  This is what concerns me, Mr. President, ``fleshed out in \nnegotiations.'' The senior Senator from West Virginia and the occupant \nof the chair, Senator Hagel, authored a resolution that has been \nsupported in this body by an overwhelming vote of 95 to 0. The Byrd-\nHagel resolution said developing nations must have targets and \ntimetables in the same timeframe as the United States.\n  Mr. President, it is my contention that the President is glossing \nover the issue of developing-country participation.\n  The Berlin Mandate says ``no new commitments for developing \nnations.'' Has the President repudiated the Berlin Mandate? Otherwise, \nhow in the world can President Clinton simply state that this is \nsomething that can be taken care of in negotiations when the Berlin \nMandate clearly says no new commitments for developing nations? Our \nPresident only says ``meaningful commitments for developing nations.'' \nI wonder what meaningful really means.\n  At this time, we are somewhat at the mercy of our negotiators on this \nmatter. We have seen comments in the Record from various members of the \nSenate praising the President's plan, stating that they are encouraged \nby the policy announcements and pleased with the White House plan. \nAnother member said that the President's position should satisfy \ndemands of the Byrd-Hagel resolution as expressed in this body.\n  Those demands are not met, Mr. President, because Byrd-Hagel says \ndeveloping nations must have targets and timetables in the same \ntimeframe as the United States. That is the test.\n  Another Senator indicates this is a green light that speaks to our \nNation's commitment to reducing greenhouse gases. I am a bottom line \nperson, a nuts and bolts kind of guy. How are we going to get there \nfrom here? How will we reach the goal the President expressed, which is \nto go back to emissions levels of 1990 by the years 2008 to 2012?\n  Let's do the math.\n  Fifty-five percent of our U.S. energy production is coal. What is \nhappening to coal? If a new climate treaty is signed, there will be \nreductions in coal use. EPA's new air quality standards on ozone and \nparticulate matter are likely to decrease coal use. EPA's tightened air \nquality standards on oxides of sulfur and nitrogen will put more \nemphasis on coal reduction. EPA's proposed regional haze rule will put \nmore pressure on coal as will any new EPA mercury emission rules.\n  So there is going to be more pressure to reduce use of the resource \nsupplying 55 percent of our electricity.\n  What about nuclear?\n  Well, the President threatens to veto our nuclear waste bill. There \nhave been no new orders for new plants in the United States since 1975. \nThere is the potential inability to recover stranded\n\n[[Page S11190]]\n\ncosts of nuclear plants in electric restructuring, so nuclear use is \nlikely to fall.\n  Nuclear is the largest carbon-free generator of power. The President \ndidn't even mention it in his plan.\n  Let us go to our next contributor--10 percent of our energy comes \nfrom hydroelectric. Yet, there are considerations in the administration \nto tear down dams. An example that has been discussed is the Glen \nCanyon Dam. If we tear down Glen Canyon, we would drain Lake Powell--\n252 square miles. That is a lake that provides the water for Los \nAngeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. It would eliminate sources of carbon-\nfree electricity for 4 million consumers in the Southwest. We would \nscuttle a $500 million tourist industry.\n  What about gas that supplies 10 percent of our power? Gas also emits \ncarbons, but not as much. Demand would increase, prices would increase, \nand shortages might result.\n  Some people say we will pick up the slack with wind and solar. I like \nwind and solar, but you can't always count on it. It is kind of \ninteresting to see the Sierra's Club announcement the other day \nopposing wind farms. They refer to them as ``Cuisinarts for birds.'' So \nthey are opposed to that.\n  So the point is, Mr. President, how do you get there from here if the \nadministration does not consider nuclear or hydroelectric? In his \nspeech, the President specifically excludes hydro from renewable \nenergy.\n  What about the rest of the world? Let me tell you what one of our \nwitnesses said at a hearing yesterday. Mr. Bill Martin, former Deputy \nSecretary of Energy, said the world is likely to increase its \ndependence on coal primarily due to energy demand in China. This \ndependence is likely to result in the doubling of sulfur dioxides in \nAsia and at least a 30-percent increase in global CO2, in \n1990 levels, by the year 2000. To reach a sustainable energy with \nrespect to carbon, the world will have to triple natural gas \nproduction, increase coal efficiencies through clean coal technology, \ntriple renewables, triple nuclear power to a worldwide total of 1,000 \ngigawatts and increase energy efficiency by at least 25 percent.\n  Mr. President, these are the real terms and conditions in the world \nthat we are living in. Nuclear energy, renewables and energy efficiency \nemerge as the only viable source to date that are emissions-free and \noffer some energy independence to nations which adopt them.\n  The point I want to make here, Mr. President, is that nuclear and \nhydro, a big part of the solution, are not addressed in the \nadministration's proposal on how to reduce emissions to the 1990 level \nby the year 2008 to 2012.\n  The witnesses at the hearings we held yesterday said you cannot get \nthere from here. You cannot physically do it unless you triple nuclear \nand the renewables, including hydro.\n  Let me conclude with one other thing. The President says we can do \nthis without a carbon tax. The Department of Energy says you need a \ncarbon permit price of $50/ton. There is no difference. There are no \nfree rides. Somebody has to pay it. If it is a carbon tax, it is $50 a \nton, and it goes to the consumer. If we set up some kind of a market in \nemissions, somebody like the Board of Trade starts trading permits, \nthey are estimated to equate to $50 a ton. Somebody is going to have to \npay for that, and that is the U.S. consumer.\n\n  Let me conclude with just one observation as we address China, as we \naddress the question of whether we should sell nuclear reactors and \ntechnology to China.\n  China has the availability of nuclear power reactors from France. \nThey have it from other nations. Canada is selling; Russia is selling. \nAnd certainly they are a nuclear power.\n  Do we want China to burn more coal? We already have a prohibition \nagainst assisting China in the development of the world's largest \nhydroelectric project. It is called the Three Gorges Dam. The Eximbank \nwill not assist.\n  Let me tell you how big Three Gorges is. That plant would produce \n18,000 megawatts, equal to 36 500-megawatt coal plants. So that is how \nChina will address some of its energy demands from carbon-free \nhydropower. But we are prohibited from participating. And we are \nprohibited from participating in their nuclear power program.\n  So I think, Mr. President, we have to be realistic. As the \nadministration comes down with its plan, again, I suggest to you that \nthe President has glossed over the issue of the developing countries' \nparticipation.\n  I suggest and remind my colleagues of the Byrd-Hagel vote that was 95 \nto 0. It said developing nations must have targets and timetables in \nthe same timeframe as the United States. And the Berlin Mandate says, \nno new commitments for developing nations.\n  So I conclude by saying the President only says ``meaningful \ncommitments for developing nations.'' And I say ``meaningful'' means \nwhat?\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11189-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President. A bright young reporter, Kevin Wallevand, \nwho covers news in Fargo, ND for WDAY television, has made my State, \nand me, awfully proud. Kevin's documentary, ``The Quilt: Hope from the \nHeartland,'' has been awarded an Emmy, television's highest award.\n  In North Dakota, we have always known that Kevin is a talented \nreporter, writer, and producer. Now, his documentary about the dark \nside of human nature that allows exploding land mines to do the work of \nwar; and the bright side of human kind, the compassion people show \ntoward one another in the aftermath of war's tragedies, has earned him \nnational acclaim.\n  Kevin Wallevand has produced a moving story about a rural community \nwhere women create by hand a beautiful, colorful quilt in the hope that \nit will warm and cheer someone less fortunate than themselves. The \nresulting quilt begins its travels near the North Dakota border on the \nBuffalo River, and ends its journey along a river in Angola, Africa \nwhere a homeless family--bodies ravaged by exploding land mines--\nclutches the quilt for warmth and safety.\n  Sadly, we learn that the family's story is not an isolated one. Kevin \ntakes us into the hospital beds of other villagers who have fallen \nvictim to landmines--who are displaced and anticipating the help and \nthe arrival of thousands of quilts, blankets and other donated items \nfrom American volunteers.\n  Hundreds of churches, like the one in Kevin's story, and other \nhumanitarian groups have taken it upon themselves to give a little \ncomfort and a little hope to landmine victims. Now we, as a country, \nowe it to them to prevent this instrument of war, which targets \ninnocent people long after the peace agreement has been signed, from \never being used again.\n  Like Kevin, I have seen first hand the tragic human costs of \nlandmines. While serving in the House of Representatives, I visited a \nclinic in Central America where landmine victims who had lost hope, \nalong with a leg or an arm, were fitted for artificial limbs. I \nwitnessed how important it was to support this program which could turn \ntheir lives around. When I returned, I worked to get funding so that \nother landmine victims might be able to get prosthetic limbs and I'm \nproud to say I helped get it done. Kevin must have\n\n[[Page S11191]]\n\nthe same kind of satisfaction--because by showing others the horrors of \nthis war against the innocent, he has struck a blow against the \nworldwide scourge of land mines. But more must be done.\n  I commend Kevin Wallevand, and the others who worked on this story at \nWDAY, for bringing this tragedy to the attention of others. Landmines \nare a worldwide problem, but with a very simple solution. We must rid \nthe world of landmines and promise future generations that this weapon \nof destruction will never be used again for warfare. In sharing this \nEmmy winning story, Kevin's work heightens our awareness of the problem \nand brings us a step closer to that ultimate goal. Congratulations to \nKevin Wallevand. You make North Dakotans very proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11190-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RURAL SATELLITE SUBSCRIBERS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to raise an issue that my \ncolleagues may have heard about, the recent decision by an arbitration \npanel convened under the auspices of the Copyright Office in the \nLibrary of Congress regarding the rates satellite carriers will pay \nunder the satellite copyright compulsory license. The panel, in \nattempting to set a fair market value of the retransmission of \nbroadcast signals, has decided to raise those rates and has made the \nnew rate effective July 1, 1997. The arbitration panel's decision is \ncurrently on appeal to the Librarian of Congress who is empowered to \nreview the decision. The standard of review is limited to one of \narbitrariness or contrariness to law. The Librarian's decision will be \nannounced next Tuesday, October 28. At that point, the Librarian's \ndecision is subject to appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia. The decision to raise the rates and especially its \nretroactive effective date has raised objections by the satellite \ncarriers. Obviously, copyright owners disagree with the satellite \ncarriers. My colleagues may be contacted by one side or the other of \nthis dispute in the coming weeks or months.\n  My colleagues should know that as chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, the committee of jurisdiction over copyright matters \ngenerally, and the Satellite Home Viewers Act in particular, I have \nbegun a review of the satellite and cable licenses. Earlier this year I \nasked the Copyright Office to conduct in depth public hearings and make \na comprehensive report to the Judiciary Committee on the licenses, \ntogether with recommendations for reforms. The Judiciary Committee is \nnow reviewing these recommendations.\n  As we make our review of the compulsory licenses, I believe we need \nto keep in mind the needs of rural families. The Satellite Home Viewers \nAct was originally intended in 1988 to ensure that households that \ncould not get television in any other way, such as traditional \nbroadcast or cable, would be able to get television signals via \nsatellite.\n  The market has changed substantially since 1988, and those changes \nhave led to many of the controversies that currently surround the act. \nMany are looking to satellite carriers to compete directly with cable \ncompanies for viewership. But as we consider reforms to make the \nlicense work better in the current marketplace, we need to consider \ncarefully the impact on the original beneficiaries, rural folks who are \notherwise beyond the reach of traditional television signals.\n  I come from a state that has a fine broadcast industry that invests \nits energy and capital in trying to reach as many viewers as it can in \nour mountainous State of Utah. But there are some Utahans, or others in \nsimilar rural States, who appear to be simply beyond the reach of \nbroadcast transmitters and translators, despite the best efforts of our \nbroadcasters. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I hope to \nfind a fair way of helping the greatest number of Utahans have the \ngreatest amount of choice in television entertainment. Obviously this \nmeans balancing a number of interests, since consumer choice will be \ncurtailed if any segment of the industry is disadvantaged too much to \nsupport the other segments. We need to try to get a system that will be \nconsumer-friendly, fair to creators and copyright holders to encourage \nthem to continue to produce quality entertainment, and that makes for a \ncompetitive environment that will lower prices and increase choices. As \nwe do this, we need to remember the original purpose of the satellite \nlicense, which is to make television available to those who cannot \notherwise get it.\n  I believe many of my colleagues on the committee and in the Senate \nshare my views, particularly my good friend, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy. Mr. President, I would ask the \ndistinguished ranking member if he shares my concerns about rural \nsatellite viewers, as well as the other affected interests in this \nindustry?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank Senator Hatch for his comments. I am also very \nconcerned about rural areas in my home State of Vermont and about the \nneeds of rural satellite viewers throughout the country.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.

A bill to establish an Office of National Security within \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, provide for the monitoring of \nthe extent of foreign involvment in U.S. securities markets, financial \ninstitutions, and pension funds, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  THE U.S. MARKET SECURITY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, on October 28 the President of the \nPeople's Republic of China will begin an official state visit to this \ncountry. Jiang Zemin is coming. It is reported, as a gift to him, the \nClinton administration will applaud China's policy on weapons \nproliferation.\n  As a reward for China's responsible behavior, President Clinton and \nVice President Gore plan to willingly, without reservation, share our \nmost sensitive nuclear technology with China.\n  There is something very suspicious about this drastic shift in U.S. \nforeign policy. I cannot understand why the administration would \nnegotiate this kind of deal?\n  Hasn't the CIA told us that China serves as the weapons clearinghouse \nof the world? Why in the world would President Clinton seek to abandon \na longstanding Federal law that has prohibited American corporations \nfrom selling nuclear technology to Communist China.\n  It appears this is payback time.\n  Senator Thompso9n and the Governmental Affairs Committee have spent \nthe last few months searching for why China would funnel illegal \ncontributions into American political campaigns. Perhaps the pieces of \nthe puzzle are starting to come together.\n  Clearly, the Chinese Government wants the best American technology \nfor both military and commercial use. China wants both nuclear weapons \nand nuclear powerplants.\n  Apparently, President Clinton And vice President Gore are convinced \nthat the best American nuclear technology is none too good for Beijing.\n  Now I understand that there are some very good American companies \nwhich stand to make billions from this deal. Certainly the foreign \npolicy establishment is excited about all of the new lobbying and \nconsulting possibilities. But aren't there some far more important \nfactors to be considered?\n  Let me remind the Clinton administration that its own Central \nIntelligence Agency concluded in July that the People's Republic of \nChina had become the most significant supplier of nuclear and chemical \nweapons technology to foreign countries.\n  Let me remind the Clinton administration that the People's Republic \nof China sold chemical weapons materials to Iran and missiles and ring \nmagnets used to process uranium to Pakistan.\n  Let me remind the Clinton administration that the People's Republic \nof China has a long history of misrepresenting the use of American \ntechnology it buys and then reselling it to other nations, often \nterrorist countries like Iran.\n  Mr. President, selling nuclear technology to the Chinese is a \nterrible idea. Even worse, however, is the thought that Americans are \npaying for it too.\n  Since 1989, the Peoples Republic of China and various businesses \nconnected to the Chinese Government have issued nearly $7 billion in \nbonds denominated in United States dollars.\n  China itself has issued some $2.7 billion in such bonds.\n  The Chinese International Trading and Investment Co., Chaired by Wang \nJung, reportedly connected to the Chinese Army, has issued $800 million \nin bonds in the United States during the past few years.\n  If Mr. Jung's name sounds familiar--its because he was at the White \nHouse having coffee with the President on February 6, 1996. What a \ndelightful man for a tea party.\n  It was also discovered that Mr. Jung's other company, Poly \nTechnologies, was responsible for smuggling AK-47's to Los Angeles \ngangs.\n  This is the man that was at the tea party.\n  The Bank of China has also issued some $80 million in dollar \ndenominated bonds in the United States. This is the same bank that \nwired money to Charlie Trie on a regular basis.\n  Mr. President, my greatest concern is that American mutual funds and \npension funds will end up owning these bonds. Where else is there for \nthem to go except to mutual funds and pension funds? To say that these \nbonds are risky is putting a nice face on them. If these companies \ndefault, they will stick the American taxpayer with the bill on the \nChinese bonds.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will require the SEC to \nestablish an office of national security that will routinely report to \nthe Congress on security offerings by foreign governments and \ncompanies. This will also require the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation to annually review America's pension funds and report on \nthe number of foreign securities being held.\n  It is time that Congress and the American public start paying \nattention to this quiet financial invasion. We need to pay attention to \nwhat is in America's retirement funds because we know who will pick up \nthe deficit.\n  Already, it has been reported that the Arkansas State Teachers' \nRetirement Fund is holding roughly 40 percent of its assets in Pacific \nrim entities, several of which are Chinese.\n  If so, this is a tragedy for people who worked all their lives and \nare counting on that pension for their retirement peace of mind, when \nin reality it might not happen.\n  Mr. President, maybe this administration thinks the American people \ndon't care about China's activities. Maybe I'm wrong, but I believe the \nAmerican people do care. They know the Chinese people are oppressed by \na\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\nCommunist government that uses capitalism when it is convenient to \nfurther their death grip on political power.\n  They know that China engages in unfair trading practices which result \nin a $50 billion trade deficit with the American people on an annual \nbasis. They know that China oppresses their people and flagrantly \nviolates human rights. They know China uses slave labor to make \nproducts for sale. They know that China sells the internal organs of \nexecuted prisoners on the black market. They know China infringes \npatents by selling pirated copies of American products. They know the \nPeople's Liberation Army is buying businesses in the United States as \nfronts for their secretive dealings. They know China persecutes \nChristians and religious believers.\n  I say to President Clinton and Vice President Gore that the American \npeople do care. And remember that while the People's Republic of China \nmay have supported their reelection campaigns, they do not support the \nfreedom campaign of their own people.\n  Selling highly sensitive nuclear technology to China is a bad idea \nwith extremely dangerous consequences. Permitting the invasion of our \ncapital markets is another bad idea with worse potential consequences.\n  I also believe that allowing China to own ports on both ends of the \nPanama Canal is another bad idea, from whence they could dominate the \ncanal and will bring dangerous consequences to our national security.\n  The Clinton administration and this Congress will face a difficult \ndecision between two very strong competing forces--money and morality. \nI hope they decide to do what is in the best interests of the American \npeople, not their foreign campaign donors that have all fled the \ncountry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH:\n  S. 1315. A bill to establish an Office of National Security within \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, provide for the monitoring of \nthe extent of foreign involvement in United States securities markets, \nfinancial institutions, and pension funds, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                       the tobacco transition act\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreform the federal tobacco quota and price support programs. This \nlegislation would provide economic assistance to tobacco quota owners, \ntobacco producers, and tobacco-dependent communities as they make the \ntransition to the free market.\n  Nearly every American is aware of the global tobacco settlement \nbetween 40 States' attorneys general and cigarette companies. Tobacco \nfarmers and their communities were conspicuously omitted from these \nnegotiations. Yet the settlement offers Congress a unique opportunity \nto provide economic assistance to tobacco farmers while ending the \nfederal government's support for tobacco production.\n  My legislation would buy out tobacco marketing quotas, provide \ntransition payments to tobacco producers, phase out the price support \nprogram, and provide economic assistance to tobacco-dependent \ncommunities. The cost of these reforms would be approximately $15 \nbillion and would be paid for with funds from the tobacco settlement. \nBecause farmers were not considered in the negotiations that led to \nthis settlement, this amount would be added to the current $368.5 \nbillion.\n  Under my legislation, the tobacco quota program would end in 1999 \nand, beginning that year, the price support program would be phased out \nover three years. In 1999, price supports would decline by 25 percent, \nthen by an additional 10 percent in each of 2000 and 2001, and would \nend thereafter.\n  Quota owners would receive $8 for every pound of quota they own. They \ncould elect to receive either first, a lumpsum payment in 1999 if they \nagree to cease tobacco production altogether, or second, three equal \nannual payments beginning in 1999 if they choose to continue to produce \ntobacco.\n  Tobacco producers would receive transition payments of 40 cents per \npound over 3 consecutive years for tobacco quota that they lease or \nrent on a cash-rent or crop-share basis. Transition payments would be \nbased on the average of at least 3 years of production over the 1993-97 \nperiod. Producers who both own and lease quota would receive transition \npayments based on their leased quota and a buyout based on the quota \nthey own.\n  Under this legislation, producers would be able to grow whatever \namounts of tobacco they choose--free of Government control. Most other \nfarm programs went through a similar change just last year when \nCongress passed the freedom-to farm legislation. The global tobacco \nsettlement would provide the funds to assist tobacco farmers as they \njoin other farmers in the free market.\n  Communities that are economically dependent on tobacco production \nwould receive $300 million in economic assistance. Eligible States \nwould receive block grants to facilitate the development of alternative \ncrops, industries, and infrastructure. Recipient States would then \ndetermine the areas most in need of assistance.\n  Mr. President, with or without a settlement, the forces to reform the \ntobacco program have been converging for some time now and they can no \nlonger be ignored. High-domestic price supports have hurt the \ncompetitiveness of U.S.-grown tobacco. Exports of tobacco have fallen, \nwhile imports have grown. Congress has already ended Government control \nover nearly every other farm commodity. And, most importantly, Congress \ncannot ask Americans to accept Federal support for tobacco production \nwhen we are considering legislation to settle claims that stem directly \nfrom tobacco use.\n  Clearly, the tobacco program may not be sustainable for much longer. \nWith that reality facing all tobacco producers, we should not pass up \nthis opportunity to provide economic assistance to farmers and their \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to expand the opportunity for \nhealth protection for citizens affected by hazardous waste sites; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                the environmental health protection act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, all across America toxic time bombs \nlurk beneath the soil. Many of our families find their futures poisoned \nby a long-gone industrial past.\n  And sadly we've made our families--especially our children--the \ncanaries in the coal mine. Only after they've been stricken, do we move \non the danger.\n  We need to change our emphasis.\n  Mr. President, we should help local communities meet the health \ntreats bubbling up from toxic waste sites. That is why I am today \nintroducing the Environmental Health Protection Act--legislation to \nrequire the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [ASTDR] to \nactively work with local community health and safety leaders both to \ndesign and train local health authorities to better manage a potential \ntoxic hazard and to design site-specific remedies and monitoring \nsystems.\n  Today, the ranking member of the Environmental and Public works \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, is joining with me in introducing \nlegislation to significantly boost the role that public health \nconsiderations play in Superfund decisions.\n  Mr. President, the potential health hazard posed from toxic waste \ndumps is great and growing.\n  According to a recent study of 136 Superfund toxic waste sites by the \nAgency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry [ASTDR], more than half \nthe sites they examined represent serious, ongoing public health \nhazards. ATSDR placed an additional 23 percent of toxic waste sites in \nan indeterminate hazard category because they potentially pose a long-\nterm risk to human life.\n  Communities and community leaders must have the tools and resources \nto meet these potential disaster--just like we prepare communities to \nmeet potential natural disasters.\n  ATSDR recently determined that 11 million Americans reside within 1 \nmile of the 1,309 Superfund National Priority List [NPL] sites. These \nfamilies are at particular risk from the hazardous substances wafting \nthrough the air they breath or oozing into water they drink.\n  The problems that communities face from toxic waste dumps are immense \nand complicated by the need for specialized knowledge, training and \nskills to address toxic waste problems. Dr. Barry Johnson of the ATSDR \nrecently testified before the Superfund Subcommittee of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee about the kinds of health \nproblems communities face. He told the committee that:\n  ATSDR health investigations at hazardous waste sites across the \ncountry found that nearby residents were exposed to increased health \nrisk from a wide variety of maladies including: birth defects; nerve \ndamage; skin disorders; leukemia; cardiovascular abnormalities; \nrespiratory problems, and immune disorders.\n  Two sets of studies in my home State of New Jersey--one carried out \nby the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] and the other by the New \nJersey School of Medicine and Dentistry--showed an increase in cancer \ncases in counties surrounding hazardous waste sites. The New Jersey \nMedicine study by Dr. G. Najem found that age-adjusted gastrointestinal \ncancer morality rates were higher in 20 of New Jersey's 21 counties \nthan national rates.\n  An ATSDR 1995 study of residents of Forest City and Glover, MO, who \nlive near Superfund sites, showed an increase in reports of breathing \ndisorders and decreased pulmonary function; especially among nonsmoking \nwomen.\n  Compilation of studies in California report the occurrence of an \nincreased risk of birth defects in the children of women living near \nthe State's 700 hazardous waste sites.\n  The results of another recent study funded by ATSDR and performed by \nthe New Jersey Department of Health, are particularly disturbing and, \nunderstandably, have frightened many of my constituents in the town of \nMaywood, NJ. The study reviewed data gathered on 15,000 residents \nliving near Superfund sites and found the incidence of brain cancers \nrunning at 50 percent above the expected level. In addition, the study \nfound cancer clusters--areas with unusually high rates of certain forms \nof cancer--existing in Ocean County and distressing 50 percent increase \nin various kinds of childhood cancers.\n  In short, ATSDR research demonstrates how important it is to the \nhealth of Americans living near Superfund sites to clean up those sites \nas quickly as possible. And this is no small task.\n  Communities struggling to come to grips with the potential health \nhazards of a toxic waste dump are too often left to fend for \nthemselves. No one agency is specifically charged with coordinating the \nvarious health-relief efforts these families need.\n\n[[Page S11198]]\n\n  Currently, EPA uses a risk assessment process to write plans for \ndealing with the problems posed by toxic sites. As a result, the \nselection of containment as a remedy rather than removing the toxins \nfrom a site has grown to 30 percent of the EPA remedy decisions. If \ncontainment is to work for the communities surrounding Superfund and \nother toxic sites, we must increase health monitoring and provide other \nhealth care assistance, advice, and tools to those living with near \nthese sites.\n  Congress established ATSDR specifically to address possible health \nproblems arising from Superfund sites. Now is the time to use what we \nhave learned and to actively involve local communities in their efforts \nto meet the health challenges posed by the hazardous waste sites. This \nbill requires ATSDR to do just that.\n  First, my bill both allows ATSDR to study any location where there is \nconcern that hazardous wastes threatens public health and requires that \nATSDR work closely with State and local health officials in making its \nassessment. Presently, Mr. President, State and local health and \nenvironmental officials are only required to be involved at sites \nlisted on the Environmental Protection Agency's national list of \npriority sites--the National Priority List [NPL]. By mandating that \nATSDR work with the State and local officials from the get-go at any \npotential site, we will be insuring the understanding, cooperation, and \nconsultation necessary to effective environmental cleanup exists in a \ncommunity.\n  Second, critics frequently complain that ATSDR's health assessments \nare completed too late in the process to be of any real use to the \nlocal officials struggling to manage the health impact of a hazardous \nwaste site on a community. This bill changes the way EPA and the health \nauthorities do their job. It requires EPA to notify local and State \nhealth officials early in the process that an investigation is \ncommencing and to better coordinate its activities with local \nauthorities so that EPA's proposed remedy better reflects local \nconditions and needs.\n  Third, this bill requires EPA to directly involve State and local \nhealth officials in decisions concerning analysis and sampling methods \nused at hazardous sites. State and local health officials are often the \nfrontline experts. They have important first-hand information on how a \ntoxic waste dump affects their community. Working with EPA, they can \nbetter determine and analyze possible health problems patterns in a \ncommunity and whether that arises from a toxic waste dump. With this \ninformation, EPA can zero-in on those areas for additional sampling and \nfurther studies and design a site appropriate remedy that meets the \nspecial circumstances of the affected community.\n  Fourth--and this is critically important--better training and up-to-\ndate information are essential to helping communities deal with \nhazardous waste sites. This legislation will ensure that State and \nlocal health officials receive the training and technical information \nthey need to diagnose and treat environmental health problems, and it \nwill also empower local authorities to help EPA make appropriate, site-\nspecific decisions about clean up remedies.\n  Fifth, this bill requires that when EPA selects to leave toxic wastes \nin place, then EPA must work with local health officials to design a \nsite specific health monitoring program. This will be paid for by the \nparties responsible for the hazard, and those requirements will become \nan enforceable part of any clean up agreement. It will no longer be \nadequate for a polluter to simply build a fence around a toxic waste \nsite and hope the toxins stay in and community residents stay out. \nEPA's remedy must now ensure that the health of the residents in the \nline of fire is protected first, foremost, and always. And, when EPA \nrevisits a site to evaluate whether the clean up is working, EPA will \nnow specifically have to consider the recommendations of local health \nofficials on the effectiveness and appropriateness of the solution.\n  Since the Superfund amendments of 1986, the communities near \nhazardous waste sites have appealed to us to strengthen the public \nhealth requirements of the law. A major focus of our efforts in \ncleaning up toxic waste must be the health of our people. This bill \nwill put community health and safety back at the top of the Superfund \nagenda. It will increase the information available to the public and \ncooperation between public health officials at all levels of \ngovernment. It will result in health considerations being made a \ncentral part of any discussions of clean up strategies and effective \nlong-term monitoring of toxic waste sites.

A bill to establish an adoption awareness program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                  the adoption promotion awareness act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues' support for \nthe Adoption Promotion Awareness Act. This legislation will provide the \nmeans necessary to keep women fully informed concerning all their \noptions regarding any unexpected pregnancy.\n  Mr. President, each year more than a million couples eagerly await \nthe opportunity to adopt a child. Unfortunately, only 50,000 domestic, \nnonrelated adoptions occur each year. That means that only 5 percent of \nAmerican couples willing and able to open their hearts and homes to a \nchild who needs them are able to do so.\n  As a result, Mr. President, would-be parents often must wait several \nyears for the opportunity to adopt a healthy child. For the anxious \nparents, the waiting seems to last an eternity. And their waiting is \nmade even more tragic by the fact that only 4 percent of women in \nAmerica choose adoption as an option for an unplanned pregnancy. We \nhave hundreds of thousands of empty homes, waiting to welcome children \nwho are never born.\n  There are many reasons for the sharp disparity between the relatively \nlimited number of children available for adoption and the growing \nnumber of families anxiously waiting to adopt a child. Crucial is the \nfact that many women are not provided adequate information about \nadoption when they are making the crucial decision of how to deal with \nan unexpected pregnancy. Too few women are fully informed concerning \nthe adoption option. If we could get the news out to these women that \ncouples are waiting with open arms to welcome their children into a \nloving home, more would chose to have their babies and release them for \nadoption.\n  This is not mere speculation, Mr. President, it is supported by the \nfacts. Michigan's private adoption agencies, for instance, report that \n21 percent of the women seen for services decide to release their \nchildren for adoption. Studies have shown that women are more likely to \nchoose adoption when clear, positive information is provided concerning \nthat option.\n  We know that providing information to women on adoption as a choice \ncan increase the number of adoptions that occur each year and decrease \nthe number of abortions. I believe that this is an important goal. For \nthis reason, I have introduced, along with my colleague, Senator \nLandrieu, legislation that authorizes an Adoption Awareness Promotion \nProgram. This program will provide $25 million in grants to be used for \nadoption promotion activity. It will also require recipients to \ncontribute $25 million of in-kind donations. The total amount going to \nadoption promotion will, therefore, be $50 million. This amount will \nallow for a thorough information campaign to take place--reaching women \nall over the country.\n  The legislation provides for grants to be used for public service \nannouncements on prints, radio, TV, and billboards. Grants will also be \nprovided for the development and distribution of brochures regarding \nadoption through federally funded title X clinics. These provisions \nwill enable women to have accurate and clear information on adoption as \nan alternative when at a crucial point in their pregnancies. Further, \nthe campaign will help to raise the level of awareness around the \ncountry about the importance of adoption.\n  Mr. President, I believe that each and every one of us, whether pro-\nlife or pro-choice, should be working to reduce the number of abortions \nthat occur each year. Indeed, I have often heard on this floor that \nabortion should be ``safe, legal and rare.'' I take my colleagues at \ntheir word and urge them to join me in this voluntary information \nprogram; a program designed to inform women of all their choices \nregarding any unexpected pregnancy.\n  Too many women in America feel abandoned and helpless in the face of \nan unexpected pregnancy. The father of the child may have left, the \nwoman's family and friends even may desert her. Even those who stay \nwith her may simply pressure her to end an embarrassing and troublesome \nsituation.\n  Too often, then, our women, in a vulnerable state, are left without \nfull, unbiased information and guidance concerning their options. I \nthink it is crucial in these circumstances that we keep these women \nfully informed of all their options--including the option of releasing \ntheir child into the arms of a welcoming couple, anxious to become \nloving parents.\n  If we truly are committed to making every child a wanted child, Mr. \nPresident, I believe it is our duty to see to it that pregnant women \nknow that there are couples out their who would love to care for their \nchildren. It is time for us, as a nation, to make clear our commitment \nto truly full information for expectant mothers, information that \nincludes the availability of safe, loving homes for their children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Wellstone, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1320. A bill to provide a scientific basis for the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to assess the nature of the association between \nillnesses and exposure to toxic agents and environmental or other \nwartime hazards as a result of service in the Persian Gulf during the \nPersian Gulf War for purposes of determining a service connection \nrelating to such illnesses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                 the persian gulf veterans act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today the \nPersian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1997, legislation which establishes a \nclear framework for the compensation and health care needs of Persian \nGulf war veterans. This bill implements the recommendation of the \nPresidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses to \ncreate a permanent statutory authority for the compensation of ill gulf \nwar veterans. It builds upon the system of scientific review and \ndeterminations for presumptive compensation that currently exists for \nveterans exposed to agent orange during the Vietnam war.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have \nwitnessed firsthand the struggles of many of our Nation's gulf war \nveterans. The Persian Gulf war will undoubtedly go down in history as \none of our country's most decisive military victories. Despite our \nfears of potentially huge troop injuries and losses, the careful \nplanning and strategy of our military leaders paid off. The ground war \nlasted only four days, and the casualties we experienced, while deeply \nregrettable, were fortunately few. But as with any war, the human costs \nof the gulf war have been high, and the casualties have continued long \nafter the battle was over.\n\n[[Page S11201]]\n\n  Many of the men and women who served in the gulf have suffered \nchronic, debilitating health problems. Unnecessarily compounding their \npain has been their difficulty in getting the government they served to \nacknowledge their problems and provide the appropriate care and \nbenefits they deserve. This legislation will go a long way to address \nsome of these concerns. We can't wait the 20 years we waited after the \nVietnam war to assess the effects of agent orange, or the 40 years we \nwaited after World War II to concede the problems of radiation-exposed \nveterans. We must learn from the lessons of the past and act now. We \nhave already waited too long.\n  For the past 6 years, we have looked to the leaders of the Department \nof Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs for a resolution of \nthese difficult issues. While they have made some progress, I think we \ncan all agree there is much more to be done. This legislation will \nrequire VA to enlist the National Academy of Sciences--an independent, \nnonprofit, scientific organization--to review and evaluate the research \nregarding links between illnesses and exposure to toxic agents and \nwartime hazards. Based on the findings of the NAS, VA will then \ndetermine whether a diagnosed or undiagnosed illness found to be \nassociated with gulf war service warrants a presumption of service \nconnection for compensation purposes. This will provide an ongoing \nscientific basis and nonpolitical framework for the VA to use in \ncompensating Persian Gulf war veterans.\n\n\n                         SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. President, I will now highlight some of the provisions contained \nin this legislation.\n  First, this legislation calls for the Secretary of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to contract with the National Academy of Sciences \n[NAS] to provide a scientific basis for determining the association \nbetween illnesses and exposures to environmental or wartime hazards as \na result of service in the Persian Gulf. The NAS will review the \nscientific literature to assess health exposures during the gulf war \nand health problems among veterans, and report to Congress and the VA.\n  Second, this legislation authorizes VA to presume that diagnosed or \nundiagnosed illnesses that have a positive association with exposures \nto environmental or wartime hazards were incurred in or aggravated by \nservice even if there was no evidence of the illness during service. \nHaving that authority, VA will determine whether there is a sound \nmedical and scientific basis to warrant a presumption of service \nconnection for compensation for diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses, \nbased on NAS' report. Within 60 days of that determination, VA will \npublish proposed regulations to presumptively service connect these \nillnesses.\n  Third, this bill requires NAS to provide recommendations for \nadditional research that should be conducted to better understand the \npossible adverse health effects of exposures to toxic agents or \nenvironmental or wartime hazards associated with gulf war service. The \nVA, in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DOD) and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services [HHS], will review and act upon \nthe recommendations for additional research and future studies.\n  Fourth, this legislation tasks NAS with assessing potential treatment \nmodels for the chronic undiagnosed illnesses that have affected so many \nof our gulf war veterans. They will make recommendations for additional \nstudies to determine the most appropriate and scientifically sound \ntreatments. VA and DOD will review this information and submit a report \nto Congress describing whether they will implement these treatment \nmodels and their rationale for their decisions.\n  Fifth, this legislation calls for the establishment of a system to \nmonitor the health status of Persian Gulf war veterans. VA, in \ncollaboration with DOD, will develop a plan to establish and operate a \ncomputerized information data set to collect information on the \nillnesses and health problems of gulf war veterans. This data base will \nalso track the treatment provided to veterans with chronic undiagnosed \nillnesses to determine whether these veterans are getting sicker or \nbetter over time. VA and DOD will submit this plan for review and \ncomment by NAS. After this review, VA and DOD will implement the \nagreed-upon plan and provide annual reports to Congress on the health \nstatus of Persian Gulf war veterans.\n  Finally, this legislation requires that VA, in consultation with DOD \nand HHS, carry out an ongoing outreach program to provide information \nto gulf war veterans. This information will include health risks, if \nany, from exposures during service in the gulf war theater of \noperations, and any services or benefits that are available.\n\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n  After the war, DOD and VA acknowledged that they couldn't define what \nhealth problems were affecting Persian Gulf war veterans. Nonetheless, \nwe did not want to make these veterans wait for the science to catch up \nbefore we could provide health care and compensation for their service-\nrelated conditions.\n  That is why, back in 1993, we provided Persian Gulf war veterans with \npriority health care at VA facilities for conditions related to their \nexposure to environmental hazards. Congress went on to pass legislation \nin 1994 that confirmed that VA could provide compensation to Persian \nGulf war veterans who suffered from chronic undiagnosed illnesses. \nPrior to this authority, VA asserted that it could not compensate \nveterans whose health problems could not be diagnosed.\n  However, some gulf war veterans are falling between the cracks and \nstill cannot receive compensation under current law. These veterans \nhave been diagnosed with a condition several years after leaving \nservice, such as chronic fatigue syndrome or migraines. Therefore, they \nare not eligible for compensation under VA's undiagnosed illness \nauthority, nor are they eligible under the guidelines for diagnosed \nillnesses because the diagnosis was not made within the proscribed \nperiod following service. At the same time, these illnesses are due to \nunknown causes which could, someday, be tied to their gulf service. We \ncannot require veterans to wait for that day to arrive. This \nlegislation will address this unfortunate catch-22 unwittingly created \nthrough previous legislation.\n  We will continue to retrace the steps and decisions that were made in \ndeploying almost 697,000 men and women to the Persian Gulf in 1990. \nHopefully, we will learn from the lessons of this war to prevent some \nof these same health problems in future deployments where our troops \nwill again face the threat of an everchanging and increasingly toxic \ncombat environment. But we also must address what our ill gulf war \nveterans need now. We need to provide a permanent statutory authority \nto compensate them. We need to be able to answer the questions of How \nmany veterans are ill? and Are our ill veterans getting sicker over \ntime?\n  Mr. President, this legislation targets these important issues. As \nVeterans' Day approaches, we prepare to honor those who offered to make \nthe ultimate sacrifice for our country. Many of us will be called upon \nto make speeches in support of these brave men and women. I ask my \ncolleagues in the Senate to join me now in supporting this legislation. \nLet us honor our gulf war veterans through our deeds--and not just our \nwords--this Veterans' Day.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, several years ago, I authored legislation \nthat today allows Vietnam veterans to receive disability compensation \nfor their exposure to Agent Orange and other toxic herbicides. This \nlegislation, known as the Agent Orange Act of 1991, called for the \nNational Academy of Sciences to review scientific and medical \ninformation related to the health effects of exposure to Agent Orange. \nIn addition, it provided permanent presumptions of service connection \nfor soft-tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chloracne, and any \nadditional diseases the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, based on the \nAcademy review and other relevant information, may determine to be \nassociated with such exposure.\n  For more than a decade, many in Congress and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs [VA] debated whether there was a connection between \nexposure to Agent Orange and other toxic herbicides and the illnesses \nsuffered by Vietnam veterans. There were allegations of bureaucratic \nattempts to thwart scientific investigations of the issue and alter, \nbury, or delay Government reports that did exist. Ultimately, \nindependent scientific evidence and a long-term effort to uncover \nGovernment information convinced Congress to pass the Agent Orange Act \nof 1991.\n  With the help and guidance of Senator Rockefeller and many others who \ncosponsored this legislation in the House and Senate, Vietnam veterans \nexposed to Agent Orange and other herbicides are beginning to receive \nthe treatment and compensation they deserve. And, with the passage of \nadditional legislation last year, approximately 2,800 children of \nVietnam veterans whose exposure to Agent Orange has been linked to \ntheir children's diagnosis of spina bifida, a congenital defect in the \nspine, are now eligible for health care and related services from the \nVA.\n  Although we have made great strides to determine the cause of \nillnesses suffered by Vietnam veterans and their children and agreed to \nprovide them with just compensation, we have yet to do the same for \nthose men and women who served in the Persian gulf war. When the first \nreports of gulf war illness emerged, several of us warned that we \nneeded to be sure that we did not repeat the mistakes that were made \nwith respect to Agent Orange. We needed to act quickly to ask all the \nappropriate questions and secure timely answers. Whatever our \ninvestigation might reveal, we needed to uncover the truth and act \naccordingly. Our Nation's veterans deserve no less.\n  Unfortunately, the effort to get to the truth has been undermined by \nactions painfully reminiscent of the Agent Orange experience. I am \nhopeful, though, that those actions are behind us and that we are now \nmoving ahead with a single-minded commitment to the truth.\n  Countless studies have been conducted to determine whether there is a \nconnection between a wide range of toxins as well as environmental and \nwartime hazards and the illnesses suffered by Persian Gulf war veterans \nand their families. Despite these efforts, the actual causes of Persian \nGulf war illnesses remain unknown, and many veterans and their families \ncontinue to suffer.\n  Mr. President, it is time for Congress, the VA, the Department of \nDefense [DOD] and the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] to \nstep up their efforts to find the causes of Persian Gulf war illnesses. \nMore importantly, we must provide veterans and their families with \nproper medical care and compensation regardless of whether we know the \nparticular causes of their illnesses.\n  That is why I am proud to join my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing the Persian Gulf War \nVeterans Act of 1991. As ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Rockefeller has been a tireless advocate for all \nveterans. His commitment and dedication to improving the lives of \nveterans and their families is well known, and he and his staff on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee deserve to be commended for their work in \ndrafting this important legislation.\n\n  Since the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991, many veterans have been \nsuffering from a variety of symptoms, including extreme fatigue, joint \nand muscle pain, short-term memory loss, diarrhea, unexplained rashes, \nnight sweats, headaches, and bleeding gums. Many believe that these \nillnesses may be caused by exposure to a wide range of toxins as well \nas environmental and wartime hazards. Among the potentially hazardous \nsubstances to which United States servicemembers may have been exposed \nare smoke from oil-well fires set by retreating Iraqi soldiers; \npesticides and repellents; depleted uranium used in munitions; \ninfectious diseases; petroleum products; and vaccines to protect \nagainst chemical warfare agents.\n  U.S. servicemembers may have also been exposed to chemical warfare \nagents. For 5 years, the Pentagon had steadfastly insisted that no \nUnited States soldiers had been exposed to chemical weapons in Iraq. In \nJune of last year, however, the Pentagon revealed that chemical \nmunitions had been unknowingly destroyed near an ammunition dump at \nKhamisiyah in southern Iraq and that 20,000 United States troops may \nhave been exposed. In July of this year, the Pentagon changed its \nassessment again and announced that nearly 100,000 U.S. servicemembers \nmay have actually been exposed to trace levels of poisonous sarin gas.\n  Much like the Agent Orange Act of 1991, the Persian Gulf War Veterans \nAct of 1997 calls for the Department of Veterans Affairs to contract \nwith the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the available \nscientific evidence regarding associations between illnesses suffered \nby Persian Gulf war veterans and their exposure to toxins or \nenvironmental or wartime hazards. Specifically, the Academy would \nidentify the biological, chemical, or other\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\ntoxic agents or environmental or wartime hazards to which U.S. service \nmembers may have been exposed during the Persian Gulf war.\n  The National Academy of Sciences would be required to identify those \ndiagnosed and undiagnosed illnesses among Persian Gulf war veterans. In \naddition, it would be responsible for reviewing potential treatment for \nchronic undiagnosed illnesses. As it did under the Agent Orange \nlegislation, the Academy would also be authorized to make \nrecommendations for additional scientific studies regarding the \nexposure that Persian Gulf war veterans may have had to toxic agents or \nenvironmental or wartime hazards.\n  Based upon the assessments of the National Academy of Sciences and \nany other relevant scientific and medical information, the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs would then determine whether a presumption of service \nconnection is warranted for various diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses. \nThe Secretary would provide compensation when there is a positive \nassociation between the illness and exposure to one or more toxic \nagents or environmental or wartime hazards during the Persian Gulf war. \nA positive association is regarded as one where credible evidence for \nthe association is equal to or outweighs credible evidence against the \nassociation. Like the Agent Orange Act, this legislation provides for \nongoing Academy reviews and puts a mechanism in place whereby the \nSecretary may provide compensation for additional illnesses as the \nscientific evidence warrants.\n  The bill Senator Rockefeller and I are introducing today also \nrequires the VA to collaborate with the Pentagon to operate a \ncomputerized database for the collection, storage, and analysis of \ninformation on the diagnosed and undiagnosed illnesses suffered by \nPersian Gulf war veterans. I should point out that the database would \nalso include information on the treatment veterans receive for chronic \nundiagnosed illnesses. The VA would be required to continuously compile \nand analyze the information in this database that is likely to \ndetermine the association between the diagnosed and undiagnosed \nillnesses suffered by veterans and their exposure to toxic agents or \nenvironmental or wartime hazards during the Persian Gulf war.\n  In June, the General Accounting Office issued a report stating that, \n``although efforts have been made to diagnose veterans' problems and \ncare had been provided to many eligible veterans, neither DOD nor VA \nhas systematically attempted to determine whether ill Gulf War veterans \nare any better or worse today than when they were first examined.'' The \ndatabase we are proposing would correct that deficiency. It would \npermit VA and DOD to determine whether Persian Gulf war veterans are \ngetting better over time and whether they are responding to the \ntreatment they are receiving.\n  The bill we are introducing today also calls for enhanced outreach to \nthose who served in the Persian Gulf war. Specifically, it would \nrequire the VA to consult with DOD and HHS to create an ongoing program \nto provide information to veterans and their families. For example, \nthey would receive information pertaining to the possible health risks \nto Persian Gulf war veterans who were exposed to toxic agents or \nenvironmental or wartime hazards. In addition, veterans would receive \nvaluable information on any services or benefits available to them.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned previously, we have made great strides \nto determine the cause of illnesses suffered by Vietnam veterans and \ntheir children and agreed to provide them with just compensation. We \nmust now enhance our efforts to help those who served our country \nduring the Persian Gulf war. Passage of this legislation is essential \nto providing answers to the many questions we have about the causes of \nPersian Gulf war illnesses. More importantly, it will ensure that our \nveterans are receiving proper medical care and the compensation they \nhave earned. I again thank Senator Rockefeller for his leadership on \nthis issue and hope my colleagues will support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11192-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 140--RELATIVE TO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \nHollings, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Inouye) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n                              S. Res. 140\n\n       Whereas restrictive and discriminatory Japanese port \n     practices have been a significant source of international \n     concern for many years, have increased the cost of \n     transporting goods to and from Japan for American consumers, \n     and all ocean carriers and their customers, and have \n     restricted United States carriers' operations in Japan while \n     Japanese carriers have not faced similar restrictions in the \n     United States.\n       Whereas for many years the Federal Maritime Commission, and \n     the United States Departments of State and Transportation, \n     have investigated and monitored these practices and urged the \n     Japanese Government to remedy the problems caused by these \n     restrictions; and\n       Whereas recent actions by the Federal Maritime Commission \n     and negotiations conducted by the Departments of State and \n     Transportation with the Government of Japan have reportedly \n     produced agreements which would, when implemented, reform the \n     Japanese port practices and remedy these problems: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate express strong support for--\n       (1) the efforts of the President and executive branch to \n     achieve removal of Japanese port restrictions, and\n       (2) vigilant, continued monitoring and enforcement by the \n     Federal Maritime Commission of changes in port practices \n     promised by the Japanese Government that will benefit \n     international trade.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I, Senator Faircloth, Senator Lott, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Hollins, Senator Bingaman, Senator Brownback, and \nSenator Inouye are submitting today a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nwhich commends the administration for its actions in attempting to end \nthe Japanese blockade of American ships who wish to use Japanese port \nfacilities. We are also urging the administration to remain firm and \nstand behind the Federal Maritime Commission in these negotiations with \nthe Government of Japan.\n  This issue is a no brainer. The Japanese are simply throwing up a \nblockade against American ships, who seek to dock at Japanese ports.\n  Mr. President, this protectionist stand has increased cost of \nshipping for the American consumer and all American ocean carriers and \ntheir customers. We simply will not tolerate that kind of treatment \nfrom Japan or any other trading partner.\n  The Federal Maritime Commission is to be commended for taking a tough \nline toward the Japanese port authorities. We encourage the \nadministration to stand squarely behind the Commission's efforts to \nachieve fairness for American ships, especially because we allow the \nJapanese open access to our ports.\n  There is the Biblical saying of ``Do unto others as you would have \nthem do unto you.'' The Japanese version is the complete reverse of \nthat.\n  We accommodate Japanese shipping and we should expect no less of \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to swiftly adopt this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11205-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11205-S11206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from New Mexico \n[Mr. Bingaman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 61, a bill to amend title \n46, United States Code, to extend eligibility for veterans' burial \nbenefits, funeral benefits, and related benefits for veterans of \ncertain service in the United States merchant marine during World War \nII.\n\n\n                                 S. 412\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] was added as a cosponsor of S. 412, a bill to provide for \na national standard to prohibit the operation of motor vehicles by \nintoxicated individuals.\n\n\n                                 S. 943\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the name of the Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of S. 943, a bill \nto amend title 49, United States Code, to clarify the application of \nthe Act popularly known as the ``Death on the High Seas Act'' to \naviation accidents.\n\n\n                                S. 1096\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Maine \n[Ms. Collins] was added as a cosponsor of S.\n\n[[Page S11206]]\n\n1096, a bill to restructure the Internal Revenue Service, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1251\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the names of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Shelby], the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], the \nSenator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], and the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] were added as cosponsors of S. 1251, a bill \nto amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the amount of \nprivate activity bonds which may be issued in each State, and to index \nsuch amount for inflation.\n\n\n                                S. 1252\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the names of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Shelby], the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], the \nSenator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], and the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] were added as cosponsors of S. 1252, a bill \nto amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the amount of \nlow-income housing credits which may be allocated in each State, and to \nindex such amount for inflation.\n\n\n                                S. 1297\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coverdell, the name of the Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Allard] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1297, a bill to \nredesignate Washington National Airport as ``Ronald Reagan Washington \nNational Airport.''\n\n\n                                S. 1299\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hutchinson, the names of the Senator from Ohio \n[Mr. DeWine], the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], the Senator from \nAlabama [Mr. Shelby], the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], and the \nSenator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] were added as cosponsors of S. \n1299, a bill to limit the authority of the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration to \nban metered-dose inhalers.\n\n\n                                S. 1306\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inhofe, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Faircloth] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1306, a bill to \nprohibit the conveyance of real property at Long Beach Naval Station, \nCalifornia, to China Ocean Shipping Company.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11205-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          THE ECONOMIC GROWTH DIVIDEND PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       ABRAHAM AMENDMENT NO. 1524\n\n  (Ordered referred jointly to the Committee on the Budget and to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 800) to create a tax cut reserve fund to protect revenues \ngenerated by economic growth;

Mr. President, I want to make a few brief \ncomments regarding the nomination of Mr. Peter Scher to be the Special \nTrade Ambassador for Agriculture which the Senate approved yesterday. I \nam pleased to report that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on \nwhich I serve, considered the nomination of Mr. Scher and favorably \nreported his nomination last month.\n  I met with Mr. Scher following his confirmation hearing before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss with him the problems \nWisconsin's agricultural sector has had with our existing trade \nagreements such as the Uruguay Round of GATT and the North American \nFree Trade Agreement. I urged Mr. Scher, in his new position, to work \ndiligently to ensure that our trading partners are complying with their \nagricultural trade obligations established by these agreements.\n  Specifically, I asked Mr. Scher and the USTR to accept a Section 301 \npetition filed by the dairy industry asking USTR to challenge the \nCanadian export pricing scheme before the World Trade Organization. \nCanada's dairy export subsidies violate the export subsidy reduction \ncommitments under the Uruguay Round. These subsidies disadvantage the \nU.S. dairy industry in its efforts to compete in world markets. I also \npointed out that Canada also has effectively prohibited our dairy \nindustry from exporting products to lucrative Canadian markets. Not \nonly must USTR aggressively pursue WTO dispute settlement proceedings \nagainst Canadian export subsidies, but it must also seek greater access \nfor U.S. dairy products to Canadian markets, among others, in any \nupcoming trade negotiations.\n  I am pleased that late last month U.S. Trade Representative \nBarshefsky agreed to pursue formal WTO dispute resolution proceedings \nchallenging the Canadian dairy export subsidy scheme as well as \nEuropean Union violations of the dairy provisions of the Uruguay Round. \nI appreciate the cooperation of Mr. Scher and Ambassador Barshefsky on \nthis important matter.\n  I also raised with Mr. Scher the problems the U.S. potato industry \nhas had with respect to access to both Canadian and Mexican markets. I \nurged him to pursue negotiations with the Canadians to allow greater \naccess of U.S. potatoes to their domestic markets and to aggressively \nseek accelerated reduction in Mexican tariffs for U.S. potatoes, a \ncommitment made to potato growers when NAFTA was approved. Mr. Scher \nassured me that potatoes would be among the commodities to be \nconsidered in upcoming negotiations with Mexico.\n  I believe Mr. Scher has a fundamental understanding of both the \nimportance of trade to agriculture generally and of the complex trade \nproblems the U.S dairy industry faces regarding compliance with \nexisting trade agreements. For that reason, I have supported the \napproval of his nomination. But I expect USTR, with Mr. Scher acting as \nAmbassador, to aggressively pursue the resolution of the critical \nissues facing our domestic dairy and potato sectors. I will continue to \nwork with USTR to resolve these issues and will hold Mr. Scher to his \ncommitment that USTR will use all existing tools to ensure compliance \nwith existing trade agreements and to pursue greater access for \nagriculture to international markets.\n  I continue to have serious reservations about U.S. efforts to begin \nnew trade negotiations until the problems with our current bilateral \nand multilateral agreements are successfully resolved. Wisconsin is \nhome to 24,000 dairy farmers, 140 cheese processing plants and many \nother businesses associated with milk production and processing. Dairy \ncontributes some $4 billion in income to Wisconsin's economy and \nprovides 130,000 jobs. Wisconsin is also the fifth largest potato \nproducing state with a large chip and french fry processing sector. \nOverall, Wisconsin ranks tenth in the nation in farm numbers and ninth \nnationally with respect to market value of agricultural products sold.\n  Wisconsin's farmers and food processing industry could greatly \nbenefit by gaining a greater share of international markets. However, \nfor that to happen, our trade agreements must not only be fair, they \nmust be enforceable. To date, our trade agreements have not only failed \nto provide significant benefits for many agricultural sectors, \nincluding dairy, they have placed some sectors at a distinct \ndisadvantage. I will look at all future trade agreement proposals with \nan eye to these issues and make decisions on those proposals based, in \npart, on how they treat Wisconsin farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11210-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11210-S11211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LEE H. CLARK\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to a \nman of great character, commitment, and integrity.\n  Lee H. Clark has dedicated his life to public service. Beginning at \nthe tender age of eighteen, Lee entered the United States Navy in 1943 \nwhere he served honorably for three years. After his commitment to the \nNavy, Lee entered college where he threw himself into academics, \ngaining a Master's degree in business from the University of Michigan. \nFollowing his education, Lee returned home and started his own \nbusiness. Soon after, with his company flourishing, Lee's interest in \nthe political process was sparked after serving as a precinct delegate \nin 1956. Lee entered into the political realm with the same \ndetermination and vigor that he displayed throughout his entire life \nand four years later ran for Congress. Although his bid for office was \nunsuccessful, Lee's desire for public service was unabated and he began \na long, meritorious career in service to the State of Michigan.\n\n[[Page S11211]]\n\n  Michigan has been greatly affected by Lee's energetic guidance and \nleadership. In the intervening years between 1956 and the present, Lee \nhas been a driving force for the Republican Party. From community \nelections to those elections national in scope, Lee always offered \ngreat wisdom and foresight. Throughout his life, Lee has shown \ntremendous concern for his fellow citizens and was always a willing \nvolunteer for any task. I am proud to have had the chance to work \nbeside him.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely honored to have this opportunity to \nthank him for his many years of service and friendship. He is a very \ndear friend and my thoughts and prayers go out to him, his wife Nancy, \nand the rest of his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11210-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO WESTERN COVENTRY SCHOOL, 1997 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION \n                           BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievement of Western Coventry School of Coventry, Rhode Island, which \nwas honored earlier this year as a U.S. Department of Education Blue \nRibbon School.\n  It is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School. \nThrough an intensive selection process beginning at the state level and \ncontinuing through a federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, many of \nthe very best public and private schools in the nation are identified \nas deserving of this honor. These schools are particularly effective in \nmeeting local, state, and national goals. However, this honor signifies \nnot just who is best, but what works in educating today's children.\n  Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to \nreach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and \nthat we make their education come alive. At the Western Coventry \nSchool, a kindergarten through sixth grade school, parent-teacher \ncooperation, through an award winning Parent Teacher Association (PTA), \nhas helped to improve the quality of education. The school has \ninstituted a mentoring program for at-risk youth and has made concerted \nefforts to ensure that students with special needs receive the \nassistance they require. In addition, teachers have taken an aggressive \nrole in developing new approaches to teaching reading and math.\n  Mr. President, Western Coventry School is dedicated to the highest \nstandards. It is a school committed to a process of continuous \nimprovement with a focus on high student achievement. Most importantly, \nWestern Coventry recognizes the value of the larger community and seeks \nits support and involvement. This school and community are making a \nhuge difference in the lives of its students.\n  Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very \nbest we can do for students and the techniques that can be replicated \nin every school to help all students succeed. I am proud to say that in \nRhode Island we can look to a school like the Western Coventry School. \nUnder the leadership of its principal, Barry Ricci, its capable \nfaculty, and its involved parents, Western Coventry School will \ncontinue to be a shining example for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11211-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11211-S11212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HOW NOT TO BUILD CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT STATISTICS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on October 16, following the \nrelease of monthly price data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], \nthe Social Security Administration announced a 2.1-percent cost of \nliving adjustment [COLA] for Social Security and other Government \nprograms. Yet a week earlier, the Social Security Administration \ncirculated a table which indicated that the benefit increase would be \n2.7 percent.\n  How could this happen? Simple. The Administration, as I have noted on \nnumerous occasions, insisted on using an outdated economic forecast so \nas to obscure the fact that the budget was approaching balance in \nfiscal year 1997 in the absence of a budget agreement. While that \nbudget legislation was pending in Congress last summer, it was feared \nthat if the economic outlook was too favorable, pressure for the budget \nbills would decrease and agreement would not be reached. And so the \nSocial Security Actuaries had no recourse other than to use the \nofficial forecast when presenting data on the actuarial status of the \ntrust funds.\n  Here is why the numbers were, to put it mildly, misleading. The \nAdministration notes that its midsession budget review--released almost \n2 months late on September 5--is based on economic projections \nfinalized in early June. But even by then it should have been clear \nwhat was happening to prices. By early June 1997, data for 8 months of \nthe benefit computation period, August 1996-April 1997, indicated that, \non an annual basis, CPI-W had increased by 2.4 percent. To increase by \n2.7 percent for the full year would require, on an annual basis, a 3.2-\npercent increase in CPI-W for the remaining 4 months, April 1997-August \n1997, of the computation period. Put another way the Administration was \npredicting a one-third increase in the inflation rate. Yet, on an \nannual basis, CPI-W increased by only 1.5 percent during these 4 \nmonths. That is, the inflation rate actually declined by almost 40 \npercent.\n  In short, by the spring it should have been clear that the benefit \nincrease would be less than 2.7 percent. And by late summer it was \nvirtually certain that the increase would be 2.0 to 2.2 percent, but \nnowhere near 2.7 percent.\n  What does this mean to the average beneficiary now receiving a \nmonthly benefit of $749? Instead of a $20 monthly benefit increase--2.7 \npercent of $749--the benefit increase will be about $16. Fortunately, \nfew if any Members of Congress rushed out in early October and \nannounced to constituents, based on the Administration's estimates, \nthat they would receive an expected 2.7-percent benefit increase.\n  The Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index--the Boskin \nCommission--concluded that the Consumer Price Index [CPI] overstates \nchanges in the cost of living by about 1.1 percentage points.

Mr. President, on October 16, following the \nrelease of monthly price data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], \nthe Social Security Administration announced a 2.1-percent cost of \nliving adjustment [COLA] for Social Security and other Government \nprograms. Yet a week earlier, the Social Security Administration \ncirculated a table which indicated that the benefit increase would be \n2.7 percent.\n  How could this happen? Simple. The Administration, as I have noted on \nnumerous occasions, insisted on using an outdated economic forecast so \nas to obscure the fact that the budget was approaching balance in \nfiscal year 1997 in the absence of a budget agreement. While that \nbudget legislation was pending in Congress last summer, it was feared \nthat if the economic outlook was too favorable, pressure for the budget \nbills would decrease and agreement would not be reached. And so the \nSocial Security Actuaries had no recourse other than to use the \nofficial forecast when presenting data on the actuarial status of the \ntrust funds.\n  Here is why the numbers were, to put it mildly, misleading. The \nAdministration notes that its midsession budget review--released almost \n2 months late on September 5--is based on economic projections \nfinalized in early June. But even by then it should have been clear \nwhat was happening to prices. By early June 1997, data for 8 months of \nthe benefit computation period, August 1996-April 1997, indicated that, \non an annual basis, CPI-W had increased by 2.4 percent. To increase by \n2.7 percent for the full year would require, on an annual basis, a 3.2-\npercent increase in CPI-W for the remaining 4 months, April 1997-August \n1997, of the computation period. Put another way the Administration was \npredicting a one-third increase in the inflation rate. Yet, on an \nannual basis, CPI-W increased by only 1.5 percent during these 4 \nmonths. That is, the inflation rate actually declined by almost 40 \npercent.\n  In short, by the spring it should have been clear that the benefit \nincrease would be less than 2.7 percent. And by late summer it was \nvirtually certain that the increase would be 2.0 to 2.2 percent, but \nnowhere near 2.7 percent.\n  What does this mean to the average beneficiary now receiving a \nmonthly benefit of $749? Instead of a $20 monthly benefit increase--2.7 \npercent of $749--the benefit increase will be about $16. Fortunately, \nfew if any Members of Congress rushed out in early October and \nannounced to constituents, based on the Administration's estimates, \nthat they would receive an expected 2.7-percent benefit increase.\n  The Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index--the Boskin \nCommission--concluded that the Consumer Price Index [CPI] overstates \nchanges in the cost of living by about 1.1 percentage points. And many \nother researchers concur with the findings of the Boskin Commission. \nThe American Association of Retired Persons [AARP], and others, have \nargued that the only way to keep politics out of the process is to let \nthe BLS do it. Such critics should be mindful that accurate statistics \ninclude timely and accurate projections. By late September or early \nOctober of each year Social Security beneficiaries should be able to \nrely on their Government to provide reliable projections of upcoming \nbenefit increases.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a table prepared by the Social Security \nAdministration, Office of the Actuary, on October 7, 1997, be printed \nin the Record.\n  The table follows:\n\n                                           TABLE 1.--ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE MID-SESSION REVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT'S FISCAL YEAR 1998 BUDGET\n                                                                                          [In percent]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     1996        1997        1998        1999        2000        2001        2002        2003        2004        2005        2006        2007\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in real GDP..............................         2.4         3.5         2.0         2.0         2.1         2.4         2.4         2.4         2.4         2.4         2.4         2.4\nCivilian unemployment rate......................         5.4         5.0         5.2         5.4         5.5         5.5         5.5         5.5         5.5         5.5         5.5         5.5\nChange in average annual CPI....................         2.9         2.7         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5\nChange in average covered wage..................         4.3         4.6         3.2         3.8         3.9         3.7         3.6         3.8         3.8         3.8         3.9         3.9\nReal wage differential..........................         1.4         2.0         0.7         1.2         1.4         1.2         1.1         1.3         1.3         1.3         1.4         1.4\nBenefit increase................................         2.9         2.7         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5         2.5\nAverage annual interest rate....................         6.6         6.7         6.1         5.7         5.6         5.4         5.4         5.4         5.4         5.4         5.4         5.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Social Security Administration, Office of the Chief Actuary, October 7, 1997.\n\n\n[[Page S11212]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11211-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        WORKING MOTHER'S 100 BEST COMPANIES FOR WORKING MOTHERS\n\n    Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, I \nattended the White House Conference on Child Care. Business, labor, and \nreligious leaders will be sharing their strategies and successes for \nimproving and expanding child care opportunities. This afternoon's \ndiscussion is entitled ``learning from what works.''\n  In government, we can do no better than to look to the private and \nnonprofit businesses and organizations in our communities to learn what \nworks. With today's focus on child care issues, I commend to my \ncolleagues, this month's issue of Working Mother Magazine, and it's \n12th annual survey of the 100 best companies for working mothers.\n  The companies included on the 100 best list are ones that provide \nworking mothers with exceptional opportunities to contribute to the \ncompany's success, and to care for their families. Working Mother \nMagazine measures companies based on five criteria: pay, opportunities \nto advance, child care, flexibility, and other family friendly \nbenefits.\n  The 100 best companies have made a commitment to strengthening \nfamilies and communities. At the same time, these companies are \nstrengthening their bottom line. In order for our Nation to remain \nglobally competitive in the 21st century, we must utilize all of the \ntalents of all of our people. Working mothers have talents and \nabilities our country cannot afford to be without. The 100 best \ncompanies are utilizing creative, effective solutions to the problems \nworking mothers face as they try to balance career and family concerns. \nBy doing so, these companies profit as mothers are able to focus more \nenergy and attention on their work.\n  Making jobs work for women and their families is what these companies \nare all about. I am especially proud that 7 of the companies on the 100 \nbest list are based in my home State of Illinois. Each of the Illinois \ncompanies has taken steps to recognize the talents of working mothers, \nand to help them help their families. Among other accomplishments,\n  Allstate Insurance Co. recently opened a $3 million child care center \nin Northbrook, IL, that not only provides child care at the company's \nheadquarters, but also offers full day kindergarten and holiday, \nvacation, and backup care;\n  Amoco Corp. provides elder and child care referral services that were \nused by over 6,000 employees last year, and provides reimbursements for \nchild care expenses accrued due to travel or overtime;\n  Leo Burnett Co., Inc., continues to promote working mothers to \nexecutive positions. Today, the president and the chief creative \nofficer are women;\n  Fel-Pro, Inc., offers family friendly programs ranging from an 8-week \nsummer camp to a $1,000 savings bond for newborns. Fel-Pro has been \nincluded in the 100 best list since its inception years ago;\n  First Chicago NBD Corp. has been improving on their already \nimpressive array of services with financial support for adoptions, and \nbenefits for part-time employees;\n  Motorola, Inc., according to the magazine, ``remains the corporate \nleader in providing subsidized child care for employees' kids'';\n  Northern Trust Corp. has doubled the number of employees working at \nhome in the past year; and\n  Sara Lee Corp. has a commitment to helping working mothers advance. \nToday, its general counsel, chief financial officer and treasurer, \namong others, are female.\n  This list includes some of the most successful companies in the \ncountry, including the largest advertising firm in the country, and one \nof the Nation's oil companies. What each of these seven corporations \nhas shown is that both companies and children benefit from policies \nthat take not only the employee, but her whole family into account. \nWorking mothers are an important asset to the Nation's employers. \nStrong families are an important asset to us all.\n  I urge my colleagues to read this month's issue of Working Mother \nMagazine so that we can learn from industry leaders--we all benefit \nfrom policies that support working families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11212-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE IMPORTANCE OF RENEWABLE FUELS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just this week, we in the U.S. \nSenate have been confronted with two strong reminders of the importance \nof renewable fuels to this country. This emerging industry, potentially \nlucrative for American farmers and agribusiness, can help solve two key \nproblems that we face: the impact of greenhouse gases on the global \nclimate, and the growing dependency of the American economy on the \nimport of foreign petroleum products.\n  On Wednesday, President Clinton, announced the U.S. position with \nrespect to the climate change treaty to be negotiated in Kyoto in \nDecember. Under his instructions, American negotiators will seek to \nfashion an agreement that will commit, on an equitable basis, the \nnations of the world to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases over the \nnext several decades. If implemented, our ability to meet such goals \nwill depend greatly on the development and adoption of new technologies \nwhich are more energy efficient. The President's proposal to provide \ntax incentives for more energy efficient technology should be important \nin spurring such development efforts. Renewable fuel technologies, \nespecially those derived from agricultural products, will be a crucial \ncomponent of such activities. Many forms, such as the energy that will \nbe produced from the switchgrass project underway in Centerville, IA, \noffer the added benefit of actually withdrawing carbon from the \natmosphere. Expansion of production of renewable fuels also increases \nincome for the farm sector, and creates new jobs. In keeping with a key \ntheme voiced at the recent White House Conference on Climate Change, \nwith renewable fuels we can do well by doing good, for American \nagriculture and the whole country.\n  If that were not enough, Mr. President, Tuesday's announcement by the \nCommerce Department that record oil imports caused our merchandise \ntrade deficit to increase in August gives added urgency to the \npromotion of renewable fuels. It is clear that even if no treaty on \nclimate change comes out of Kyoto, our dependence on oil imports still \nlooms on the horizon. The share of imports in U.S. oil consumption has \nbeen climbing steadily over the last few years, and the Energy \nInformation Administration of the Department of Energy projects that \nthe share could reach 75 percent within the next 10-15 years. Increased \nproduction and use of renewable sources of energy could help to stem \nthat tide, and reduce our need to rely on energy sourced in large part \nfrom a politically unstable region of the world.\n  During this session of Congress, we can begin to respond to these \nevents in at least one concrete way, by passing into law the proposed \nextension of the ethanol tax credit to the year 2007. I urge my \ncolleagues to seize this opportunity now to show our confidence in \nagriculture's ability to make a positive contribution in these areas by \nproducing renewable energy for American consumers to use.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11212-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 37\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

We may \nstill give some additional time to consideration of the pending highway \nbill. It is our intent to have the Interior appropriations conference \nreport voted on following the vote on Judge Marbley at 5 o'clock. Also, \nthe Senate could be asked to consider Amtrak reform legislation in \nconjunction with the strike legislation.\n  Under a previous order, at 5 o'clock, we will conduct the one \nrollcall vote on Judge Marbley. Then it could be followed by as many as \nthree other votes, and we will have to determine that during the day \nMonday. But a minimum of one and possibly a maximum of five votes.\n  Another cloture motion was filed today, of course, on the highway \nbill, and that vote would occur on Tuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11213-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DISAPPROVING PRESIDENT'S VETO OF CERTAIN PROJECTS IN THE MILITARY \n                    CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, if I could respond to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, I would need to consult further with \nSenator Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and the \nSenator from West Virginia. But if they would agree, I think we should \nlook for a time on Tuesday or Wednesday to take that matter up, because \nwe are not sure exactly what will be our final days in session this \nyear but it could be just the next 2 weeks. So I would like to go ahead \nand take this up at the earliest possible time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/24/senate-section/article/S11213-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
