Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.''--\nJohn 14:27.\n  That is the quality of peace we need to do our work creatively today. \nOften the conflict and tension present in our lives threaten to rob us \nof a calm and restful mind and heart. It is so easy to catch the \nemotional virus of frustration and exasperation. Help us to remember \nthat Your peace is a healing antidote to anxiety that can survive in \nany circumstance.\n  Provider of peace, give us the peace of a cleansed heart, a free and \nforgiving heart, a caring and compassionate heart. Right now, may Your \ndeep peace flow into us, calming our impatience and flowing from us to \nothers.\n  Especially, we pray for Your peace for the women and men of this \nSenate. May Your profound inner peace free them to think clearly and \nspeak decisively while maintaining the bond of peace with one another. \nThrough our Lord and Saviour. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8765-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate will immediately resume \nconsideration of amendment No. 1077, offered by the Senator from \nIndiana, Senator Coats, who is here and prepared to go. This is an \namendment, of course, to S. 1061, the Labor, HHS appropriations bill. \nIt is hoped that an agreement can be reached this morning to conduct a \nvote on the Coats amendment by mid-morning, hopefully within the hour.\n  In addition, Members can anticipate additional votes on amendments \ncurrently pending to the Labor, HHS appropriations bill and other \namendments expected to be offered to the bill throughout the day's \nsession. I understand a couple of amendments have been offered and set \naside. I know there are some other amendments pending. As always, \nMembers will be notified of exactly what time the votes will be \nscheduled. We will work with all Members to make sure they have an \nopportunity to offer their amendments and debate them, and then, of \ncourse, we will have votes, if necessary.\n  I ask, again, that all Senators cooperate with our managers on both \nsides of the aisle. They are trying to move this very important \nlegislation that means so much to our country. And, as is quite often \nthe case when we return from a period back in our respective States, we \nhave not gotten off to a fast start. We hope to complete this very \nimportant appropriations bill today. We do have some problems and some \ndelays. I would like to address those just for a moment.\n  First, with regard to tomorrow, it is still my intent to have a \ncloture vote in the morning. We have not set a time. It could be as \nearly as 8:30 to accommodate Senators' schedules, on the cloture motion \non the Food and Drug Administration reform bill. We need to get this \nbill done. It was reported out overwhelmingly from the committee, and \nit has broad bipartisan support. Unfortunately, this is even a cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has objections to \nthis FDA reform. I thought we had them worked out two or three times at \nthe end of the session, before the August recess, and then it seemed to \nget away from us.\n  I hope we can get all the Senators to work together and work out \nagreements so we can move this very important legislation. It is very \nimportant to the health and general quality of life of all Americans. \nThis is an agency that has been bureaucratic, it has been slow, it has \nnot done its work where it should be doing its work, and it has tried \nto force itself into areas where it really doesn't belong. This is long \noverdue.\n  I, again, am interested in getting it done. But if we have to, we \nwill have more than one vote or votes on cloture. We need to go ahead \nand complete this. I think, once we can get it to debate and vote, it \nwill not take very long. If we can work out something, by the way, on \nthe bill, before the time, then we would not have to have a cloture \nvote tomorrow. I would be glad to work with the leaders on the \nlegislation, Democratic leaders, to decide on a time when it would be \ndebated and when that would be scheduled, either later on this week, or \nMonday or Tuesday. We will work together on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8765-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8765-S8772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONTESTED LOUISIANA ELECTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the other issue I want to address is some of \nthe problems we have today. When we have something brought to the \nSenate that\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\nwe have to look into, and, in this case, I am referring to the election \nin Louisiana for the Senate last year, where allegations of fraud have \nbeen made, it is incumbent upon us to thoroughly check those \nallegations out. Unfortunately, the committee charged with jurisdiction \nin this area has not been able to work together in a bipartisan way to \nget it done and get the work completed. I want us to reach that point \nsooner, not later, and I have worked across the aisle to try to come up \nwith a process to make that happen. I thought we had it worked out, \nagain, the last week in July, and at the last minute that fell apart.\n  So, we have to do our job. I am not going to come to the floor of the \nSenate, look Senators in the eye, and the American people, and say, \n``We checked it out thoroughly, there is nothing here,'' or, ``There is \na real problem here,'' until all the work that needs to be done has \nbeen done. I can't do that.\n  Now we are being told, well, if you continue it, we are going to have \ndelays and obstruction by the Democrats. What are they delaying and \nobstructing? The Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill, \nthe Superfund reform. Here is a program, Superfund, that is really the \nlaughingstock of America. You care about the environment? Who among us \nwould not care that the program is not working. Lawyers have a grand \ntime. They are making money. But we are not cleaning up hazardous \nsites. We are not cleaning up hazardous waste sites.\n\n  So the Committee on Environment and Public Works wants to meet today \nto mark up the Superfund bill, and I am being told, ``Well, we are not \ngoing to let you meet; we are not going to let that committee meet, in \na bipartisan way, and mark this bill up.'' And, therefore, I have no \noption but to say, OK, if you are going to do that, then we will go out \nthis afternoon.\n  If objection is made to the Environment and Public Works Committee \nmeeting this afternoon to mark up Superfund reform, which would clean \nup hazardous waste sites in my State and probably every State in \nAmerica, if that is going to be blocked, then the Senate will go out at \n2 o'clock, we will be out until 4 o'clock so the committee can meet and \ndo its work, and we will tack that time onto tonight. We are not going \nto have this arrangement where the other side tries to dictate the \nschedule in committee meetings. We are not going to do that.\n  I have worked very hard to keep my word to the Senate and to the \nSenators. When I say we are going to meet and have votes, we try to do \nthat. When we agree we are not going to meet and have votes, we try to \nhonor that. We agreed we would be out in the third week in October for \nthe Columbus Day period. I am going to keep my word on that. I tried to \nkeep in mind the personal lives, and opportunities to have dinner with \nfamilies and children. I want to do that. But if we are going to start \nplaying this game of threats and delays and obstruction and blocking of \ncommittee meetings and that sort of thing, then I have no option but to \nput the time on the back end.\n  So, I don't think that is necessary. We have had a good feeling here \nin the Senate for the last 2 months. We worked together in a bipartisan \nway, even when we disagreed. I think we can continue to do that, and I \ncertainly will try to continue to keep my word and work with the \nSenators on this schedule. That is one of the reasons why we might have \nto vote early in the morning, because some Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle want to leave. That is fine. We want to help them. But we \nalso have work to do.\n  So, I just wanted to point out what is going on. I don't have any \nproblem with doing it this way. I just want everybody to understand I \nam not doing it to cause confusion or delay. I have no option.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee will meet today. We will \ncontinue to work on the Labor, HHS appropriations bill. I believe that \nwe can and should get it completed today or tomorrow. But we will have \nsuccess on this bill, and we will do it in a bipartisan way, and we \nwill do it, hopefully, by the end of this week or the first of next \nweek.\n  So I just wanted to advise Senators what the schedule looks like for \ntoday and in the morning. I will talk to my counterpart on the other \nside of the aisle. I will be glad to work with Senators on FDA reform \nand Superfund reform and on Labor, HHS, to see if we can find \nreasonable accommodation, and we will also continue to pursue an \nopportunity to recommend to the Senate what action, if any, or none, \nshould be taken with regard to the Louisiana election.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I'd be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I listened with interest to the Senator from Mississippi, \nthe majority leader. I think it is important to point out that there is \nno intention that I am aware of on this floor to interrupt the business \nof appropriations bills. The principal business in this month of \nSeptember is to finish, and work hard on, the appropriations bills; by \nthe end of September, have them down to the White House, so the \nPresident can sign them and avoid a continuing resolution. So we want \nto do that, and there is no objection that I am aware of, made by \nanyone, which would interrupt in any way the conduct of business on \nappropriations bills.\n  The Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, knows there is \ngreat concern about the issue of a contested election in Louisiana, by \nwhich a Member of the Senate was seated without prejudice and an \ninvestigation was begun. The conduct of that investigation causes some \nsignificant concern here in the Senate. It is not December, it is not \nJanuary, February, March, or April; it is September, and we have a \nMember of the Senate who is still seated in this Senate, seeing \nactivities of a committee on an investigation in which allegations of \nfraud were made. And I might say that the committee hired a couple of \ninvestigators, lawyers--a Republican and a Democrat--and the first \nreport they gave to the committee was to say there is nothing there. \nBut that was not enough.\n  I am not going to go into what is going on in the committee. I don't \nthink we need to have that discussion. But, you know, it is September. \nIt's September, and we have a Member of the U.S. Senate who is still \nheld in limbo, here, on this issue of investigation. I saw yesterday \nnewspaper after newspaper after newspaper in Louisiana, the editorials \nand stories say, ``There is nothing here. Let this go. Stop this \ninvestigation.''\n  So, you know, the concern that some exhibit on the floor of the \nSenate about this issue is not without foundation. The Senator from \nMississippi points out that he is concerned about delay. I don't think \nany of us want a delay.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could reclaim my time to respond on \nthat, I think everybody has indicated we want to continue to move the \nappropriations bills.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That's correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. But if an objection is heard today for the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee to meet in session this afternoon and work on \nmarking up a very important environmental bill to clean up hazardous \nwaste sites, that interrupts the process of the appropriations bill. \nThat committee should meet. In my opinion, it should have already met \non this issue, and had votes and brought it to a conclusion. So, if an \nobjection is heard to committees meeting, I have no option but to go \nout for a period of time to allow the committees to do their work. \nThat's a very important part of our process here.\n  So the effect is that you are delaying the appropriations bill. But \nperhaps objection would not be heard, we wouldn't have to stop for 2 \nhours this afternoon so that a very important committee could meet. I \nhave indicated to the Senator and to Senator Daschle that we hope that \nwould not be necessary. But, you know, the effect is to delay the \nLabor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill.\n  With regard to the Louisiana election, yes, it is September. It need \nnot be. This matter could have been concluded, completed, weeks or \nmonths ago, but from the beginning, the Democrats on the committee \nwould not cooperate, would not work with us. They didn't actually----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well----\n  Mr. LOTT. Wait, I have the floor and I will yield when you ask me to. \nI am on that committee, and all I ever said was find out what happened, \nwas there\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\napparent fraud or not. As a matter of fact, investigators never went \ninto Louisiana until July. Shortly thereafter, in something I have not \nseen in 25 years in Congress, the Democrats walked out of the \ncommittee's proceedings and said, ``We won't participate.''\n  In investigation after investigation over the years in the House and \nthe Senate, I never saw the Republicans or Democrats, in any other \ninstance, say, ``We're not going to participate.''\n  What happened after the investigators' being down there for like 2 \nweeks, the Justice Department withdrew the FBI agents. It couldn't come \nto a conclusion. The week before we went out, I talked with Senators on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle, and we worked out an arrangement that \nI thought everybody was satisfied with for a special allocation of \nmoney to complete that work and in time to complete that work. At the \nlast minute, it was jerked away.\n  What has happened is, I think Senator Warner is going to make an \nannouncement today, I believe, about a schedule he has in mind. There \nare several boxes of documents that have been turned over now to the \ncommittee as a result of the subpoena duces tecum to get evidence with \nregard to gaming interests and involvement in the election. By the way, \nI think they have every right to support a referendum. The only \nquestion is was it in any way used improperly or illegally. I don't \nknow the answer to that.\n  Once those documents are reviewed, I understand the committee is \ngoing to meet, hear from the investigators, hear what the evidence is, \nif any, that they find in these documents and, at some point, the \ncommittee will proceed to action. I don't know exactly what date that \nwould be.\n  It is not my intention to drag this out indefinitely. But I have to \nbe able to come here and say to Members on both sides of the aisle, \n``We've done our work. Even though we haven't had cooperation, we have \nreached a conclusion as best we can, and here it is.'' I have told the \nSenators on both sides of the aisle over the past year and 3 months how \nwe deal with you. I am not interested in causing undue delay or \ndifficulty for any Senator here with or without prejudice. But I must \nbe able, along with other Senators, to say that we did our work, we \nfulfilled our constitutional responsibility, and then make a \nrecommendation. I will be glad to yield further if you like.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, he clearly should and will not \nbe surprised at concern expressed now in September about this issue. \nThose concerns were registered in July and early August, and the \nSenator understands that we have a Senator from Louisiana whose \nelection is still being contested, and it is now September. I just want \nto, if I might, just show you some of what is happening in Louisiana in \nthe press:\n  ``When will investigation end? Voters might not be happy with \nprolonged debate.''\n  ``Poll: State's voters believe Landrieu probe unnecessary.''\n  ``Enough's enough,'' an editorial in the Times-Picayune.\n  ``Senate investigation will hurt Louisiana.''\n  ``No evidence of widespread fraud.''\n  It is September, and there is no demonstration of any kind that I am \naware of that any irregularities existed in that election that would in \nany way overturn the results of the election, and yet we still have \nwhat I think is a concerted effort by some to drag this out and drag it \nout and drag it out.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Frankly, a lot are not happy about that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, there has been an effort that has caused it to be \ndelayed and dragged out.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand who the Senator from Mississippi says is at \nfault. I only know it is September. The first two lawyers who were \nhired, a Democrat and Republican, testified in front of the committee \nthat hired them and said there is nothing here. The majority leader \nsaid that is not satisfactory.\n  Mr. LOTT. In the areas they had looked into. There had been nothing \ndone with regard to the gaming activities and the so-called life \norganization in New Orleans.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My point is, if he will allow me one more minute, my \npoint is that I think it is unfair to the Senator from Louisiana. I \nthink it is unfair to the people of Louisiana. This ought to get \nwrapped up.\n  Our point is this: There is no intention to interrupt the business of \nthe Senate, which is now to pass these appropriations bills in the \nmonth of September. We have to do that. There is no one out here \nobjecting to the work on those appropriations bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. But you are going to object to a committee meeting, which \nmakes it necessary for the work of the Appropriations Committee to be \ninterrupted.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As the Senator knows, the regular order of the Senate is \nto have no committee meetings when the Senate is in session.\n  Mr. LOTT. But it has been the common practice for committees to be \nable to meet. All I am saying to you is, work with us and we can bring \nthis to conclusion. But I am also saying that if you start interrupting \nthe business of the Senate or committees, it will not be without action \nin return. We need to work together. We need to do these things \nprivately and communication in the type of way we have done over the \nlast 2 months. But if you start playing games with committees meeting \non important issues like Superfund and, let me tell you, fast track, it \nwill have an effect. Every action produces a reaction.\n  So let's not start down that trail. Let's continue to work together \nas we have, and we can complete our work on appropriations and on \nSuperfund and on fast track and on ISTEA, and then return to our \nconstituency.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one more comment, the issue \nof delay applies especially and indelibly to the issue of the \ninvestigation in Louisiana, and delay, it seems to me, continued delay \nis unfair to Senator Landrieu and unfair to the people of Louisiana. It \nis not our intent to cause problems for the Senator from Mississippi in \nthe scheduling of the Senate. I understand it is not easy to be \ninvolved in running this place. So it is not our intention to cause \nthose kinds of problems. That is especially why----\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me just say, it is not easy, but it is a great \npleasure. I'm enjoying it a lot.\n  Mr. DORGAN. You actually act like you are enjoying it. We have done a \nlot. This has been a pretty productive year, but at least a good number \non our side say with respect to delay, one of the delays that occurs \nnow in the Senate is the delay on this investigation and the end of the \ninvestigation, and the investigation has found nothing on the issue of \nthis contested Senate election. We hope that we will get beyond that \nand get on with the business and not have that hanging over the head of \nSenator Landrieu or the people of Louisiana.\n  So our point is this: Let's continue with the Senate business. Let's \npass these appropriations bills, get them to the President, get them \nsigned. That is the regular order. Let's also resolve this issue with \nthe Louisiana election. It is now September. It is not March or April \nor July. It is September, and it is long past the time when that should \nhave been resolved.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, at the end of my \nremarks, to have printed in the Record the history of this type of \ninvestigation, these type of allegations and the length of time they \nhave gone on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as a matter of fact, most of them, many of \nthem, have gone on for weeks and months, including some Senators who \nserve here in the Senate right now, and they proceeded in the normal \nway. It is not my intention to delay this investigation and this \nconclusion. It is my intention to make sure that we have investigated \nall of the alleged fraud and abuses of election laws and illegal acts. \nWhen we have done that, I will press aggressively for a conclusion. But \nuntil that is done, with the cooperation of the Democrats, it will not \nend.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        Contested Election Cases\n\n    (Prepared by the Office of Senate Legal Counsel, December 1996)\n\n\n                            I. INTRODUCTION\n\n       The Constitution provides that ``Each House shall be the \n     Judge of the Elections,\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\n     Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members. . . .'' \\1\\ \n     The Senate has always been ``jealous of [this] constitutional \n     right.'' \\2\\ Courts have consistently recognized that \n     congressional actions in this area present nonjusticiable \n     political questions beyond judicial review.\\3\\ In Reed et al. \n     v. The County Comm'rs of Delaware County, Penn., the Supreme \n     Court acknowledged that the Senate is the final judge of the \n     elections of its members and held: ``[The Senate] is the \n     judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its \n     members. . . . It is fully empowered, and may determine such \n     matters without the aid of the House of Representatives or \n     the Executive or Judicial Department.'' \\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     * Footnotes at end of report.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n         II. SENATE REFUSAL TO SEAT STATE-CERTIFIED CANDIDATES\n\n       The Senate has been called upon to judge approximately 100 \n     contested election cases. On only nine occasions, however, \n     has the Senate denied a seat to the candidate whose election \n     had been certified by the state.\\5\\ Several of these cases \n     involve fact patterns that are unlikely to be at issue in \n     modern disputes. They are not examined in this memorandum.\\6\\ \n     Five cases, however, involve allegations that are more likely \n     to be at issue in modern contested election cases: challenges \n     to the accuracy of the ballot count, and challenged based on \n     claims that the election results were tainted by fraud and \n     corruption.\n\n                      A. Inaccurate ballot counts\n\n                      1. Steck v. Brookhart (1926)\n\n       The case of Steck v. Brookhart is the only occasion on \n     which the Senate has overturned the result of a state-\n     certified election and seated the contestant. Every other \n     time that the Senate has overturned the results of a state-\n     certified election, it has simply declared the seat vacant \n     and left the state to decide how it should be filled.\\7\\ In \n     1926, however, the Senate voted to unseat Republican Smith \n     Brookhart from Iowa and replace him with his general \n     election opponent, Democrat Daniel Steck.\n       Brookhart was certified the winner of the November 1924 \n     Iowa Senate election after a state recount showed that he had \n     gained a plurality of less than 800 votes out of the more \n     than 900,000 ballots cast in a four-way race. In January \n     1925, his opponent Steck filed with the Senate a challenge to \n     Brookhart's seating based on alleged irregularities in the \n     vote count. In an unusual twist, the Iowa Republican State \n     Central Committee, angered by Brookhart's failure to endorse \n     the Coolidge presidential ticket, also challenged his \n     election on the ground that Brookhart was not, as he had \n     represented himself to be, a member of the Republican Party. \n     The Senate allowed Brookhart to take his seat at the \n     beginning of the 69th Congress in March 1925 and referred the \n     challenges to the Committee on Privileges and Elections. \n     Beginning in the summer of 1925, the Committee conducted an \n     investigation of Brookhart's election, which included a \n     recount in Washington, D.C. of each of the ballots cast. In \n     March 1926, the Committee reported to the Senate that Steck \n     had received a plurality of 1,420 votes and recommended that \n     Brookhart be unseated and replaced by Steck. Much of the \n     seven-day Senate debate concerned the applicability of Iowa \n     election law to the vote count. The Committee majority took \n     the position that the Senate was not constrained by Iowa \n     law.\\8\\ On April 12, 1926, the Senate, in a vote that crossed \n     party lines and did not include Brookhart, voted by a margin \n     of 45 to 41 to unseat Brookhart and replace him with Steck.\n\n                      2. Durkin v. Wyman (1974-75)\n\n       In the 1975 contested election case of Durkin v. Wyman, the \n     Senate, rather than declare the winner as it had done in \n     Steck v. Brookhart, simply found the seat vacant. The initial \n     count of the November 1974 New Hampshire Senate election \n     showed Republican Louis Wyman ahead of Democrat John Durkin \n     by 355 votes out of more than 200,000 cast. A subsequent \n     state recount determined that Durkin had won the election by \n     ten votes, and on November 27, 1974 the governor issued \n     Durkin a ``conditional'' certificate of election. Wyman \n     challenged the certification before the New Hampshire State \n     Ballot Law Commission, which ruled on December 24, 1974 that \n     Wyman had won the election by two votes. On December 27, \n     1974, the governor rescinded Durkin's ``conditional'' \n     credentials and certified Wyman the victor. That same day, \n     Durkin filed a petition with the Senate contesting Wyman's \n     credentials. The matter was referred to the Rules Committee's \n     Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections. The Subcommittee \n     began its investigation, which included a day of hearings \n     during sine die adjournment, before the 94th Congress \n     convened. The Subcommittee refused to make a recommendation \n     and passed the case onto the full Committee, which divided \n     evenly on the matter. The full Committee then referred the \n     case to the full Senate without a recommendation.\n       When it convened in January 1975, the Senate would neither \n     seat Wyman nor declare the seat vacant. Instead, the Senate \n     referred the matter to the Rules Committee again. After much \n     debate, the Committee decided upon carefully crafted \n     procedures to recount the approximately 3,500 disputed \n     ballots. But despite spending more than 200 hours on the \n     matter, the Committee could not agree upon whom should be \n     seated. Eventually, the Committee reported the matter to the \n     Senate without a recommendation. Beginning in June 1975, the \n     Senate debated the case for six weeks. Six cloture votes \n     could not cut off the Republican-led filibuster. The Senate \n     was at an impasse. The case was resolved only when Durkin and \n     Wyman agreed in late July 1975 to support a new election. The \n     day after the candidates reached their compromise, the Senate \n     voted 71 to 21 to declare the seat vacant. That action paved \n     the way for a September 1995 election, which Durkin won \n     decisively.\n\n                          B. Corrupt elections\n\n                      1. William Lorimer (1910-12)\n\n       On three occasions the Senate has determined that an \n     election was so tainted with corruption that its results were \n     invalid. Each time, the Senate declared the seat vacant. The \n     first occurred in 1912 when the Senate voted to overturn the \n     certified election of William Lorimer of Illinois. The \n     Illinois legislature elected Lorimer to the Senate, where he \n     took his seat in 1909. In May 1910, Lorimer asked the Senate \n     to investigate allegations by the press that he had gained \n     his seat through bribery. In December 1910, the Committee on \n     Privileges and Elections reported to the Senate its \n     determination that Lorimer's election was valid. The \n     Committee majority argued for the application of a standard \n     that had been established by precedent: the Senate would \n     invalidate an election on the basis of corrupt practices only \n     if the Senator knew of or sanctioned the corrupt activities \n     or if those activities had changed the outcome of the \n     election.\\9\\ In March 1911, the Senate declared the election \n     valid.\n       Repeated press reports of bribery in Lorimer's election \n     forced the Senate to continue to probe the allegations, \n     however, and in June 1911, the Senate created a special \n     committee to conduct a second investigation. The second \n     investigation took almost a year and involved the testimony \n     of 180 witnesses. In May 1912, the special committee finally \n     reported to the Senate that it could find no evidence linking \n     Lorimer to the alleged corruption.\\10\\ A minority report, \n     however, cited evidence that seven Illinois legislators had \n     been bribed to vote for Lorimer.\\11\\ Moreover, the minority \n     believed that there was significant evidence linking Lorimer \n     to the bribes.\\12\\ The minority argued that the evidence \n     was sufficient for the Senate to rule that the election \n     was invalid. In July 1912, following a public outcry and \n     an extensive Senate debate, the full Senate sided with the \n     minority and voted 55 to 28 to declare Lorimer's election \n     invalid and his seat vacant. In a special election \n     following Lorimer's ouster, Lawrence Y. Sherman was \n     elected to fill the seat.\n\n                      2. Frank L. Smith (1926-28)\n\n       The other two instances in which the Senate declared an \n     election invalid because of corruption arose out of the work \n     of a Special Committee that was created in May 1926 to \n     investigate allegations of the corrupt use of campaign \n     expenditures in primary elections in Pennsylvania and \n     Illinois. Eventually, the scope of the Special Committee's \n     investigation expanded to include allegations of corrupt \n     practices in the November general election too. In both cases \n     the Senate departed from its normal procedure and refused to \n     seat the Senator-elect pending the outcome of its \n     investigation. This departure from practice is probably best \n     explained by the fact that an ongoing investigation had \n     already uncovered substantial evidence of fraud and \n     corruption by the time each of these Senators-elect presented \n     his credentials to the Senate.\n       Despite the negative publicity from the investigation of \n     his primary victory, Frank L. Smith won the November 1926 \n     Illinois general election. The Special Committee continued \n     its investigation and on January 17, 1928 reported to the \n     Senate its recommendation that Smith not be seated. The \n     committee concluded that Smith's election was tainted with \n     fraud and corruption because he had received campaign \n     contributions from public service corporations in Illinois \n     while he was chairman of the state agency that regulated \n     them. The Senate agreed and on January 19, 1928 voted 61 to \n     23 to deny Smith a seat. Smith resigned from office on \n     February 9, 1928. Otis F. Glenn was elected to fill the \n     vacancy, and took his seat December 3, 1928.\n\n                      3. William S. Vare (1926-29)\n\n       William S. Vare, the Republican nominee for the Senate from \n     Pennsylvania, also won the November 1926 general election \n     despite the negative publicity surrounding the Special \n     Committee's investigation of his primary win. His opponent in \n     the general election, Democrat William B. Wilson, filed a \n     petition challenging Vare's credentials, alleging corruption \n     by Vare's supporters in the general election. Wilson's \n     allegations included ``padded registration lists, `phantom' \n     voters who were actually dead or imaginary, criminal misuse \n     of campaign funds, and voter intimidation.''\\13\\ The \n     Committee on Privileges and Elections conducted an \n     investigation of Vare's general election campaign that \n     supplemented the Special Committee's investigation into \n     his primary victory. On February 22, 1929, the Special \n     Committee, after an almost three-year probe, reported to \n     the Senate its unanimous recommendation that Vare should \n     not be seated because of the evidence of corruption it had \n     uncovered, including thousands of instances of fraudulent \n     registration. On December 5, 1929, the Committee on \n     Privileges and Elections reported to the Senate its \n     contrary determination that Vare's election was lawful. \n     After a\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\n     day of debate, the Senate voted on December 6, 1929, by a \n     margin of 66 to 15, that William Wilson had not been \n     elected, and, by a margin of 58 to 22, that Vare should be \n     denied a seat. On December 12, 1929, Joseph R. Grundy took \n     Vare's seat by appointment.\n\n                          C. Recent challenges\n\n       Since 1992, three Senate elections have been contested, but \n     in none of these cases has the election result been \n     overturned. In 1992, two petitions were filed asking the \n     Senate to seat Senator-elect Coverdell conditionally pending \n     the resolution of legal complaints concerning his election. \n     One petition, filed by four Georgia citizens, asked that \n     Senator-elect Coverdell be seated conditionally pending the \n     resolution of a federal lawsuit brought by the four \n     petitioners and Public Citizens, Inc. challenging the \n     constitutionality of a Georgia law requiring a run-off \n     between the top two candidates where no single candidate has \n     won a majority in the general election. The second petition, \n     filed by three Georgia citizens, asked the Senate to seat \n     Senator-elect Coverdell conditionally until the Federal \n     Election Commission (``FEC'') had an opportunity to \n     investigate a complaint filed by the Democratic Senate \n     Campaign Committee (``DSCC'') charging that the National \n     Republican Senatorial Committee (``NRSC'') had exceeded \n     campaign spending limits during the Georgia run-off election. \n     Senator Coverdell was sworn in with accompanying language \n     noting that he was being seated ``without prejudice'' to the \n     Senate's right to consider the petitions before it.\\14\\ \n     Public Citizen's lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of \n     the 1992 run-off election was dismissed by a federal district \n     court in March 1993. The district court's decision was upheld \n     on appeal in June 1993. In April 1995, the FEC concluded that \n     it could not reach a verdict with respect to the charge that \n     the NRSC had overspent during the run-off election.\\15\\ The \n     Rules Committee took no official action on the petitions.\n       Also in 1992, several petitions contesting the election of \n     Senator Packwood were filed by Oregon voters. These \n     petitions, later consolidated, argued that Senator Packwood \n     had lied to the voters regarding his mistreatment of women \n     and had thereby ``defrauded'' the electorate. The petitions \n     asked that the election result be set aside. Like Senator \n     Coverdell, Senator Packwood was seated without prejudice to \n     the Senate's right to review the petitions.\\16\\ By a vote of \n     16-0, the Rules Committee dismissed the petitions against \n     Senator Packwood in May 1993. While the Committee did not \n     formally report to the Senate, the Chairman advised the \n     Senate of the Committee's decision not to proceed further \n     with the inquiry and the Senate took no action.\\17\\\n       Finally, in 1994 California Senatorial candidate Michael \n     Huffington filed a petition contesting the election of \n     Senator Dianne Feinstein. In his petition, Huffington argued \n     that some of the votes cast for Senator Feinstein were \n     invalid and that he had won a majority of the valid ballots \n     cast. Senator Feinstein was sworn in ``without prejudice'' to \n     the Senate's right to consider the petitions before it.\\18\\ \n     Huffington withdrew his petition before the Rules Committee \n     could report to the Senate.\\19\\\n\n\n           iii. senate procedures in contested election cases\n\n       Unlike the House of Representatives, whose election \n     contests are governed in part by codified procedures,\\20\\ \n     ``[t]he Senate has never perfected specific rules for \n     challenging the right of a claimant to serve.'' \\21\\ Rather, \n     Senate ``practice has been to consider and act upon each case \n     on its own merits, although some general principles have \n     evolved from the precedents established.'' \\22\\ A discussion \n     of those general principles is set forth below.\n\n                   A. Beginning the election contest\n\n       Senate election contests are most frequently begun with the \n     filing of a petition by the losing candidate, addressed to \n     the Senate, protesting the seating of the contestee and \n     asserting a right to the seat in question. However, there is \n     no requirement that the protest be made by a losing \n     candidate. Petitions have also been filed by interested \n     voters in the state,\\23\\ and in Steck v. Brookhart, discussed \n     above in section II, a protest was filed not only by the \n     unsuccessful Democratic candidate, but by the state's \n     Republican committee as well, which maintained that the \n     certified winner of the election was not a proper party \n     member.\\24\\ Although no rule exists, recent practice has been \n     to file the petition with the President of the Senate.\\25\\ On \n     other occasions, the petition has been sent to various \n     members of the Senate majority and minority leadership.\\26\\ \n     Petitions of contest are not the only means available for \n     instituting an election contest. A member may offer a \n     resolution calling for an investigation of an election.\\27\\ \n     In addition, the Committee on Rules and Administration has \n     asserted its right to investigate an election contest upon \n     its own motion.\\28\\ Recent Senate practice has been to \n     refrain from investigating a contested election until the \n     state has conducted its own review or recount, where such \n     state remedies were available.\\29\\\n\n                B. Senate action upon filing of petition\n\n                        1. The Decision to Seat\n\n       If a petition of contest is filed in advance of the \n     presentation of credentials and swearing-in of senators-elect \n     on the opening day of a new Congress,\\30\\ the Senate must \n     decide whether to seat the certified senator-elect pending \n     resolution of the election contest. The practice of the \n     Senate has generally been to treat a state certification that \n     appears proper on its face \\31\\ as prima facie evidence \n     that the member-elect is entitled to a Senate seat, and to \n     seat him pending determining of his right to office:\n       ``[T]he orderly and constitutional method of procedure in \n     regard to administering the oath to newly elected Senators \n     [is] that when any gentleman brings with him or presents a \n     credential consisting of the certificate of his due election \n     from the executive of his State he is entitled to be sworn \n     in, and that all questions relating to his qualification \n     should be postponed and acted upon by the Senate \n     afterwards.'' \\32\\\n       Although this has been the usual Senate practice, the \n     Senate retains its discretion to look behind such credentials \n     and to refuse to seat a member-elect until it completes its \n     adjudication of the election contest. For example, in the \n     1927 contest of Wilson v. Vare for a Pennsylvania Senate \n     seat, discussed above in section II, the Senate asked the \n     certified senator-elect, William Vare, to step aside. The \n     Senate refused to seat Vare until a special committee, \n     previously formed to investigate excessive expenditures and \n     corrupt practices in the 1926 senatorial campaigns in \n     Pennsylvania and Illinois, had completed its investigation \n     and made its final report.\\33\\ This exercise of power was \n     upheld in a case arising out of the Vare investigation, Barry \n     v. U.S. ex rel. Cunningham,\\34\\ in which the Supreme Court \n     held that the Senate had the discretion to decide whether to \n     accept Vare's credentials and administer him the oath, \n     pending adjudication of the election contest.\\35\\\n       The Senate most recently refused to seat a member-elect \n     presenting state credentials in the 1975 election contest \n     between John Durkin and Louis Wyman for a New Hampshire \n     Senate seat, also discussed above in Section II. A \n     certificate of election had been issued to Durkin, but, after \n     a recount, the certificate was rescinded and reissued to \n     Wyman. At the swearing-in of new members-elect, both Wyman \n     and Durkin were asked to stand aside,\\36\\ and the \n     certificates were referred to the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration.\\37\\ After neither the Rules Committee nor the \n     full Senate was able to resolve the dispute, the seat was \n     ultimately declared vacant.\\38\\\n       The more common practice in recent years has been to seat \n     the certified member-elect against whom a petition of contest \n     has been filed, but to administer the oath of office to him \n     ``without prejudice.'' \\39\\ The effect of administering the \n     oath without prejudice is, it has been said, ``a two-sided \n     proposition--without prejudice to the Senator and without \n     prejudice to the Senate in the exercise of its right.'' \\40\\ \n     The ``right'' of the Senate is its right, by majority vote, \n     to later unseat the member or affirm his membership after the \n     issues respecting his right to the seat are resolved.\\41\\ The \n     most recent explanation of this practice came from then \n     Majority Leader Dole at the beginning of the 104th \n     Congress in connection with administering the oath to \n     Senator-elect Feinstein, whose election had been \n     challenged by her opponent. It was Senator Dole's view \n     that the phrase ``without prejudice'' had no effect upon \n     the rights of the Senator to act as a Senator, or the \n     rights of the Senate to act as the judge of the Senator's \n     election:\n       ``The oath that will be administered to Senator Feinstein, \n     just as the oath that will be administered to all other \n     Senators-elect, will be without prejudice to the Senate's \n     constitutional power to be the judge of the election of its \n     members. . . . [T]he making of this statement [that the oath \n     is administered ``without prejudice''] prior to the swearing \n     in of a challenge[d] Senator-elect serves the purpose of \n     acknowledging formally that the Senate has received an \n     election petition and that it will review the petition in \n     accordance with its customary procedures.''--141 Cong. Rec. \n     S4 (daily ed. Jan. 4, 1995).\\42\\\n\n                       2. Reference to committee\n\n       The petition of contest and other papers that have been \n     filed relating to an election contest are referred to the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration for investigation and \n     recommendations.\\43\\ The committee has jurisdiction over \n     ``[c]redentials and qualifications of Members of the Senate \n     [and] contested elections'' \\44\\ Under the rules of the \n     Senate, standing committees continue in existence and \n     maintain their power during the recesses and adjournments of \n     the Senate.\\45\\ The committee, on the basis of this rule and \n     the Senate precedents that underlie it, has asserted its \n     power to continue investigations without interruption during \n     periods of adjournment.\\46\\ The committee has also began \n     investigations of election contests in advance of the \n     convening of the Congress to which the member-elect was \n     elected.\\47\\\n\n                  C. Committee practice and procedure\n\n                   1. Pleadings before the committee\n\n       In most election cases, the protest takes the form of a \n     petition and complaint, similar to that in a lawsuit, \n     describing in varying detail the grounds upon which the \n     challenge is based. The contestee files a response, typically \n     in the form of an answer or an answer combined with a motion \n     to dismiss. The parties may submit follow-up replies, and in \n     some cases the contestant, either on his own or upon the \n     request of the committee, may file one or more amended \n     complaints. In addition to formal pleadings, the parties may\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\n     submit various legal memoranda on issues relevant to the \n     investigation, for example, on questions concerning the scope \n     and applicability of the state's election laws.\\48\\\n\n                         2. Committee hearings\n\n       Committee hearings may be held not only in Washington, but \n     also at the site of the election\\49\\ The parties and their \n     counsel are generally permitted an active role in \n     these hearings. Either the contestants or their counsel \n     typically make opening statements,\\50\\ and counsel may be \n     permitted to make subsequent legal arguments and otherwise \n     present their client's positions during the hearings.\\51\\ \n     The parties may be permitted to call witnesses,\\52\\ and \n     counsel may be given the right to question and cross-\n     examine witnesses themselves.\\53\\ As might be expected \n     given the politically charged nature of the issues that \n     may arise in these disputes, hearings may be lengthy, \n     particularly if a recount is conducted. For example, the \n     Rules Committee held 46 sessions and 698 rollcall votes in \n     its attempt to resolve the Durkin v. Wyman content.\\54\\\n\n                    3. Committee recount procedures\n\n       In many cases, the nature of the protest is such that the \n     committee will not engage in a recount. In some cases, no \n     recount will be requested by the contestant. For example, in \n     the 1975 Edmondson v. Bellmon contest, the challenger's sole \n     complaint was that the voting machines in one county had been \n     programmed in violation of Oklahoma law.\\55\\ In other cases, \n     the committee may decide to make its recommendations \n     exclusively on the basis of the pleadings and other evidence \n     introduced by the parties, and reject any full-scale \n     investigation or recount.\\56\\ The committee may also refuse \n     to conduct a recount because of the contestant's failure to \n     exhaust available state recount procedures.\\57\\ The decision \n     to conduct a recount is generally made by the formal adoption \n     of a resolution by the committee; \\58\\ the resolution may \n     authorize a recount on less than a statewide basis, limited \n     to selected counties in the state or to a particular group of \n     protested ballots.\\59\\\n       The first step of a recount is to secure immediate \n     possession of all election records bearing on the contest. \n     Most Senate recounts have been conducted in Washington.\\60\\ \n     Committee staff members, often together with the Sergeant at \n     Arms, may be sent to the state to seal all voting machines \n     and to bring back paper ballots, tally sheets, ballot stubs, \n     and other election records.\\61\\ In some cases, committee \n     subpoenas have been issued to the responsible state election \n     officials to obtain these records.\\62\\ Stringent security \n     precautions have been observed in transporting these \n     materials to Washington and in storing them during the \n     recount. For example, in the Durkin  v. Wyman contest, \n     ballots were kept in a locked room in the basement of the \n     Russell Office Building with Capitol Police officers on \n     guard around the clock; two padlocks were placed on the \n     door, with a different key given to the ranking majority \n     and minority members of the committee.\\63\\\n       Often extensive field investigations may be necessary at \n     various stages of the recount process. Voting machines may \n     need to be inspected to verify that the machines accurately \n     recorded the votes cast and that the total votes recorded on \n     the machines corresponds with the number of voters listed on \n     the pollbooks.\\64\\ Registration records may need to be \n     examined and compared with the pollbooks to ensure that only \n     legally authorized voters are included in the count.\\65\\ In \n     many election cases, charges of a wide variety of election \n     irregularities will be at issue, such as illegal assistance \n     or corruption of voters, tampering with ballot boxes or voter \n     machines, violation of the secrecy of the ballot, and \n     fraudulently altered ballots. Investigation of such questions \n     may require a significant commitment of committee manpower. \n     For example, in investigating charges of violations of New \n     Mexico voters' constitutional right to a secret ballot in \n     Hurley v. Chavez, committee investigators interviewed and \n     obtained signed and witnessed statements from thousands of \n     voters throughout the state. A number of Spanish-speaking \n     investigators were engaged by the committee to aid in this \n     effort.\\66\\\n\n                4. Committee report and recommendations\n\n       Upon the completion of its investigation and any recount, \n     the committee submits to the Senate a report, together with \n     an accompanying resolution, recommending a final disposition \n     of the election contest. The report may also contain minority \n     views.\\67\\ There are several courses of action that the \n     committee may recommend to the Senate. The committee may \n     recommend that the petition of contest by dismissed. \n     Dismissals of contests are commonly based on the ground that \n     the allegations of the petition are too general to justify \n     committee investigation.\\68\\ or that even if the allegations \n     are accepted as true, they would be insufficient to affect \n     the result of the election.\\69\\ Alternatively, based upon its \n     investigation, the committee may recommend that a certain \n     candidate has received a majority of the valid votes and \n     should be declared the winner.\\70\\ Finally, the committee may \n     conclude that no winner can be determined, and recommend that \n     the election be set aside and the seat declared vacant so \n     that a special election can be held.\n       However, in the two most recent Senate contested election \n     cases in which the full Senate has acted, both occurring \n     during the 94th Congress, the committee was unable to agree \n     upon recommendations for final disposition of the contests. \n     As noted in the Durkin v. Wyman contest, the inability of the \n     committee to resolve the numerous issues on which it was \n     evenly divided prevented it from reaching agreement on a \n     final recommendation; the committee was able only to report a \n     resolution seeking Senate determination of the issues upon \n     which the committee had deadlocked.\\72\\ In the Edmondson v. \n     Bellmon contest the committee found that the Oklahoma \n     election laws had been violated and that those violations \n     could have affected the results of the election, but it was \n     unable to determine who would have won the election had the \n     violations of law not occurred. The committee reported a \n     resolution requesting that the Senate determine the \n     outcome of the election.\\73\\ A minority report, which \n     charged that the majority report was partisan, recommended \n     that the challenge be dismissed. After four days of \n     debate, the Senate voted 47 to 46 to table the majority's \n     resolution. By voice vote the Senate then declared that \n     the state-certified victor should keep his seat.\n\n                         D. Standard of review\n\n       The contestant in an election has the burden of proof to \n     establish, by a preponderance of evidence,\\74\\ the \n     allegations raised in his petition. Sufficient evidence must \n     be offered to overcome the presumption that the official \n     returns are prima facie evidence of the regularity and \n     correctness of the election\\75\\ and that election officials \n     have properly performed their legal duties.\\76\\ Not only must \n     the contestant overcome these presumptions of regularity, but \n     he must affirmatively establish that the irregularities \n     complained of would affect the result of the election.\\77\\ In \n     addition to these general standards, common to all election \n     contests, the committee will often adopt detailed evidentiary \n     presumptions to govern its consideration of the factual \n     issues that may be raised in a particular contest.\\78\\\n\n                 E. Application of State election laws\n\n       The Senate has generally attempted to observe state \n     election laws in resolving election contests. However, as the \n     final judge of its elections, the Senate is not bound by \n     state election laws, and has exercised its power to disregard \n     those laws, especially in instances where their technical \n     application would invalidate the will of the voters.\\79\\ As \n     Senator Cannon stated about the Senate's investigation of the \n     Durkin v. Wyman contest, ``The U.S. Senate, as the final \n     judge or arbiter of elections, returns, and qualifications of \n     its Members, is not bound by the statutes and case law of a \n     State, although the committee has consistently given weight \n     to the New Hampshire law consistent with the attempt to \n     determine the intent of the voter.'' \\80\\ In determining \n     whether to give effect to state election laws, a distinction \n     is often drawn between ``directory'' and ``mandatory'' \n     provisions of state law. ``Mandatory'' provisions affecting \n     the right of suffrage itself have been more strictly followed \n     than ``directory'' provisions, such as those governing \n     ministerial functions of state election officials and \n     technical requirements concerning the manner of marking \n     ballots.\n\n                         F. Senate disposition\n\n       Election contests are generally disposed of, following \n     floor consideration and debate, pursuant to Senate \n     resolution. A resolution from the committee disposing of a \n     contested election case is highly privileged; it does not \n     have to lie over a day and has precedence over most \n     unfinished business or motions.\\81\\ The parties to the \n     election contest, including bona fide claimants and senators-\n     elect who have not been permitted to take the oath of \n     office, are usually granted floor privileges during the \n     debate on the election contest;\\82\\ occasionally, they \n     have even been granted the privilege of addressing the \n     Senate to present their case. \\83\\\n       The Senate may adopt a resolution dismissing the complaint; \n     such resolutions are frequently adopted by unanimous consent \n     with little or no floor debate.\\84\\ If a senator-elect who \n     has previously been sworn in is determined by the Senate to \n     be entitled to the seat, the resolution will declare that he \n     was duly elected for a six-year term as of the date he \n     received the oath.\\85\\ Where the contestant is declared the \n     winner and the incumbent is unseated, or if no one had \n     earlier been sworn in, upon adoption of the resolution, the \n     prevailing party has been immediately given the oath of \n     office and seated.\\86\\ In most instances, where the Senate \n     has determined that the state-certified victor should not be \n     seated, it has declared the seat vacant.\\87\\\n\n             G. Reimbursement of election contest expenses\n\n       The Senate has by resolution authorized the payment of \n     expenses incurred by the parties in contested election \n     cases.\\88\\ Reimbursement is not automatic, however, and the \n     Senate has refused to authorize payment of expenses even in \n     instances where the committee recommended such payment.\\89\\ \n     Most of these resolutions authorizing reimbursement specify \n     the amount of the payments, typically less than the actual \n     expenses incurred by the parties during the contest. In the \n     Durkin v. Wyman contest, however, the resolution authorized \n     payments out of the contingent fund of the Senate to \n     reimburse both Durkin and Wyman in an amount to be determined \n     by the committee.\\90\\\n\n\n                  duration of contested election cases\n\n                             Investigations\n\n       Edmondson v.

The Senate has also refused to seat members-elect \n     presenting credentials in a number of cases predating the \n     adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. In many of \n     these cases, the credentials were invalid for reasons either \n     apparent on their face or otherwise within the knowledge of \n     the Senate, for example, because a governor was attempting to \n     make an appointment to fill a vacancy which had not been \n     filled by the legislature while it was in session. E.g. \n     Matthew Quay (1899), id. at 261-62; Henry W. Corbett (1897), \n     id. at 253-55; Lee Mantle (1893), id. at 243-45. A number of \n     cases involved instances where more than one candidate \n     presented credentials for a seat. E.g., Lucas v. Faulkner \n     (1887), id. at 230-31; Reynolds v. Hamilton (1870), id. at \n     164-65; Stanton v. Lane (1861), id. at 92-94.

Id. In 1993 Senators Coverdell and \n     Packwood took the oath of office while challenges to their \n     election were pending.

Amendment No. 1077 is now pending.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we will be resuming discussion of the \namendment I offered last evening. I don't intend to repeat all that I \nsaid last evening. I do know there are a few other Senators who wish to \nspeak on this amendment, and, hopefully, we can accomplish that in a \nreasonable time and then move to a vote.\n  It is not my intention to utilize this amendment as a means of \ndelaying a vote on the larger appropriations bill or specifically on \nthe amendment that we adopted last evening, increasing funding for \nParkinson's research, an amendment I supported and worked together with \nSenator Wellstone and others on this effort. I was pleased the Senate \nadopted my amendment related to the whole area of medical research so \nthat we can commission a study which would give us, before the next \nappropriations and authorization cycle, a better idea of how we can \ndirect research funds to achieve the greatest good for the greatest \nnumber.\n  There are allocations currently made on the basis of who has the best \nlobbying effort and perhaps who has the best champion in the Congress. \nWhile I don't in any way mean to impugn the motives of anyone here who \nis putting their heart and soul into providing support for research on \na disease that affects them or that they believe is important and \ncritical, I do think that in the interest of the widespread number of \ndiseases that are currently under research at NIH and other places and \nthe Federal funds that are used for that research, having a better \nunderstanding of where we can best apply those dollars to achieve the \nbreakthroughs that can prevent the suffering and, hopefully, provide \nthe cures for a number of these diseases is the direction we ought to \ngo. We adopted that amendment last evening, and I am pleased the Senate \nsupported that.\n  This particular amendment is designed to address a specific issue \nthat relates to the utilization of human fetal tissue in research in a \nnumber of neurological disease areas. There is a broader question of \nwhether we ought to utilize human fetal tissue and put restrictions on \nhow that is sustained as\n\n[[Page S8773]]\n\napplies to neurological research in a whole number of areas--\nParkinson's, diabetes, and there are a number of other neurological \ntraumas that this could apply to. However, this specific amendment \napplies only to research in Parkinson's.\n  I offer it because this is really the issue in terms of where we are \napplying specific research and increase in research dollars, and we \nwill leave the discussion as it applies to other neurological disease \nresearch areas to the NIH reauthorization bill or a more appropriate \ntime. But I believe it is relevant to this particular issue because we \nare addressing the question of Parkinson's research.\n  I will summarize the two arguments that I made last evening. One is \nthat we really don't have a pressing need to utilize human fetal tissue \nobtained through abortions other than human fetal tissue that is \nobtained through spontaneous miscarriages and through ectopic \npregnancies. Because we have available to us some information that \nindicates that there is a diminishing viability of the utilization of \nhuman fetal tissue for Parkinson's research--it hasn't proved to be the \npromising breakthrough that we once thought it would be--there are \nalternatives to the utilization of human fetal tissue, specifically \ncell engineering, specifically utilization of animal fetal tissue, \ngenetic engineering, and some other alternatives.\n  Second, there are more promising areas of research that don't involve \nhuman fetal tissue at all, that involve brain implants, that involve a \nnumber of other research areas which I could detail, but I did last \nevening and I won't do that again.\n  More importantly, however, than the question of whether or not this \nis even necessary to continue significant and important human fetal \ntissue in Parkinson's research, more importantly and most importantly, \nthere are ethical considerations that I believe ought to give us \nsignificant pause before we just simply allow the utilization of human \nfetal tissue research.\n  A number of moral and ethical questions have been raised, and I \nraised those last evening. I think Members ought to consider those, \nparticularly those who perhaps don't have a personal concern about the \nutilization of fetal tissue research. It ought to be considered by them \nparticularly since we have alternatives that allow us to address this \nproblem without utilization of human fetal tissue for this research. If \nmedical research becomes dependent on widespread abortion--and this is \na concern because if human fetal tissue is determined to be effective \nin treatment, when we look at the whole widespread area of neurological \nresearch, we are talking of potentially utilization of fetal tissue of \nup to 20 million fetuses. That presents a wrenching dilemma for those \nof us, and I think that is most of us in this body, who believe that \nabortion ought to be rare, if not banned. For those who say it ought to \nbe legal, safe and rare, we certainly would not be moving down a path \nthat would allow us to limit abortions to only those that are most \nmedically necessary.\n  Second, let me just say that the dilemma that is posed is that the \nperson who is responsible for the termination of the life of the child \nis the very person who gives the consent for the use of fetal brain \ntissue from that particular child. It is not consent of the child for \nutilization of the tissue. The very person who volunteers to have an \ninduced abortion gives consent for the utilization of fetal brain \ntissue for one who has no voice in that consent. I think that presents \na real ethical and moral dilemma that each of us ought to contemplate \nbefore we cast our vote in favor of the use of human fetal tissue.\n  Third, I think there is a concern that we might be encouraging \nabortion by covering it with a veneer of compassion. ``After all, there \nis a benefit,'' the thinking goes. ``There is a benefit to this \nabortion because the product of the abortion can be used in alleviating \nhuman suffering.''\n  We all want to alleviate human suffering. We all want to do \neverything that we possibly can to find a cure for these diseases. And \nyet we have to be confronted with the moral and ethical dilemma of the \npossibility of the abortionist, the person encouraging the abortion, \ncovering the fundamental underlying question about the life of a child \nby saying, ``Well, after all, we can mitigate your concerns because \nlook at the good that it will do, the side benefit of the good that it \nwill do.'' Ultimately that is a question that is a great question that \nought to be pondered by each of us before we just simply say there is a \ngreat benefit to this fetal tissue research.\n  So on the narrow question of whether or not fetal tissue is necessary \nfor significant Parkinson's research, I think we have answered the \nquestion in saying it isn't. There are alternatives available and there \nare many more promising areas of research that can lead us to \nbreakthroughs in Parkinson's research.\n  And on the question of the moral, ethical dilemma, we can address \nthat dilemma, particularly in this specific narrow area, by not \nallowing the use of human fetal tissue research with the exception that \nthe research can go forward with fetal tissue obtained from spontaneous \nabortions or fetal tissue obtained from ectopic pregnancies.\n  So it seems to me that we have addressed this issue in a way that \nallows the research to go forward, utilization of alternatives other \nthan induced abortions, on a voluntary consent basis, and in ways that \nwill not present us with this horrible ethical and moral dilemma that I \nthink deserves great consideration before Members vote. That is the \ncrux of the dilemma that I have presented. I hope Members consider that \ncarefully before they cast their votes and not simply be caught up in \n``this is anti-Parkinson's, this impedes Parkinson's research, this has \nnothing to do with abortion, this has nothing to do with the \nfundamental moral questions here.''\n  We can address this and then save and reserve the greater debate in \nterms of utilization of human fetal tissue for other neurological \nresearch at a time when we are addressing that specific bill. So that \nis the crux of the argument, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor at this particular point in hopes that we can move \nforward to a successful resolution of this particular issue. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one thing should be very clear in this \ndiscussion. This is not a debate that pits those who are pro-choice \nagainst those who are antiabortion. In fact, it is not a debate about \nabortion at all. The issue is whether Americans suffering from a host \nof dreaded diseases are going to have the benefits of the best and most \nethical medical science possible.\n  Though the Senator has targeted his particular amendment on one \nparticular disease, there is a broader issue that is raised and that \nought to be considered, because if we accept it for this disease, it is \ngoing to be accepted obviously for the other diseases of which this \nprocess, this procedure is applicable.\n  Mr. President, let us review the record. And there is an extensive \nrecord because the Senate has already voted on this issue a number of \ntimes and spoken decisively in favor of ethical, controlled, \nscientifically valuable fetal tissue research.\n  In 1988, a Reagan commission, a panel of experts consisting of \ntheologians, scientists, legal experts, ethicists, and pro-life \nactivists studied this issue extensively and voted 18 to 3 to lift the \nmoratorium on fetal tissue transplantation research.\n  In 1992, both the House and the Senate overwhelmingly approved bills \nto lift the moratorium. The vote in the Senate was 87 to 10. This \nlegislation was vetoed by President Bush.\n  Again in 1993, the Senate voted to approve fetal tissue funding for \nthis vital research. That vote was 93 to 4.\n  Each of these votes was preceded by exhaustive debate, careful \nconsideration of all the issues and concerns associated with fetal \ntissue research. Each time the support for and recognition of the need \nfor this research was overwhelming. Over the last decade, opponents of \nfetal tissue research have attempted to create a connection between \nabortion and fetal tissue testing. The use of fetal tissue in medical \nresearch cannot and should not be associated with the abortion issue. \nPast and\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\npresent supporters, pro-life and pro-choice alike, have clearly stated \nthat fetal tissue research is a medical, not a moral, issue.\n  Many of my antiabortion colleagues, including Senator Dole and \nSenator Thurmond, spoke in support of fetal tissue research during the \n1992 debates. They, like many others, recognized that supporting this \nresearch is the true pro-life position because it offers hope and a \nchance for a better life to individuals suffering from such terrible \nafflictions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, \nbirth defects, and spinal cord injuries.\n  Yesterday, we heard a number of arguments against this research. And \nI would like to review and respond to these arguments for the benefit \nof my colleagues because they are based on a misunderstanding of the \nfacts.\n  First, we heard that fetal tissue research was no longer needed for \nthe study of Parkinson's disease. Information from the Parkinson's \nAction Network was cited in support of these claims. I have today a \nletter from the Parkinson's Action Network correcting the Record. The \nletter states that fetal tissue transplant research shows tremendous \npromise. In fact it shows such promise that persons currently afflicted \nwith Parkinson's are looking to the research as a likely source of \nmajor therapeutic benefit to them--if the research is not halted.\n  The letter further states that alternative sources of cells, such as \ngenetically engineered cells, pig cells, and stem cells, may eliminate \nthe need for cells from abortions to be used in the future. At the \npresent time, however, it is vital that the research be allowed to \ncontinue so that the therapy and the alternative cell sources can be \ndeveloped at the same time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Parkinson's Action Network,\n\n                                                September 3, 1997.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: Senator Coats' remarks have cited the \n     Parkinson's Action Network's fact sheets, but by taking them \n     out of context twisted their message. The following is the \n     case:\n       Fetal tissue transplant research shows tremendous promise \n     (see attached memo). The research in fact shows such promise \n     that persons currently afflicted are looking to the research \n     as likely to be a major therapeutic benefit to them--if the \n     research is not stopped.\n       The alternative sources of cells, such as genetically \n     engineered cells, pig cells and stem cells, will prevent the \n     need for aborted tissue to be needed in the future. At this \n     point, however, it is vital that the research be allowed to \n     continue, so that the therapy can be developed and the \n     alternative cell sources developed at the same time.\n       There is not one reported violation of the ethical \n     protections separating the abortion decision and the abortion \n     procedure from the use of tissue. See GAO Report, March 1997. \n     Thus, contrary to Senator Coats statements there is no \n     evidence of changes in the abortion procedure in any instance \n     at all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Joan L. Samuelson, J.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We also heard allegations that providers were altering \nthe methods of abortion to obtain tissue suitable for research \npurposes, thereby putting women's health at risk.\n  NIH guidelines provide that ``no abortion should be scheduled or \notherwise accommodated to suit the requirements of research.'' To do so \nwould be a clear violation of the safeguards that Congress enacted into \nthe law.\n  As part of its 1997 study of adherence to these and other guidelines \nto assure that the research was conducted ethically, the GAO contacted \nthe NIH's Office of Protection from Research Risks as well as the \ninstitutional review boards of each of the institutions conducting \nfetal tissue research and found that no violations of tissue donation \nrestrictions had been reported or detected. None.\n  My staff called NIH this morning to verify that no violations have \nbeen detected or reported since the GAO study was completed, and we \nwere told that there were none.\n  Concern was also expressed that the success of fetal tissue therapies \nwould create an economic link between abortion providers and the \nresearch community. Again, I point to the NIH safeguards which prohibit \nthe purchase of fetal tissue. Since no economic incentives exist for \nabortion providers, it is impossible to create an economic link between \nproviders and the research community.\n  This issue has been debated and debated. Each time the opponents of \nthe research have tried to argue that fetal tissue research will \nsomehow stimulate abortions. Each time these arguments have ignored the \nextent of safeguards built into the law and regulations to assure that \nthere is no link between the decision to have an abortion and the \ndecision to allow fetal tissue research to be conducted. Each time \nthese arguments have been rejected by the Senate and the American \npublic.\n  The preservation and enhancement of life is the foundation of this \nresearch. Fetal tissue research and transplantation are not just \nclinical abstractions, they are transforming the lives of Americans \nevery day.\n  A 55-year-old man who suffered with Parkinson's disease for more than \n20 years and had lost much of his mobility is now able to climb \nmountains. A 58-year-old woman suffering from the disease for 14 years \nused to begin her day by literally crawling to take her first dose of \nmedication. She is now able to ski and play tennis.\n  The benefits of fetal tissue research are not limited to Parkinson's \ndisease. Recent breakthroughs in the study of treatments for a host of \nother diseases and conditions, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, \nspinal cord injuries, blindness, Huntington's disease, cancer, birth \ndefects, multiple sclerosis, and conditions causing intractable pain, \nare the direct result of fetal tissue research conducted on Parkinson's \ndisease. If this amendment is adopted on this disease, it will be \nreadily applied to those as well.\n  Any attempt to turn back the progress made in this area by placing \nrestrictions on Parkinson's research will jeopardize further advances \nin the treatment of these conditions. These setbacks and delays will \nlead to unnecessary suffering for the millions of Americans afflicted \nwith illnesses that are currently benefiting from Parkinson's research. \nMake no mistake about it, if the fetal tissue research is banned for \nParkinson's disease today, it will be banned for every other disease \ntomorrow.\n  Every time this issue has been put to the Senate, it has spoken \nstrongly in favor of ethical, scientific, promising medical research \nthat offers hope to millions of Americans. I urge the Senate to \nreaffirm that commitment by rejecting the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will take just a moment of the Senate's time to \nreview the set of eight requirements that were established in the 1993 \nlegislation.\n  First, informed consent of the donor must be obtained. Each woman \nmust sign a written statement that she is donating fetal tissue for \nresearch without knowing who the recipient will be.\n  Second, the physician obtaining the tissue must make a written \nstatement declaring that consent for the abortion was obtained prior to \nthe consent of the donation and that the abortion was not performed \nsolely for the purposes of obtaining the tissue.\n  Third, the researcher using the tissue must sign a statement \nacknowledging that the tissue is human tissue and that it was obtained \nfrom an induced abortion or stillbirth. He or she must also agree to \ninform all subsequent users or recipients of those facts.\n  Any recipient of transplanted tissue must sign a statement indicating \nthat he or she is aware that the transplant tissue is human tissue and \nthat it was obtained from an induced abortion or a stillbirth.\n  Each agency head must certify that copies of all signed statements \nwill be available for audit by the Secretary of HHS.\n  Recipients of funding for research must agree to conduct research in \naccordance with applicable State laws.\n  HHS must submit an annual report to Congress detailing compliance \nwith these requirements.\n  And the purchase of fetal tissue is prohibited and no donated tissue \ncan be transplanted into a recipient specified by the donor.\n  These were guidelines developed by theological, ethical, and \nreligious people, as well as researchers. And we have the GAO study. \nAnd I will include the relevant parts of this study that was conducted \nby the NIH reviewing this particular program from 1993 to 1997.\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\n  And as the results say--I am directly quoting ``Results in Brief''--\n``There's been no reported violations in the acquisition of human fetal \ntissue for use in transplantation according to NIH and our verification \nefforts.''\n  By just reviewing this report, and I will not take the additional \ntime unless there are further questions about it, there is a very clear \nindication that the guidelines that have been established in the 1993 \nlegislation have been conformed with. It does not say there have been \nsome violations. It does not say there is an increasing number of \nviolations. It does not say that the GAO recommends further \ncongressional action. It says there have been no violations, none, in \n1997.\n  Mr. President, at a time when there have been extraordinary \nopportunities for progress in treating Parkinson's disease and so many \nother diseases and conditions, and with the kind of protections that \nhave been agreed to by ethicists, those religious and research panels \ninvestigating the utilization of this type of material, and with all of \nthe hope and opportunity this provides to so many American families in \naddressing some of the most prominent ailments suffered by mankind, to \ntry and restrict fetal tissue research in Parkinson's disease and in \nother areas would be a dramatic and a serious mistake and would have a \nvery significant and, I believe, grave impact and effect on the \nresearch and the opportunity for important progress in helping to \nrelieve the pain and anxiety associated with these various diseases.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for laying out the case as to why the Coats amendment \nought to be defeated.\n  I also want to thank Senator Paul Wellstone for working so hard on \nthis issue. He shared with me some very important information from the \nParkinson's Action Network, which also lays out the case in a very \nclear-cut way, by people who really know about what it is like to have \nthis disease and how devastating it would be if the ban on fetal tissue \nresearch was put back into law.\n  For 8 years there was a ban on this research under the Reagan and \nBush years. Finally, that ban was lifted, and we are seeing hope for \nmany, many people all over this country. We really cannot go backward \nnow.\n  I have said often on this Senate floor in relation to health issues \nthat come before the Senate that when we act, we ought to act to \nimprove the health of the American people. But at the minimum, Mr. \nPresident, we should do no harm. At the minimum, when we take a vote \naround here, we should make sure we are not hurting people.\n  I think the Coats amendment would definitely hurt people, a million \npeople who have Parkinson's disease, not to mention the others who may \nwell get it as a result of this amendment, because this amendment would \nstop the progress on fetal tissue research in reference to Parkinson's \ndisease. The prohibition in this amendment eliminates medical research, \nwhich shows significant promise of treatment or prevention of this \ntragic disease.\n  Let's take a moment to talk about Parkinson's disease and the real \npeople it affects. According to the NIH, almost 1 million people suffer \nfrom Parkinson's disease in the United States alone, with about 50,000 \nnew cases reported each and every year. There is a myth out there that \nthe symptoms begin appearing very late in life. That is not so. The \nsymptoms begin fairly early in life, sometimes in the twenties, \nthirties, and forties. The average age of the disease is 57. I, myself, \nknow several middle-aged mothers with children who suffer from this \ndisease.\n  The hallmark symptom of Parkinson's disease is the shaking or \ntrembling of a limb, and in the later stages, a slow shuffling walk and \nstooped posture, not to mention the effects on speech. I know one \nParkinson's victim who actually has to crawl around his home--a proud, \nprofessional man who has to crawl around his home. The only hope he \nhas, because he has told me this, is fetal tissue research. This man \nhas a family. This man has grandchildren. They are watching this debate \nand they are praying that we will reject this amendment.\n  Will we deny these people the possibility of a healthier life, which \nmay well result from fetal tissue research, which is already showing \ngreat promise, as Senator Kennedy has said? Will we deny these people \nhope? Will we do harm today to these people when we have not yet found \na cure for Parkinson's? I certainly hope not.\n  I received a letter yesterday from two medical doctors at the \nParkinson's Action Network in Santa Rosa, CA. They emphasize the \ntremendous need to be able to continue to use fetal tissue in their \nfight against Parkinson's disease. Let me read from these physicians. \nThey know what they are talking about.\n\n       Neural cell transplantation using fetal tissue has greatly \n     advanced our understanding of ways to replace degenerating \n     cells in the brain. From this work, in addition, alternatives \n     to fetal tissue may be developed. To close off arbitrarily \n     any particular area of investigation is potentially to retard \n     progress across a broad front by many months, perhaps many \n     years.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       The ban on fetal research during the 1980's was a crippling \n     blow to progress in many areas, including Parkinson's \n     disease, Huntington's and Lou Gehrig's disease, spinal cord \n     injury, and diabetes.\n\n  These doctors are telling us don't go back to the eighties, don't go \nback to the years where we stopped this important research.\n  Mr. President, I will share with you the comments of Dr. Jack Lewin, \na medical doctor who is executive vice president and CEO of the \nCalifornia Medical Association, the largest State medical association \nin the Nation, which has over 38,000 physicians. Dr. Lewin stated:\n\n       Research involving the use of human fetal tissue is \n     responsible, high-integrity research. Using human fetal \n     tissue to find cures for or to alleviate the symptoms of \n     diseases such as Parkinson's disease is a life-giving \n     procedure.\n\n  Mr. President, I repeat that: ``Using human fetal tissue to find \ncures for or to alleviate the symptoms of diseases such as Parkinson's \ndisease is a life-giving procedure.''\n  We are giving life with this procedure. Why would we vote to take \naway life by going back to the eighties when we had a ban on this \nbecause of politics? There is no place for that in this debate.\n  Dr. Lewin said that the California Medical Association promotes all \nlegitimate research, including research involving fetal tissue. He \ncontinues:\n\n       It is important to dispel the myth that this research \n     promotes abortion. This is not the case. On the contrary, \n     research involving fetal tissue promotes the healing of \n     crippling diseases. This research shows promise and needs to \n     be pursued.\n\n  Now, on the issue of abortion, I am going to refer to the history of \nthis issue where in 1991 and 1992, there was legislation passed which \ndirectly confronted this ethical and moral issue which Senator Coats \ntalked about today. He says we must confront this ethical and moral \nissue. He is right. We did do that. We did do that in 1991 and 1992. \nLet's discuss what is in place today in terms of the moral and ethical \nissues of abortion and fetal tissue research.\n  First, a woman may not be approached for consent to donate the \naborted tissue until after she has made the decision to have an \nabortion. So, no woman can be told this prior to her decision.\n  Second, the donor may never be paid for donation of the tissue. It is \noutlawed. No one can get a single penny for donating fetal tissue.\n  Third, the donor may not designate who will be the recipient of the \ntissue, nor ever be informed of the recipient's identity.\n  This is not a question where, say, a daughter says, ``I will become \npregnant, have an abortion and let my father regain the use of his \nlife.'' This cannot be done.\n  I think what is very important to know is that if you violate this \nlaw, you could be punished by 10 years in a Federal prison. We had a \nreport and the report came back: ``There have been no violations in the \nacquisition of human fetal tissue research for use in \ntransplantation.''\n  So when Senator Coats talks about confronting the ethical and moral \nissues, those issues were confronted in 1991 and 1992, and the Research \nFreedom Act clearly addresses this issue.\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\nThere has been no violation at all. If all of our laws were so \neffective, I think we would be very proud.\n  Let me offer a specific example of how doctors are using fetal tissue \nto improve people's lives. Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles was \none of the first hospitals in the country to offer a new, promising \nsurgical procedure using fetal tissue transplants. Many of the patients \nwho received this procedure did so only after one of the most common \ndrugs was no longer effective in helping their illness and their \nsymptoms had worsened, some to the point where they compared their \nconditions to rigor mortis--in other words, total stiffness and \ninability to move.\n  Today, the vast majority of the more than 40 Parkinson's patients who \nhave undergone the procedure at Good Samaritan have experienced \nmoderate to substantial improvements in their condition. This is a \nlife-giving procedure. This procedure gives life, gives movement to \npeople. The issue of abortion is addressed in the Research Freedom Act \nand has been confronted and not one violation has occurred. We should \nbe proud, all of us together.\n  According to Dr. Oleg Kopyov, more than 70 percent of the patients \nwho got this transplant have shown ``statistically significant \nimprovement'' on standard neurological tests. The other 30 percent are \nnow taking 20 to 40 percent less medication. None of the patients' \nParkinson's symptoms have worsened following neurotrans-plantation.\n  Do no harm. We should do no harm. The Coats amendment does harm, \ndirect harm, to good Americans, and it takes away hope from a million \npeople with Parkinson's in America. Said hospital neurosurgeon Dr. \nDeane Jacques:\n\n       We are proud to be in the forefront of treatments like \n     neurotransplantation, which clearly have enhanced patients' \n     quality of life.\n\n  Yet another example of the tremendous effects and great potential of \nthis research comes from Colorado. A professor at the University of \nColorado Health Sciences Center, who is conducting a study using fetal \ntissue, described the incredible effects on one participant earlier \nthis year. He is quoted as saying:\n\n       We have a woman who could never walk prior to taking her \n     first dose of drugs in the morning. Now she can walk before \n     her first dose of drugs, and has resumed playing tennis. A \ntypical transplant patient cuts the drug by 40 to 50 percent.\n\n  Why would we inject ourselves into this important nonpolitical health \nissue when, in fact, the issue of abortion has been successfully \naddressed in the Research Freedom Act? I cannot understand why this \namendment is before us.\n  Mr. President, these are significant results of helping people. Why \nwould we even consider closing the door on this promising life-giving \nresearch? We make progress in research by opening doors, not by closing \ndoors.\n  I want to bring back the words of South Carolina Senator Strom \nThurmond that he spoke on this Senate floor in 1992 when he urged this \nbody to lift the ban on fetal tissue research. He said, ``We cannot \nafford to lose this opportunity to develop a cure.''\n  The Senator was speaking in reference to his daughter Julie, who has \ndiabetes. He stated, ``As a parent of a diabetic, I have a personal \nappreciation for the urgent need for a cure.'' Those were Senator \nThurmond's words back then.\n  No doubt this sentiment is shared today by the parents, siblings, and \nchildren of those suffering from serious debilitating diseases such as \nParkinson's disease.\n  Senator Coats said we are only stopping the fetal tissue research for \nParkinson's disease. Yes, that is on this bill. What is the next one \ngoing to be? Alzheimer's? What is the next one going to be? It is not a \ngood precedent. We took care of this issue. Anti-choice politics should \nnot get into this debate. This is not about choice. It is about health. \nWe addressed the issue. Let's move on.\n  I am going to quote again from Senator Thurmond, whose words 5 years \nago captured the essence of the issue before us today, when he stated:\n\n       This is not a debate about abortion. This is a debate about \n     allowing federally sponsored research that will serve \n     humanity and may save thousands of lives. Passage of this \n     bill [to allow fetal tissue research] should improve the \n     quality of life for many people with devastating diseases and \n     disabilities.\n\n  Supporters of this amendment may argue that fetal tissue research \ncould still continue if this amendment were passed, as the ban would \nnot apply to tissue obtained from spontaneous abortions or ectopic \npregnancies.\n  But, Mr. President, we have heard this argument before. It remains as \nweak as ever. Doctors have addressed this issue in earlier debates, and \nhave stated that tissue from spontaneous miscarriages is often diseased \nand is difficult to collect in a safe and timely fashion to preserve \nthe viability of the cells. The same applies to ectopic pregnancies, \nwhich produce tissue that is likely to be non-viable due to the lack of \nblood supply.\n  So, really, we addressed this issue before. There has not been one \nviolation. A woman may not be approached for consent to donate the \naborted tissue until after she has made the decision to make the \nabortion. The donor may never be paid for donation of tissue, and the \ndonor may not designate the recipient of the tissue. A GAO study \nreports not one violation. And if there is, someone is going to jail \nfor 10 years. The issue has been addressed.\n  Mr. President, doctors have made significant progress toward \nunderstanding and treating serious debilitating diseases, such as \nParkinson's disease, through research involving fetal tissue. But we \nare not there yet. I know that my phone has been ringing off the hook \nfrom people who have Parkinson's disease. Some are pro-choice. Some are \nanti-choice. They know that issue was addressed in 1991 and 1992. They \nknow that the only hope they have is for the doors of research to \ncontinue to be open.\n  I am so pleased that we will be spending more on Parkinson's disease. \nI want to see us double the research at NIH. And I have joined with \nSenators Mack, Specter, Durbin, and others to make that a reality.\n  The enemies we face are right here at home. We fear that a loved one \nwill get cancer. We fear that a loved one will get AIDS. We fear that a \nloved one will fall ill. We fear that we are going to lose our parents \nto Alzheimer's. These are legitimate fears, and these are legitimate \nareas for the Federal Government to be involved in.\n  I will say this. When Senator Coats says we have to confront ethical \nand moral issues, he is right. But what I don't understand is why he \nisn't proud of the Research Freedom Act, which does, indeed, protect \nagainst people saying, ``Well, I am going to get an abortion because I \ncan get money for this fetal tissue,'' when, in fact, that has never \nhappened. That cannot happen. And it will not happen as long as we keep \nthe Research Freedom Act in place. And there is not one Member of this \nSenate that I know of who isn't a strong supporter of that.\n  So, Mr. President, today we have a million Americans with Parkinson's \nwatching the debate, and we have millions of other Americans with other \ndiseases and families who love and adore these family members hoping \nthat we will not take a step backward. I have faith that we will not do \nso.\n  I hope that we will vote down the Coats amendment. I hope we will \ncontinue the progress. I hope we will all continue to support the \nResearch Freedom Act so that we can feel we did everything we could to \nensure that this research is ethical.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me make two points. One is that I don't \nneed to be reminded by the Senator from California about the ravaging \neffects of Parkinson's disease, having watched my grandfather suffer \nand die from Parkinson's, and having watched my father suffer and die \nfrom complications from Parkinson's. I am well aware of the \ndebilitating nature of Parkinson's disease. I think many of us have had \npersonal experiences with that. I have not mentioned that before. But I \nthink the implication is that if one truly understood Parkinson's, you \ncouldn't begin to support the Coats amendment. I think I truly \nunderstand Parkinson's and what it does and how it affects an \nindividual, how it affects family and loved ones. There is the\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\nvery real possibility that it is genetically induced and that I may go \nthrough the same experience.\n  Second, let me just state for those who suggest that there is no hope \nfor the millions of Parkinson's sufferers, there is great hope for the \nmillions of Parkinson's sufferers. There is hope because, No. 1, fetal \ntissue research can continue if the Coats amendment is adopted. I do \nnot deny research utilizing human fetal tissue through this amendment. \nI simply say that that fetal tissue cannot be obtained through induced \nabortions. It can be obtained through spontaneous abortions, \nmiscarriages, or ectopic pregnancies.\n  But, second, there is hope because there are so many viable, \nwonderful alternatives that are now being researched which offer far \nmore promise than the fetal tissue research. If you want to continue \nfetal research--and it probably should be continued--that fetal tissue \ncan be obtained through sources other than human fetal tissue. In fact, \nit is much more promising now using animal tissue. There are a number \nof alternatives being explored, both through the use of cell \nengineering techniques, genetic engineering, and other developing cell \nlines.\n  There are also alternatives outside tissue research that hold some \npromise. Perhaps the recent discovery of a gene that has an effect on \nParkinson's, which perhaps is the cause of Parkinson's, albeit for a \npercentage of people and not for all the people, offer hope. So there \nis great hope. There is great promise in Parkinson's research. And \nnothing in this amendment denies that hope, denies that promise.\n  So I think Members need to understand when they are voting for the \nCoats amendment that it is a way to preserve and continue Parkinson's \nresearch. But it is done so in a way that avoids what I think is a \npotential significant, ethical, and moral dilemma in terms of utilizing \nhuman fetal issue without the consent of the person giving the tissue.\n  The very person who makes the decision to terminate that life is not \nthe person who gives the consent to utilization of the tissue. That is \na moral and ethical dilemma that I think is important for us to \nexplore.\n  So for those two reasons, I think the Coats amendment is more than a \nreasonable amendment. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before the debate goes any further, I ask \nunanimous consent that a vote occur on or in relation to the pending \namendment at 12 noon today, and that the time between now and noon be \nequally divided in the usual form with no amendments in order prior to \nthe 12 noon vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \non this issue.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is an attempt to revisit an issue that \nhas been settled and should remain settled. It attempts to reverse a \ndecision supported by both pro-choice and pro-life Senators alike. The \nlast time this body voted on this issue, the vote was 93 to 4.\n  The ban on fetal tissue research was lifted 4 years ago. Since that \ntime, the NIH has awarded over $23 million in grants for research \ninvolving the study, analysis, and use of fetal tissue. This research \nholds the potential to provide tremendous advances in the treatment of \ndebilitating conditions such as Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's, \nHuntington's, epilepsy, blindness, multiple sclerosis, leukemia, and a \nhost of other illnesses.\n  The issue of fetal tissue research has been debated, as I said, and \nlegislated by the Congress. The Senate voted 93 to 4 that the benefits \nof this research far outweigh the unsubstantiated fears and concerns \nthat it would lead to increases in abortions.\n  The bill enacted in 1993 established rigorous standards to safeguard \nagainst any potential that the needs of researchers would affect \nindividual decisions about abortion. Those safeguards are in place and \nthey are working. In 1997, a GAO study of the safeguards reports that \n``the act's documentation requirements were met'' and that there have \nbeen no reported violations in the acquisition of human fetal tissue \nfor use in transplantation.''\n  These safeguards were not written specifically to address research \ninvolving Parkinson's disease, but all research using fetal tissue. \nThere is no need to revisit this debate as it relates to research on \nParkinson's. The research being conducted today with fetal tissue is \nalso providing new techniques such as specialized cell lines and \ngenetically engineered cells. In fact, the development of these new \ntechnologies may well eliminate the need for using fetal tissue for \nresearch purposes in the future.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I received a letter from Joan Samuelson, \npresident of the Parkinson's Action Network. It was addressed to \nSenator Kennedy and others. I would like to read for the Record what \nshe had to say. Her letter starts:\n\n       For decades, despite the eight-year ban on federal support \n     for the research, significant progress has been made in the \n     therapeutic benefit of cell transplants, including the \n     following:\n       Major progress has been made in confirming the new neural \n     cell transplant process works. In the last two years, post-\n     mortem review of transplanted cells has proven that the \n     transplanted cells can take hold in the host brain and \n     produce dopamine, thereby replacing the dopamine in the body.\n       Major progress has been made in developing an alternative \n     source of tissue for transplantation, so that when a therapy \n     is available to the public, it will not be dependent on \n     elective abortions. Several alternatives are in development, \n     including use of porcine (pig) cells, stem cells and \n     genetically engineered cells.\n       The research is also providing valuable insights into the \n     fundamental issues of Parkinson's cause. For example, the \n     transplanted cells do not appear to be affected by the \n     underlying disease process: While the original cells continue \n     to degenerate, the transplanted ones do not continue to \n     degenerate. This fact is giving essential clues into the \n     nature of the cause and disease process.\n       The transplanted cells are proving more and more effective \n     at treating Parkinson's symptoms. A few transplant patients \n     are now off medication and symptom-free--a dramatic change.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the \nSamuelson letter be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Parkinson's Action Network,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 1997.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: For decades, despite the eight-year \n     ban on federal support for the research, significant progress \n     has been made in the therapeutic benefit of cell transplants, \n     including the following:\n       Major progress has been made in confirming the neural cell \n     transplant process works. In the last two years, post-mortem \n     review of transplanted cells has proven that the transplanted \n     cells can take hold in the host brain and produce dopamine.\n       Major progress has been made in developing an alternative \n     source of tissue for transplantation, so that when a therapy \n     is available to the public, it will not be dependent on \n     elective abortions. Several alternatives are in development, \n     including use of porcine (pig) cells, stem cells and \n     genetically engineered cells.\n       The research is also providing valuable insights into the \n     fundamental issues of Parkinson's cause. For example, the \n     transplanted cells do not appear to be affected by the \n     underlying disease process: while the original cells continue \n     to degenerate, the transplanted ones do not. This fact is \n     giving essential clues into the nature of the cause and \n     disease process.\n       The transplanted cells are proving more and more effective \n     at treating Parkinson's symptoms. A few transplant patients \n     are now off medication and symptom free--a dramatic change. \n     Although the first clinical trials are still ongoing, initial \n     results indicate that even in these initial experimental \n     stages the typical patient is able to reduce medication \n     dramatically--thereby also reducing the related side \n     effects--while also significantly lessening Parkinson's \n     symptoms.\n       The Parkinson's research has created a research base which \n     is now being used for important research using neural cell \n     transplantation to treat many other diseases and disorders \n     including diabetes, spinal cord injury, blindness, \n     Huntington's disease, intractable pain, Alzheimer's disease, \n     cancer, birth defects and Multiple Sclerosis.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Joan I. Samuelson, J.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the letter points out that we are making \nprogress, that we are discovering new things. Now is not the time to \nrevisit\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\nthis issue. This issue has been settled and I believe we ought to leave \nit alone. As we have said, the studies have shown that the safeguards \nwe put in place are working. No violations have been encountered, and I \nbelieve the best course of action is to stay the course that we have \nhad since 1993, and, of course, I think at the appropriate time there \nwill be a motion made to table the Coats amendment. And I urge all \nSenators to support that motion to table and to continue what we have \nbeen doing since 1993 in providing for fetal tissue research but with \nadequate safeguards to ensure that unintended consequences do not \nhappen because of this research.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Idaho for such \ntime as I need.\n  Mr. CRAIG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] to prohibit the use of Federal money \nto conduct research using fetal tissue on Parkinson's disease, fetal \ntissue that is produced from elective abortion. The Coats amendment \nexempts spontaneous abortions, exempts ectopic pregnancies. But really \nthe thrust of his amendment is that we do not want to turn abortion \nclinics into mills producing tissue that is used for research.\n  I support his amendment. I do think it is immoral to use fetal tissue \nfrom elective abortions for medical research. I think occasionally we \nhave to make moral statements. Do we really want to allow abortion \nclinics to harvest material to be used for research in whatever \ndisease? In this case it is Parkinson's disease. Do we really want that \nto happen in this country?\n  We had a prohibition on it for years. It was not done for years. Now \nsome people think that maybe it would be a good idea. Tissue can be \nharvested, can be used if the abortion is spontaneous, but not in the \ncase of elective abortions. Do we want to have a situation where an \nindividual goes in and kills a human being, although not yet born, \nmaybe up into the eighth month of pregnancy, kill that unborn human \nbeing and use that human being's cells for medical research? I do not \nthink so, and I do not think we should fund it.\n  The Senator from Indiana should be complimented for his amendment. I \nwish that this amendment was not necessary. I heard yesterday that NIH \nor someone has alluded to the fact that NIH, had no objections to the \namendment.\n  So I am maybe a little bit surprised that others are opposing this \namendment as aggressively as they are. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Coats amendment. I think it is a good amendment. I regret that it \nis needed, but it is needed. I think it is important. I do not think we \nas a country want to have a national policy allowing abortion mills to \nkill unborn children and use their body parts for medical research. \nThat is a serious issue. That is what we are voting on. So I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of the Coats amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the bill \nand not have the time charged to either side on this amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Missouri such \ntime as he requires.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the acting manager of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thought, as children are going back to \nschool across the country and in our States, we ought to take a few \nmoments to think about the education they are receiving and how we as \nparents, not just in our role as legislators, can make a real \ndifference in how our children develop.\n  The truth is, we have come to know the foundations of learning begin \nlong before a child ever gets to school. Babies from birth to age 3 \nyears old are learning fundamental language skills at this time. \nResearch tells us that 50 percent of a child's mature learning \nintelligence develops by the time that child is 3 years old. We can \nplay a very large role in determining how successful that learning \nfunction is. We do this by reading to children even before they are old \nenough to hold a book. We do this by talking to them. We do this by \ninteracting with them.\n  Over the August recess I traveled around the State of Missouri, \nfocusing on the issue of literacy and working with young children who \nwere in preschool classes or, in Missouri, in our Parents as Teachers \nProgram. I found it to be a very exciting, a very interesting, and a \nrewarding experience, and one that I hope we can show--all of us, as \ncolleagues, as others who are concerned--is a very rewarding activity \nfor the parents.\n  We have always thought that early childhood was a key learning time. \nThat is common sense. But now we have seen it validated by science. The \ndevelopment of children's learning skills depends upon the child's \nexposure to language in the earliest years. What we do to encourage and \nstimulate literacy, reading ability, communicating ability, in very \nyoung children, is going to provide the basis of their success later in \nlife.\n  When you come to think about it, reading is the basic skill. Learning \nto understand, to read and communicate is absolutely essential, \nparticularly as we live in a complex society. Most of us think about \nreading and learning as part of the economic process of getting a job. \nI can tell you that my experiences in job training in the years when I \nwas Governor reemphasized the importance of that. In my second term as \nGovernor we had an on-the-job training program for industries expanding \nin Missouri and creating new jobs. I will never forget visiting one \nfacility where they were installing sophisticated computer-assisted \nmanufacturing systems. They were very complicated. You had to \nunderstand a lot of science to do the job well. And these jobs were \nextremely high-paying jobs. As a matter of fact, one of the workers in \none of those jobs, working a 2,000-hour year, would earn more than the \nGovernor of Missouri would have at that time. The science had all \ndeveloped since I last opened a science textbook in college.\n  They had a 6-week training program for these workers. Four of the \nweeks were devoted to teaching these workers to read, because so many \nof them had not learned the basic reading and understanding skills in \nschool. The prize there was demonstrable; the prize was visible. If you \ncould read and understand, you could operate one of these machines and \nearn more than the Governor of Missouri was earning. And there is no \nquestion, as I talked to employers around the State, they are looking \nfor and begging for workers. But the workers have to be able to read \nand understand complicated instructions, because the tasks that the \nworkers will be called on to perform, now and in the years ahead, are \nrapidly changing. They are changing with technology. And the people who \nare doing the work have to learn to read and understand the changed \ninstructions.\n  So, reading is a fundamental skill, an absolutely essential skill to \nget ahead economically. But we ought not to focus ourselves just on the \neconomic side. To be an informed citizen, to participate in our \ndemocratic form of government, requires that people read, be able to \nunderstand all the messages that are coming to them. Reading provides \nthe basis for communicating and getting along in the world in many \nother ways--in social activities, in community activities. So, literacy \nreally is the fundamental basis, the foundation for knowledge and for \ndevelopment of well-informed, well-attuned children in our communities, \nin our States and in our Nation.\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\n  Former First Lady Barbara Bush has made literacy her top priority, \nand I take my hat off to her. I think, as I see more and more of the \nchallenges we face in this country, the more I understand that Mrs. \nBush is right. Where people do not have the fundamental reading skills, \nthey have significant problems.\n  One of the reasons I have been closely associated with this literacy \nproject is following up on the Parents as Teachers program we have in \nMissouri. Parents as Teachers begins by providing assistance, on a \nvoluntary basis, to parents of children from birth to 3 years old. We \nhave found that parents who participate in this program with their \nchildren--No. 1, are able to avoid many of the serious learning \nproblems that affect children today and require that they be put in \nremedial or special education; but we are also finding that in every \nmeasure of scientific testing, these children are scoring higher than \ntheir peers. When I talk to kindergarten teachers and elementary \nschoolteachers and administrators, they can see the difference in these \nchildren who have worked in the program where literacy is emphasized, \nwhere parents reading to their children is emphasized.\n\n  I spent the month of August trying to encourage more and more \nfamilies in Missouri--parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, \ncaregivers--to read to their children to show that it is fun, but also \nto tell them that it is vitally important.\n  Also, we want to expand--and this bill does provide expansion of the \nopportunities for more States to participate in the Parents as Teachers \nProgram. At my request, the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember included $30 million to expand Parents as Teachers programs to \nother States around the country and to improve on the program. Already, \n47 States participate, to some degree, in the program.\n  Early childhood learning and development is important, and we can do \na much better job. The Parents as Teachers Program is one that has had \ntremendous success. Mr. President, 150,000 Missouri families \nvoluntarily participate in that program every year, and if you want to \nknow if the program works, I can refer you to any one of those 150,000 \nfamilies, because they see it is working, they know it is working, and, \nMr. President, this bill provides more resources to help start these \nprograms in every school district in the country.\n  I hope there will be a time when we find that families, wherever they \nare, who want help developing the child's learning skills will be able \nto get the kind of assistance that is now available in Missouri. It can \nmake a difference, and it will make a difference in our children's \neducation, their preparation for the work force but, most of all, their \npreparation to take the role in society as responsible adults, as \nresponsible parents themselves.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting and keeping in the \nmoney for early childhood development. I hope to work with Senator \nKerry and others to provide authorizing legislation in this session to \nexpand on the opportunities to support early childhood development. \nGovernment programs are fine, but it all comes down to the \nresponsibility of the parents, and that responsibility is very easy to \noutline, because the starting point is reading to children, relating to \nthem and showing them the excitement and the wonders that are opened \nthrough reading of books and other materials.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I beg \nyour pardon. I withdraw that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes off \nwhatever time remains on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1071 to amendment no. 1070\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this morning, the appropriations \nsubcommittee is having a hearing, as I understand it, to resolve the \nquestion about testing. The President has proposed a reading test that \nwould be voluntarily made available to States and local school \ndistricts for fourth graders where the school wants to provide testing \nin reading, and one for eighth graders in mathematics.\n  There has been some controversy about this. Senator Coats from \nIndiana has proposed an amendment which would--the Coats amendment and \nthe Gregg amendment together, as I understand it--essentially prohibit \nthe use of funds to go forward with the development of these tests. I \nbelieve this would be a very grave mistake for this Congress to make if \nwe were to prohibit the Department of Education from going forward with \nthe development of these tests. I think the President's support on this \nissue has been strong. The White House has indicated that they would \nveto the legislation if, in fact, it did contain a prohibition on the \nuse of funds to go ahead and develop these tests.\n  As I see it, the tests that the President has proposed and the \nDepartment of Education would like to develop and make available to \nschool districts and to States is designed to allow parents, to empower \nparents, to understand the educational performance and the achievement \nlevel of their own children and how well the school that their child is \nattending is doing in preparing their child for a career later on.\n  The Coats amendment, as I said, would prohibit the development of the \ntests, and I think that would be a very serious mistake.\n  The problem we have today, frankly, is that every State that gives \ntests--and all of our States do give tests--every State that gives \ntests measures by a different standard how well their students are \ndoing. Accordingly, you have some States where most all the students do \nreasonably well on the test that is provided, and there is a general \nperception that they are going to be fine. The general trend is that \neverybody thinks that although the school system nationally, the \neducational system nationwide, is in serious difficulty, they believe \nthat their own child is getting a good education. It just doesn't add \nup. Every individual child in our country cannot be getting a good \neducation and still have the vast majority getting a less than quality \neducation.\n  What we need to do is to have a system where there is agreement as to \nwhat the standard is, there is agreement as to what the test results \ndemonstrate, and then parents can make an intelligent decision about \nhow their child is doing relative to other children, how their child is \ndoing, how their school that their child attends is doing relative to \nother schools in that same district and relative to other schools in \nthe State or in the Nation.\n  We have today what is called the National Assessment for Educational \nProgress test, and that is a test that in 43 States tens of thousands \nof students participate in on a voluntary basis. This test has been in \nplace now for 25 years. The problem, of course, is that it is not \navailable to most students. But clearly, communities, States, and \nschool districts recognize that it is a good, objective assessment of \nhow the students in the schools are doing.\n  What we are trying to do through the development of these new tests \nis to take the model that the NAEP, the National Assessment for \nEducational Progress, has developed and, essentially, have a test that \nthen is available for each student in each school around the country \nwhere they want to have that test administered.\n  I believe this is important because I believe that improvement in \neducation in the country is going to have to be driven by concern of \nparents. They are the ones who need to understand the quality of the \neducation that their children are receiving. Without something like \nthis test available, you are not going to have the level of concern by \nparents that is necessary in order to ensure and require the \nimprovements in education that I believe are needed.\n\n  Let me just indicate that there is nothing that complicated about the \ntests that they are talking about giving here. The reading test is a \nsimple one. One example is they essentially go through and ask fourth \ngraders to describe Charlotte to a friend after they read a passage \nfrom the well-known book ``Charlotte's Web.'' That is a commonsense \nkind of a test that all of us would like our children to be able to \npass. It is the kind of test which is appropriate to make available to \nall of our schools.\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\n  The same thing in math. The test there is a straightforward test. \nThere is nothing convoluted or complicated about it. It tests basic \nmath skills for eighth graders, and, goodness knows, everybody in this \ncountry, every parent I talked to believes their child should be \nprepared with a basic understanding of math by the time they complete \nthe eighth grade.\n  Let me say, the business community strongly supports the President's \ninitiative to have these tests available to States and school \ndistricts. There has been a call, a repeated call and a consistent \ncall, by the business community to have more objective assessment going \non in our schools so that we don't have so much rhetoric, but we have \nactual information, good solid information, about how well our students \nare doing.\n  That is exactly what employers require before they hire a person. \nThey give them those objective tests to determine whether they have the \nbasic skills in reading and in mathematics so that they can become \nproductive employees. For us not to make those same kind of objective \ntests available in the schools before they get out into the workplace I \nthink would be a serious mistake.\n  Not only does the business community support this, the public \nsupports it. In the most recent national poll, 77 percent of the public \nthat was questioned supported establishing national standards; 67 \npercent specifically supported using national tests, such as were \ndescribed and supported by the President and the Department of \nEducation.\n  I know that we have testimony being presented this morning. Secretary \nRiley is making the case before the Appropriations Committee. I hope \nvery much that he will be persuasive to the members of that committee \nand that we can go forward with the funding of these tests as the \nadministration intends.\n  I do think this is an issue that has great long-term consequences for \nour country. It would be a serious mistake for us to head this off. We \nalready have a whole number of States--I see the distinguished chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee on the floor here right now. His State \nof Alaska has chosen to participate voluntarily in the use of these \ntests when they are made available. The superintendent of public \ninstruction in my State of New Mexico has indicated his desire that we \nshould also participate at some future date in the use of these tests. \nThere are many States that are anxious to participate. There are many \nlarge school districts in our larger cities that have indicated the \nsame thing.\n  We need to keep faith with them, go forward and develop these tests, \nmake the tests available. If they want to use them, so much the better, \nthat is their choice. But it would be a serious mistake for this \nCongress to try to make that decision for the States, make that \ndecision for the local school districts by denying the Department of \nEducation the funds necessary to go ahead and develop these tests.\n  So I hope very much that, once the appropriations subcommittee \nconcludes its hearing on the issue, we can proceed to dispose of this \nmatter. I hope very much that the Coats amendment and the Gregg \namendment, which is a second-degree amendment, as I understand it, or a \nperfecting amendment, that those amendments can be disposed of and we \ncan proceed to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the courtesy. \nMy understanding is we have a vote at noon; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wishes to advise the Senator that \nthe time is under the control of the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I inquire, do we have a vote scheduled at noon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1077\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleagues, and especially Senator Coats, \nfor their courtesy. I was not able to come to the floor earlier, and \nsometimes if we feel strongly about an issue we will have a chance to \nspeak before the vote. I thank him, and I thank Senator Stevens and \nothers as well.\n  I do not know quite where to start. Last night we passed an \namendment, and this was work I was fortunate enough to get a chance to \ndo with Senator McCain, and I think we had 97 votes to expand funding \nfor Parkinson's disease. It was an enormous victory. I believe that \nkind of strong vote will serve us very well in conference committee, \nand I believe finally we will be able to get some funding.\n  There has been so little funding. It has not been fair, and people \nwho have been struggling with this disease have been here for several \nyears now. They have become their own advocates. The only reason we had \nsuch a strong vote last night was because of their work.\n  My colleague, Senator Coats, was gracious enough to raise his concern \nthrough this amendment separately from that vote. He is someone here in \nthe Senate that I believe in. I think he speaks for what he thinks is \nright. This amendment he introduces in very good faith.\n  I will be the opposite of shrill in my opposition. I think the \namendment is profoundly mistaken. We have gone through this whole \ndebate about fetal tissue research, and I again want to make it clear \nthat not only have we not seen one instance of abuse, not one example, \nbut we really have very, very stringent and clear protections. A woman \nmay not be approached for consent to donate aborted tissue. The donor \nmay not be paid for donation of the tissue. The donor may not designate \nwho will be the recipient of the tissue. Violations of these \nrestrictions are a Federal felony, punishable by 10 years in Federal \nprison.\n  I say all that because I want to make it clear how strict the \nguidelines are. I also want to make it clear that I do not think this \nissue is really about using the labels pro-choice or pro-life, but it \nhas to do with another question, which is whether or not people who are \nstruggling with the disease are going to be able to look to a day where \nthere will be a cure. If this amendment passes, we are essentially \nwiping out one very promising avenue of research. I think that would be \na very crucial thing to do. That is certainly not the intention of the \namendment.\n  I say to my colleagues, because I have been active in this work \ndealing with Parkinson's since I came to the Senate, I know something \nabout it, having had two parents who struggled with Parkinson's. I know \nsomething about it, having spent a great deal of time with people in \nthe Parkinson's community, that given the strict guidelines and given \nthe fact that we do not see examples of abuse, and given the fact that \nthis really is not about pro-choice and pro-life, and also given the \nfact that if this kind of amendment is going to be raised it ought not \nto be focused on one disease, I just hope that my colleagues will \noppose this amendment. I think it is profoundly mistaken.\n  Now, Mr. President, just forget all of the statistics, except to say, \nand I think my colleagues will believe me, that if you talk to people \nin the medical research community they will tell you that fetal tissue \ntransplant research is one of the very promising approaches. I do not \nthink we want to ``defund'' that. We do not want to be in a position \nof, on the one hand, finding resources for research, and then \nessentially wiping out one of the very important modes of research to \nfind a cure for the disease. We do not want to do that. It really \nundercuts part of the very important vote that took place last night.\n  Maybe the best way for me to summarize my view, because we will vote \nin just a few minutes, is to talk about a woman that some of you have \ncome to know. Her name is Joan Samuelson. I have not asked for \npermission to do this, but Joan has been so visible and so vocal I do \nnot think she will object. I first met her a number of years ago when \nshe was testifying before our committee, the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee. I think she was speaking about the need to have at least a \nlittle bit more by way of resources for research, but I think she\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\nwas talking about, if my memory serves me correctly, about this fetal \ntissue research.\n  What I remember was I kept thinking about my parents. My father was \nalmost 60 when he found out he had Parkinson's and he lived to be 84, \nthough at the very end I will tell you, if you do not know this \ndisease, he was so alert. He was a brilliant man. I am not objective, \nhe was my father. He spoke 10 languages fluently but it did not help. \nHe spoke 10 languages fluently, but because of Parkinson's he could not \nspeak. He could not walk. And really the truth of the matter is he \nintensely wanted to die. That is exactly what he indicated to me.\n  When Joan Samuelson testified, I kept thinking, gee, she is in her \nthirties. What is going to be her future? If you are lucky, this \ndisease runs a slow progression, but you never know. You do not want to \nfind out you have Parkinson's when you are in your thirties. By the \nway, it is a myth that this is a disease that only afflicts the \nelderly.\n  When Joan Samuelson testified, more than anything what she was saying \nis, ``Look, for me and many others, time is not neutral. How can you \nsay to me that you are only willing to invest about $30 per person for \nthe 1 million of us who struggle with Parkinson's? How can you look at \nme in the eye and say that? This is my life or whether I will have a \nlife.''\n  The reason I raise this is I remember hearing her testify and \nthinking about my parents and sort of just then starting to have tears \nin my own eyes because I was thinking I don't want someone like Joan \nSamuelson to get to the place where my dad did. I don't want that to \nhappen to her.\n  Now, I am not a doctor. I cannot guarantee there will be a cure to \nthis disease tomorrow. But when I spoke to Joan Samuelson two nights \nago, she is out in California, she said to me, ``The way I look at this \ndebate on fetal tissue research is this is the particular research that \nI think could very well lead to a cure for me.'' That is the point. \nPlease, everybody, that is the point.\n  Whatever your position is on the general question of pro-choice, pro-\nlife, that is not what this debate is about. To someone like Joan \nSamuelson, this is one avenue of research that could very well lead to \na cure for this disease. That is of central importance to her. That is \nof central importance to the lives of many other people struggling with \nParkinson's. I think that is what this vote is about.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to please vote against this \namendment. I feel like I have to, in good faith, conclude by saying, \neven though I hope there will be a strong vote against this amendment, \none more time I want to make it crystal clear that Senator Coats is \ndoing what he thinks is right. Senator Coats has supported this effort \nto expand the funding for Parkinson's. Senator Coats knows this disease \nall too well. I believe his father had Parkinson's. Senator Coats, when \nhe does something on the floor of the Senate does it because he \nbelieves in it. He does it because he thinks it is the right thing.\n  I deeply appreciate the support he has given Senator McCain and \nmyself on our efforts, but I think this amendment is a mistake. \nActually, I want to say I know this amendment is a mistake, because I \nreally believe it is all about someone like Joan Samuelson. We ought \nnot to vote for the Mo Udall Parkinson's Research Act, the amendment \nlast night introduced by Senator McCain and myself, and then turn \naround and essentially defund one of the important avenues of research \nthat potentially could lead to a cure for this disease. I think that \nwould be an injustice to Joan Samuelson and many other women and men \nwho struggle with this disease. I hope my colleagues will vote against \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the call of the quorum be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a second? There is a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That vote will occur at noon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, just in summarizing before we vote at 12 \no'clock on the Coats amendment, let me just, for Members' information, \nclarify things here.\n  This amendment does not prohibit all Federal funding for fetal tissue \nresearch. Fetal tissue research can go forward. It allows fetal tissue \nresearch to go forward with tissue obtained from ectopic pregnancies \nand spontaneous abortions. It does prohibit Federal funds from being \nused for research on fetal tissue obtained by induced abortions only.\n  We encourage research in the most promising areas of Parkinson's \ndisease with animal tissue transplants, gene-based therapy, deep-brain \nstimulation.\n  So this applies not to diabetes research, not to other neurological \nresearch--just to this. Other alternatives exist. Even fetal tissue \ncould go forward.\n  I hope our colleagues will understand the practical nature of this \nand the ethical and moral considerations of doing this, and I urge a \nvote in support of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Indiana. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] \nand the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 38, nays 60, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 215 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--38\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Coats\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n\n                                NAYS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Chafee\n     Murkowski\n       \n  The amendment (No. 1077) was rejected.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, once again, we have seen the ugly, \nundeniably brutal, horrific actions of terrorism. We have seen the \ndestructive impact of it in Jerusalem so vividly put forth over the TV \nscreens, but it goes well beyond. We are told that 6 people died, over \n150 have been injured, and obviously our sympathy goes out to them and \nto their families and to the people of that region who are held captive \nby these kinds of terrorist attacks. This is the work of Hamas, the \nHamas who are given sanctuary, who operate out of the territories under \nthe direct control of Yasser Arafat.\n  Now, make no mistake about it: The responsibility for this terrorist \nact and the previous bombings lies with Mr. Arafat. He, Mr. President, \nhas the power to deter these murderers but does nothing. Indeed, he \ngives them sanctuary. He gives them sustenance. He gives them comfort.\n  Let me illustrate by way of this picture. It is said that a picture \nis worth a thousand words, and in this case I think even more so. The \nNew York Times, Thursday, August 21, and here we see Mr. Arafat greeted \nby a leader of the Hamas during a meeting in Gaza: ``Defying Israel, \nArafat embraces Islamic militants.''\n  You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say, on the one hand, that \nwe are the instrumentality of peace, that we want peace, we are working \nfor peace, and on the other hand be embracing the leaders of the \nterrorist organizations that are sworn to destroy Israel, the Jewish \npeople and any prospects for peace.\n  That is indefensible. And so while there are those who claim that \nthis is an internal security problem for Israel, I believe it is quite \nclear, given the responsibilities and given the power and given the \neconomic wherewithal that we have provided, the United States, to \nYasser Arafat, whose police force has failed, whose security services \nhave, if anything, given sanctuary and protection to Hamas, it is about \ntime we held him accountable for these acts. Instead of providing the \nsecurity and loaning himself to the peace process, he embraces these \nmurderers as we see so clearly. He coddles them, he provides them with \nsanctuary.\n  Mr. President, terrorism will not end if this is permitted.\n  I believe, and I have said before--and I see my colleague in the \nChamber--that it may come time--and the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. \nLieberman] has raised this issue--for this country to look very closely \nat the moneys, the hundreds of millions of dollars annually that we \nsend to Mr. Arafat under the umbrella, the cloak, of peace.\n  When those dollars are not being used to provide the kind of security \nto bring about a peace process but are aiding and abetting, and, \nindeed, we have him embracing terrorist leaders, I think we have to at \nthe very least look at whether this should continue. I believe that we \nhave an obligation to speak up and say, we hold you, Mr. Arafat, \nresponsible, and it is time to condemn him publicly for the carnage and \nthe destruction of human life that has taken place today and in the \npast.\n  Mr. President, I see my friends and colleagues, the Senators from \nConnecticut and New Jersey, in the Chamber, and I know that they feel \nstrongly about this issue.\n  I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Connecticut and the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from New York for \nyielding and for his statement.\n  Mr. President, as a result of a terrorist act, blood has been spilled \nin the streets of Israel as its citizens go about the most normal day-\nto-day tasks, walking, shopping. Lives again have been lost to the \nterrorist hand. It is a very sad and dispiriting moment, not just, of \ncourse, for those who have suffered in this terrorist attack and for \nthe families and friends who pray now that the lives of the wounded \nwill be saved. It is also a sad and dispiriting day for all of us who \nhope for the continuation of the peace process in the Middle \nEast, begun in Oslo, ratified at a historic, dramatic, hopeful signing \non the lawn of the White House on September 13, 1993 by the late Prime \nMinister Rabin and Chairman Arafat. The agreement, the understanding, \nthe exchange made in the declaration of principles in the Oslo accord \nwas complicated in one sense, but simple in another. It was an exchange \nin which the Israeli Government would yield land in recognition of a \nPalestinian self-governing authority in exchange for the Palestinians--\nand particularly their eventually elected leadership, Chairman Arafat \nand others--giving security to the people of Israel; freedom from fear \nof the kind of terrorist acts that have been committed again today in \nIsrael.\n\n  Mr. President, I know the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin \nNetanyahu, is controversial in many areas of this country, and there \nare different acts that he has carried out as a leader that some \nchallenge and question. But it seems to me, if you look at the \nagreement made in the Oslo accords and you look at what was required of \nIsrael, Prime Minister Netanyahu, since he has been Prime Minister, has \nkept those promises made by Prime Minister Rabin. The same cannot be \nsaid of Chairman Arafat.\n  It is not just, although it is significant, the failure, as promised \nin the Oslo accord, to remove from the Palestinian Charter these \nclauses which threaten the destruction of the State of Israel. It is \nnot just, though of course it is tragic and painful, the terrorist acts \nthat continue. But it is the tone, it is the context of what is \nhappening. The Israeli intelligence gathers evidence, presents it to \nMr. Arafat to show him, a month or so ago, that the person he has \nappointed as the chief of the Palestinian Authority police has been \ninvolved in planning terrorist acts. How would we feel if we had \nevidence from intelligence showing that the minister of defense of \nRussia, with whom we were negotiating an arms control agreement, had \nbeen involved in planning terrorist acts against the United States? The \ndreadful moment, after the bombing in Israel, in Jerusalem, a few \nmonths ago, Chairman Arafat, instead of taking action to reassure the \nfear of average Israelis about their security, holds a conference with \nHamas and other terrorist groups and embraces and kisses one of the \nleaders of that group. Again, the chief of police of the Palestinian \nAuthority at one point declares with some pride that more than 100 \nmembers of Hamas are members of the Palestinian Authority police.\n  The effect of these actions leading, again, to this tragic terrorist \nact today, is not just to affect the political leadership of Israel. \nIsrael is a democracy. That is why Mr. Netanyahu is Prime Minister. The \neffect of these acts that I have described is to undercut severely the \ntrust, the confidence, the hope of the people of Israel for peace. \nBecause they don't trust the Palestinian Authority and Mr. Arafat, \nbased on these various acts I have described and Senator D'Amato has \ndescribed, to carry out the promises in the Oslo accords to provide \nsecurity and peace.\n  The late Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel, was a great leader, \na great soldier of the peace, so-called peace of the brave. But I would \nsay today, if Prime Minister Rabin was alive and was still Prime \nMinister today, he could not accept the continuation of the peace \nprocess under the status quo, because the Palestinians have not kept \ntheir part of the bargain. So, I fully support the statements made by \nthe Senator from New York. I am grateful the Secretary of State is \nunderway to the Middle East. It will take a courageous and bold action. \nBut the main point here is that Chairman Arafat has to understand---\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The time for morning business is \nexpired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent I be given 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, might I ask that we have an \nadditional--up to 15 minutes in morning business to be able to speak on \nthis issue, because I know there are colleagues, my colleague from New \nJersey and colleague from California, who would like to speak to this.\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, what I am saying here is that this \nprocess--for the first time since September 1993 I fear that the peace \nprocess in the Middle East is unraveling. And that would be a terrible \nresult for the people on both sides in the Middle East. The only way it \ncan be brought back on track is for Chairman Arafat to take some \nunequivocal and strong actions to make clear that he is an enemy of \nterrorism. That will probably include arresting suspected terrorists. \nThat will include a direct break of this embrace with Hamas. It will \ninclude a dedication to destroying the terrorist infrastructure that is \npart of Hamas. If that does not happen, the process will not go \nforward. Because the people of Israel--leave aside the Government--the \npeople of Israel will not have the confidence to take it forward.\n  Here our options are limited. The Secretary of State and her \ndesignees are there to try to bring some sense to the parties on both \nsides. But, insofar as we have options, it suffices to say that in the \nclimate and the reality that has occurred, as Senator D'Amato has \nindicated, it seems to me there is very little chance that this \nCongress would appropriate any funds for the Palestinian Authority. It \nwill make it difficult to renew the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, \nwhich allowed the PLO, the Palestinian Authority, to have an office \nhere in Washington which was closed in August because we didn't renew \nit.\n  These are serious consequences which go to the heart of the process \nand to the hopes of people, on the Palestinian and Israeli sides, for a \nbetter future than the war-torn past. I think we are all here appealing \nto Chairman Arafat, who remains the elected chairman, to seize this \nmoment, show his leadership, or forever be seen in the eyes of history \nas the man who destroyed the hopes for peace in the Middle East.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, if I might, I don't know, is the \ntime reserved just generally?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. No. I have asked that we be permitted to speak on this \nissue for up to 15 minutes. My colleagues have yet to speak. So use \nwhatever time is necessary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from New York. I commend him for \nhis ever-present concern about the well-being of our friends around the \nworld, Israel in this case, and his staunch defense of freedom and \ndemocracy against terrorism. I thank him for his initiative today.\n  It is heartbreaking for all of us, when we see innocent people \ncarried away in stretchers, and the mayhem and the destruction that \nterrorists visited upon Jerusalem this day. It is not a unique \nhappening. It has gone on for too long. The attempt to suggest that \nthis is a way to obtain peace, or to coerce friends who want democratic \nsocieties throughout the Middle East, kind of modeled on what Israel \nhas done--it is a democratic society, as my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut said. They elected a Prime Minister. It is not for us to \nagree or disagree. It is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, it is a \ndemocratic society. And what we try to do is encourage the Palestinian \nAuthority to take democratic leadership and represent law and order and \ndefend against terrorism. But we have been grossly disappointed of \nlate.\n  I was in Israel 2 years ago in April when a bus was exploded by a \nterrorist. On that bus was a young woman from New Jersey whose family I \nnow know very well. She died in a few days; 21 years old, an innocent \nvictim. She wasn't there trying to hurt anybody. She was there because \nshe was interested in studying Hebrew and the history of the Jewish \npeople. Sometime later another young woman, also from New Jersey, was \nkilled in a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv--just a random explosion, \nsomeone willing to take his life, convinced that he would be rewarded \nfor killing himself and killing others.\n  The one thing we have to insist on in this country is we should not \ntalk to anybody who, in addition to a formal relationship with us, \nsupports terrorism. Syria by way of example. We have an ambassador \nthere. They have representation there. But they are on a list of \ncountries that support terrorism. And we ought to say listen, if that \nis the way you are going to conduct your life, in terms of the region \nthat you exist in, that you want to encourage terrorism on the one hand \nand be a friend of this great democracy on the other, it's no go. We \nought to say that to countries all around the area. If you in any way--\neven those that we have established some friendships with--if you in \nany way encourage or inflame the fire of violence and terrorism, our \nrelationship is going to change. We cannot sit by and simply pour our \nhearts out and say, ``Isn't it sad? Somebody lost a son, somebody lost \na daughter, mother, father, sister.'' It has to be more overt than \nthat.\n  We have seen what happens with terrorism. We have seen it in our own \ncountry. It shocked everybody, in Oklahoma, the Port Authority building \nin New York, the Trade Center. It is frightening. It is a disgusting, \nrevolting act. Think of it, that someone feels justified, for political \nor personal reasons, to take others' lives in the name of a cause. We \nought not let it be misunderstood, that we will never, never, never \naccept a handshake on one hand from someone who is going to support \nterrorism with the other hand.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I wonder if my colleague might yield for an observation?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Sure.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Do you think that we should consider very seriously \ngoing forward with a cutoff of funding to Yasser Arafat and the \nPalestinians, unless we see some--I am not saying tomorrow or the next \nday--but unless we see some concerted action? I think we have to begin \nto let him know. I am wondering what my colleague thinks about that--my \ncolleagues think about that? Because, it seems to me, we say one thing \nand we do the other. We are permitting, I think, ourselves to look \nrather foolish in the continued funding, or permitting funding to \ncontinue to flow.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The question my colleague from New York State raises \nis a very complex one. Because we want to continue a peace process. I \nspent some time in Ireland. I visited in the north. We made investments \nin that society, in the northern section, so that people could elevate \ntheir standard of living and reduce some of the anger and the rage. And \nwe continued. I was pleased to see, in the last couple of days, \ndiscussions taking place that include the Sinn Fein, with some Members \nof the Senate and so forth, to try to say, ``Stop the killing, stop the \nkilling.''\n  I met with people in New Jersey, and we disagreed on the tactic that \nwas being used, the violence in the North, to try to bring about the \nkind of equality that all of us like to see for our families and our \nfriends. Thusly, I am reluctant to say just offhand that we ought to \nsimply cut off the relationship.\n  I have faith that the Palestinian people also want peace. I don't \nthink that they, any more than anyone else, likes the prospect of a son \nor a daughter dying in a conflict. There are those madmen--we have them \nin our society; we saw it in Oklahoma--people who are part of our \nculture who do something that is so outrageous. We see it in violence \naround the country all too frequently. We just saw it in New Hampshire.\n  I will say this, though, that I think the Senator confirms what I was \ntalking about, and that is, we have to, as they say, tighten the \nscrews. We cannot have a Hamas operating under one disguise in one \nplace doing a good deed here and there--and I don't care how many good \ndeeds they do--if the alternative is to have another branch of that \norganization that kills people, those who might disagree with them, \nwhile they tend to the needs of others who are indigent medically, \ntroubled, et cetera.\n  So we have to make sure that if you want to be a friend of the United \nStates, if you want us to work with you in any continued way of support \nfor democracy, for economic betterment, that you have to leave out any \nassistance or any encouragement for terrorism, and that means reacting \nto terrorist acts by saying, ``We condemn it and we condemn those who \ndid it,'' and not hedge what they are saying, not permit them to say, \n``Well, we don't like terrorism, but, in this case, maybe''--baloney.\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\n  What we say is, if anybody participates in any support of terrorism, \nthey can't be friends of ours and they can't derive any benefit from \nit.\n  I will relinquish the floor with a word of encouragement for \nSecretary Albright to continue her effort, for all the peacemakers to \ncontinue their efforts, to try to get by this but at the same time to \nmake certain that those who commit terrorist deeds know that they \ncannot sit at the table at the same time that the peacemakers do. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I would like to continue \nalong the lines of some of my colleagues' comments with some of my own, \ninformal as they may be, about what happened this morning. I find \nmyself very much thinking along the lines of the Senators from New \nYork, Connecticut and New Jersey.\n  I watched the CNN coverage from Jerusalem this morning, and my heart \nvery much went into my throat. I wondered how much can the people of \nthis small nation endure. I looked at the faces on the streets, and I \nsaw a kind of brokenness, a spirit diminished, a hurt that was turning \nrapidly to anger.\n  I have been one on the Foreign Relations Committee who has been a \nsupporter of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act. That act expired \nprior to our recess. It was not renewed. My understanding is that as a \nresult the Palestinian office in this area has closed, and I believe it \nshould remain closed, and that the aid specified through the Middle \nEast Peace Facilitation Act, which we call MEPFA, has ceased. I believe \nthat aid should cease. I believe that the Middle East Peace \nFacilitation Act at this point in time should not be renewed and, as a \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, it is going to take a great \ndeal to convince me to go in any other direction.\n  The last terrorist attack before this was July 30. Since then, there \nhas been an aborted attack. Today, we saw three suicide bombers go into \na busy pedestrian mall and blow themselves up in a kind of fanaticism \nthat certainly is not understood in Western countries or really any \npeace-loving country. It is not the act of peace-loving people to blow \nthemselves up and blow up anyone that happens to be around them.\n  I submit that the only reason these bombs are not blowing up inside \nrooms, businesses, and convention halls--and causing even more \ncasualties--is that in Israeli, everyone is searched when they enter \npublic buildings. This is a terrible way for people to have to live. At \nsome point it almost begins to approach the atrocity of a concentration \ncamp if people must live this way.\n  My own view is that it takes two parties to pursue peace, and both \nparties must want peace. I had thought up to this point that Yasser \nArafat wants peace. I must tell this body honestly, I no longer believe \nthat to be the case. I watched his kiss with a Hamas leader, and I know \nthat when public leaders engage in these kinds of symbolic gestures, it \nsets forth signals, signals to every Hamas terrorist everywhere, that \ntheir actions are, to some extent, condoned by the chairman of the \nPalestinian Authority, the head of that authority. That is a terrible \nsignal to send if you are going to be seriously engaged in a peace \nprocess.\n  So I have come to believe that that authority at this stage does not \nwant peace. I have come to believe it when I read that members of the \npolice department were actually engaged in complicity with terrorists \nto allow a terrorist attack to take place.\n  I believe the following: First, that if there is ever a time for the \nArab world to come forward and take a united and strong position \nagainst Hamas and Hezbollah and any other organization that would carry \nout these acts, it is now. If there ever was a time for the Arab world \nto begin to press for the arrest, for the destruction of these \nterrorist organizations, it is now. Outside of concerted action by the \nArab world, I don't see how a peace process can go ahead with any \nprogress whatsoever.\n  Second, I believe we should not renew the Middle East Peace \nFacilitation Act. I believe that all funding should cease at this \npoint. And I must finally say that I personally have very mixed \nfeelings about Secretary Albright's trip to the Middle East. Yes, I \nbelieve we should resist terrorism. I am not sure that going to the \nMiddle East at this point in time sends the signal that we do, indeed, \nresist terrorism. It seems to me that if both parties, Israel and the \nPalestinians, want to discuss peace and the United States is going to \ncarry out our role as an honest broker, this peace can be brokered \nelsewhere than on Israeli soil at this point in time.\n  When three people move forward to kill themselves and kill others, I \nonly can believe that other attacks are going to follow. If I am any \njudge at all of the faces, the Israeli faces I saw on television this \nmorning, I would have to say that peace is having a price that free \npeople have a great deal of difficulty in paying, because it means your \nchild can't go to school, you can't shop, you can't walk down a street. \nYou become a hostage, in another sense.\n  So I make these comments with very deep concern as one who has tried \nto work on resolutions passed by this body so that they weren't \ninflammatory to the peace process, so that Jerusalem, as an issue, \ncould be handled in a way that was not inflammatory, so that the Middle \nEast Peace Facilitation Act could go ahead. But as one Member of this \nSenate, I am now at the point where I believe that without a major \ncommitment from the Arab world, from Mr. Arafat and from his \ngovernment, peace is at the weakest point that I have ever seen since \nthe peace process has begun.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from New \nYork for his comments.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Chair has been gracious in extending morning \nbusiness time, but I would like to make one observation, if I might, \nand ask that the time be continued.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I think that this picture and the \ncaption describes it. Here is Yasser Arafat embracing a leader of \nterrorism, a killer, the leader of Hamas. The caption reads: ``Defying \nIsrael, Arafat embraces Islamic militants.'' It is better titled: \n``Defying peace''--defying peace. It is better titled ``Embracing \nterrorists,'' because that is exactly what he is doing.\n  My colleague from California, I think, described it quite correctly. \nIt is not good enough to speak about peace and yet to give sanctuary, \nsafe haven and tangible, visible support to those who bring about these \nhorrific acts. That is what Mr. Arafat has done. Generally, he has done \nit under the cloak of speaking in a language and in places and at times \nwhere the world does not hear it, but that selected groups hear his \nwords. Here he has done it in the way that the camera has captured him \nand his words in giving support and comfort to those who bring terror \nto the streets and to the homes of innocent civilians.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, once again innocent Israeli civilians have \nbeen murdered by the enemies of the peace process. I rise today to \nstrongly condemn this cowardly act of violence and reaffirm my support \nfor the people of Israel and for the people who want peace throughout \nthe Middle East.\n  There is no doubt that today's suicide bombings were carefully timed \nto inflict the greatest number of civilian causalities. Three \nexplosions in quick succession rocked the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall \nduring the busiest time of day. These bombs killed at least 6 and \ninjured nearly 200 people.\n  As expected, the terrorist group Hamas has claimed responsibility for \nthis deplorable act. They are responsible for the blood and carnage in \nthe streets of Jerusalem, and they must answer to the grieving parents \nand families of the victims.\n  Last month, I stood before this body to urge Yasser Arafat and the \nPalestinian Authority to keep their promise and crack down on \nterrorism. As evidenced by his complete inaction since the July 30 \nbombing, Mr. Arafat has not done anything to join the fight against \nterrorism. If the peace process is to move forward, he must find the \ncourage to confront those who would victimize innocents to undermine \npeace in the Middle East.\n  Secretary Madeleine Albright is scheduled to visit the Middle East \nnext\n\n[[Page S8785]]\n\nweek, and there are many who believe these bombings were intended to \ndisrupt her visit. Mr. President, this deliberate act of violence \nagainst Israel will not deter us in any way from moving forward with \nthe peace process--indeed, it will only strengthen our resolve. It is \ncritical that America continue to play a major role in the peace \nprocess. We will not allow terrorists to set the agenda for the peace \nprocess. We will not allow cowards to strangle the prospects for peace \nin the Middle East.\n  In these difficult times, the need for strong American leadership \nbecomes ever clearer. That is why I am very pleased that Secretary \nAlbright has decided to proceed with her planned visit to the Middle \nEast. It is my profound hope that her efforts can jump start the ailing \npeace process.\n  I believe Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian Authority must both agree to \nfully engage in the peace process and take dramatic steps to halt these \nterrorist attacks if they wish to continue to receive financial \nassistance from the United States. Unless such action is taken in the \nimmediate future, I will steadfastly support cutting any and all aid to \nthe Palestinian Authority. It is truly unconscionable that American \nmoney, given in good faith, be used to aid those who would conspire \nwith terrorists.\n  Israel's greatest responsibility is to protect her citizens. Mr. \nArafat must understand that a true peace can be achieved only when \nIsraeli citizens are secure in their homes, in their places of worship, \nand on their streets. They deserve no less.\n  I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Israeli people on \nthis senseless tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8782-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8785-S8790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1079\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amounts made available to carry out title III \n                  of the Older Americans Act of 1965)\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Madam President, I thank Chairman Specter and the \nranking minority member, Senator Harkin, for their incredible \nstewardship and leadership in developing the 1998 Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, Education appropriations bill. It is one of the most \ndifficult bills that we have to deal with because the needs are so \ngreat; the needs for increased medical research, for research in all of \nthe areas, whether it be for breast cancer, whether it be for kidney \nprograms, whether it be for the programs for AIDS research.\n  Encompassed in this is how do we share the resources which are so \nlimited? So it really comes down to, unfortunately, choices, of not \ngiving sufficient funding to some of the most critically important \nareas affecting our health, affecting infants, and affecting all of our \npopulations.\n  But there is another population that continues to grow, a population \nthat has not, unfortunately, had their needs met, too. That is our \nsenior citizens. That is why I rise today, on behalf of America's \nelderly citizens, to increase the title III of the Older Americans Act. \nI offer an amendment that would increase it by $40 million, for a total \nof $893 million. The current Older Americans Act funding includes a 2-\npercent increase. That is 15 percent. That is a cost-of-living increase \nover last year's allocation.\n  Most people would say, ``Well, that's not bad in these times of \nausterity.'' I agree. But I think we have to look at the problem. The \nprimary goal of these community services is to keep millions--\nmillions--of frail elderly people living independent in their own \nhomes, in their own apartments, for as long as possible, allowing them \nto avoid unnecessary institutionalization and saving billions of \ndollars, not to mention improving their quality of life.\n  So the Older Americans Act provides a whole variety of programs, home \nand community-based services to the elderly, including congregate and \nhome-delivered meals--Meals on Wheels; we have heard of that--\ntransportation so that seniors do not live as shut-ins so they have an \nopportunity to come together with friends and neighbors, senior \nemployment, senior centers, adult day care and other services.\n  Three of these services account for more than two-thirds of the title \nIII funding: Congregate meals, that is $250 million; home-delivered \nmeals, $134 million; and transportation, $63 million. No one can deny \nthe incredible needs and the fact that, if anything, they grow and \ngrow.\n  The face of America's population, Mr. President, is changing. It is \ngrowing older. Believe it or not, those elderly people who are 85 years \nof age or older are growing faster than any others. They are growing at \na faster rate--85 and older. So when we talk about the needs of the \nfrail elderly and keeping them from being institutionalized, this is \nbecoming an increasing problem.\n  The elderly population over age 85 will increase by 36 percent by the \nyear 2005. Think of that; an incredible 36 percent. That is going to \ncall for increased services, increases well beyond what we can imagine \nand envision today. And unless we do, we are talking about a vulnerable \npopulation. They will have no other alternatives in many cases than to \nbe institutionalized. I suggest not only the quality of life of the \nseniors then becomes degraded to the extent that we do not even like to \nthink about it, but the cost factors will become incalculable.\n  The typical Older Americans Act participant, Mr. President, to get a \nprofile of who is that person, is a woman over 75, living on a very \nlimited fixed income, who needs daily help in preparing meals or weekly \ntransportation to a doctor.\n  Thirty-nine percent of the Older Americans Act participants have \nincomes at or below the poverty level.\n  Among States, the poverty rates for participants range from 17.2 to \n86.9 percent. Twelve States report at least half of their participants \nhave incomes at or below the poverty threshold.\n  Mr. President, why is a $40 million increase so desperately needed? \nWell, despite the steady funding increases, the effect of inflation and \nthe tremendous population growth have diminished the actual impact of \nthe annual appropriations increases. Over the past 15 years, there has \nbeen a 40-percent loss in the program's capacity to meet the needs of \nolder citizens due to a combination of the following factors: increased \ncosts due to inflation, serving increased numbers of frail elderly who \nneed more, and reduced Federal funding.\n  If inflation and the increasing age population were accounted for \nfrom the OAA's start in 1973, we would have had to double the funding. \nSo while the request for doubling the funding level in 1 year is \nunrealistic, certainly--certainly--the request that we put forth at 5 \npercent, or $40 million, is one that I believe is extremely \nconservative and one that I hope we can meet.\n  Where do we find the funds? Let me first say the committee has done \nan excellent job. It has identified funding, an increased funding of \n$15 million, by reducing the general administrative costs, which amount \nto about $1 billion, the bureaucracy, the overhead for administering \nthese programs, for the bureaucrats here in Washington and in other \nareas. I believe that by a further reduction by 5 percent, we can add \n$40 million. That is a very modest reduction as it relates to overhead. \nAnd that is what we intend to do.\n  So what we are talking about is making more resources available for \npeople, the frail elderly, people who need it, a population that \naverages 75 years of age, a population that continues to\n\n[[Page S8786]]\n\nincrease, as opposed to decreasing resources for bureaucrats.\n  I believe in the days of computerization, et cetera, and effective \nefficiency, we can do that. We can actually increase the services with \nless people by way of attrition, by way of maximizing the efficiency \nand the effectiveness that one person today can bring to the work force \nby use of the computer that can do the work of two or three or four.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1079, As Modified\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto submit a modification to the amendment which I have offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1079), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 45, line 13, strike ``$854,074,000'' and insert \n     ``$894,074,000''.\n       On page 85, line 19, strike ``$30,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$70,500,000''.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to offer an \namendment, along with my good friend and colleague Senator Coats from \nIndiana, which would increase our investment in one of the most \npromising engines of education reform in America today, which is the \ncharter school movement. This amendment would increase funding for the \ncharter school grant program from the current level of $51 million up \nto $100 million for fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. President, we recognize that this is a sizable jump in funding, \nbut let me put it in context and then go on to explain why we believe \nit is more than warranted.\n  Earlier this week, on Tuesday of this week, my friend and mentor, \nBill Bennett, wrote a column on the op-ed page of the Wall Street \nJournal in which he began with some startling numbers. ``This \nmorning,'' that is Tuesday morning, ``a record 52 million children will \nwalk into America's classrooms. And this year Americans will spend more \nthan a quarter of a trillion dollars trying to educate them.''\n  So when we think, as this amendment would do, Mr. President, of \ntaking the $51 million the Federal Government now invests in charter \nschools and raising it to $100 million--a sizable jump; just about \ndoubling it--let us put it in the broader context of the quarter of a \ntrillion dollars that is being spent every year in this country to \neducate our children. This additional $50 million, I think, provides \nenormous hope that the remaining quarter of a trillion dollars will be \nbetter spent.\n  Dr. Bill Bennett went on to say that these numbers alone ensure that \neducation will be at or near the top of the national political agenda, \nand indeed, in addition to this, there is greater political emphasis on \nsocial issues. Education is how many people talk about the condition of \nour children, cultural decline, and the Nation's moral well-being.\n  Dr. Bennett goes on to cite a number of hopeful signs of reform and \nprogress occurring in our education system, including some of the \nsuperb experiments that are now being tried with school choice or \nschool vouchers, school scholarships. But he also mentions charter \nschools. I quote from his article. ``Public schools that are freed from \nmany regulations, in exchange for greater autonomy and more \naccountability, are flourishing. There are now more than 700 charter \nschools in 28 States.''\n  Mr. President, the goal of this amendment is to help us open, help \nthe States, help individuals, help entrepreneurs open hundreds of more \ncharter schools. This movement has quickly become one of the most \npopular and encouraging developments in the world of education reform. \nSince the first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1991, 29 States \nand the District of Columbia have enacted charter programs. And as \nchildren head back to school this month, it is expected that more than \n700 charter schools will be in operation across the country, including \na whole new group in my own State of Connecticut, practically tripling \nthe number of charters that were in existence just 2 years ago.\n  The appeal of this new breed of schools is obvious. In the context of \na school system that is not adequately educating too many of our \nchildren, charters offer the promise of higher standards, greater \naccountability, broader flexibility to innovate in the classroom, and \nultimately greater choice, which is what more and more parents want in \npublic education. So far the broad array of charter schools already in \nbusiness are delivering on that potential. Parents give overwhelmingly \nhigh marks to charter schools for their responsiveness to them, the \nparents, as customers. Several independent studies show that this, in \nturn, is helping to generate greater parental involvement in the \neducation of their children.\n  These studies also show that charters are effectively serving diverse \npopulations, particularly many of the disadvantaged and at-risk \nchildren that traditional public schools have struggled to reach. While \nit is too soon to determine what impact charter schools are having on \noverall academic performance, the early returns in places like \nMassachusetts suggest that charters are succeeding where it matters \nmost, in the classroom.\n  Perhaps the most powerful endorsement of the charter school approach \ncame recently from the superintendent of public schools for the Seattle \npublic school district, who suggested that the city should consider \nmaking every school in its district a charter school, freeing the \nschools of the burdens of the central bureaucracy, setting a series of \nstandards of accountability that would have to be met by those who run \nthe school in a given amount of time and understanding that the charter \nis not forever. The charter is only renewed if the goals set out within \nit are realized.\n  The movement is being driven by a growing legion of parents, \neducators, business leaders and community activists who are convinced \nthat alternatives in public education, including charter schools, \nrepresent the future of public education in America. But Congress, to \nour credit, has made a valuable contribution to the growth of charters \nthrough the Federal charter grant program, which was authorized in 1994 \nwith broad bipartisan support. I was privileged to be a cosponsor of \nthat legislation with Senator David Durenberger, the main sponsor, \nSenator from Minnesota.\n\n  Over the last 3 years, the Federal charter program has helped scores \nof charter schools open. What do we do? We defray the costs many groups \nface in trying to start a school from scratch. That is what the Federal \nmoney goes to. Most States provide charter schools, and this is the \ncase in\n\n[[Page S8787]]\n\nConnecticut, with a per pupil allotment once they are in operation. But \ncharter operators have to scramble to cover such startup expenses as \nplanning a curriculum, leasing a building, hiring a staff.\n  A survey of charter school operators recently conducted by the \nDepartment of Education highlighted this problem showing that it was by \nfar the biggest obstacle to success that charter school operators face. \nIt is that obstacle that this amendment intends to diminish.\n  As the charter movement expands, the demand for this aid will only \ncontinue to grow with it. With the number of charter schools \nmushrooming each year, our ability to help them meet their startup \ncosts will quickly diminish, unless we increase the amount \nappropriated, as this amendment would do.\n  President Clinton recognized this when he issued a challenge in the \nState of the Union to double the funding for the Federal charter \nprogram. That is what we do, Senator Coats and I, in this amendment.\n  By doubling funding for this program, we would help scores of new \ncharter schools make the transition from the drawing board to the \nblackboard, and provide thousands of additional students with an \nopportunity to attend one of these innovative, performance-based \nprograms. Moreover, we would also send a strong message to charter \nadvocates and to families in general that the Federal Government is \ncommitted to supporting the good work that is happening at the State \nand local level and that we are serious about fundamentally improving \npublic education.\n  To make sure we spend this new money wisely, Senator Coats and I also \nintend to introduce legislation this fall aimed at strengthening the \nFederal charter program. From our experience to date, we have learned \nsome valuable lessons about how we can improve this program to speed \nthe development of charter schools in participating States and to also \nencourage nonparticipating States to join this movement. The \nlegislation we're preparing would use the new Federal funding to reward \nthose States that are most actively moving to create charters. It would \nalso tighten a few unintended loopholes in the current law that have \nallowed schools that are not true charters to receive Federal aid that \nwas not intended for them.\n  We can begin strengthening this program immediately by increasing our \ninvestment in charter schools. And that is the purpose of our amendment \ntoday. To pay for this new investment, we are proposing shifting a \nrelatively small amount of funds from three broad-based Federal \nprograms--the title VI block grant account, Goals 2000, and the Fund \nfor the Improvement of Education. All three of these programs are aimed \nat promoting educational reform and innovation, which is the same exact \nmission of the charter school program. So in essence, rather than \ncutting these three broad-based accounts, our amendment would simply \nearmark a fixed portion for a highly effective, well-targeted, and \nbroadly supported program.\n  The three programs from which we are shifting funding are all \nworthwhile efforts. But we feel strongly by earmarking a relatively \nsmall amount from them for the charter school program, we will be \ngetting the most bang for the books.\n  We are convinced that the charter movement, as charter expert Bruno \nManno of the Hudson Institute has said, is arguably the most vibrant \nforce in public education today. It has managed to bring together \nparents, educators, and political leaders from both parties in support \nof an effort to inject more choice, accountability, and competition \ninto our public schools, an effort that focuses first and foremost on \nperformance, not process--performance in educating our children.\n  I hope we can come together ourselves in a bipartisan fashion, as we \ndid in launching the Federal charter program, to demonstrate our \ncommitment to these goals by passing this amendment. I thank the \nmanagers of the bill for the opportunity to speak on this important \nissue, and would ask them for their support.\n  Mr. President, let me discuss the funding offsets for the Lieberman-\nCoats charter school amendment.\n  The Lieberman-Coats amendment would increase funding for the Federal \ncharter school grant program by $49 million. Here is a breakdown of how \nthis amendment is paid for: $25 million would come from the title VI \nblock grant program that supports State and local driven innovation \nefforts. This would leave funding for this account at $285 million; $14 \nmillion would come from the Goals 2000 program. This would leave \nfunding for this account at $515.9 million, which would still amount to \na $25 million increase over the fiscal year 1997 level; and $10 million \nwould come from the Fund for the Improvement of Education, a pool of \ndiscretionary funds administered by the Secretary of Education. This \nwould leave funding for this account at $40 million, the same amount \nappropriated for fiscal year 1997.\n  All of these programs are broad-based efforts aimed at promoting \neducation reform and innovation and lifting standards. The charter \nschool program is dedicated to these same goals. So rather than cutting \nthe three programs listed above, the Lieberman-Coats amendment simply \nearmarks a fixed portion of these accounts for arguably the most \npromising education reform and innovation initiative in the country.\n  I notice the presence on the floor of my cosponsor and Senator \nStevens as well. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote occur on \nthe pending D'Amato amendment at 4:30 p.m. today, and that no \namendments be in order to the D'Amato amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. I understand that shortly the Senator from Alaska will \nmake a proposal that is certainly acceptable to Senator Lieberman and \nI, and I will be very brief in my comments.\n  I am pleased to join my colleague from Connecticut in coauthoring and \ncosponsoring this amendment to increase funding for charter schools. \nClearly, we are in a situation where I think there is a growing \nrecognition that the status quo in our public schools is unacceptable, \nparticularly our public schools located in low-income and urban areas. \nThat status quo has existed for quite some time.\n  It has been nearly 13 years since the President's commission reported \nabout mediocrity in public education. We have seen numerous attempts \nboth through public policy and through local initiatives to try to \naddress the mediocrity and improve educational opportunities for our \nyoung people. We have met considerable resistance from the Federal \nGovernment, from the Department of Education, because they do not want \nto upset the status quo. Yet parents are voting with their feet and \nwith considerable sacrifice and demanding at local and State levels \nthat change be made. They are demanding alternatives.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have explored a possibility of vouchers for \nlow income, providing parents who do not have a choice, a choice that \nmost of the rest of us have, that if their failing public school is not \neducating their young people they would have some means and wherewithal \nto utilize a voucher to achieve a better education.\n  This is not that amendment. This is an amendment that addresses \nanother alternative, a viable alternative called charter schools that \nSenator Lieberman has said is being more and more accepted throughout \nAmerica. Even the Department of Education, in releasing its first \nformal report on the study of charter schools, has some findings \nindicating that charter schools have racial compositions similar to \nstatewide averages, and in many cases have a higher proportion of \nminority students. So the charge that they are just for a certain race \nor just for the elite is not a well-founded charge.\n  Sixty percent of public charter schools are new startups rather than \nconversions of public and private schools to charter status. They \nenroll roughly the same percent of low-income students on the average \nof other public schools. So a lot of red herrings about charter schools \nundermining the effectiveness of public schools is not proven.\n  The Hudson Institute, located in Indianapolis, has undertaken a very \nsignificant and comprehensive study of\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\ncharter schools called Charter Schools in Action. Their research has \ninvolved visiting 14 States, 60 schools, and visiting thousands of \nteachers and students. The key findings are that three-fifths of \ncharter school students rate their charter school teachers as better. \nOver two-thirds of parents say the charter school is better than the \nchild's previous school with respect to class size and school size. \nOver 90 percent of the teachers are satisfied with their charter school \neducational philosophy, their size, colleagues and students. And among \nstudents who said they were failing at their previous school, more than \nhalf are now doing excellent or good work.\n  The gains were dramatic, most dramatic for minority and low-income \nyoungsters, and were confirmed by their parents.\n  In summary, the Hudson Institute study found charter schools point to \nimportant ways to improve and reinvent public education as a whole. The \nimplications from the success of charter schools indicate that \nsuccessful public schools should be consumer-oriented, diverse results \noriented and professional places that also function as media \ninstitutions in their area.\n  Because of the tremendous success of charter schools in the past 6 \nyears, I joined Senator Lieberman in an attempt to double the funding. \nAs Senator Lieberman pointed out, they offer great accountability, \nbroader flexibility for classroom innovation, and ultimately more \nchoice in public education.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have addressed what we think are some offsets \nto provide for this doubling of funding to encourage charter schools. \nThere has been some concern about where that funding comes from. I \nthink there are some creative, innovative, and useful offsets, but it \nwould engender considerable debate and discussion and might undermine \nthis effort. Senator Stevens has found, I think, a very acceptable way \nto address this, and I appreciate his involvement and his efforts and \nhis support for this.\n  With that, I thank my colleague, Senator Lieberman from Connecticut, \nfor his initiatives, and I am pleased to join him in this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this pending Lieberman-Coats amendment is \na good one. We see no reason to take further time on it because the \nHouse bill does have the $75 million for charter schools. The effect of \nthis amendment would be to increase it to that amount.\n  It is the intention of the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nSpecter, to notify the House that in conference we will recede to the \nHouse on this item.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the two Senators, Senator Lieberman \nand Coats, and ask under the circumstances that they accept our word \nthat will be the amount of money provided for charter schools under \nthis bill when it comes out of conference.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska very \nmuch for his statement. The willingness of the Senate conferees to \nyield to the House on this would accomplish an enormous step forward in \nFederal support of the charter school movement. There is no need to \ntake any more time of the Senate. Obviously, the word of the Senator \nfrom Alaska is bankable. I thank him for that.\n  I thank my colleague from Indiana and I appreciate very much another \nexpression of bipartisan support for this educational reform movement \nthat is sweeping America. With our help, it will help it even more with \nthis additional amount of money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment and congratulate the \nSenators from Connecticut, Indiana, and Alaska for not only their \nsupport for charter schools but also for the additional funding, \nbecause this is a success story. There are successes in communities all \nacross the country. The number of charter schools has exploded. I think \nthere are over 700 now, and growing.\n  A lot of States are looking to see how can we improve our schools, \nhow can we make education better. Charter schools have been a proven \nsuccess.\n  I compliment my colleagues for bipartisan work in making a real \naddition to a proven success story and improving education.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1080 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself, and \n     Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 1081.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection \n     (b), none of the funds made available under this Act, or any \n     other Act making appropriations for fiscal year 1998, may be \n     used by the Department of Labor or the Department of Justice \n     to conduct a rerun of a 1996 election for the office of \n     President, General Secretary, Vice-President, or Trustee of \n     the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n       (b) Exception.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the submission to Congress of a \n     certification by the President of the United States that the \n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters does not have funds \n     sufficient to conduct a rerun of a 1996 election for the \n     office of President, General Secretary, Vice-President, or \n     Trustee of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the \n     President of the United States may transfer funds from the \n     Department of Justice and the Department of Labor for the \n     conduct and oversight of such a rerun election.\n       (2) Requirement.--Prior to the transfer of funds under \n     paragraph (1), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters \n     shall agree to repay the Secretary of the Treasury for the \n     costs incurred by the Department of Labor and the Department \n     of Justice in connection with the conduct of an election \n     described in paragraph (1). Such agreement shall provide that \n     any such repayment plan be reasonable and practicable, as \n     determined by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Treasury, and be structured in a manner that permits the \n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters to continue to \n     operate.\n       (3) Repayment plan.--The International Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters shall submit to the President of the United States, \n     the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the Majority \n     and Minority Leaders of the House of Representatives, and the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, a plan for the \n     repayment of amounts described in paragraph (2), at an \n     interest rate equal to the Federal underpayment rate \n     established under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 as in effect for the calender quarter in which \n     the plan is submitted, prior to the expenditure of any funds \n     under this section.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment I send to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Jeffords is an amendment that deals with \nthe potential rerun of the 1996 Teamsters election. I think most of my \ncolleagues are aware the Teamsters election, which was held in 1996, \nhas now been held invalid, at least by the administrator overseeing the \nelection who determined that there was fraud, that there was \ncorruption, and that there needed to be another election. She has now \nmade that petition before the U.S. district court. The court will rule \non that. My guess is she will probably order another election.\n  The purpose of this is to ensure that taxpayers won't pay for the \nnext election. To give my colleagues a little history of how the U.S. \ntaxpayers paid for the last one, I have heard estimates of around $22 \nmillion. I also heard more than $22 million, maybe higher or closer to \n$28 or $29 million, but the taxpayers paid millions of dollars, $20 \nmillion-some for the 1996 Teamsters election.\n  Now it seems that the Federal overseer of that election says it was \nnot fair, it was not right, there was corruption, it needs to be held \nover again.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to say that taxpayers will not pay \nfor it again. I might mention, somebody said why would taxpayers pay \nfor it in the first place? Mr. President, 99 percent of all union \nelections that are held in this country, the U.S. taxpayer does not\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\npay for. There was a 1989 decree with the Teamsters and the Justice \nDepartment entered into in 1989 that called for the elections both in \n1991 and 1996. The 1991 election, I might mention, had oversight by the \nFederal Government but was not paid for by the Federal Government. \nActually, the Teamsters paid for the 1991 election.\n  With Federal Government oversight, no allegations of improprieties or \ncorruption were made. It was a good election. The 1996 election, \nhowever, provided for in the decree, provided that the taxpayers would \npay for the 1996 election. Now the overseer of that election said, wait \na minute, there was fraud, we will have to have another election.\n  The purpose of this amendment is, let's not pay for it, let the \nTeamsters pay for it. Somebody said, well, maybe they do not have the \nmoney, it could cost several million. I heard it could cost $10 \nmillion, it might cost $20 million. Who knows? I think they will be \nmore frugal if they are paying for it. Certainly, they are capable of \npaying for it. In the event they do not have the money, our amendment \nallows for the taxpayers to pay for it, but we have to be paid back.\n  Again, I think taxpayers did not get their money's worth out of the \n1996 election. If you paid $20 million-some and you find there was \nrampant corruption, fraud, and abuse to the extent we have to have \nanother election--we should not let that happen again.\n  So, that is the purpose of my amendment. I think it is a fair \namendment. It is in accord with the 1989 decree ordered in the past. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                amendment no. 1082 to amendment no. 1081\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1082 to amendment No. 1081.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end thereof, insert the following:\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect \n     the obligations of the United States under the consent decree \n     in United States v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, \n     88 Civ. 4486 (DNE) (S.D.N.Y.), or any court orders \n     thereunder.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just for the benefit of the membership, \nto describe where we are, the amendment that I have offered would \ninclude the Nickles amendment, but it would also add to the Nickles \namendment: ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the \nobligations of the United States under the consent decree'' entered \ninto in United States v. Teamsters, decided in 1989.''\n  So, effectively, the Nickles amendment would be perfected with the \nKennedy amendment. All we are saying with the Kennedy amendment would \nbe that nothing in the Nickles amendment would eliminate the \nobligations of the United States that was a part of a consent decree \nthat was signed in 1989 because we are not operating in a vacuum here \ntoday with regard to the Teamsters elections. We are basically \noperating on the basis of a consent decree that was signed by the \nprevious administration, signed by the Bush administration, and \nsupported by the Bush administration.\n  All that we are saying is that whatever decision that is going to be \nmade, or whatever language would be included in the Nickles amendment, \nit will not be contrary to what was agreed to by the United States, \nagreed to by the U.S. Government and the previous administration and \nadhered to by the courts. We don't know what the future is going to \nbring with regard to any potential future election or what the \nallocation of responsibility would be in terms of who would be \nresponsible to pay for various aspects of the election. We don't \nprejudge that. All we are saying is that nothing in the Nickles \namendment will, in any way, undermine the responsibilities of the \nUnited States, which I believe is a solemn agreement and a solemn \ncommitment, and that has been accepted in the courts of law by the \nUnited States.\n  Now, Mr. President, this amendment, I believe, is basically a \ntransparent attempt to punish the Teamsters Union for winning the UPS \nstrike, and it doesn't deserve really to pass. This issue is no light \nmatter. The amendment would require the Federal Government to abdicate \nits responsibility under the court-approved consent ordered and signed \nby the Justice Department under the Bush administration. If the Federal \nGovernment abdicates this responsibility, it could be subject to \ncontempt proceedings in the Federal court.\n  The amendment would deny Federal funds to oversee the forthcoming \nTeamsters election, which had been ordered after the 1996 election was \nnullified by the Government-appointed election officer. That election \nwas paid for by Federal dollars. The Federal Government agreed to fund \nthat election under a 1989 consent order in the Federal court of New \nYork City that resolved a racketeering suit brought by the Government. \nThe suit was a culmination of over 30 years of effort to eliminate \norganized crime from the leadership of the Teamsters Union. Congress \nhas been heavily involved in that process. From the McClellan committee \nhearings in 1957 to the Senate permanent subcommittee investigation \nhearings in 1994, we have worked to reduce the influence of organized \ncrime in the union and in the industry where its members work.\n  In 1988, the Justice Department, under President Bush, sued the \nTeamsters under the Federal racketeering laws. The charge was that the \nunion was dominated by organized crime. That was settled in 1989. The \ncourt-approved consent order was designed to rid the union of officers \nwith ties to organized crime and to create a new, open and democratic \nstructure in the union. The consent order provided that the 1991 \nelection for Teamster offices would be supervised by a court-appointed \nelection officer. The consent order also required the 1996 election to \nbe supervised by the election officer.\n  Let me quote the union-defendant's consent to the election officer, \nat Government expense, to supervise the 1996 elections on page 16 of \nthe consent order:\n\n       In accord with that decree, the election officer supervised \n     the '96 election, at Government expense. Late last month, the \n     officer ruled that the '96 election must be rerun because of \n     irregularities committed by consultants to one of the \n     candidates. The election officer specifically refused to find \n     that any union officer or member committed any misconduct and \n     noted that Teamster President Ron Carey cooperated with the \n     election officer in a manner inconsistent with guilt. Under \n     the consent order, the Federal court must formally order any \n     rerun election that is held. The court's decision will be \n     issued later this month.\n\n  It is the consent order that obligated the Government to pay for the \n1996 election. Under the consent order, any rerun of that election \nordered by the election officer should be Government-funded. Yet, this \namendment asks the Government to walk away from that clear obligation. \nIf passed, the amendment would order the Government to subject itself \nto a contempt proceeding. These financial obligations were entered into \nby a Republican-controlled Justice Department and a Republican \nadministration. They were part of a comprehensive and successful effort \nto root out organized crime from the Teamsters Union and restore \ndemocratic process to that union.\n  It is an outrage to ask Congress to abdicate our responsibility to \nhelp in eliminating corruption in this union. The heart of this \namendment is an attempt to punish the Teamsters for their extraordinary \nsuccess in the recent UPS strike, in which the Teamsters won 10,000 \nmore permanent jobs for their members, improved benefits for all \n185,000 UPS employees, and sensitized the entire Nation to the gross \nabuses in many workplaces that force hard-working men and women into \npart-time jobs with lower wages and lower benefits than they deserve.\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\n  Some of our Republican friends may believe the Teamsters should be \npunished for these gains. I believe that they deserve praise instead of \npunishment. I urge my colleagues to give our amendment the kind of \nsupport that it deserves.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. In looking at your amendment, you said that nothing in \nthis section should be construed to affect the obligations under the \nconsent decree. I might agree to that part. But then you also add, ``or \nany court orders thereunder.'' What do you mean by that last few words?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would expect that what we would include in that is any \ncourt orders that would be related under the consent decree or that \nwould be related to the consent. Is there something in particular--I \nwould be glad to attempt to define that, if the Senator has some \nparticular concerns in some particular way. But it seems to me to be \nfairly clear. Any of the orders that would be a part of that consent \ndecree. Now that we are retained and we are within the consent decree, \nthere would be any of the court orders with regard to the various \nelections. And I would expect that as we did before, we would want to \ncomply with the consent decree in those areas.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am just trying to help a little bit. If the Senator \nwill drop those last few words, I might agree to his amendment, because \nI think our amendment is consistent with the consent decree. But I may \nbe overly interpreting. I don't know exactly what the sentiment is for \n``or any court orders thereunder.'' But it might be hoped by the \nTeamsters, or something, they could go to court and find some court \nthat would say, yes, the Federal Government should pay for a rerun \nelection. That is not covered.\n  I might tell my colleague that I have done a little homework on this. \nThe rerun is not covered by the consent decree. There certainly is no \nobligation for taxpayers to pay for reruns, which is not consistent \nwith the statement of the Senator from Massachusetts. That, I think, is \nfactual.\n  So my point is, if the Senator would delete those last few words ``or \nany court orders thereunder,'' I think I could accept his amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If there was any court order affecting the 1996 \nelections of Teamsters officers--I would like to try a short quorum \ncall to make sure that would be language, which I think appears to be \nto the Senator's point, and I think it would meet the objectives. But \nmaybe we could suggest a short quorum call to make sure that we have \nthe language that conforms to both of our understanding.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8785-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8790-S8791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ELECTION IN LOUISIANA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was distressed yesterday to hear \ncomments on the floor relative to the duty of the U.S. Senate under the \nU.S. Constitution to determine--and we have the sole authority under \nthe Constitution to determine--the issues as relating to the presence \nor absence of that degree of fraud or other conditions that would \naffect the outcome of the election in Louisiana. The subject has been \ndiscussed many times on the floor.\n  As chairman of the Rules Committee, I have overall responsibility for \nthe direction and the daily conduct of this investigation. I will later \ntoday either address the Senate or put in the Record a detailed \naccounting of everything that I, the staff of the committee, and others \nhave done since the last time I reported to the Senate with regard to \nthis very important case. But I wish to assure my colleagues that while \nI regret that the Democrats decided to walk out on the investigation \nthat the Republican majority of the committee, and specifically myself, \nwe have continued to fulfill what I and others regard as the bottom-\nline responsibility of the U.S. Senate, and that is to go and look at \nevery reasonable source of potential evidence as it relates to fraud in \nthis election. This has taken a great deal of time. I recognize that it \nhas stressed the patience of many.\n  But if you look historically, as I have done, at comparable \nsituations when the U.S. Senate has been faced with the election \nproblems, this case thus far is relatively short in duration. Many have \ngone for as much as 18 months to over 2 years.\n  It is my hope and my expectation that we can conclude this work in a \nreasonable period of time. Under the leadership of our distinguished \nmajority leader and, indeed, some on the other side of the aisle, we \nwere very near to an agreement whereby both sides concurred that this \nmatter could be concluded before late September--this month. That fell \nby the wayside, and I was then given the authority at long last, \nalthough I had asked a number of times--it had been denied by the \nDemocrats--the authority to issue subpoenas. I received that authority \nfrom the committee. Subpoenas were promptly issued. And I went to \nLouisiana on two occasions and each time conducted 2 full days of \nhearings. I repeat, 2 full days; 4 full days thus far of hearings in \nLouisiana.\n  In response to those subpoenas, individuals without exception came \nin, some voluntarily. Those individuals responded in large measure to \nthe best of their knowledge to each and every question. Some \nequivocated. That is true in any trial. I used to be an assistant U.S. \nattorney for 4 or 5 years, and I have tried many cases. But I can judge \nwitnesses fairly well based on that experience. I say on the whole the \nwitnesses were forthcoming in their oral testimony.\n  Likewise, we issued subpoenas duces tecum for records. We have in the \npossession of the Senate now some four to six cartons of records as a \nconsequence of those subpoenas issued in August. Most of those records \nrelate to the gambling industry, which, according to official records, \nput anywhere from $10 to $15 million into the elections taking place on \nDecember 5 or 6 of 1996 because there was a referendum that affected \nthe gambling industry. They had a right to participate and contribute \nmoney to foster their interests in certain votes as related to the \nreferendum.\n  But anyway, that is a voluminous amount of record material that must \nbe gone over carefully by Senate staff and such other adjunct support \nas we can get from the GAO. Much to my disappointment, and despite the \nefforts of the distinguished majority leader, myself, and others, the \nFBI pulled out when the Democrats left. That left us short-handed in \nthe nature of support. But we are doing our best. And despite the \nefforts of majority leader, myself, and others, the FBI still has not \ncome in to give any further help.\n  All of this is to say the buck stops with me as the chairman. And I \ncan, in clearest of conscience, report to my colleagues that I feel \nthat the Rules Committee, its staff, and the Republican Senators \nparticipating are fulfilling the exact requirement placed upon us by \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  I urge that the Members of this body continue to allow that work to \nbe done in an orderly fashion as best we can, given the extraordinary \nhandicaps we have, both financial, time and staffwise, to do our work, \nto go over the records we have.\n  I announced in Louisiana it would be my judgment, subject to \nconcurrence of other members of the committee, to have at least one \nmore hearing, this time here in the Rules Committee room, at which time \nthe gambling industry would be subpoenaed to come and explain in detail \nthe voluminous amount of records we now have before us. We need to \nascertain whether or not this sum of money, ranging from $10 million to \n$15 million, was expended in a proper way in accordance with Federal \nand State law, or in fact did some of it slip into areas which could \nhave generated fraud and, indeed, affected the outcome of this election \nthrough fraud.\n  So, Mr. President, I see the majority leader now at this time and I, \ndue to time constraints, have to stop my remarks, but I will put in the \nRecord today, either orally or insert a more complete dissertation, \nexactly what we have done.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8790-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8791-S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, our Democratic \ncolleagues are objecting today to permission for two committees to meet \nduring the pendency of this session. The Agriculture Committee began \nmeeting at 9 a.m. this morning to discuss rural and agriculture credit \nissues. Yet, as a result of that objection, or the objection we heard \non that committee meeting, they had to abruptly end their meeting at \n11:30 this morning.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee is scheduled to meet at 2 \np.m. today, and I want to take some action here momentarily that will \nallow them to, in fact, begin their hearing to discuss the Superfund \nCleanup Act. Permission for them to meet was also objected to by the \nDemocrats. It is my understanding that prominent witnesses have flown \nin from all over the country to appear before the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee to discuss this vital environmental issue, what \ncan we do to reform Superfund so the lawyers don't clean up but we \nclean up hazardous waste sites across America in most every State in \nthis Nation.\n  Included in the group that was to come to testify is the Governor of \nNebraska. He is scheduled to be introduced momentarily by one of the \nSenators from Nebraska. That testimony would certainly be key with \nrespect to the Superfund Act in that State.\n  The objection lodged by the Democrats would deny that meeting from \ntaking place unless the Senate were to recess. I regret that the Senate \nmust recess in the middle of the day while discussing a very, very \nimportant piece of legislation, the Labor and Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill. We were, I thought, committed to working together \nin completing the appropriations process, especially a bill like this. \nWhile there are still some amendments pending that are of great \ninterest and perhaps even controversial, we have made progress, and I \nthink we could finish it up tonight with a little effort.\n  Unfortunately, this objection will only delay the consideration and \npassage of the Labor, HHS appropriations bill. Our colleagues from the \nother side of the aisle have stated that ``there is no intention to \ninterrupt the business of the Senate, which is to pass these \nappropriations bills. There is no one out there objecting to the work \non those appropriations bills.'' Yet, the Democratic objection to the \nEnvironment Committee meeting today on Superfund in fact does interrupt \nthe business of the Senate. I truly regret the action taken by our \ncolleagues here today and hope this will not become a practice by \nMembers on the minority side of the aisle.\n  Having said all of that, by consent a vote is scheduled at 4:30 p.m. \ntoday on the D'Amato amendment to the Labor, HHS appropriations bill, \nand I now ask unanimous consent the Senate stand in recess until 4:30 \np.m. today.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that we come \nto this point, but I think it is important for us to remember from \nwhere it is we have come and how it is we got here. I will not \nelaborate in the detail at this point except to say this:\n  This was a bipartisan investigation during the first phase. I recall \nto my colleagues during that phase we asked the same attorneys who were \ninvolved in the last contested election--that is, Senator Feinstein and \nher opponent, Mr. Huffington--to examine the circumstances of this \nparticular race. They did. They recommended a certain course of action, \nand the majority on the Rules Committee chose to ignore it.\n  They then set in motion a second phase for investigation. That \ninvestigation also was bipartisan. That investigation took the course \nof a couple of months and came back again on a bipartisan basis with \nrecommendations that again were ignored by the majority.\n  It was with increasing frustration that Democrats warned our \nRepublican colleagues that we could not tolerate this endless \nabrogation of the regular order, this bipartisan effort to come to some \nconclusion on this investigation.\n  With some reluctance, we continued to work and ultimately indicated \nthat beyond the end of July we were simply not in a position to \ntolerate unnecessary elongation and the increasingly partisan nature of \nthis investigation and put our colleagues on notice that it must end. \nWe indicated that if it had not ended by the time we came back after \nthe August recess, we would have no recourse but to add increasing \npressure to the process to bring about some end.\n  Now, this may or may not bring about an end. I am disappointed and \nsomewhat alarmed that the chairman of the Rules Committee has now \nannounced further hearings and further efforts to prolong this--in my \nview, completely unnecessarily. It would be one thing if evidence had \nbeen produced to suggest in some way some wrongdoing on the part of \nSenator Landrieu, but that has yet to be produced. In fact, just the \nopposite. If any wrongdoing, anything related to wrongdoing has been \nfound, it has been with regard to her opponent, Mr. Jenkins. That is \nwhere the wrongdoing becomes increasingly evident as we look closer and \ncloser at this case.\n  So, Mr. President, I must say we will continue to insist that \ncommittees meet for no longer than 2 hours as long as this situation \ncontinues. If it takes a month, I will put my colleagues on notice that \nwe will use this selective approach for committee meetings for however \nlong it takes until it is resolved. We simply cannot tolerate the \nunnecessary and political effort to prolong this investigation further, \nand we have no other recourse but to take the action we have, and so \nfor that reason I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to make sure that the--first of all, \nI do not think----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do not intend to object to the unanimous-consent \nrequest propounded by the majority leader, and I apologize for it. I \nobject to this process. I do not want to have my objection construed as \nan objection to the UC propounded by the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret that we have to take this action in \norder to get our business done on a very important environmental issue. \nThis sort of selective hit certainly, I think, would not be in the best \ninterests of the legislative process of the Senate. We want to get \nSuperfund legislation considered by the committee to the floor. We want \nto hear from witnesses such as the Governor of Nebraska and citizens \nwho are affected by this. It seems to me the normal way of doing \nbusiness around here is that is allowed to happen.\n  Mr. President, the saber rattling has begun. After bipartisan \ncooperation by Senate Democrats and Republicans over the past several \nmonths, it seems as though the Democrats have now returned to the \npreening and posturing of politicians more interested in blocking and \nobstructing the other side than concern for the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  Senate Democrats have effectively withdrawn from the bipartisan \nspirit of negotiation and compromise that has been evidenced regarding \nthe budget and tax bills recently enacted by the Congress. Mr. \nPresident, the minority is, in effect, threatening to shut down the \neffective operation of the Senate. Now, they can call it selective \ncooperation or some other slick phrase that seeks to skirt the truth of \nthe matter, but the American people are too smart for these word games, \nor, in Washington speak, for deceptive political spin.\n  Let me state, positively, that we are more than willing to continue \nthe spirit of bipartisanship to achieve significant accomplishments on \nsubjects of importance to the American people. For example, we are more \nthan willing to work through the Appropriations bills, through ISTEA, \nand through debate on the many other matters pending before the Senate. \nBut it is going to take cooperation and good faith on both sides, \nincluding the Members of the minority.\n  That good faith and cooperation is now missing on the part of the \nminority. The subject of the investigation into the election in \nLouisiana involves a duty of the Senate--of every Member of the \nSenate--to fully, thoroughly,\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\nand completely investigate the conduct of such elections where the \nintegrity and result of the election is legitimately called into \nquestion. The minority is refusing to allow--in fact, is actively \nobstructing--the Senate from conducting a thorough and complete \ninvestigation of the election in Louisiana.\n  If the minority wishes to prevent the Senate from living up to its \nduty regarding this election contest, and wishes to prevent the Senate \nfrom considering these important matters that I have noted and to shut \ndown the Senate, then the minority must assume the responsibility for \nthe consequences. Mr. President, good faith and cooperation is a two-\nway street. We believe that it is important to conduct and complete \nthis election investigation in a thorough and complete manner. We are \nbound and determined that the investigation will be completed despite \nobstructionist tactics. I urge the minority to recognize the importance \nof this subject and the essential place that good faith plays in this \nlegislative process. I urge the minority to assist us in completing \nthis important investigation and to work together with us in good faith \nto address the many other subjects which are important to the American \npeople.\n  I will sum it up this way. This is not the way to get the \ninvestigation by the Rules Committee concluded. In fact, it will cause \ndifficulty and will probably delay it. The goal is not--there is no way \nwe could just say, OK, it is over right now. The intent of the chairman \nis to have a hearing, to see what evidence they have found during the \nAugust recess, and I presume to have a meeting at some point to decide \nwhat action, if any or none, is to be taken. We will conclude this. We \nhave had to proceed, frankly, without the cooperation of the Democrats. \nI have been in Congress 25 years. I have never, never, ever before seen \none party or the other, either party, walk out on a committee's \ninvestigation or activities, even though there have been many, many \ninvestigations, several in which I was involved.\n  When I can look my colleagues in the Senate and the American people \nin the eye and say we have looked at this and we have found out as best \nwe could--with the lack of help from the FBI, for instance, in most \ninstances--we have concluded what happened or did not happen, and we in \ngood conscience can say that, when I can do that, then we will conclude \nit. I can't do that right now.\n  But rather than engaging in extended debate at this time, there will \nobviously be other opportunities to do that and----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I have, say, a minute and a half?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will yield the floor at this point, but I \ndo hope we can be brief so we can get the committee started.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be brief. I thank the majority leader. I thank \nboth leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to assure the Senate that I said in Louisiana, as \nI concluded the second hearing--and we had a total of 4 days of \nhearings--it would be my intention to come back and recommend to the \nRules Committee and the leadership of the Senate that I have another \nhearing, at which time we will assess in specific the voluminous amount \nof record material now in our possession from the gambling industry and \nthat within a period of perhaps a week after that I would schedule a \nsecond meeting, at which time I would give to the full Committee on \nRules all of the evidence, my own assessment, and then entertain such \nresolutions as I or other members may wish to submit.\n  That I think can be done within a 3-week period of time, as I roughly \noutlined this morning to my distinguished leader. But I decided on that \nschedule 10 days ago.\n  Now, I say to you that thus far there has been no evidence which, in \nthe judgment of this Senator, has impugned Senator Landrieu, but that \nis not the underlying issue. It is whether or not there were other \nfactors in this election which could have affected the outcome as a \nconsequence of criminal fraud. And I have said, much to the \ndiscouragement of many, that thus far, after the first hearing in \nLouisiana, there was no body of evidence which I felt could meet that \nburden.\n  I cannot make the same statement after the second hearing in \nLouisiana, because I haven't had the opportunity to assess four boxes \nof information. But we are proceeding, although handicapped, as \nexpeditiously as we can. I have always been absolutely objective and \nfair about my pronouncements in this case and my assessment of the \nevidence. But until such time as we have looked in every area where \npotentially that quantum of fraud which could have affected the outcome \nof the election might have occurred, I cannot say this investigation \nwould be complete. I do believe the work that needs to be done under my \nleadership can be concluded in the third week of September.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8791-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nStevens and Grams be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 1079 to S. \n1061.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak for up to 3 minutes on the pending D'Amato amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the amendment by Senator \nD'Amato to add funding for the support services for seniors to the \nadditional funding. They perform a very vital service as places for \nseniors to gather and to have their meals and to carry out the purposes \nof the legislation to improve the quality of life in the golden years; \nand especially in the context where senior benefits have come under \nsuch attack, so much concern that I heard, for example, in my travels \nthrough Pennsylvania, where there is concern about the solidity of \nSocial Security and what is happening with Medicare. I believe it is a \nwise course to make an allocation from administrative costs across the \nboard, to add the funding in the D'Amato amendment.\n  We have funded, last year, some $300,556,000. The administration made \na request to cut that funding to $291,375,000. Our Senate markup, \nagreed to by Senator Harkin and myself in our committee and in the full \ncommittee, was $305,556,000. So, instead of dropping the amount by more \nthan $9 million as the administration had requested, we put an \nadditional $5 million in. On reflection, hearing the arguments of the \nSenator from New York, Senator D'Amato, I think that the addition of \nthis $40 million is well placed, so I lend my voice in support of the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from New York on \nthe floor. I see him reaching for the microphone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me thank the chairman of this \ncommittee, Senator Specter. As I indicated before, this is a most \ndifficult, difficult task, the management of scarce resources for \nLabor, Health, and Human Services, with the demands from the various \ncommunities for additional funding for medical research, the scarceness \nof resources, and the difficult time in the allocations. His support is \ngreatly welcomed in this area. I am deeply appreciative.\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, I \nhave spent a great deal of time concentrating on how to improve the \nways the nutrition programs and senior services that are part of the \nOlder Americans Act. I appreciate the work of the Senator from New York \non this related funding issue.\n  In March 1995, I was pleased to have New Hampshire meals provider \nDebbie Perou-Hermans come to Washington to testify before the Aging \nSubcommittee; she emphasized the role these programs play for our \nseniors in New Hampshire and across the Nation. I also know that what \nwe accomplish through the funds spent on other senior services--such as \nsupporting congregate centers, transportation services, and health \nprograms and counseling--is vital to the meeting the requirements of \nthis population.\n  I think it is important to note, in addition, that this program has \nseveral other important qualities: The Older Americans Act requires the \nStates to invest in these critical services; it has a great track \nrecord for leveraging private funds; and it generally makes its \nservices available to all seniors, many of who are suffering from the \nchallenges of social isolation, not just those in financial need. Need \nwears many faces in America.\n  I believe that we should work hard to ensure that the benefits are \nmaximized through more flexibility in the funding of needed services, \nto be certain that the decisions about how and where these dollars are \nbeing spent are made at the State and local level. That will be the \ngoal of the reauthorization bill that I am assembling which will be \nbased on the bill I introduced in the 104th Congress.\n  However, I would like to quickly ask a question of my colleague from \nNew York, Senator D'Amato. You stated in your introductory remarks that \nyour goal is to increase the availability of services to our seniors \nthrough the infusion of this additional $40 million. But I do not note \nany specific assignment of these funds. Would the Senator clarify again \nfor me his intention to ensure that these dollars are spent on services \nthat are proven to be effective and efficient, and not to pad the \nadministrative accounts over at the Administration on Aging, or to \nallow them funds to try new things?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would like to assure the Senator from New Hampshire \nthat my intention is to put this $40 million in to those services that \nwe know are making the lives of our seniors healthier and more \nindependent. Indeed, at the same time this amendment seeks to bring \nmore resources into effective services for the elderly, it also reduces \nfunding from administrative accounts. I share the Senator's interest in \nboth getting needed services to our seniors and in reducing overhead \ncosts.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then I am pleased to have the opportunity today to support \nthe Senator from New York's increase in funding to the services \nprovided by the Older American's Act.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we are ready to proceed now to \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from New York, amendment No. 1079, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1071\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I believe that in order to achieve a goal, \nwe must set the goal, commit the necessary resources to reaching the \ngoal, and establish a method for measuring our progress toward that \ngoal. Voluntary national testing would enable us to reach our goal of \nraising the achievement levels of America's children.\n  I oppose the Coats Amendment because it deprives parents, school \nadministrators, teachers, and students of the information needed to \ncontinue the work of constructive education reform. Funding for the \ndevelopment, planning, implementation, and administration of voluntary \nnational testing for individual students in mathematics and reading is \nimportant for several reasons. Requiring a Federal statute would impede \ncooperative efforts to ensure that children in every State have the \nnecessary knowledge and skills to be competitive in today's highly \nmobile and globally conscious society.\n  Put simply, we need voluntary testing because we cannot ascertain \nwhere we are going if we do not know where we are.\n  Parents need to know how their child's educational achievement level \nin reading and mathematics compares with that of other children \nnationwide. Because families are relocating with increasing frequency \nthese days, children need to feel confident that they can perform at a \nconsistent level of achievement even though they may change school \ndistricts. These tests would empower parents by providing them with the \nsame information that Members of Congress receive from National \nAssessment of Educational Progress. Parents deserve to know this \ninformation so that they can make the best decisions regarding their \nchild's well-being. Also, there is considerable public support for \nnational testing. A recent Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll showed that 67 \npercent of Americans favored using standardized national tests to \nmeasure the academic achievement of students.\n  Furthermore, there is a demand for the tests among teachers, \nprincipals, State school officials, and school boards. States and \nschool districts with over 20 percent of fourth- and eighth-graders in \nthe Nation have committed to using the tests. Let me stress that \ncommitting to voluntary national testing does not mean committing to a \nnational curriculum. Local education authorities will determine how to \nuse the results. The tests simply give them the tools to do their jobs \nbetter.\n  Mr. President, we in Congress should be doing all that we possibly \ncan to ensure that America's children have the very best opportunity to \nexcel in a technologically advanced 21st century. But we have to know \nwhere our children stand so that we can move forward. Research has \nshown that high academic standards generate high academic performance. \nOur children deserve no less.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill, S. 1061, \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and related agencies \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1998.\n  The bill provides $236.4 billion in new budget authority and $188.6 \nbillion in new outlays for programs of the Departments of Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education and related agencies.\n  When adjustments are made for prior-year outlays and other completed \nactions, the bill as adjusted totals $286.3 billion in budget authority \nand $285.2 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998.\n\n[[Page S8794]]\n\n  The committee-reported bill is within the subcommittee's revised \n602(b) allocation just filed with the Congress' return.\n  There are several items for which the Senator from New Mexico would \nlike to express appreciation. One item is continued funding for \nHispanic Serving Institutions. With a slight increase over the 1997 \nlevel, the bill retains this program as separate from the Strengthening \nInstitutions program. In addition, I appreciate the committee's \nwillingness to continue funding PATH grants for the homeless.\n  I continue to be concerned about the practice of providing a $300 \nmillion contingency fund for LIHEAP that must be designated as \nemergency spending to be released. These expenses, in most cases, can \nbe anticipated and should be addressed through the regular \nappropriations process.\n  I am especially pleased, that within the funding for the Centers for \nDisease Control, the committee has provided an $18 million increase for \ndiabetes, including the establishment of a ``community-based \nintervention project in Gallup, New Mexico.''\n  As you know, this is an historic year in which we have set forth a \nplan to balance the budget in 7 years. The authorizing committees have \ncompleted a very difficult task in implementing this historic \nbipartisan budget agreement. I am pleased that the Appropriations \nCommittee is attempting to live within funding and priority proposed in \nthis agreement.\n  A concern I continually have, is the reduction of mandatory spending \nwithin appropriation bills. When mandatory savings are included in \nappropriations bills, it is generally to offset discretionary spending, \ninstead of deficit reduction. In particular, the subcommittee has \nreduced the cap on the Social Services block grant by $255 million for \nfiscal year 1998.\n  Overall, I am supportive of the work of the committee and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               S. 1061, LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS, 1998, SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL              \n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]                                   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Defense  Nondefense   Crime   Mandatory    Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:                                                                                           \n    Budget authority.........................................  .......     79,558       144    206,611   286,313\n    Outlays..................................................  .......     75,926        65    209,167   285,158\nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority.........................................  .......     79,558       144    206,611   286,313\n    Outlays..................................................  .......     76,009        65    209,167   285,241\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n    Budget authority.........................................  .......     73,025        60    206,611   279,696\n    Outlays..................................................  .......     74,571        48    209,167   283,786\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority.........................................  .......     79,869       144    206,611   286,624\n    Outlays..................................................  .......     75,935        64    209,167   285,166\n                                                                                                                \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:                                                                               \n                                                                                                                \nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority.........................................  .......  ..........  .......  .........  ........\n    Outlays..................................................  .......        -83   .......  .........       -83\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n    Budget authority.........................................  .......      6,533        84  .........     6,617\n    Outlays..................................................  .......      1.355        17  .........     1,372\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority.........................................  .......       -311   .......  .........      -311\n    Outlays..................................................  .......         -9         1  .........       -8 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Senator Kennedy has offered a \nsecond-degree amendment. We have talked about it. We negotiated about \nit. We tried to figure out what it would mean. We keep getting \ndifferent opinions.\n  So my guess is, I think we will have to at some point move to table \nSenator Kennedy's amendment, find out where the votes are, and dispose \nof my amendment. I would hate to have to wait longer and longer. So I \nwould just as soon move ahead with our amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had suggested setting aside the \namendment to move to Senator McCain on the theory a little more time \nmight find some resolution. But if the Senator from Oklahoma thinks \nnot, it is his prerogative to proceed with his amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How long would it take?\n  Mr. McCAIN. In response to the Senator from Oklahoma, I am not sure \nhow long it would take because I am not sure how strong the \ndisagreement would be with the amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1082\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I love my colleague from Arizona. And I \nthink my amendment is somewhat the same. I thought maybe we would be \nable to dispose of our amendment in a short period of time and have a \nclear vote on our amendment that would try to make sure that taxpayers \nwould not have to pay for the Teamsters' election twice.\n  Senator Kennedy came up with a very clever amendment, and I am still \ntrying to figure out what the net impact would be. I still do not know. \nI have the greatest respect for my colleague. That is one of the \nreasons I am not sure I want to agree to his amendment. I have a great \ndesire to work with my colleague from Massachusetts, but in the last \n2\\1/2\\ hours I still have not been able to determine, if we adopted his \nsecond-degree amendment, who would pay for the Teamsters' election.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I think, after consulting with others, that \nI will debate the Kennedy amendment. At some point I will move to table \nthe Kennedy amendment. Then we can dispose of our amendment and proceed \nto the amendment of the Senator from Arizona and dispose of the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Can we get a time limit on the debate before the tabling \nmotion?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am prepared to move to table the amendment. I would \nlike to speak for a few minutes, Senator Kennedy would probably like to \nspeak for a few minutes, and the Senator from Texas probably would like \nto speak for a few minutes. I will not move to table at this point, but \nit is my intent to move forward rather expeditiously to bring this to \nclosure.\n  Mr. President, let me make a couple comments.\n  Mr. President, is our amendment pending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are pending in the first and \nsecond degree.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, so \neveryone can understand what the Nickles amendment is and what the \nKennedy amendment is--and we will be voting on a motion to table the \nKennedy amendment and, hopefully, a motion on the underlying Nickles-\nJeffords amendment.\n  The Nickles-Jeffords amendment is this: Taxpayers should not have to \npay for the Teamsters' election twice.\n  Mr. President, in 1989, the consent decree said that there will be an \nelection in 1991 and said that the Teamsters would pay for it. They \ndid. They had a successful election. It had oversight and management by \nthe Government, but it was paid for by the Teamsters. It was deemed to \nbe a good election.\n  The 1996 election had oversight and management by the Federal \nGovernment, and it was also paid for by the Federal Government. The \noverseer of the election, though, said there was some fraud, said there \nwas some corruption, and said in her opinion we needed to have a new \nelection. She has\n\n[[Page S8795]]\n\nnow petitioned a judge, and the judge will be ordering a new election.\n  My point being, it is not the taxpayers' fault that there was fraud. \nThat came from the Teamsters. I do not have any qualm on who is elected \nor who is not elected. That is not my issue. Somebody, I think, said, \n``You're trying to influence an election.'' Far from it. That is not my \ndecision. My decision is to protect taxpayers. Taxpayers should not \nhave to pay for it again.\n  The estimates of the cost are $22 million. I heard subsequent to that \nthat it will be well over $22 million. I heard estimates up to $28 \nmillion, $30 million. My point is, we should not have to pay for it \nagain. We paid for it once. It was not U.S. taxpayers that had the \ncorruption. That happened to come from within the union. They hired \nsome consultants, and they funneled money to various campaigns. We \nshould not have to pay for that. That is not the taxpayers' fault.\n  So what would our amendment do? Our amendment basically says you can \nhave a rerun election and, if the Teamsters do not have the money, the \nFederal Government can pay for it; just that the Federal Government has \nto be paid back.\n  So to me it is eminently fair. It does not have any influence, \nsaying, ``This group is favored over another group.'' It does not say \nanything in the wording--my colleague from Massachusetts said this has \nsomething to do with the UPS strike. That is totally hogwash. There was \nan abuse in dealing with the UPS strike. That was the fact that the \noverseer knew there was corruption in the election, knew it during the \nstrike, but did not let the rest of the country know. This is one of \nthe most important strikes, but that does not have anything to do with \nit.\n  My point being, if there is another election, let the Teamsters pay \nfor it. These happen to be individuals who make good money. Almost all \nelections in the country are paid for, if you are talking about union \nelections, are paid for by the union. And they should be paid for by \nthe union. This is not that big a deal. There are 1.4 million members. \nI think a little less than 500,000 people voted in the last election. I \nthink they can pay for it. The average payroll of the Teamsters can \nwell afford this, so they should pay for it. If they do not have the \nmoney, the taxpayers can pay for it, and the taxpayers can be paid back \nwith interest. It is only fair.\n  Is it consistent with the consent decree of 1989? Yes, it is. The \nconsent decree of 1989 said that the Teamsters would pay for the 1991 \nelection and that the taxpayers would pay for the 1996 election. It did \nnot say taxpayers pay for a 1996 rerun if there is corruption in the \nelection.\n  Some people would like--and I believe Senator Kennedy's position \nwould be: Well, let's leave that up to a judge. We will let a judge \ndecide whether taxpayers have to pay for it or not. The consent decree \nwas silent. It didn't say who would have to pay for a rerun if there's \ncorruption in the election.\n  I want to eliminate the question mark. I want to make sure that \ntaxpayers do not pay for it. It is that simple. Why leave it to the \ndetermination of a judge? I do not think the judge has --frankly, if \nthe judge reads the consent decree, there is nothing in the consent \ndecree that would indicate taxpayers should pay for a 1996 rerun. But \nwhy leave it ambiguous? Let us just say, wait a minute, if we are going \nto have a rerun, fine, let the Teamsters pay for it, and, if necessary, \nif they do not have the money, the U.S. taxpayers pay for it, but they \nhave to be repaid.\n  I think our amendment is eminently fair. I wish my colleague from \nMassachusetts had not second-degreed it. It is confusing. His amendment \nlooks innocuous, but we do not want to turn it over to the courts. \nTherefore, at the appropriate time, after a couple of our colleagues \nhave spoken on the amendment, I will move to table the Kennedy \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are mindful now that we are only a few \nshort days from the time that the UPS strike was resolved and settled, \nand settled in a way which benefited many thousands of workers. There \nare 186,000 workers that were involved, and there was important \nprogress made in the areas of pensions and part-time work. There was \ngreat progress made in a number of different areas which we may or may \nnot have an opportunity to discuss here this evening.\n  But, quite frankly, Mr. President, I doubt whether this amendment \nwould be before us if we had not seen the success of the Teamsters as a \nresult of a collective-bargaining process. We saw 15 days where the \nNation was focused on the issue about whether the workers of UPS were \ngoing to participate in the extraordinary kinds of successes that UPS \nwas involved in. Americans around the country responded to the fact \nthat many of those that had been on part-time were not having part-time \nmortgages, part-time payments in terms of food bills, part-time \npayments in terms of children's clothing bills. Finally, the UPS and \nthe Teamsters worked out an agreement. It was important for those \nworking men and women.\n  There are some here, some here in the Senate who just cannot stand \nthe fact that workers were able to have their rights considered and to \nhave their rights resolved in a positive and constructive way. And \nthere are those who just want to somehow get back at these workers, \nsomehow get back at them. I believe here we are seeing some attempt to \ntry to do so by the mischievousness of this particular amendment.\n  The amendment which I have proposed is an amendment to the Nickles \namendment that does not require the American taxpayers to pay. The \nSenator from Oklahoma believes that the judge does not have the \nauthority to require the payment for the election by the taxpayers. All \nthe amendment that I have offered is saying is that if the consent \nagreement does not require it, it does not have to be expended; if it \ndoes require it, we are not going to take any action that is going to \ninterfere with a judicial process and a consent agreement that was \nsigned under the Bush administration, was initiated by a Republican, \nMr. Giuliani, in New York, was ratified by the Attorney General, Mr. \nThornburgh, who is on record in strong support of this agreement.\n  This agreement is still applicable. As a matter of fact, the \nrespondents are required, under the Southern District Court, to file \ntheir briefs on September 19--on September 19. This is a court order \nthat is in effect at the present time. All we are saying in support of \nthe amendment that I have offered is, let us not interfere with the \ncourt order that was established in 1989 that was agreed to by the \nparticipants. It is part of a judicial process and procedure.\n  What we are basically asking, under the Nickles amendment, is that we \nare going to interfere with a legitimate judicial procedure. All my \namendment says is, let the judicial procedure flow as it was designed \nand agreed to at an earlier period of time. That is the extent of my \namendment. We are not requiring, in my amendment, that taxpayer money \nbe used. We are not saying that it will not be used. We are saying, \nwhatever the judge, under that consent agreement in 1989, understood \nthat agreement to be, that we will not interfere with it.\n  But that is not satisfactory to Senator Nickles. He wants to rig, \nevidently, or change the consent agreement. We believe that the consent \nagreement ought to be maintained for the reason that consent agreements \nare put into place and agreed to by the different parties. When the \nconsent agreement goes in and the different parties agree, we do not \nsee that they agree on one day and the next day we are going to have \ninterference with that particular agreement. That is really what is at \nissue.\n  Here is Rudolph Giuliani, in 1988, saying, ``Today the U.S. \nGovernment is bringing a lawsuit to attack and reverse, once and for \nall, a major American scandal.'' This is not an issue that is just \nbrought up today. This has been the result and consent agreement from a \nlong, long history which I reviewed earlier in the debate.\n  Richard Thornburgh said, ``This settlement, which union leaders agree \nto today, culminates 30 years of efforts''--30 years of efforts--``by \nthe Department of Justice to remove the influence of organized crime \nwithin the\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\nTeamsters Union,'' and then indicates support for it. Thirty years of \neffort and the consent agreement in 1989.\n  We have seen a continued consent agreement, as these cases are going \non to the Southern District Court today. The briefs are required by \nSeptember 19. So this issue is very much alive, Mr. President.\n  All we are saying in support of our amendment, which is basically an \nadd-on to the Nickles amendment, all our amendment says is nothing in \nthis section under the Nickles amendment shall be construed to apply to \nthe expenditures required by the consent decree in the U.S. v. \nInternational Brotherhood. We do not say you are going to have to pay \nfor them. We don't say you will have to pay part of them. We don't say \nthat they are not going to or we are going to restrict the judge. That \nis effectively what we are basically attempting to do with this \nparticular amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think there are strong reasons for accepting this \namendment. I will speak just for a few more moments on this particular \nissue. Mr. President, as I mentioned, in 1988, the Justice Department \nunder President Bush sued the Teamsters Union under the racketeering \nlaws, and the U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case was Rudolph \nGiuliani, another Republican, who now, of course, is the mayor of New \nYork City. In 1989, Mayor Giuliani negotiated a resolution to the suit \nwith the Teamsters that imposed sweeping reforms on the union.\n  A critical part of the election reform was the supervision of all \naspects of the union elections by a court-appointed election official. \nThus, the consent decree establishes the position of election officer \nand gave the officer substantial authority to regulate the entirety of \nthe electoral process. Under the consent order the expenses of the 1991 \nTeamster election were borne by the union itself, including the \nexpenses of the election officer.\n  But the 1996 election was different as to that election. The consent \norder stated the union defendants consent to the election officer at \nGovernment expense to supervise the 1996 election. The election officer \nand all parties to the suit complied with this provision of the consent \ndecree. The Republican refusal to appropriate funds for fiscal year \n1996 for the Labor and Justice Department forced the election officer \nto seek a court order requiring the Justice Department to fund the \ncritical preelection activities. The Justice Department and union \njoined in the election officer's request for that order which \nultimately was granted in October of 1995. Ultimately, however, the \nfunding was obtained and the election was conducted. Protests were \nfiled with the election officer to resolve them and an opinion issued \nlate last month. In that opinion, the election officer found that \nmisconduct by consultants to one candidate required that the election \nbe rerun. The officer specifically declined to find wrongdoing by any \nofficer or member of the union and noted that President Carey had \nconducted himself throughout the investigation in a manner inconsistent \nwith guilt.\n  So, there is a judicial finding and conclusion that there has been no \nconclusion to this current election and has not been certified and \ntherefore the election officer maintains the jurisdiction.\n  In accordance with this decision, the election officer did not \ncertify the 1996 election. She did, however, apply to the Federal court \nfor an order requiring that the election be rerun. That application is \npending. The parties' briefs will not be filed until September 19 and \nthe court will not rule until after that time. The court may order that \nthe election be rerun or it may not. It may require the Government to \nfund the election officer's supervision of the election or it may \nrequire the union to do so or it may require each party to bear some \npart of the cost. Let me repeat that: The court may order the election \nbe rerun or it may not. It may require the Government to fund the \nelection officer's supervision of that election or it may require the \nunion to do so. Or it may require each party to bear some part of the \ncost. We do not know that. We do not know that. That still has to be \nresolved.\n  Under the Nickles amendment it would prejudge that. All we are trying \nto do is say we had the agreement in 1989. It is under active \nconsideration before the Southern District Court of New York and we \nshould do nothing that is going to affect that agreement which has been \nagreed to by all the principle parties and negotiated under the \nprevious administration.\n  The point is we do not know how the court will rule. But this \namendment would tell the court that regardless of its ruling the \nGovernment will not be permitted to fund the election, even if the \nconsent order requires the Government to pay, this amendment will \nrefuse to permit that. Thus the amendment would interfere with an \nongoing judicial process.\n  That is, basically, the issue. Are we going to permit legislative \ninterference in an ongoing judicial process? It is as simple as that. \nMoreover, the amendment would renege on an agreement that a Republican-\ncontrolled Justice Department entered into 8 years ago by repudiating \npart of that agreement. The amendment would order the Government to \nsubject itself to a contempt proceeding, and that is an outrage and an \nuntenable result.\n  Why do those on the other side of the aisle seek to achieve this \nresult? It can only be because they want to punish the Teamsters Union \nfor their tremendous success in the recent UPS strike. That is what is \nat the bottom of this, make no mistake about it. Does anybody think if \nthey had not been successful in that strike we would be considering \nthis here? It is a basic, fundamental assault on the fact that they \nwere able to negotiate some protections for part-time workers and for \npension rights for workers. There are those in this body and in this \ncountry that cannot stand that. They want to give those workers a \ncomeuppance. That is really what is at issue here. That is what is \nbeing attempted, to try to interfere with this judicial process.\n  That strike resulted in significant improvements for 185,000 workers \nat UPS. It sensitized the entire Nation to the gross abuses in many \nwork forces that forced hard-working men and women into part-time jobs \nwith lower wages and lower benefits than they deserve.\n  Let me highlight a few of the achievements of the Teamsters in the \nUPS strike: 10,000 new full-time jobs by combining existing low-wage \npart-time positions. That is in addition to the full-time opportunities \nthat are normally created through growth in the company, retirements or \npeople leaving for other reasons. Pension increases that are the same \nor better as the increases the company had already said it would make, \nbut under the Teamster pension plan, not a company-controlled pension \nplan. Under the Teamster's central pension fund, a UPS worker could \nretire at 30 years with a pension of $3,000 per month, 50 percent more \nthan the current amount. Limits on subcontracting--to replace some \ncontractors with UPS workers, so that as UPS grows, full-time UPS jobs \ngrow as well. Wage increases of $3.10 an hour for full-time plus an \nextra dollar an hour for part-time workers. That may not sound like a \nlot to the Members of this body but that is important for working \nfamilies. Safety protections for workers who handle heavy packages may \nnot sound important to a lot of people around this body but that is \nimportant for a lot of workers who are handling those heavy packages. \nThe list goes on, and the list goes on.\n  Our Republican colleagues seem to think that the Teamsters deserve to \nbe punished for these gains and I think the union deserves praise.\n  Mr. President, I believe, for the reasons I have outlined here, this \nis a consent decree, that the consent decree is still active, that \nthere is pending action that is before the Southern District Court, and \nthe amendment which I introduced would effectively accept the Nickles \namendment but it would indicate there would be no interference with any \ndecision that is going to be made by the judge in that decree that will \nbe forthcoming, and the outcome of which we do not know.\n  Let me mention, Mr. President, some of the observations of the Judge, \nDavid Edelstein, approving the consent decree.\n\n       Just over two months ago I signed a consent decree between \n     * * * Teamsters and the government. The decree contains an \n     acknowledgment by the Teamsters leadership that there are \n     severe shortcomings in the way it has conducted its affairs \n     in the past, and it embodies the standards by which the \n     leadership of the * * * Union should conduct its affairs in \n     the future.* * *\n\n[[Page S8797]]\n\n       These goals alone, however, are merely statements of good \n     intentions--and we all know where those can lead. Without a \n     dedicated effort to put these ideals into practice, the good \n     intentions will become empty promises and unfulfilled hopes. \n     * * * The public has a significant stake in the outcome of \n     the decree. The IBT exercises vast power and cuts across \n     every segment of society--political, social, and economic. It \n     affects every aspect of our lives. Such power must be \n     insulated against corruption and criminal elements and must \n     be reserved for legitimate use to achieve legitimate ends.\n       * * * The conditions that have necessitated and justified \n     such unprecedented measures are extreme. The remedy therefore \n     is necessarily extreme. The court expects that all parties \n     involved--the union, the government, and the three \n     individuals I am about to appoint--live up to the spirit and \n     letter of the laws and Constitution of the United States as \n     well as the consent decree.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Could we enter into a time agreement, say, with the vote \nat 6 o'clock?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do not expect we would go beyond 6 o'clock but I am \nreluctant just to enter into it at this time since there are Members \nthat indicated to me they wanted to speak and indicated they would like \nto speak, but I don't anticipate we would go beyond 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. A point of inquiry.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. As I understand what the Senator from Massachusetts is \nsaying in reply or in response to the Senator from Pennsylvania is that \nwe want to try and finish but there are some other Senators that want \nto speak and the Senator is right, I would like to speak.\n  I think it is a shame we did not have an agreement. We should have. \nThis is a very reasonable second degree, I think, but I want to make it \nclear to my colleague from Pennsylvania I would like to speak, and I \ncan be relatively brief.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I make an inquiry as manager of the bill to see if we \ncan move it along.\n  We have quite a number of amendments. I would like to speak for 5 \nminutes. If the Senator from Minnesota wishes to speak for 5 minutes, \nhe can get a sequencing. It would be helpful.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I assume we will go back and forth?\n  Mr. SPECTER. And perhaps agree to limit speeches to 5 minutes, if \nthat is acceptable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I indicated, I have talked to some \nSenators who wanted to speak. I do not anticipate going beyond 6 \no'clock. I cannot speak for them at the present time.\n  After Senator Wellstone speaks, I can make inquiries of the Senators \nand inform the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So, here we have the Republican administration that is \ncommitted to this consent decree. We have the consent decree still \nactive in the southern district court requiring the submission of \nvarious briefs, a judge that is going to make a judgment based upon \nthose briefs, and the facts as have been found on the recent election. \nWe do not know what the terms of the pronouncement is going to be in \nterms of the judge, and all we are saying in the Kennedy amendment is \nthat we are not going to interfere with the judgments of that judge in \nfulfilling the consent decree requirements that were agreed to by all \nparties, that go back over a long period of time, some 30 years of \ninvolvement, and we are not going to prejudge that, tonight, to \ninterfere with a judicial proceeding.\n  That is, basically, what the effect of the Kennedy amendment would be \nas a perfecting amendment to the Nickles proposal.\n  Mr. President, I find it difficult to see how a President of the \nUnited States, if this were to go through and to pass and to be \nactually accepted in the committee in the conference report, how a \nPresident of the United States could sign this appropriation that would \nhave a legislative intrusion in terms of a consent decree that had been \nagreed to and honored by all of the parties.\n  It seems to me that this would be a clear interference by the \nlegislative body into the judicial consent decree and would certainly \nbe subject to a Presidential veto. It is of that importance and of that \nconsequence. I hope my amendment will be agreed to. Just to repeat it, \nall we want to say is that nothing in this section--which would be the \nNickles amendment--should be construed to apply to expenditures \nrequired by the consent decree. We are not saying what they may be, \nwhat they might not be, whether they would be or would not be. But all \nwe are saying is that we would not interfere with the consent decree. \nIt is as plain and as clear as can be, Mr. President. I hope the \namendment will be accepted.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me review what the issue is before the \nSenate and make it clear that there is nothing confusing about the \nKennedy amendment. The objective of the Kennedy amendment is to require \nthe taxpayer to pay for yet another union election.\n  Now, let me go back to the facts and then delineate where I believe \nSenator Kennedy drifts far afield from the facts. I also want to \nrespond to this assertion about UPS, which borders on violating rule \nXIX of the U.S. Senate.\n  Now, first, let me begin with the consent decree. Because of \ncorruption in the Teamsters, we entered into a consent decree which \nresulted in the taxpayers paying for the 1996 Teamsters election. The \ntaxpayers spent $22 million. The person appointed to oversee the \nelection, having been paid $300,000 to $400,000, a couple of weeks \nafter it was known that we clearly had violations in the election, now, \nbelatedly, has raised questions.\n  Now, my point and the point of the Nickles amendment is that we \nagreed to pay for the election, and we paid for the election. The point \nis that we did not get the election that we paid for. Perhaps the \namendment of Senator Nickles should demand that we get our $22 million \nback because the same corruption we were trying to stop apparently \noccurred again.\n  Now, nothing in the Nickles amendment interferes with the consent \nagreement, except that the Nickles amendment makes it clear that the \nConstitution of the United States does not give a judge the power of \nthe Federal purse. The Nickles amendment says we paid for an election \nwe didn't get, and we are not paying for another election. The judge \ncan require another election, which I assume he will do. But under the \nNickles amendment, he will have to require the Teamsters to pay for the \nelection. We have already paid for one election and we didn't get it. I \nhope while he is at it, he will fire everybody who drew these salaries \nto oversee an election through which they slept.\n  Now, as for the UPS strike having anything to do with this amendment, \nthat assertion violates rule XIX of the U.S. Senate. We are impugning \nthe motives of people offering this amendment. If I stood up on the \nfloor of the Senate and said that this amendment was offered by a \nDemocratic Senator because the Democratic Party colluded with the \nTeamsters Union, I would be subject to rule XIX, and rightly so. I \nwould never do that. And to come to the floor of the Senate and suggest \nthat Senator Nickles' amendment has anything to do with anything other \nthan stopping the purchase of another election when we didn't get the \nfirst one we paid for is outrageous. I was on the verge of raising rule \nXIX on that assertion. I think it assaults the dignity of the Senate to \ntry to impugn the motives of people who are offering serious \namendments.\n  Now, with regard to the judge, the Nickles amendment doesn't restrict \nthe judge. The judge can order a new election; he can fire the people \nwho didn't do their jobs the first time; and the judge can set out the \nparameters of the new election. But under the Nickles amendment, the \njudge cannot say to the taxpayer: You already paid for an election you \ndidn't get and we are going to make you pay for another election.\n  All the Nickles amendment does is assert the power of Congress to \nexpend money. It says to the judge and the courts that we are passing a \nlaw that says we already paid for our election and any future election \nwill have to be reimbursed. The cost that the Federal taxpayer should \nincur in overseeing that election will have to be reimbursed by the \nbeneficiaries, the members of the union, who, hopefully, will get an \nhonest election in the future.\n  We had a consent decree; the Federal Government has lived up to the \nconsent decree. We spent $22 million for an\n\n[[Page S8798]]\n\nelection that we did not get. We were supposed to have gotten an honest \nelection, but apparently did not. The question is: Are we going to do \nit again? I think it is a very clear vote.\n  We attempted to have an honest election once, which we did not get, \neven after the taxpayer paid $22 million. Now the person who was given \nthe responsibility of overseeing that election says that a fair \nelection did not occur. Should we be forced to pay again? The Nickles \namendment says no. I think the American people would say no.\n  So the Kennedy amendment puts this back in the hands of the court. \nAnd, basically, his argument is, let a Federal judge appropriate and \nexpend another $22 million if he chooses. The Constitution is very \nclear about who has the power of the purse. The Nickles amendment, \ntotally within the consent decree, simply says that we paid to have an \nhonest election, but we didn't get what we paid for. Quite frankly, I \nwould vote for an amendment that demanded our $22 million back. But the \npoint is that the Nickles amendment simply says that if another \nelection is ordered, which it almost certainly will be, the \nbeneficiaries of the election pay for it. So it does not interrupt the \nconsent decree.\n  We have lived up to our end of the bargain, but the participants in \nthe election and the overseers did not live up to their end of the \nbargain. This is a question of whether you want the taxpayers to fund a \nsecond election when the first election was apparently fraudulent. The \nNickles amendment says no; the Kennedy amendment says yes, but does it \nindirectly by saying let's let the judge take the rap for requiring us \nto pay for the election the second time.\n  I say this is an issue the Congress should decide. We have the \nconstitutional responsibility to spend or not spend money. I say buying \none election you didn't get is one too many. I support the Nickles \namendment, and I hope people will vote to defeat--by voting to table--\nthe Kennedy amendment so that we can vote on the Nickles amendment, \nwhich simply says that we paid for an honest election, we didn't get \nit, and we are not paying for a second one. That is the issue. It is as \nclear-cut as it can be, and hiding behind some black-robed official who \ndoes not have the inconvenience of having to run for reelection and \nhaving to answer to voters for spending their money, I don't think is a \nway the U.S. Senate, as the greatest deliberative body in the world, \nshould be acting.\n  This is a clear-cut choice, and the choice is: No more money to pay \nfor elections that don't seem to be held fairly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Texas wants to focus \non the black-robed judges, but I think his analysis is a bit \nahistorical. Rudolph Giuliani, former U.S. attorney, 1988: ``To date, \nthe United States Government is bringing the lawsuit to attack and \nreverse once and for all the major American scandal.'' Richard \nThornburgh, Attorney General, March 14, 1989--not a black-robed judge: \n``This settlement, which union leaders agreed to earlier today, \nculminates 30 years of efforts by the Department of Justice to remove \nthe influence of organized crime within the Teamsters Union.''\n  This was an agreement with a Republican administration. The second-\ndegree amendment here, the Kennedy amendment, simply says, nothing in \nthis section shall be construed to apply to expenditures required by \nthe consent decree in United States versus The International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters. My colleague from Oklahoma wants to say there \nisn't anything in his amendment that goes against this consent \nagreement. If so, this second-degree amendment should be acceptable. We \nshould not even be having this debate.\n  Now, I heard what my colleague from Texas said about the need to not \nbe personal. I won't be. Let me make a different kind of argument. \nWhen, all of a sudden and unrelated to the bill on the floor, there is \nan amendment that goes after a consent agreement that goes back to the \nactions of a Republican administration, and when that all-of-a-sudden \nmove on the Senate floor follows only a few short weeks from a very \ninspiring and successful effort on the part of the Teamsters to \ncollectively bargain, and when this effort, unrelated to the bill on \nthe floor all of a sudden comes up just a few short weeks after many \npeople in the country are saying, thank goodness there is a focus on \ntrying to have full-time jobs as opposed to part-time jobs, thank \ngoodness there is a focus on living-wage jobs, thank goodness those of \nus who are hard-pressed and struggling to earn a decent living and \nraise our children well are going to have a chance, I think this is the \nwrong time for such an extraordinary move.\n  I don't think we can decontextualize what we do on the floor of the \nSenate. It would be a little foolish to believe that, whatever the \nintentions are of colleagues, people in the country, many working \nfamilies, union or nonunion, won't look upon this effort as just \npayback. That will be the perception. That is the way it looks in terms \nof the chronology of this. That is the way it looks in terms of the \ntimeliness of this. That is the way it looks in terms of this action by \nthe Senate, following up on the successful effort on the part of a \nunion to bargain collectively.\n  Finally, once again, it is such an extraordinary move to go against \nan agreement that a Republican administration was a part of and to take \nthis extraordinary, and I think really very imprudent, action. Senator \nKennedy's second-degree amendment is reasonable. It just says--and I \nwill finish--nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to \nexpenditures required by the consent decree. Whatever those \nexpenditures are or are not, this amendment just says, look, we don't \ncome out here on the floor--it is not in the dark of night, but all of \na sudden--with this kind of major move, and I think this is an \nextremely reasonable second-degree amendment. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have taken the time to go through the various aspects \nin the consent decree that was agreed to, the agreement, in terms of \nthe allocation of resources, some of which was spelled out in the \nconsent decree. Let me mention, reading specifically, and I will--I ask \nunanimous consent that the full consent decree be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, Order 88 CIV. 4486 \n                                 (DNE)]\n\n United States of America, plaintiff, v. International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters, Chauffers, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, AFL-CIO, et \n                            al., defendants.\n\n       Whereas, plaintiff United States of America commenced this \n     action on June 28, 1988, by filing a Complaint seeking \n     equitable relief involving the International Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters, AFL-CIO (hereinafter, ``the IBT''), pursuant to \n     the civil remedies provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and \n     Corrupt Organizations (``RICO'') Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1964; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Summons and Complaint have been served, \n     answers filed, and pretrial discovery commenced by and \n     between the parties; and\n       Whereas, plaintiff United States of America and defendants \n     IBT and its General Executive Board, William J. McCarthy, \n     Weldon Mathis, Joseph Trerotola, Joseph W. Morgan, Edward M. \n     Lawson, Arnold Weinmeister, Donald Peters, Walter J. Shea, \n     Harold Friedman, Jack D. Cox, Don L. West, Michael J. Riley, \n     Theodore Cozza and Daniel Ligurotis (hereinafter, the ``union \n     defendants'') have consented to entry of this order; and\n       Whereas, the union defendants acknowledge that there have \n     been allegations, sworn testimony and judicial findings of \n     past problems with La Cosa Nostra corruption of various \n     elements of the IBT; and\n       Whereas, the union defendants agree that there should be no \n     criminal element or La Cosa Nostra corruption of any part of \n     the IBT; and\n       Whereas, the union defendants agree that it is imperative \n     that the IBT, as the largest trade union in the free world, \n     be maintained democratically, with integrity and for the sole \n     benefit of its members and without unlawful outside \n     influence;\n       It is hereby ordered and decreed that:\n\n                         A. Court Jurisdiction\n\n       1. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of \n     the action, has personal jurisdiction over the parties, and \n     shall retain jurisdiction over this case until further order \n     of the Court.\n\n[[Page S8799]]\n\n       2. Upon satisfactory completion and implementation of the \n     terms and conditions of this order, this Court shall \n     entertain a joint motion of the parties hereto for entry of \n     judgment dismissing this action with prejudice and without \n     costs to either party.\n\n                              B. Duration\n\n       3. The authority of the court officers established in \n     paragraph no. 12 herein shall terminate after the \n     certification of the 1991 election results by the Election \n     Officer for all IBT International Officers as provided in \n     this Order, except as follows:\n       (1) The Election Officer and the Administrator shall have \n     the authority to resolve all disputes concerning the conduct \n     and/or results of the elections conducted in 1991 under the \n     authority granted to them under paragraph 12(D) herein, and \n     the Investigations Officer and the Administrator shall have \n     the authority to investigate and discipline any corruption \n     associated with the conduct and/or results of the elections \n     to be conducted in 1991 under the authority granted them \n     under paragraph 12 (A) and (C) herein, so long as said \n     investigation is begun within six months of the final \n     balloting.\n       (2) The Investigations Officer and the Administrator shall \n     have the authority to resolve to completion and decide all \n     charges filed by the Investigations Officer on or before the \n     date on which the authority granted to them under paragraphs \n     12 (A) and (C) herein terminates the authority pursuant to \n     subparagraph (3) below.\n       (3) The role and authority provided for in paragraphs 12 \n     and 13 of this Order regarding the Investigations Officer and \n     the Administrator and their relationship with the Independent \n     Review Board shall terminate not later than nine (9) months \n     after the certification of the 1991 election results.\n       (4) As used herein, the date referred to as ``the \n     certification of the 1991 election results'' shall be \n     construed to mean either the date upon which the Election \n     Officer certifies the 1991 election results for all IBT \n     International Officers or one month after the final \n     balloting, whichever is shorter.\n\n              C. Status of the Individual Union Defendants\n\n       4. The union defendants herein remain as officers of the \n     IBT, subject to all of the terms herein, including the \n     disciplinary authority of the Court-appointed officers, \n     described in paragraph 12(A) herein.\n\n                   D. Changes in the IBT Constitution\n\n       5. The portion of Section 6(a) of Article XIX of the IBT \n     Constitution that provides, ``Any charge based upon alleged \n     conduct which occurred more than one (1) year prior to the \n     filing of such charge is barred and shall be rejected by the \n     Secretary-Treasurer, except charges based upon the non-\n     payment of dues, assessment and other financial \n     obligations,'' shall be and hereby is amended to provide for \n     a five (5) year period, running from the discovery of the \n     conduct giving rise to the charge. This limitation period \n     shall not apply to any actions taken by the Investigations \n     Officer or the Administrator.\n       6. Section 6(a) of Article XIX of the IBT Constitution \n     shall be deemed and is hereby amended to include the \n     following: ``Nothing herein shall preclude the General \n     President and/or General Executive Board from suspending a \n     member or officer facing criminal or civil trial while the \n     charges are pending.''\n       7. Immediately after the conclusion of the IBT elections to \n     be conducted in 1991, Section 8 of Article VI of the IBT \n     Constitution shall be deemed and hereby is amended to provide \n     that a special election be held whenever a vacancy occurs in \n     the office of IBT General President, pursuant to the \n     procedures described later herein for election of IBT General \n     President.\n       8. Article IV, Section 2 of the IBT Constitution shall be \n     deemed and is hereby amended to include a new paragraph as \n     follows:\n       ``No candidate for election shall accept or use any \n     contributions or other things of value received from any \n     employers, representative of an employer, foundation, trust \n     or any similar entity. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to \n     prohibit receipt of contributions from fellow employees and \n     members of this International Union. Violation of this \n     provision shall be grounds for removal from office.''\n       9. (a) The IBT Constitution shall be deemed and hereby is \n     amended to incorporate and conform with all of the terms set \n     forth in this order.\n       (b) By no later than the conclusion of the IBT convention \n     to be held in 1991, the IBT shall have formally amended the \n     IBT Constitution to incorporate and conform with all of the \n     terms set forth in this order by presenting said terms to the \n     delegates for a vote. If the IBT has not formally so amended \n     the IBT Constitution by that date, the Government retains the \n     right to seek any appropriate action, including enforcement \n     of this order, contempt or reopening this litigation.\n\n                        E. Permanent Injunction\n\n       10. Defendants William J. McCarthy, Weldon Mathis, Joseph \n     Trerotola, Joseph W. Morgan, Edward M. Lawson, Arnold \n     Weinmeister, Donald Peters, Walter J. Shea, Harold Friedman, \n     Jack D. Cox, Don L. West, Michael J. Riley, Theodore Cozza \n     and Daniel Ligurotis, as well as any other or future IBT \n     General Executive Board members, officers, representatives, \n     members and employees of the IBT, are hereby permanently \n     enjoined from committing any acts of racketeering activity, \n     as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961 et seq., and from knowingly \n     associating with any member or associate of the Colombo \n     Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, the Genovese \n     Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, the Gambino \n     Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, the Lucchese \n     Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, the Bonnano \n     Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, any other Organized \n     Crime Families of La Cosa Nostra or any other criminal group, \n     or any person otherwise enjoined from participating in union \n     affairs, and from obstructing or otherwise interfering with \n     the work of the court-appointed officers or the Independent \n     Review Board described herein.\n       11. As used herein, the term, ``knowingly associating,'' \n     shall have the same meaning as that ascribed to that term in \n     the context of comparable federal proceedings or federal \n     rules and regulations.\n\n                      F. Court-Appointed Officers\n\n       12. The Court shall appoint three (3) officers--an \n     Independent Administrator, an Investigations Officer and an \n     Election Officer--to be identified and proposed by the \n     Government and the union defendants, to oversee certain \n     operations of the IBT as described herein. The parties shall \n     jointly propose to the Court at least two persons for each of \n     these three positions. Such proposal shall be presented to \n     the Court within four weeks of the date of the entry of this \n     Order, except that for good cause shown such period may be \n     extended by the Court. Except as otherwise provided herein, \n     the duties of those three officers shall be the following:\n       (A) Disciplinary Authority.--From the date of the \n     Administrator's appointment until the termination of the \n     Administrator's authority as set forth in paragraph 3(3) \n     herein, the Administrator shall have the same rights and \n     powers as the IBT's General President and/or General \n     Executive Board under the IBT's Constitution (including \n     Articles VI and XIX thereof) and Title 29 of the United \n     States Code to discharge those duties which relate to: \n     disciplining corrupt or dishonest officers, agents, employees \n     or members of the IBT or any of its affiliated entities (such \n     as IBT Locals, Joint Councils and Area Conferences), and \n     appointing temporary trustees to run the affairs of any such \n     affiliated entities. The Investigations Officer shall have \n     the authority to investigate the operation of the IBT or any \n     of its affiliates and, with cause,\n       (i) To initiate disciplinary charges against any officer, \n     member or employee of the IBT or any of its affiliates in the \n     manner specified for members under the IBT Constitution and,\n       (ii) To institute trusteeship proceedings for the purpose \n     and in the manner specified in the IBT Constitution.\n       Prior to instituting any trusteeship proceeding the \n     Investigations Officer shall notify the General President of \n     the Investigations Officer's plan to institute said \n     trusteeship proceeding and the basis therefor and give the \n     General President ten (10) days to exercise his authority \n     pursuant to the IBT Constitution to institute such \n     trusteeship proceedings. If the General President timely \n     institutes such proceedings and/or a trusteeship is imposed, \n     the Investigations Officer and the Administrator shall have \n     authority to review any action thus taken by the General \n     President and/or any trusteeship imposed thereafter and to \n     modify any aspect of either of the above at any time and in \n     any manner consistent with applicable federal law. If the \n     General President fails to institute trusteeship proceedings \n     within the ten-day period prescribed herein, the \n     Investigations Officer may immediately proceed in accordance \n     with the authority specified above.\n       When the Investigations Officer files charges, the \n     following procedures shall be observed:\n       (a) the Investigations Officer shall serve written specific \n     charges upon the person charged;\n       (b) the person charged shall have at least thirty (30) days \n     prior to hearing to prepare his or her defense;\n       (c) a fair and impartial hearing shall be conducted before \n     the Administrator;\n       (d) the person charged may be represented by an IBT member \n     at the hearing; and\n       (e) the hearing shall be conducted under the rules and \n     procedures generally applicable to labor arbitration \n     hearings.\n       The Administrator shall preside at hearings in such cases \n     and decide such cases using a ``just cause'' standard. The \n     Investigations Officer shall present evidence at such \n     hearings. As to decisions of the IBT General Executive Board \n     on disciplinary charges and trusteeship proceedings during \n     the Administrator's tenure, the Administrator shall review \n     all such decisions, with the right to affirm, modify or \n     reverse such decisions and, with respect to trusteeship \n     proceedings, to exercise the authority granted above in this \n     paragraph. Any decision of the Administrator shall be \n     final and binding, subject to the Court's review as \n     provided herein. For a period of up to fourteen (14) days \n     after the Administrator's decision, any person charged or \n     entity placed in trusteeship adversely affected by the \n     decision shall have the right to seek review by this Court \n     of the Administrator's decision. The Administrator shall \n     also have the right to establish and disseminate new \n     guidelines for investigation and discipline of corruption \n     within the IBT. All of the above actions of the \n     Administrator and Investigations Officer shall be in \n     compliance with applicable Federal laws and regulations.\n       (B) Review Authority.--From the date of the Administrator's \n     appointment until the certification of the IBT elections to \n     be conducted in 1991, the Administrator shall have\n\n[[Page S8800]]\n\n     the authority to veto whenever the Administrator reasonably \n     believes that any of the actions or proposed actions listed \n     below constitutes or furthers an act of racketeering activity \n     within the definition of Title 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961, or \n     furthers or contributes to the association directly, or \n     indirectly, of the IBT or any of its members with the LCN or \n     elements thereof:\n       (i) any expenditures or proposed expenditure of \n     International Union funds or transfer of International Union \n     property approved by any officers, agents, representatives or \n     employees of the IBT,\n       (ii) any contract or proposed contract on behalf of the \n     International Union, other than collective bargaining \n     agreements, and\n       (iii) any appointment or proposed appointments to \n     International Union office of any officer, agent, \n     representative or employee of the IBT.\n       In any case where the Administrator exercises veto \n     authority, the action or proposed action shall not go \n     forward. The Administrator, upon request of the IBT's General \n     President or General Executive Board, shall, within three (3) \n     days, advise the IBT's General President and/or General \n     Executive Board whichever is applicable, of the reasons for \n     any such veto. For a period of up to fourteen (14) days after \n     the Administrator's decision, the IBT's President and/or \n     General Executive Board shall have the right to seek review \n     by this Court of the Administrator's decision. The \n     Administrator may prescribe any reasonable mechanism or \n     procedure to provide for the Administrator's review of \n     actions or proposed actions by the IBT, and every officer, \n     agent, representative or employee of the IBT shall comply \n     with such mechanism or procedure.\n       (C) Access to Information.--(i) The Investigations Officer \n     shall have the authority to take such reasonable steps that \n     are lawful and necessary in order to be fully informed about \n     the activities of the IBT in accordance with the procedures \n     as herein established. The Investigations Officer shall have \n     the right:\n       (a) To examine books and records of the IBT and its \n     affiliates, provided the entity to be examined receives three \n     (3) business days advance notice in writing, and said entity \n     has the right to have its representatives present during said \n     examination.\n       (b) To attend meetings or portions of meetings of the \n     General Executive Board relating in any way to any of the \n     officer's rights or duties as set forth in this Order, \n     provided that prior to any such meeting, the officer shall \n     receive an agenda for the meeting and then give notice to the \n     General President of the officer's anticipated attendance.\n       (c) To take and require sworn statements or sworn in-person \n     examinations of any officer, member, or employee of the IBT \n     provided the Investigations Officer has reasonable cause to \n     take such a statement and provided further that the person to \n     be examined receives at least ten (10) days advance notice in \n     writing and also has the right to be represented by an IBT \n     member or legal counsel of his or her own choosing, during \n     the course of said examination.\n       (d) To take, upon notice and application for cause made to \n     this Court, which shall include affidavits in support \n     thereto, and the opportunity for rebuttal affidavits, the \n     sworn statements or sworn in person examination of persons \n     who are agents of the IBT (and not covered in subparagraph \n     (c) above).\n       (e) To retain an independent auditor to perform audits upon \n     the books and records of the IBT or any of its \n     affiliated entities (not including benefit funds subject \n     to ERISA), provided said entity receives three (3) \n     business days advance notice in writing and said entity \n     has the right to have its representatives present during \n     the conduct of said audit.\n       (ii) The Independent Administrator and the Election Officer \n     shall have the same rights as the Investigations Officer as \n     provided in sections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of A, herein.\n       (iii) The Independent Administrator, Investigations Officer \n     and Election Officer shall each be provided with suitable \n     office space at the IBT headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n       D. IBT Election.--The IBT Constitution shall be deemed \n     amended, and is hereby amended, to provide for the following \n     new election procedures:\n       (i) The procedures described herein shall apply to \n     elections of the IBT's General President, General Secretary-\n     Treasurer, International Union Vice Presidents, and \n     international Union Trustees;\n       (ii) Delegates to the IBT International convention at which \n     any International Union officers are nominated or elected \n     shall be chosen by direct rank-and-file secret balloting \n     shortly before the convention (but not more than six months \n     before the convention, except for those delegates elected at \n     local union elections scheduled to be held in the fall of \n     1990), and with all convention Candidate election voting by \n     secret ballot of each delegate individually;\n       (iii) Delegates shall nominate candidates for eleven (11) \n     Regional Vice Presidents, as follows: Three (3) from the \n     Eastern Conference, three (3) from the Central Conference, \n     two (2) from the Southern Conference, two (2) from the \n     Western Conference, and one (1) from the Canadian Conference. \n     In addition, there shall be nominated candidates for five (5) \n     Vice Presidents to be elected at large. All duly nominated \n     Vice Presidents shall stand for election conducted at local \n     unions on the same ballot and time as the election of General \n     President and General Secretary-Treasurer, as provided \n     herein;\n       (iv) At such an International convention, after the \n     nomination of International Union Vice Presidents and \n     election of Trustees, all delegates shall then vote for \n     nominees for the offices of IBT General President and \n     Secretary-Treasurer;\n       (v) To qualify for the ballot for the direct rank-and-file \n     voting for IBT General President, Secretary-Treasurer, and \n     Vice President, candidates must receive at least five (5) \n     percent of the delegate votes at the International \n     convention, for the at large position, or by conference for \n     regional positions, as the case may be;\n       (vi) No person on the ballot for the position of IBT \n     General President may appear on the ballot in the same \n     election year for the position of Secretary-Treasurer; and \n     further no member shall be a candidate for more than one (1) \n     Vice President position;\n       (vii) No less than four (4) months and no more than six (6) \n     months after the International convention at which candidates \n     were nominated, the IBT General President, General Secretary-\n     Treasurer and Vice Presidents shall be elected by direct \n     rank-and-file voting by secret ballot in unionwide, one-\n     member, one-vote elections for each at large position, and \n     conference wide, one-member one-vote elections for each \n     regional position;\n       (viii) All direct rank-and-file voting by secret ballot \n     described above shall be by in-person ballot box voting at \n     local unions or absentee ballot procedures where necessary, \n     in accordance with Department of Labor regulations; and\n       (ix) The current procedures under the IBT Constitution for \n     filling a vacancy between elections in the office of General \n     Secretary-Treasurer, International Trustee, and International \n     Vice President shall remain in effect.\n       The Election Officer shall supervise the IBT election \n     described above to be conducted in 1991 and any special IBT \n     elections that occur prior to the IBT elections to be \n     conducted in 1991.

Any disputes about the \n     conduct and/or results of elections shall be resolved \n     after hearing by the Administrator.\n       The union defendants consent to the Election Officer, at \n     Government expense, to supervise the 1996 IBT elections. The \n     union defendants further consent to the U.S. Department of \n     Labor supervising any IBT elections or special elections to \n     be conducted after 1991 for the office of the IBT General \n     President, IBT General Secretary-Treasurer, IBT Vice \n     President, and IBT Trustee.\n       At the IBT 1991 International Convention, the delegates \n     shall be presented with these aforesaid amendments for vote; \n     provided further that nothing herein shall be deemed or \n     interpreted or applied to abridge the Landrum-Griffin free \n     speech right of any IBT officer, delegate or member, \n     including the parties hereto.\n       (E) Reports to Membership.--The Administrator shall have \n     the authority to distribute materials at reasonable times to \n     the membership of the IBT about the Administrator's \n     activities. The reasonable cost of distribution of these \n     materials shall be borne by the IBT. Moreover, the \n     Administrator shall have the authority to publish a report in \n     each issue of the International Teamster concerning the \n     activities of the Administrator, Investigations Officer and \n     Election Officer.\n       (F) Reports to the Court.--The Administrator shall report \n     to the Court whenever the Administrator sees fit but, in any \n     event, shall file with the Court a written report every three \n     (3) months about the activities of the Administrator, \n     Investigations Officer and Election Officer. A copy of all \n     reports to the Court by the Administrator shall be served on \n     plaintiff United States of America, the IBT's General \n     President and duly designated IBT counsel.\n       (G) Hiring Authority.--The Administrator, the \n     Investigations Officer and the Election Officer shall have \n     the authority to employ accountants, consultants, experts, \n     investigators or any other personnel necessary to assist in \n     the proper discharge of their duties. Moreover, they shall \n     have the authority to designate persons of their choosing to \n     act on their behalf in performing any of their duties, as \n     outlined in subparagraphs above. Whenever any of them wish to \n     designate a person to act on their behalf, they shall give \n     prior written notice of the designation to plaintiff United \n     States of America, and the IBT's General President; and those \n     parties shall then have the right, within fourteen (14) days \n     of receipt of notice, to seek review by this Court of the \n     designation, which shall otherwise take effect fourteen (14) \n     days after receipt of notice.\n       (H) Compensation and Expenses.--The compensation and \n     expenses of the Administrator, the Investigations Officer and \n     the Election Officer (and any designee or persons hired by \n     them) shall be paid by the IBT. Moreover, all cost associated \n     with the activities of these three officials (and any \n     designee or persons hired by them) shall be paid by the IBT. \n     The Administrator, Investigations Officer and Election \n     Officer shall file with the Court (and serve on plaintiff \n     United States of America and the IBT's General President and \n     designated IBT counsel) an application, including an itemized \n     bill, with supporting material, for their services and \n     expenses once every three months. The IBT's\n\n[[Page S8801]]\n\n     General President shall then have fourteen (14) business days \n     following receipt of the above in which to contest the bill \n     before this Court. If the IBT's President fails to contest \n     such a bill within that 14-day period, the IBT shall be \n     obligated to pay the bill. In all disputes concerning the \n     reasonableness of the level or amount of compensation or \n     expense to be paid, the Court and parties shall be guided by \n     the level of payment as authorized and approved by the IBT \n     for the payment of similar services and expenses.\n       (I) Application to the Court.--The Administrator may make \n     any application to the Court that the Administrator deems \n     warranted. Upon making any application to the Court, the \n     Administrator shall give prior notice to plaintiff United \n     States of America, the IBT's General President and designated \n     IBT counsel and shall serve any submissions filed with the \n     Court on plaintiff United States of America, the IBT's \n     General President and designated IBT counsel. Nothing herein \n     shall be construed as authorizing the parties or the Court-\n     appointed officers to modify, change or amend the terms of \n     this Order.\n\n                      G. Independent Review Board\n\n       Following the certification of the 1991 election results, \n     there shall be established an Independent Review Board \n     (hereinafter, referred to as the ``Review Board''). Said \n     Board shall consist of three members, one chosen by the \n     Attorney General of the United States, one chosen by the IBT \n     and a third person chosen by the Attorney General's designee \n     and the IBT's designee. In the event of a vacancy, the \n     replacement shall be selected in the same manner as the \n     person who is being replaced was selected.\n       (a) The Independent Review Board shall be authorized to \n     hire a sufficient staff of investigators and attorneys to \n     investigate adequately (1) any allegations of corruption, \n     including bribery, embezzlement, extortion, loan sharking, \n     violation of 29 U.S.C. Sec. 530 of the Landrum Griffin Act, \n     Taft-Hartley Criminal violations or Hobbs Act violations, or \n     (2) any allegations of domination or control or influence of \n     any IBT affiliate, member or representative by La Cosa Nostra \n     or any other organized crime entity or group, or (3) any \n     failure to cooperate fully with the Independent Review Board \n     in any investigation of the foregoing.\n       (b) The Independent Review Board shall exercise such \n     investigative authority as the General President and General \n     Secretary-Treasurer are presently authorized and empowered to \n     exercise pursuant to the IBT Constitution, as well as any and \n     all applicable provisions of law.\n       (c) All officers, member, employees and representatives of \n     the IBT and its affiliated bodies shall cooperate fully with \n     the Independent Review Board in the course of any \n     investigation or proceeding undertaken by it. Unreasonable \n     failure to cooperate with the Independent Review Board shall \n     be deemed to be conduct which brings reproach upon the IBT \n     and which is thereby within the Independent Review Board's \n     investigatory and decisional authority.\n       (d) Upon completion of an investigation, the Independent \n     Review Board shall issue a written report detailing its \n     findings, charges, and recommendations concerning the \n     discipline of union officers, members, employees, and \n     representatives and concerning the placing in trusteeship of \n     any IBT subordinate body. Such written reports shall be \n     available during business hours for public inspection at the \n     IBT office in Washington, DC.\n       (e) Any findings, charges, or recommendations of the \n     Independent Review Board regarding discipline or trusteeship \n     matters shall be submitted in writing to an appropriate IBT \n     entity (including designating a matter as an original \n     jurisdiction case for General Executive Board review), with a \n     copy sent to the General President and General Executive \n     Board. The IBT entity to which a matter is referred shall \n     thereupon promptly take whatever action is appropriate under \n     the circumstances, as provided by the IBT Constitution and \n     applicable law. Within 90 days of the referral, that IBT \n     entity must make written findings setting forth the specific \n     action taken and the reasons for that action.\n       (f) The Independent Review Board shall monitor all matters \n     which it has referred for action if, in its sole judgment, a \n     matter has not been pursued and decided by the IBT entity to \n     which the matter has been referred in a lawful, responsible, \n     or timely manner, or that the resolution proposed by the \n     relevant IBT entity is inadequate under the circumstances, \n     the Independent Review Board shall notify the IBT affiliate \n     involved of its view, and the reasons therefor. A copy of \n     said notice shall be sent by the Independent Review Board, to \n     the General President and the General Executive Board.\n       (g) Within 10 days of the notice described in paragraph (f) \n     above, the IBT entity involved shall set forth in writing any \n     and all additional actions it has taken and/or will take to \n     correct the defects set forth in said notice and a deadline \n     by which said action may be completed. Immediately \n     thereafter, the Independent Review Board shall issue a \n     written determination concerning the adequacy of the \n     additional action taken and/or proposed by the IBT entity \n     involved. If the Independent Review Board concludes that the \n     IBT entity involved has failed to take or propose \n     satisfactory action to remedy the defects specified by the \n     Independent Review Board's hearing, after notice to all \n     affected parties. All parties shall be permitted to present \n     any facts, evidence, or testimony which is relevant to the \n     issue before the Independent Review Board. Any such \n     hearing shall be conducted under the rules and procedures \n     generally applicable to labor arbitration hearings.\n       (h) After a fair hearing has been conducted, the \n     Independent Review Board shall issue a written decision which \n     shall be sent to the General President, each member of the \n     General Executive Board, and all affected parties.\n       (i) The decision of the Independent Review Board shall be \n     final and binding, and the General Executive Board shall take \n     all action which is necessary to implement said decision, \n     consistent with the IBT Constitution and applicable Federal \n     laws.\n       (j) The Independent Review Board shall have the right to \n     examine and review the General Executive Board's \n     implementation of the Independent Review Board's decisions; \n     in the event the Independent Review Board's decisions; in the \n     event the Independent Review Board is dissatisfied with the \n     General Executive Board's implementation of any of its \n     decisions, the Independent Review Board shall have the \n     authority to take whatever steps are appropriate to insure \n     proper implementation of any such decision.\n       (k) The Independent Review Board shall be apprised of and \n     have the authority to review any disciplinary or trusteeship \n     decision of the General Executive Board, and shall have the \n     right to affirm, modify, or reverse any such decision. The \n     Independent Review Board's affirmance, modification, or \n     reversal of any such General Executive Board decision shall \n     be in writing and final and binding.\n       (l) The IBT shall pay all costs and expenses of the \n     Independent Review Board and its staff (including all \n     salaries of Review Board members and staff). Invoices for all \n     such costs and expense shall be directed to the General \n     President for payment.\n       (m) The Investigations Officer and the Administrator shall \n     continue to exercise the investigatory and disciplinary \n     authority set forth in paragraph 12 above for the limited \n     period set forth in paragraph 3(3) above, provided, however, \n     that the Investigations Officer and the Administrator may, \n     instead, refer any such investigation or disciplinary matter \n     to the Independent Review Board.\n       (n) The IBT Constitution shall be deemed and hereby is \n     amended to incorporate all of the terms relating to the \n     Independent Review Board set forth above in this paragraph. \n     This amendment shall be presented to the delegates to the \n     1991 Convention for vote.\n\n                           H. Indemnification\n\n       13. The IBT shall purchase a policy of insurance in an \n     appropriate amount to protect the Administrator, the \n     Investigations Officer, the Election Officer and persons \n     acting on their behalf from personal liability for any of \n     their actions on behalf of the IBT, the Administrator, the \n     Investigations Officer or the Election Officer. If such \n     insurance is not available, or if the IBT so elects, the IBT \n     shall indemnify the Administrator, Investigations Officer, \n     Election Officer and persons acting on their behalf from any \n     liability (or costs incurred to defend against the imposition \n     of liability) for conduct taken pursuant to this order. That \n     indemnification shall not apply to conduct not taken pursuant \n     to this order. In addition, the Administrator, the \n     Investigations Officer, the Election Officer and any persons \n     designated or hired by them to act on their behalf shall \n     enjoy whatever exemptions from personal liability may exist \n     under the law for court officers.\n\n                          I. IBT Legal Counsel\n\n       14. During the term of office of the court-appointed \n     officers, the IBT General President shall have the right to \n     employ or retain legal counsel to provide consultation and \n     representation to the IBT with respect to this litigation, to \n     negotiate with the appropriate official and to challenge the \n     decisions of the court-appointed officers, and may use union \n     funds to pay for such legal consultation and representation. \n     The Administrator's removal powers and authority over union \n     expenditures shall not apply to such legal consultation and \n     representation.\n\n                             J. Non-Waiver\n\n       15. To the extent that such evidence would be otherwise \n     admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, nothing \n     herein shall be construed as a waiver by the United States of \n     America or the United States Department of Labor of its right \n     to offer proof of any allegation contained in the Complaint, \n     Proposed Amended Complaint, declarations or memoranda filed \n     in this action, in any subsequent proceeding which may \n     lawfully be brought.\n\n                        K. Application to Court\n\n       16. This Court shall retain jurisdiction to supervise the \n     activities of the Administrator and to entertain any future \n     applications by the Administrator or the parties. This Court \n     shall have exclusive jurisdiction to decide any and all \n     issues relating to the Administrator's actions or authority \n     pursuant to this order. In reviewing actions of the \n     Administrator, the Court shall apply the same standard of \n     review applicable to review of final federal agency action \n     under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n                          L. Future Practices\n\n       17. The parties intend the provisions set forth herein to \n     govern future ITT practices in those areas. To the extent the \n     IBT wishes\n\n[[Page S8802]]\n\n     to make any changes, constitutional or otherwise, in those \n     provisions, the IBT shall give prior written notice to the \n     plaintiff, through the undersigned. If the plaintiff then \n     objects to the proposed changes as inconsistent with the \n     terms and objections of this order, the change shall not \n     occur; provided, however, that the IBT shall then have the \n     right to seek a determination from this Court, or, after the \n     entry of judgment dismissing this action, from this Court or \n     any other federal court of competent jurisdiction as to \n     whether the proposed change is consistent with the terms and \n     objectives set forth herein.\n\n                           M. Scope of Order\n\n       18. Except as provided by the terms of this order, nothing \n     else herein shall be construed or interpreted as affecting or \n     modifying: (a) the IBT Constitution; (b) the Bylaws and \n     Constitution of any IBT affiliates; (c) the conduct and \n     operation of the affairs of the IBT or any IBT-affiliated \n     entity or any employee benefit fund as defined in ERISA or \n     trust fund as defined by Section 302(c) of the Labor \n     Management Relations Act, as amended; (d) the receipt of any \n     compensation or benefits lawfully due or vested to any \n     officer, member or employee of the IBT or any of its \n     affiliates and affiliated benefit fund; or (e) the term of \n     office of any elected or appointed IBT officer or any of the \n     officers of any IBT-affiliated entities.\n\n                        N. Non-Admission Clause\n\n       19. Nothing herein shall be construed as an admission by \n     any of the individual union defendants of any wrongdoing or \n     breach of any legal or fiduciary duty or obligation in the \n     discharge of their duties as IBT officers and members of the \n     IBT General Executive Board.\n\n                           O. Future Actions\n\n       20. Nothing herein shall preclude the United States of \n     America or the United States Department of Labor from taking \n     any appropriate action in regard to any of the union \n     defendants in reliance on federal laws, including an action \n     or motion to require disgorgement of pension, severance or \n     any other retirement benefits of any individual union officer \n     defendant on whom discipline is imposed pursuant to paragraph \n     12 above.\n\n                           P. Limits of Order\n\n       21. Nothing herein shall create or confer or is intended to \n     create or confer, any enforceable right, claim or benefit on \n     the part of any person or entity other than to the parties \n     hereto and the court-appointed officers established herein. \n     As to the undersigned defendants hereto, this order \n     supersedes the order of the Court entered on June 28, 1988, \n     as thereafter extended.\n\n                              Q. Execution\n\n       22. Each of the undersigned individual defendants has read \n     this order and has had an opportunity to consult with counsel \n     before signing the order.\n\n     March   , 1989.\n                                               David N. Edelstein,\n                                              U.S. District Judge.\n     Consented to: Benito Romano, United States Attorney, Southern \n         District of New York, One St. Andrew's Plaza, New York, \n         New York 10007, Attorney for Plaintiff, United States of \n         America.\n     By: Randy M. Mastro, Assistant United States Attorney, Mudge \n         Rose Guthrie, Alexander & Ferdon, 16 Maiden Lane, New \n         York, New York 10038, Attorneys for Defendants IBT and \n         its General Executive Board.\n     By: Jed S. Rakoff, James T. Grady, Esq., General Counsel, \n         International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, \n         Warehousemen and Helpers of America, AFL-CIO, 25 \n         Louisiana Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001.\n     By: James T. Grady, Esquire.\n\n       Defendant William J. McCarthy;\n       Defendant Joseph Trerotola;\n       Defendant Joseph W. Morgan;\n       Defendant Arnold Weinmeister;\n       Defendant Donald Peters;\n       Defendant Walter J. Shea;\n       Defendant Harold Friedman;\n       Defendant Jack D. Cox;\n       Defendant Michael J. Riley;\n       Defendant Theodore Cozza;\n       Defendant Daniel Ligurotis.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. ``The union/defendants consent to the election officer, \nat Government expense, to supervise the '96 elections.''\n  And then it reviews this. It says ``at Government expense.''\n  If we are to take the Nickles--this is in the consent decree. This is \nnot the judge reaching this. This is the Republican Justice Department, \nunder Attorney General Thornburgh, agreeing to this, and where they had \nmade that kind of commitment and agreement. All we are saying is, in \nany kind of new election, we don't know exactly what they are going to \nrecommend, but we do not want to restrict or affect that consent decree \nby interfering with legislative action.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Massachusetts that I would \nagree. That is why I find it hard to understand why there can't even be \nan agreement here on the floor of the Senate because I think the \nposition that the Senator takes is very reasonable, and I think it is \nimportant to have this consent decree as part of the Record for that \nvery reason.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor, if my colleague wants to \nspeak. If that is what he really wants to do, I am pleased to yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have a question for the Senator from \nMinnesota. It is not about the subject matter at hand. It is about this \nrather disturbing assertion by the Senator from Minnesota and the \nSenator from Massachusetts about the motives behind the Nickles \namendment. It is disturbing. And I think the Senator from Texas is \nright when he said that in fact this borders on a violation of rule \nXIX.\n  Let me make a statement. And then I would like the Senator to \nrespond.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield, why doesn't he put the \nquestion to me first?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me put the information out, and then I would like \nthe Senator to respond to it. I can do it in the form of a question. \nBut the Senator from Minnesota makes the assertion that this comes \nright on the heels of a Teamsters strike when they were successful in \nnegotiating some changes in their contract. The Senator talks about the \nchronology. Let's also talk about the chronology of when Barbara Zack \nQuindel, who is the overseer of the election, came out with her order \nfollowing the strike. That didn't occur 3 months ago. That didn't occur \n6 months ago. It occurred 3 or 4 weeks ago over the break. The first \nopportunity for us to address this issue is this bill.\n  To suggest that we somehow waited until after this Teamsters strike \nto do this is ridiculous. The timing is perfectly appropriate. It is \nappropriate because it is the first legislative opportunity to address \nthis issue after the overseer ruled on the election. If we waited 6 \nmonths and there happened to be a strike and we happened to come \nforward with this after that successful strike by a union, then you can \nmake the argument. But that is not what is happening here.\n  To suggest and imply and impugn the integrity of the Senator from \nOklahoma and his motives I think is really below the dignity of this \nSenate given the chronology that the Senator from Minnesota is well \naware of. I hope that given that knowledge--and maybe he did not have \nthat knowledge--but given the knowledge that this in fact was right \nafter this decision was handed down by the overseer of the election, \nand that this was in fact timely, and had nothing to do with the \nTeamsters strike, in fact one might add that the fact that Ms. Quindel \nsat on this report for a couple of weeks might have had something to do \nwith the Teamsters strike. But that is not the issue here. What is at \nissue is the Senator from Oklahoma addressed this issue expeditiously \nright after the decision was made on the first legislative vehicle to \ndo so. And I think any other construction of motivation really does not \nhold water very well.\n  So I would be pleased with a response, given that information.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to respond. I know the majority \nleader wants to respond.\n  First of all, if the Senator was listening carefully, I said, \nwhatever the intention, it just seemed to me that it is hard \ncontextually with what we do from what is happening outside the Senate. \nAnd I think it is a big mistake to do this. I think many people will \nview this as nothing less than an effort to retaliate.\n  That is my position. Whether or not I am right or wrong, I say to my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania that the proof will be in the pudding. We \nwill see how people in the country respond. We will see what \ninterpretation people put on this. I think it is a big mistake. I think \nthis is a real overreach.\n  As I tried to do in this debate, I went back through the history of \nthis. I make it crystal clear. Richard Thornburgh, in this settlement \nof March 14, 1989, which union leaders agreed to earlier today, said \nculminates 30 years of efforts by the Department of Justice to remove \nthe influence of organized crime within the Teamsters Union. We are \nsaying in the second-degree amendment that nothing that we do should be \nconstrued to apply to expenditures.\n  Don't overreach, and don't take an imprudent action, and don't try to\n\n[[Page S8803]]\n\noverturn this. That is profoundly mistaken.\n  That is my argument. And that will continue to be my argument, \nirrespective of what some of my other colleagues believe.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have never seen so many red herrings in my \nlife. We should be flying a flock. This is not about the recent \nTeamsters strike at UPS, although clearly that strike injured millions \nof Americans and small businessmen and women. And I heard a lot of \nthose concerns while I was home. I had a lot of calls in my offices \npleading for help in some way. ``Please find a way to help end this \nstrike because of what it is doing to us as individuals and small \nbusinesses.''\n  It is not about a union or a particular union. I have had a good \nrelationship with individual teamsters over the years. When I practiced \nlaw I represented the longshoremen, the boilermakers, and every other \nunion you can name.\n  No. What is this really about? This is about fairness for the \nAmerican people. That is why this amendment has been offered and why it \nis so important. The taxpayers of America are paying for union \nelections. Do we want that? I don't think my constituents know that, \nand they would be horrified to know it. That is what this is all about. \nPaying for the Teamsters to hold an election has not happened once. It \nhas happened twice. The question now is, Will it happen a third time \nbecause of fraudulent elections, or is it in fact a bill the American \npeople have to foot in perpetuity?\n  I've heard a great deal of talk about a consent degree. I am not \nimpressed that a judge said that the people of this country, the \ntaxpayers, should pay for union elections. I am not impressed, whether \nit was a Republican or a Democrat administration, or which Justice \nDepartment went along with it. This is wrong.\n  When the people find out the truth of what is going on here, they \nwill be in an uproar because we should not be paying for private union \nelections.\n  So that is the remarkable thing about this situation. That is why \nthis amendment has been offered--to set up a process to stop taxpayers' \nmoney being used to conduct union elections; and more importantly, it \nsets up the process for taxpayers' money to be repaid.\n  That is one of the key components of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. It says that there will be a process whereby the \nTeamsters, if, in fact, taxpayer dollars are involved, will have to pay \nback in an agreed-to process with a plan to repay the cost of these \nelections. The taxpayers of America paid $22 million for the last \nTeamsters' election; that is $45 per Teamster vote.\n  As the Washington Times noted, ``the taxpayers were monumentally \nripped off.'' It turns out there was a fraudulent election. And now \nthere is an indication, well, a judicial official might decree that the \ntaxpayers should have to pay the Teamsters again. This is a horrible \nprocedure. This is a horrible precedent. I don't care what union it is; \nwhat business it is. We shouldn't be paying for these kind of \nelections, and certainly not without some process to get the taxpayers \nrepaid for what they have put into this process.\n  The Nickles amendment puts an end to this nonsense. It allows the \nFederal Government to continue the fight against corruption in the \nTeamsters Union but says the teamsters have to pay the American people \nback for the privilege of an honest election. For heaven's sake. \nNothing could be more fair than that.\n\n  Last month, a Federal election official determined that \n``corruption''--this is a quote--``in the Teamsters remains a major \nproblem.'' Citing ``extraordinary'' and ``egregious improprieties,'' \nthe Federal election officials threw out the Teamsters election. We \ndidn't have anything to do with that. That is what the Clinton \nadministration is saying about this. Taxpayers paid for what turned out \nto be a stolen private election.\n  Somehow or other the Justice Department, which was supposed to be \noverseeing this process, let someone in the Teamsters steal an election \nright from under its nose with the taxpayers paying the tab for the \nelection. Guess what? Now they are saying, ``Well, we don't know but \nmaybe we will have to have another election, and maybe the taxpayers \nshould pay again.'' Ridiculous. It is time that we stopped this.\n  The Clinton FBI, not the Republican Congress, alleges that there was \nan intricate money laundering scheme pouring thousands of dollars from \nthe union treasury into union president Ron Carey's campaign.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues: This is a travesty. It is a \ntravesty that these elections are fraudulent again and again. People \naround here forget that the Teamsters have even been thrown out of the \nAFL-CIO in the past for such corruption. Now you add to that equation \nmore taxpayer funding. This won't sell in America.\n  The Nickles amendment should be adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the issue now pending exists on \ncomplexity on a number of levels.\n  I agree with the remarks just made by our distinguished majority \nleader that the American people ought not to pay for union elections. \nIt is an open question as to how the consent decree was entered into \nwhen it was, and why the U.S. Government entered into that consent \ndecree. But that is what we face at the present time.\n  My view is that we have a question of judicial authority here which \nis paramount, and it is a matter for the court to decide under our \ndoctrine of separation of powers.\n  We are very premature in what we are doing here on two scores.\n  One is there has been a recommendation for a new election, which, as \nI understand the record, has not yet been approved in the court. This \nis a complicated matter. There are lots of complexities on it. But my \nunderstanding is that it has not been approved by the court. And then \nthe court under any expected interpretation would come to the \nconclusion that this is a new election, and not to be paid by the \nTreasury of the United States under the preexisting arrangement. That \nelection has already been paid for. But essentially this a matter for \nthe court to decide. And there would be ample time for the Congress to \nturn down an appropriation in the future on the basis that is not an \nappropriate matter to be paid for by taxpayers' money. But on this \nstate of the record, it is my view that it is a judicial matter, and \nnot a matter of the Congress.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to follow the statement \nthat is made by Senator Specter, the chairman of the subcommittee. It \nis my understanding also that the election officer's recommendation has \nnot been approved by the court. I share the consternation of many \npeople here about the timing of that election officer's report of her \nfindings concerning that Teamster election.\n  It is clear that under the existing situation there is no order of \nthe court. Even the court hasn't even considered that recommendation, \nif we have one who has exercised severe bad judgment in terms of the \ntiming of the announcement of her finding. And it is apparent that she \ncould be overruled as to even her findings. But the main thing is that \nthis is a bill that has nothing in it pertaining to this matter.\n  There now comes another one of our cause celebre riders that could \nwell lose the product of this bill.\n  Mr. President, we have 14 appropriations bills to pass by this Senate \nbefore September 30, 13 bills coming out of conference, and one \ncontinuing resolution. That says that if we can't send them all to the \nPresident and get them signed before the 30th, there will have to be a \ncontinuing resolution in any event. In addition to that, we have this \nbill and two other bills to pass.\n  We are really going to be in appropriations every day during this \nperiod of September.\n  I have great respect for my friend from Oklahoma. But I have to say \nthe time to deal with this issue is when and if the administration asks \nCongress for money to pay for this election. We don't even know that \nthere is going to be a new election. If the court rules there is to be \na new election,\n\n[[Page S8804]]\n\nthere is no authority in the Department of Justice or the Department of \nLabor to use existing funds for that election. They will have to come \nup here with a supplemental request. That is the time we should deal \nwith it.\n  I have to say that it is my feeling, very frankly, as chairman of the \ncommittee, that I would rather risk a supplemental--an issue where we \ndisagree with the administration--than risk the whole year's bill. To \nmy knowledge, this is the only issue that would lead this bill to be \nsubject to a veto.\n  So I really have to say, as I did to my friend from Oklahoma, that I \ndisagree with the Senator from Massachusetts, too; that I don't think \nhis amendment is necessary, the amendment in the second degree. And I \ndon't think it is timely to raise the Nickles amendment now.\n  What we need to do is get on with our work and get this bill passed. \nWe still have the Interior bill, we have the District of Columbia bill, \nand then we have all 13 bills to pass as conference reports, and then \nwe have to pass a continuing resolution. And it has a conference \nreport, too.\n  So, if we want to be here all year working appropriations, then we \ncan spend our time on these riders again. For me, there is no necessity \nfor the second kick of a mule. I got kicked the last time we had this \nproblem on that supplemental. I don't see any reason to go through it \nagain.\n  I urge the Senate not to approve these riders that are controversial. \nEvery one of them has something we would like to have settled. And, if \nthey are noncontroversial and we can work them out, we should do it. \nBut this is a controversial matter. It is, obviously. I am told that \nthe Department of Labor believes it is cheaper to pay for the \nsupervision of the election rather than to have to deal with many \ncomplaints on the next election, if one is ordered.\n  So this is a very complicated issue.\n  From my point of view, it is not involved in this bill before us. I \nrespect my good friend from Oklahoma in terms of his views about that \nelection officer, as I have said, and the timing of the release, but \nthere is nothing before us yet. The court has not approved that report. \nWe are dealing with speculation as to whether there will even be \nanother election. So why tie up this bill and tie up the Senate on an \nissue that is premature, Mr. President, and I urge the Senate to join \nme in voting against both my friend from Massachusetts and my friend \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I heard the comments of my colleague from \nAlaska, but basically what he is saying is we should not tell the \nDepartment of Labor how to spend money. In this appropriations bill we \nappropriate money for the Department of Labor. In this case they \nappropriated about $22 million--admittedly it came from the Department \nof Labor and the Department of Justice--to conduct this last election. \nAnd they did a pretty crummy job. We paid millions of dollars and we \nended up with a corrupt election.\n  I do not want that to happen again. We talk about adherence to the \nconsent decree that was agreed to in 1989. I think my original \namendment is in adherence to the 1989 consent decree, because it said \nthat the Teamsters will pay for the 1991 election. They paid for it. \nAnd guess what. There was no complaint that it was a corrupt election. \nThey paid for it themselves. You know what. People are a lot more \nfrugal with their own money. They are less likely to steal from their \nown members. They are less likely to be corrupt maybe with their own \nmembers' money than they would be with taxpayer money.\n  So we had a 1991 election. Mr. Carey won. Fine. And I don't know that \nanybody--there was an overseer in the 1991 election. They did not \nallege fraud in that. So the 1991 election was done by the Teamsters. \nThey paid for it. They should have paid for it. They had a good \nelection. No one said a thing. The 1996 election the taxpayers paid \nfor.\n  I will admit I did not know we paid for it until I read about it. And \nwhen did we read about it? Well, the overseer of the election, she \nannounced during, or after the UPS strike--and that is the only thing \nUPS has to do with this--she waited until after the UPS strike to \nannounce that there was fraud and that her recommendation would be that \nwe need a new election. Mr. Carey only won by a few thousand votes. She \nsaid that maybe there were hundreds of thousands of dollars that were \nfunneled in his direction and so she thought a new election was \nwarranted.\n  Fine. Let there be a new election. I am just saying in the new \nelection taxpayers should not pay for it. We did not pay for the one in \n1991. It was a clean election. We paid for the one in 1996 and there \nwas corruption. A lot of money was moved around. Let's make sure, if we \nhave an election in 1998, it is not a corrupt election.\n  That is the purpose. This bill funds the Department of Labor for \n1998. Let's make sure that taxpayer money is not used for this purpose.\n  Somebody says, well, is this in compliance with the consent decree. I \nwill tell you the consent decree is silent on a rerun election. It does \nnot say it. I read the consent decree two or three times. It does not \nsay anything about a rerun. So maybe a judge would determine, well, \nmaybe taxpayers should pay for it. Maybe a judge would not. But wait a \nminute. Congress is supposed to appropriate money, and we have \nopinions. If somebody says, well, we are violating, we are stamping out \nthe consent decree, hogwash. The consent decree does not say it.\n  I did not request this, but there is a Congressional Research Service \nstudy dated May 1995, what would happen if Congress--does Congress have \nthe right to withhold the money? The answer is yes. I will read you the \nquote from CRS. I will ask unanimous consent to put the entire study \ninto the Record. But it says:\n\n       Legislation enacted by Congress limiting or restricting the \n     funds for the 1996 election would be a Federal law, and the \n     Government parties would be bound to take appropriate action \n     in reliance on that law.\n       What are the consequences to the Congress of not \n     appropriating all the funds necessary to supervise the 1996 \n     IBT elections?\n       There would appear to be no consequences to the Congress. \n     The consent decree does not appear to obligate the Government \n     to supervise the 1996 elections, either directly or \n     indirectly. Rather, the decree embodies the consent of the \n     union defendants to governmental supervision.\n\n  We had governmental supervision in 1991. We will in 1998. What I am \nsaying is let's just not pay for the election. This is not a destitute \ngroup of individuals. These are people who do quite well. Great.\n  I read something; they average $27 an hour, about $50,000 a year. \nFine. Why is the Federal Government paying for the election? We did not \npay for the other election. We did not pay for the 1991 election. Why \nwould we pay for a rerun of the election?\n  All I am trying to do is protect taxpayers' money. And my colleague \nis suggesting, well, maybe somebody is upset about the UPS settlement. \nThat has nothing to do with it. I am offended by that allegation. That \nis totally ridiculous. All I am trying to do is protect taxpayers.\n  They had their strike. They had their settlement. And some people are \nrunning around saying, ``great victory,'' and so on. So be it. I am \njust saying you are not entitled to another $22 million of taxpayers' \nmoney. If the Teamsters pay for it--if it cost the Teamsters maybe less \nthan half an hour to pay for their own election, they should pay for \nit.\n  I even went so far in the amendment to try to be fair. Some people \nsaid make sure you put in language that no Federal funds be used to \nconduct the election. You could use it to oversee the election, to \nsupervise the election. We do that in Third World countries. We do that \nin new democracies, so maybe we would spend a little money to oversee \nthe election.\n  I think that is fine, to have observers to try to monitor the \nelection, to see that we would eliminate some of the corruption, but we \nhad corruption when we had Federal funding because people took some of \nthe Federal money and abused it. I am trying to make sure that does not \nhappen again.\n  Do we have the constitutional right to do it? Absolutely. CRS said we \ndo. The consent decree is silent on a rerun. Certainly we can do that. \nAnd my colleague from Alaska says the judge may not even agree. We had \nthe overseer, who made $300,000 or $400,000 monitoring this election, \nfind out it is corrupt, withholds that information until after\n\n[[Page S8805]]\n\nthe UPS strike and then says, oh, yeah, we are going to have a new \nelection. I didn't want to tell anybody during the strike because it \nmight have influenced the strike one way or another. Oh, yes, but we \nneed a new election.\n\n  I am saying fine. If they need a new election, I agree. If that's her \nrecommendation, fine. I am saying taxpayers shouldn't pay for it. Very \nplain and simple. We can monitor it. We can try to make sure it is not \ncorrupt. But we should not pay for it. It's that simple. We didn't pay \nfor the 1991 election. They had a good election. Certainly we can allow \nan election in 1998, if there is to be an election. If there isn't \ngoing to be an election, fine. My amendment wouldn't cost the \ntaxpayers. I am trying to save the taxpayers money. So this amendment \nwouldn't cost anything.\n  The very thought of my colleague who said maybe the administration \nwould veto it, wait a minute. You have an appropriations bill that is \nactually hundreds of billions of dollars. They are going to veto this \nbill because they want to protect the Teamsters from what? Paying for \ntheir own election. Give me a break. You have to be kidding. How \nspecial interest could this group be? I know I saw the Vice President \nwith the Teamsters on Labor Day, with thumbs up, and so on. But surely \nthey would not veto a bill that says this group, which is pretty well \ncompensated at an average--I guess truckers are making something like, \nI don't know, $27 an hour, wages and benefits--surely they say \ntaxpayers that make a lot less than that should not be paying for their \nelection when the consent decree does not say that. The consent decree \nis silent, frankly, on election reruns. I can't imagine that the \nadministration would recommend vetoing a bill over something that \nspecial interest.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we have had adequate debate. I would just \nurge my colleagues to vote to table the Kennedy amendment, and I move \nto table the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The motion to table is not \ndebatable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I \nsuggest the absence a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed for 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just two brief comments. One with regard to the \nCongressional Research Service. It is not true that section O of the \nconsent decree permits the U.S. Government to avoid its legal \nobligations under the decree, including its legal obligation to pay for \nsupervision of the upcoming election.\n  Section O is a general savings clause retaining the right of the \nGovernment to seek remedies against the defendants for misconduct. It \nwas never intended, nor can it be reasonably read, to override the \nremainder of the consent decree.\n  Under the overbroad reading of section O, the consent decree is \nmeaningless--the parties would have agreed to nothing, because section \nO would always undermine the original understanding. This is an absurd \nreading of the provision.\n  It violates the basic rule of legal construction that meaning must be \ngiven to the entire text of the decree.\n  It has also been argued that under the decree the United States did \nnot need to insist on supervision of the election and therefore need \nnot pay for the election. This is also absurd--the United States did \nelect to supervise the election, and therefore must pay for the \nelection. To say otherwise is to make the Federal Government a \ndeadbeat; a party to litigation weaseling out of its legal duties.\n  Mr. President, Senator Stevens said it best when he talked about \nbringing into this appropriation matters which are not directly related \nto the appropriations. I have here the statement of administration \npolicy, September 2. I will read these provisions.\n\n       The administration understands that a number of \n     controversial amendments may be offered, such as an amendment \n     to prohibit the use of funds in the act for supervising the \n     Teamster's election * * * The President's senior advisers \n     would be forced to recommend that the President veto the \n     bill.\n\n  There are other provisions but that I think supports what the Senator \nfrom Alaska has mentioned.\n  I had hoped that we could have tabled the whole proposal, and I would \nhave supported it. But nonetheless we don't have that opportunity at \nthis time, so I hope that the proposal of the Senator from Oklahoma to \ntable the measure would not be agreed to. And if that were the case, I \nwould not object to tabling the whole proposal and get on with the \nbusiness of the appropriations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is not debatable.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma to table the amendment. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. \nMurkowski] is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 217 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Glenn\n     Murkowski\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 1082) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, this second-degree amendment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk has not concluded reading.\n\n[[Page S8806]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Objection. Can we have the reading of the amendment? It \nhas not been distributed to the Members. It seems to me we ought to \nhave the amendment read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue to read.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May we have order?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, may we have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point is well taken, the Senate is not in \norder. The clerk will continue to read.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n       Strike all after the word ``Section'' and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), none \n     of the funds made available under this Act, or any other Act \n     making appropriations for fiscal year 1998, may be used by \n     the Department of Labor or the Department of Justice to \n     conduct a rerun of a 1996 election for the office of \n     President, General Secretary, Vice-President, or Trustee of \n     the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n       (b) Exception.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the submission to Congress of a \n     certification by the President of the United States that the \n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters does not have funds \n     sufficient to conduct a rerun of a 1996 election for the \n     office of President, General Secretary, Vice-President, or \n     Trustee of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the \n     President of the United States may transfer funds from the \n     Department of Justice and the Department of Labor for the \n     conduct and oversight of such a rerun election.\n       (2) Requirement.--Prior to the transfer of funds under \n     paragraph (1), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters \n     shall agree to repay the Secretary of the Treasury for the \n     costs incurred by the Department of Labor and the Department \n     of Justice in connection with the conduct of an election \n     described in paragraph (1). Such agreement shall provide that \n     any such repayment plan be reasonable and practicable, as \n     determined by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Treasury, and be structured in a manner that permits the \n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters to continue to \n     operate.\n       (3) Repayment plan.--The International Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters shall submit to the President of the United States, \n     the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the Majority \n     and Minority Leaders of the House of Representatives, and the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, a plan for the \n     repayment of amounts described in paragraph (2), at an \n     interest rate equal to the Federal underpayment rate \n     established under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 as in effect for the calendar quarter in which \n     the plan is submitted, prior to the expenditure of any funds \n     under this section.\n       (c) This section shall take effect one day after enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment clarifies a few \npoints in the first-degree amendment. As you noticed, the clerk read \nsection (c) which merely discusses time of enactment and time in which \nthe proposed amendment would take effect. What we have here, of course, \nis the fundamental question that has been brought by the Senator from \nOklahoma: Who should pay for the elections of a private union?\n  The question fundamentally put before this Senate is very simple for \nall of us. Should it be the taxpayers or should it in fact be the \nunion? I think we are concluding here that it should be the union in \nthis instance. The taxpayers have done what they should do in this \ninstance and should do no more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I rise in support of the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, let me just clarify again, some of our colleagues were \nnot aware of the taxpayers' support for the last election. I told a \ncouple colleagues--they said, ``How much did we spend?'' We spent $22 \nmillion; some people said more. The union has 1.4 million members. A \nlittle less than 500,000 voted. And $22 million is a lot of money. And \na lot of money was wasted or maybe abused. It was abused, frankly, \nbecause it was taxpayers' money. That did not happen when it was their \nown union money. I mention, every other union in the country uses their \nown money for their own elections, as they should.\n  So, again, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. This is not \nan unfair amendment. This even says that we can still use taxpayers' \nmoney. If for some reason the Teamsters do not have the money, they can \nborrow money from the Federal Government. They just have to pay it \nback. It happens to be, in my opinion, consistent with the consent \ndecree because the consent decree is silent. The word ``rerun \nelection'' is not mentioned in the 1989 decree.\n  So what we are trying to say is, in future elections they should pay \nfor it. We can still have Federal Government monitors. We can still \nhave some oversight to try to make sure it is not abused, as that last \nelection was. Taxpayers were abused as well as Teamsters last time.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Would the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Would the Senator from Oklahoma yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Certainly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Does your first-degree amendment prohibit the Government \nfrom overseeing the rerunning of an election?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The answer to the Senator's question is no. The \nGovernment can have some oversight and be involved in monitoring the \nelection, trying to make sure there is not corruption in the election. \nWe should not have to pay for it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In other words, if Teamsters were concerned, and there was \nat issue here corruption in the last election, and therefore a \nreelection to get rid of that corruption, or at least to have an \noutcome that all would be satisfied with, we could still have the \nDepartment of Labor and/or Justice involved in overseeing the rerunning \nof this election, and your amendment does not prohibit that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is exactly right.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one final comment.\n  We talk about this money, and people say, ``Big deal.'' We are \ntalking about $22 million. The Federal subsidy for Presidential \ncampaigns is what? $71 million for a general election. That is the \namount of money that Senator Dole received; that is the amount that \nClinton-Gore received from the taxpayers. This is one-third as much. \nThat amount of money was for the entire country. We are talking about \n1.4 million people, and only 500,000 or less voted last time.\n  Should taxpayers be liable for $22 million, or more? I do not think \nso. So this amendment tries to protect taxpayers. That is all it does. \nIt tries to be fair to Teamsters and does not get involved in who \nshould win in any way, shape, or form. It does not have anything to do \nwith the UPS strike whatsoever.\n  The only involvement of the UPS strike was the fact that they found \nout there was a corrupt election, and that information was withheld \nuntil after the strike was over. I am just saying, let us just make \nsure that taxpayers do not get stuck again. We got stuck in 1996. It \nwas a corrupt election. Let us not let it happen again for future \nelections.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as two Senators have indicated, this is \nbasically a restatement of the Nickles amendment. The Senator from \nOklahoma indicated earlier in the course of the debate that he was not \ninterested nor did he want to interfere with the consent decree that \nhad been signed in 1989.\n  I offered an amendment to make sure that that would be the case, by \nneither requiring the payment of taxpayers' funds to be used in a \nsubsequent election nor prohibiting funds to be used. The principal \nissue that is before the Senate is whether we are going to interfere \nwith a judicial proceeding that is before the Southern District Court \nof New York in which briefs are required to be filed on September 17.\n  This agreement, this consent decree, is not the result of the Clinton \nadministration or the Clinton Department of\n\n[[Page S8807]]\n\nLabor. This consent decree was initiated by Mayor Giuliani in 1988 and \nagreed to in the Federal District Court of New York in 1989 and \napproved by a Republican Attorney General. They understood the powers \nwhich were being included in that consent decree. They understood fully \nwhat was being agreed to. The record demonstrates that. We can have a \nchance to go through that in greater detail if there really is a \nquestion by the Members on that particular fact. They understood the \nrange of authority and responsibility as a result of that particular \nagreement.\n  This was based upon some 30 years of various activities by the \nTeamsters and the resulting initiative by Mr. Giuliani, who was the \nU.S. attorney in New York trying to bring a resolution to a great deal \nof the challenges, the difficulties, and the corruption that had been a \npart of the Teamsters in the past.\n  So now we have had intervening activities under that consent decree. \nBut that consent decree has not been concluded. As I mentioned, that \nconsent decree is active, and it is very much alive.\n  I did not hear the voices of those who are so troubled this evening \ncomplaining about that consent decree in 1988 or 1989. I did not hear \nthe voices that are speaking on the floor of the U.S. Senate tonight \nthat are concerned about how the consent decree was going to be \nimplemented, saying that we will agree to a certain part of the consent \ndecree but we will not agree to other provisions of it. That was not \nthe case.\n  The only initiative, and the new initiative, to somehow interfere \nwith this consent decree comes 2 weeks after the UPS and Teamsters \nstrike, which was a strike for some 15 days and which resulted in the \nprotection of certain rights of American workers, the 185,000 workers \nthat were working for UPS, and other rights in terms of part-time \nworkers and other issues involving pensions.\n  There are those who say, ``Well, this is completely coincidental. \nThis is really just here today. We just feel it now in our bones that \nthe fact that it is just after the successful UPS strike has nothing to \ndo with it. And the indignity which has been demonstrated on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate to suggest that there might be some kind of \ncorrelation between the fact that this amendment is being offered now \ntoday, tonight on this appropriations bill, is startling to me.'' It \nspeaks for itself. The facts speak for themselves. The facts speak for \nthemselves. I think the Members in this body understand what is going \non here.\n  As has been pointed out by Members on the other side--Members on the \nother side--this is a judicial process, judicial proceeding, and it \nshould not be altered or changed. That was a Republican Senator, \nSenator Specter, who pointed that out very effectively and very well. \nAnd we have the statements of others on the other side. The Senator \nfrom Alaska, Senator Stevens, said we should be about the fact of \nhaving an appropriations and move the appropriations process forward \nand should not become involved in these extraneous issues.\n  There will be those comments later on, I am sure, probably not too \nlong from now, about how some Members are delaying the completion of \nthe appropriations bill, when we took an hour last night to consider \nthe issues of fetal transplantation, which is an issue that has been \ndebated and debated and debated and debated, in which this body had \ngone on record time and time again, and we debated that over the course \nof the morning, which was basically an extraneous issue, and now we \nhave been debating over the course of the afternoon about this issue \nwhich is extraneous to the appropriations process and procedure.\n  The statement of the administration with regard to this legislation \nis very clear. I will read it again: Unfortunately, the administration \nunderstands that a number of controversial amendments may be offered, \nsuch as an amendment to halt the testing initiative, an amendment to \nprohibit the use of funds in the act for supervising the Teamsters' \nelection.\n  That is what this amendment does. It effectively undermines the \ncourt's flexibility in terms of the supervision of the Teamsters \nelection.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Doesn't, in fact, this amendment undercut the consent \ndecree? The consent decree leaves open, as I understand it, the \npossibility that the supervision of this election will be done by \npublic funds. It does not say that it will be, but it leaves open that \npossibility. This amendment closes out that possibility. It closes out \nthat possibility. That possibility was part of the consent decree. It \nwas left to the judgment of the court whether, in fact, that remedy \nwill be used. Is that not the case?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. With the understanding of the Justice Department that \nthat may very likely or probably be utilized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Wasn't this consent decree approved by the Justice \nDepartment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Approved by the Republican Justice Department under \nSecretary Thornburgh, who embraced and endorsed and supported it, this \nconsent agreement, that was initiated by now Mayor Giuliani, who was \nthe Republican U.S. attorney in New York City.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So this amendment----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could further respond, the consent decree required, \nas of September 17, the submission of additional briefs--September 17--\nto be submitted in the district court of New York on this very issue \nwith regard to the recent election. This is a consent decree that is \nongoing and is continuing.\n  What we are being asked is effectively to have legislative \ninterference into a judicial proceeding. That case was made very \nclearly, I thought, and convincingly by Senator Specter and others, \nthat there is a clear constitutional issue about separation of powers. \nI think it is very clear from the administration's letter that this \nwill open this measure to a veto. I certainly believe that it should, \nsince it is a clear violation of the separation of powers.\n  We were not either requiring, under the amendment that we had, that \nthere be an expenditure of public funds or not. We are not trying to \ngive guidance to the court to make a judgment. That judgment ought to \nbe made on the basis of the facts and the briefs that are submitted to \nit.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield further for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that the consent decree left \nopen that question and placed the power to decide it in the court; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This amendment would, in effect, negate that aspect of \nthe consent decree, would it not?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. For a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If you read page 16 of the consent decree, it does not \nmention ``rerun.'' We are not affecting or changing the consent decree \nin any way.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, you are; because the consent decree opens the \npossibility that the court will require that the election be paid for \nwith public funds. It does not say that it will, but it does not say \nthat it will not. It leaves open that option to the court. You are \ndenying that option by your amendment and, therefore, undoing the \nconsent decree.\n  How do you expect people to enter into a consent decree?\n  Was it 30 years they spent trying to work out a consent decree, did \nthe Senator say earlier?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thirty years that this was a matter.\n  Mr. SARBANES. A consent degree that was involved with the Bush \nadministration, approved by Attorney General Thornburgh, actually \ncarried out, I take it, by U.S. Attorney Giuliani at that point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of the Southern District of New York.\n  Now we are coming with an amendment to undo this process.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S8808]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to tell my colleague that in reviewing the \nconsent agreement we did not undo anything. The consent decree does not \nsay anything about a rerun election. It says that the Teamsters will \npay for the 1991 election and it says taxpayers will pay for the 1996 \nelection. It does not say anything about who will pay for a subsequent \nelection. We are trying to clarify that.\n  We had 56 votes who say the taxpayers should not, that the Teamsters \nshould. I think that is consistent with the consent decree.\n  I might mention, the CRS just studied this, and whose legal analysis \nI will refer to again, says the Congress has the right to do this, \nperiod.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, my understanding \nwas that the 1996 election was never certified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct, so it is still an \nopen question. That is a basic and fundamental point. That 1996 \nelection has never been certified.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So the rerun they are talking about would in effect \nflow out of the 1996 election, does it not?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. It is not necessarily a \nrequirement for a rerun. We do not know what the judge is going to \nrequire. The judge may require a rerun. The judge may not require a \nrerun. All we are saying is that we are not going to interfere in the \nprerogatives of the consent agreement which has been agreed to by the \nvarious parties who had a clear understanding about what the powers \nwere for the various parties.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am reminded of the words of the wonderful Mo Udall who \nsaid, ``Everything on this subject that could possibly be said has been \nsaid, only not everybody has said it,'' and I wonder if we had any time \nthat we might want to conclude this debate since I do have a couple of \npending amendments that I would like to address tonight.\n  Could the Senator from Massachusetts give me an idea as to perhaps \nwhen we might be able to move on?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As long as this matter is before the Senate I think we \nare going to have an opportunity to talk about it. There are more \nMembers here now than there were earlier. I would not object to setting \nthis aside to consider other measures. That is not my idea of delaying. \nIf it were to be set aside, I would not object to that process.\n  However, if we are going to be on this amendment, there are both \nspeakers and additional points that I think ought to be made.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So, as the Senator from Maryland has pointed out, the \ncourt may order the election to be run or it may not. It may require \nthe Government to fund part of the election officer's supervision in \nsome ways. It may be limited, maybe to that election, or it may require \nthe union to do so, or it may require each party to bear some of the \ncosts. All of that is out and all of that is possible.\n  The point is we do not know how the court will rule. We don't know \nhow the court will rule, but this amendment now would tell the court \nthat regardless of its ruling, regardless of its ruling, the Government \nwill not be permitted to fund any of the election. Even if the consent \norder requires the Government to pay for part of it, the amendment \nwould refuse to permit that. Thus, the amendment would interfere with \nan ongoing judicial process.\n  Effectively, the amendment, I believe would force the Government to \nbe in a position of reneging on this consent decree. It would, I \nbelieve, leave the Government subject to a contempt citation. I think \nyou can make a strong case at that time if we were to take this kind of \naction that the Government itself would be liable to a contempt \ncitation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In fact, as I understand it, part of the consent order \nwas a consent by the union to have the 1996 election supervised by an \nelection officer, is that not the case?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, part of that was that would be done at \nGovernment expense, to supervise the 1996 election? In other words, \nwhat the Government was getting out of this at the time was continued \nsupervision of Teamster elections, and part of the consent decree was \nthat the supervision of the 1996 election, extending well beyond the \n1991 election, would be done at Government expense, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Now the consent decree remains silent on the question \nof a rerun of that election since it has not been certified. This \namendment would, in effect, deprive the court of an option that is now \navailable to it, an option that, in fact, was left open by the consent \ndecree. This is simply undoing a consent decree. You will never get \nconsent decrees.\n  The Bush Administration held out the accomplishment of this consent \ndecree as a major achievement, is that not correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In 1989?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Did not the President and the Attorney General hold it \nout as a major accomplishment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Now, our colleague from Oklahoma and others are trying \nto undo the consent decree at a time, as I understand, that the court, \n2 weeks from yesterday, will be receiving briefs on this very issue of \nthe election, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If ever there was an instance of trampling in on the \npart of the Congress and in effect, undoing an arrangement that was \nvery carefully and elaborately worked out and, in fact, done so by now \nMayor Giuliani but then U.S. Attorney Giuliani in the Southern District \nof New York, approved by the Department of Justice, headed by Richard \nThornburgh, and held out by President Bush as a major accomplishment.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his comments because they make \nthe case extremely well and effectively.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Several comments were made that we are vitiating the \nconsent decree. Totally false. I will tell my colleagues, you can read \nthe consent decree, it does not say anything about a rerun election. \nThe consent decree did say that the Teamsters would pay for the 1991 \nelection and taxpayers would pay for the 1996 election.\n  The Teamsters came out very well. They got a nice gift, $22 million, \nmaybe more, which is over about $45, maybe $50 per person as the cost \nto the taxpayers of this vote. That is pretty high. Some of us do not \nthink we should do it again.\n  Maybe I was asleep at the switch in 1989. It happened. Nobody \nobjected. And in 1991, since the Teamsters paid for it, it never came \nup. I was not aware of it until after the 1996 election and we found \nthe abuse. It is an abuse on the Teamsters and on the taxpayers and \nshould not be repeated. That is the reason we have the amendment before \nthe Senate.\n  We do not vitiate the consent decree. We say in the future, judge, we \nknow the consent decree is silent. It does not say who should pay for \nit.\n  Now, frankly, if you read the Constitution it says Congress shall \nhave the power to appropriate money. It does not say ``an unelected \njudge.'' It does not say a judge, where a consent decree is silent, has \nthe power to go in and mandate something, like mandating U.S. taxpayer \nfunds. Some of us think elected officials should make that decision, \nnot unelected judges.\n  We are stating that in the future if there is another election, let \nthe Teamsters pay. This is not a group of individuals that cannot \nafford it.\n\n[[Page S8809]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does the Senator feel the election should be supervised \nby an election officer?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I tell my colleague my thought is it should be handled \nthe way it was in 1991. We had Federal supervision and observation of \nthe election in 1991 but the cost of the election was borne by the \nTeamsters.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But the consent to have an election officer was \nprovided for by the Teamsters in the consent decree. Do you not \nordinarily have an election officer to supervise an election?\n  The Senator says----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have the floor.\n  Let me correct you. What I said, the way I hope it would be done is \nthe way it was done in 1991. You had Federal supervision, you had \nFederal observers, you had Federal monitors, but you did not have \ntaxpayers paying $22 million for the election in 1991, and you had, in \n1991, an election that had Federal observers stating that they thought \nthis was a fair, clean election. That is what I want. I want the \nTeamsters to have a fair, clean election and I do not want the \ntaxpayers to take another ride for $22 million.\n  If we followed the thought that you and Senator Kennedy have, you \ncould have another corrupt election, taxpayers would be out another $20 \nor $30 million, an observer could receive another $400,000 for saying, \n``Oops, it was corrupt again,'' and we could do it again and again and \nagain.\n  Taxpayers have been taken for a ride once, we should not be taken for \na ride again.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, in fact, what the taxpayers got out of the \nconsent decree was the use of the election officer for the 1996 \nelection.\n  The Senator seems to proceed on the premise that having an election \nofficer to supervise the election is the normal course of events. That \nis not the case. One of the things that was negotiated in the consent \ndecree was getting an election officer for the 1996 election.\n  Let me read from the consent decree.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Is that a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will ask a question.\n  ``The union defendants consent to the election officer at government \nexpense to supervise the 1996 IBT elections.''\n  Now, that represented a major concession by the union in the consent \ndecree to place themselves under an election officer. Part of the \nconsent decree was, obviously if they were going to do that, that the \ncosts of the election officer would be paid by the Government and you \nare undoing that aspect of the consent decree.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, since I have the floor I will make a \ncomment.\n  I am not undermining that because the consent decree touched two \nelections, for my colleagues' information. It touched the 1991 election \nand touched the 1996 election, and it did both elections differently. I \nhope my colleague will realize that, and if he reads the consent decree \nhe will see that is the fact.\n  It said in 1991 the Teamsters paid for the election with some Federal \nsupervision. In 1996 it said we will have Federal supervision and \ntaxpayers pay for it. It does not say anything about a rerun. I am just \nsaying on the rerun we should not pay for the election. We can still \nhave supervision but we should not pay for it. That simple.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I understand it, this election has not been certified. \nThat has been brought out in the debate, and therefore we are still \noperating under the election of this year. As I understand it further, \nthe Senator can correct me if I am wrong, that this finding of this \nelection overseer now goes to a judge, the judge will make a decision \nas to whether or not to have a rerun of the election and, further, \ncannot that judge then decide who should pay for it, also?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to respond. The consent decree does not say \nwho would pay for the next election. Now, the judge may interpret that \nthe judge has the authority. I do not think they do, but that remains \nto be seen. What our amendment would do would be to clarify, ``Judge, \nyou can make your order, but Uncle Sam or the taxpayers are not going \nto pay for the next election.''\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield? I have a question whether or not \nthis is premature. Why not wait until the courts take their action and \nsee what has happened before the Senate then operates. Obviously, it \nwill happen in the next few weeks, I assume, and then the Senate can \nwork its will after the judge makes a decision.\n  Would that not be a reasonable course to take?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I do not think so for this reason: One, because I think \nthe Congress of the United States was elected to appropriate the money, \nnot an unelected judge in New York; and, two, this is timely because \nthis is an appropriations bill for 1998. If the election is ordered, it \nwill be for 1998. I think, instead of allowing the Departments of Labor \nand Justice and this administration, who has very close ties with this \nparticular union and might like to give them a $22 million gift--I \ndon't think we should do that. So in this bill we are appropriating for \nnext year, I think we should make it very clear that the taxpayers got \nthe shaft and so did the Teamsters out of this last $22 million, and it \nshould not happen again.\n\n  We clearly have the constitutional prerogative and right, as stated \nby CRS and the Constitution, to control Federal funds. I think we \nshould make it very clear that in any subsequent election the Teamsters \nshould pay for their own election. Every other union in the country \npays for their own elections. They should do so.\n  Incidentally, when you look at the 1991 election, which they paid \nfor, it was a good election. Then look at the election where the \ntaxpayers put in $22 million; it was a corrupt election. That should \ntell you something. Federal funds don't automatically mean you are \ngoing to have clean elections. We can still have oversight. We have \noversight in Third World countries where our Government is involved in \nbringing people in, whether it's President Carter or others, to help \noversee and make sure elections are clean and upright.\n  Don't get me wrong. The Mafia has been very involved in the \nTeamsters, and they have been for decades. I want them to be out. I \nwant the union to be clean. I want people to be able to vote and elect \ntheir representatives. It is kind of embarrassing, despite all this \nmoney, when you have a union of 1.4 million people and only 400-some-\nodd-thousand voted in the last election. I don't think the U.S. \ntaxpayers should have to take the hit for paying for it to the tune of \n$22 million.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me ask this question of the Senator from Oklahoma. Since \nthis is boiling down to a question of whether the taxpayers of the \nUnited States should pay for a union election or whether the union \nshould pay for its own election, why was it that the consent decree \nthat some of our colleagues seem to be focusing so much attention on \nwas entered into in the first instance? Why was the U.S. Government \ninvolved in dealing with the Teamsters Union in the first instance? And \nwhy was it that a special officer to oversee the election had to be \nassigned for that, or the parties agreed to have that officer oversee \nthe election to ensure that it would be a fair election? Why was the \nU.S. Government obligated to provide these funds for this labor union, \nfor a private labor union election?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will read a statement that came from the Department of \nJustice, on page 2: ``Because of the deep entrenchment of La Cosa \nNostra in the Teamsters electoral process, the consent decree gave the \nGovernment and the IBT the option to have the IBT election supervised \nby a court-appointed officer.''\n  It is because of the mob influence that has been with this union for \na long time. I want it to be out. Hopefully, it is out. Obviously, \nthere was still some corruption in the last election, which had a lot \nof taxpayer funding. The fact that the taxpayers had funds in it didn't \nclean it up. That is my point.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could ask this question. So the reason that my \nconstituents in\n\n[[Page S8810]]\n\nArizona had to help pay for this union election is because of past \nfraud and alleged illegal conduct of the union. That is why they are \nhaving to pay for this union election, or why they paid for the last \nunion election; is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That's correct. Obviously, the fact that they paid $22 \nmillion didn't guarantee a clean election.\n  Mr. KYL. Obviously. The last question I ask is, why, if it is the \nunion's elected officials' fault that the taxpayers had to spend this \nmoney in the first instance because they had allowed the fraud and \nalleged corruption to come into the union and tossed out the ability of \nthe union to conduct its own election on behalf of its members, why, \nonce the taxpayers paid for an election, should they have to pay for it \na second time? The taxpayers didn't do anything wrong; it was the union \nofficials.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I agree. That is the purpose of the amendment. We have a \nmajority--I think we have one, or I believe we will have a majority \nwhen we vote, and I hope that we vote on the amendment in the not-too-\ndistant future.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to respond to the questions put \nby the Senator from Arizona. The Senator seems to proceed on the \npremise that you are entitled to have an election officer to supervise \na union election, although he referred to them as ``private unions'' \nand said, ``Why are we paying for this with public funds?''\n  Now, the deal that was made in 1989 by the Bush administration and by \nAttorney General Thornburgh was that the 1991 election would be held \nwith an election officer, paid for by the union. The Government \nobviously wanted to have an election officer in the picture in the next \nelection, the 1996 election. But part of the consent decree was, if the \nelection officer was going to be in the picture for the 1996 union \nelection, the cost of that election was going to be paid for by the \nGovernment. Now, you all talk about how anxious you are to keep the \ninfluence of the mob out of the union. I certainly subscribe to that. \nBut what you are doing by this amendment is you are setting up the \npossibility that the union can conduct its election without an election \nofficer because it is out from under the consent decree. The consent \ndecree required the 1996 election to be done with an election officer. \nThat election has not been certified. It is that election about which \nthere are questions, which the judge is now going to hear. Now, you are \ngoing to come in and, in effect, undo part of the consent decree. I \nsimply point out to you that it carries with it the very high risk that \nan election officer will no longer be required. That is how the Bush \nadministration got an election officer for the 1996 election, through \nthe consent decree. They got it for 1991, and they got it for 1996.\n  The Bush administration obviously wanted an election officer in the \n1996 election. They didn't want the Teamsters out from under the \nconsent decree altogether after the 1991 election. Part of the \narrangement, in order to get the consent decree, was that the election \nofficer would be, at Government expense, appointed to supervise the \n1996 election. Now, that is the election that is in question. That is \nthe election that has not been certified. I mean, you act as though the \ninvolvement of public moneys did not achieve a public objective.\n  What was the Bush administration thinking about, and what was \nAttorney General Thornburgh thinking about, to support a consent decree \nthat provided that the Government would pay for the 1996 supervised \nelection? Obviously, what they were thinking about is they would get an \nelection officer to supervise the 1996 election, so they would carry \nthe supervision of the Teamsters beyond the 1991 election.\n  Now you are coming in and you want to undo this arrangement. My view \nis, you are intervening in an established court procedure under the \nconsent decree. Second--and I suggest that people stop and think about \nthis very carefully--you are running the very high risk that you will \nenable the Teamsters to come out from under the consent decree, as far \nas having an election officer is concerned. The people on the other \nside will certainly say that other unions pay for their elections; the \nGovernment doesn't pay for their union elections. That is true. But \nthey don't have an election officer to supervise it either.\n  In fact, the other side referred to this as private elections on the \npart of the union. Those private elections on the part of other unions \nare not supervised by election officers. With respect to the Teamsters \nelections, given the corruption we were trying to deal with, we thought \nit imperative to have an election officer. They got an election officer \nin 1991 for that election. The union paid for that election as part of \nthe consent decree. But the Bush administration obviously wanted to \nsupervise the next election as well, in order to ensure that they \ndidn't revert back to past practices.\n  Part of getting an election officer for the 1996 election was that \nthe Government assumed the cost of that supervision. Now, that election \nhas not been certified. It still remains an open question, and that is \nthe very matter on which the judge will be holding these hearings in \nless than 2 weeks' time. Now we come in here and are sort of, in \neffect, trespassing on this whole arrangement, portraying it as though \nthere was no return to the Government for the arrangement. The \nGovernment got the use of election officers in order to supervise these \nelections. I mean, the Senator ought to want election officers to \ncontinue----\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. SARBANES. And not provide a way for the union to come out from \nunder the consent decree and the election officer.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We had an overseer in the 1991 election, but it didn't \ncost $22 million. We ought to be able to have one in the 1998 election \nand not have it cost taxpayers $22 million. The overseer costs almost \n$400,000 for that one position. That is a lot of money. I don't have \ntoo many constituents that make that kind of money--$175 an hour. We \nhad a lot of supervision and still had a corrupt election. We can still \nhave supervision, but we should not pay for it. We had a clean election \nin 1991. We should not have to do this again in 1998.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to my colleague that that is not the consent \ndecree which the Bush administration approved and which they presented \nforward as a major accomplishment. That is an interesting argument, but \nthe Senator should have used it in 1989, at the time the Bush \nadministration sanctioned this consent decree. Otherwise, you never \nwould have had an election officer for the 1996 election. It is treated \nas though that is a normal course of events. That is a major part of \nthe bargain that was reached in the consent decree, keeping an election \nofficer. The other part of the bargain was that the Government would \npay the cost for the supervised election.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It strikes me that the job of Congress is to \nappropriate funds for the Federal courts to administer justice as best \nthey see fit. I am wondering why we are trying to wade in and specify \nhow this particular Federal judge administered the implementation of \nthe consent decree which has been entered in his court. It strikes me \nthat we have Federal courts all over the country and we have consent \ndecrees in place in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of cases all over the \ncountry. Here we are, singling out one of those cases and saying we are \ngoing to step in and specify how a Federal judge in the future should \nimplement the administration of that consent decree. It just seems to \nme that we are micromanaging, in the worst possible way, and really \nstepping into an area that the Congress should stay out of.\n  We should get on with the business that we were given to do under the \nConstitution, which is to pass appropriations bills, and we should let \nthe courts administer the cases that are before them. I ask the Senator \nfrom Maryland if he would agree with that basic view.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator makes a very valid point, but I \nwill take it a step further. By meddling into this, we may well make it \npossible for the Teamsters to come out from under the consent decree \nwith respect to the use of an election officer to conduct the election.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side, is that a result they want? Do \nthey want the Teamsters to be able to\n\n[[Page S8811]]\n\nconduct an election without the use of an election officer?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I just say I would like to have it where we would have \nsupervision, like in 1991. I don't think we have to give a $22 million \ngift to the Teamsters to have an election. It is a big union and a nice \ngroup of people. They ought to be able to elect their leaders, and we \nshould not have to give them a $22 million gift in the process. We can \ndo it like we did it in 1991.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I observe to the Senator that the only reason you got \nthat supervision was because of the consent decree. The reason you had \nan election officer in 1991, and the reason you had one in 1996 was \nbecause of the consent decree. You don't automatically get election \nofficers to supervise union elections. You are absolutely right, \nordinarily union elections are paid for by the union. It is a private \nassociation. They pay for the elections. There is no election officer \nto supervise those elections.\n  Now, what the consent decree gave you was an election officer because \nthe Government wanted to supervise the election as a way of rooting out \ncorruption and the influence of the mob in the Teamsters Union. They \ngot a consent decree and it gave them an election officer in 1991, and \nalso gave them an election officer in 1996 because, obviously, the Bush \nadministration didn't want to have just one election and then they are \noff the hook. They wanted to keep the supervision for the 1996 \nelection. But in order to get that agreement and that understanding in \nthe consent decree, they agreed to pay the costs of the supervision for \nthe 1996 election, which is, in a sense, the election that is still \nbefore us, since it has never been certified.\n  Now you are coming in, and you want to in effect eliminate an option \nthat is available to the judge in terms of carrying out the consent \ndecree. My point is that is carrying with it the very high risk that \nyou eliminate the election officer. Then that raises a question. Why do \nyou want to eliminate the election officer to supervise the teamsters \nelection? That brings us back to why we have the election officers to \nbegin with. So that works the whole thing back full circle. This is a \nclassic example of tramping in without fully thinking through what the \nconsequences of doing so are.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico has pointed out, it intrudes into the \njudicial operation, clearly. But, beyond that, I think it carries with \nit a very high risk that you are going to be hoisted by your own petard \nhere, and you are going to end up without an election officer, which is \nan essential part of the consent agreement that was reached which the \nBush administration at the time trumpeted as a major accomplishment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. Can the Senator help me a little bit in the position that I \nfind myself? We are sitting here with the Federal judges--almost 100 \nvacancies around the country. And they have to pass a litmus test \nbefore we can ever get them to the floor so we might approve them so \nthat justice might be done and not delayed. Now we find this amendment \nbefore us saying that we want to interfere in the courts that are \nalready there.\n  My fear is that democracy, as we know it, is being deleted, in my \nopinion, because of the meddling with the Federal courts and the delay \nof the appointment of judges and the interference of statutory \nprovisions that would tell the judge what to do and what not to do. \nThat is not what this country was founded on. It was founded on justice \nby judges, and you have the ability to go to court. Now we are saying \nyou can't.\n  Am I right or wrong? Have I lost something here, or have I found \nsomething on which my fear might be substantiated?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator is on a very important point. As \nthe Senator from New Mexico said, you have the Congress coming in and \ntrying to in effect dictate what the conclusions are going to be in the \ncourt proceedings--improper intrusion into the process, and a total \nlack of respect for the separation of powers. We are talking about a \nconsent decree here. We are not even talking about a matter which is \njust in the initial stages of litigation in which we have traditionally \nshied away from intervening in saying it is a matter to be resolved by \nthe courts. We have a matter here that was in extended litigation and \nwhich resulted in a consent decree entered into under an order of the \ncourt.\n  Now we are coming along and we are going to play around with this \nconsent decree, and it is treated as though there is no downside to it. \nIn other words, they say, ``Well, we will not honor the consent decree \nthat requires that we pay for the election but we will keep the \nelection officer which was provided in the consent decree.'' Which is \nunprecedented. That is not the normal way you do an election with an \nelection officer.\n  So they are going to keep the election officer. But they are going to \ndeny the court the ability to handle the apportioning of the cost of \nthat, which is apparent currently available to the court under the \nconsent decree. You are playing with fire. The end result of this may \nbe that the teamsters get out from under the consent decree, and they \ndon't have to use an election officer in order to conduct their \nelection.\n  If that is what you really want to do, I mean I think one ought to be \nexplicit about it. I don't think that is desirable. The questions that \nhave been raised about this election that just happened--and, you know, \nobviously, you want to be sure you have a fair election given the long \nhistory of this issue involving the Teamsters Union.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. FORD. Am I right if what I see here is that we are trying to say \nthat this is a bad union here that is going to get taxpayer dollars to \nhave an election? So, therefore, we are going to interfere. The issue \nis emotional. No question about it. But we are going to interfere with \nthe courts, and we will diminish the courts. Isn't it time for \nthoughtful people to try to protect the judiciary here so that even \nthough the question may be sensitive it may be a tough vote--we have \nhad tough votes before. A lot of times they are not easy votes. But \nthis is one I think we have to look beyond to the long-term harm that \nmight be done to the judiciary.\n  Am I all wrong in this?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. I think the Senator is absolutely correct. Just as \nthe court is about to pass on this previous election and make some \njudgment as to what ought to be done with respect maybe to holding \nanother election, we come along with this amendment, and in effect \nalter the consent decree.\n  What the Government got out of the consent decree was continued \nsupervision of the Teamster election by an election officer. In order \nto get that for the 1996 election in the consent decree, the Government \nundertook to pay the costs of that election. Now people want to \npreclude that side of the bargain but they want to keep the election \nofficer.\n  I am simply suggesting to them that they may lose the election \nofficer as well and bring the Teamsters out from under the consent \ndecree. I would think upon reflection that that is something they would \nnot want to do. In fact, the consent decree very clearly states that \nthe union defendants consent to the election of officers at Government \nexpense to supervise the 1996 IBT elections.\n  This was a litigated matter. It was in the courts. In fact, the mayor \nof New York, the current mayor of New York, was then the U.S. Attorney, \nRudy Giuliani, and this was the agreement they worked out as part of \nthe consent decree, as part of this litigation. Now, it is suggested \nthat, well, we didn't get anything for it. Of course, we got something \nfor it. We got the continued supervision of these elections with an \nelection officer. You don't ordinarily get that with union elections. \nOrdinarily the unions pay for the election. There is no election \nofficer. The Government wanted an election officer. They wanted to \nsupervise these elections. The union said pay for the '91 election. But \nthey, obviously, want out from under it. In effect, the deal was if you \nare going to continue to supervise us with an election officer through \nthe 1996 election, you are going to pay the costs of the 1996 election. \nThis election we are talking about here is in effect a continuation of \nthe 1996 election, and that one has not been certified.\n  So now we are playing, as it were, fast and loose with this consent \ndecree.\n\n[[Page S8812]]\n\n The end result of it may be that you will get an unsupervised election \nthrowing the whole thing right back. This thing was negotiated, as I \nunderstand it, after a long period of time with very intense and \nextended negotiations. And it was finally put in a place under the \norder of a U.S. district judge, and it was consented to by the U.S. \nAttorney. It was consented to by the U.S. Government, and consented to \nby the plaintiffs and by the defendant. In fact, there is a long list \nof signatures consenting to the consent decree. Otherwise, you would \nhave been in litigation. You don't know what the outcome would have \nbeen.\n  At the time, I can recall President Bush declaring this a great \nsuccess. I think it was an accomplishment by the Bush administration, \nby Attorney General Thornburgh. Now we come along, and we are undoing \nit here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for one comment in the form of \na question?\n  Just to quote from Attorney General Thornburgh, who said on March 14, \n1989, to back up the Senator's point, ``This settlement, which union \nleaders agreed to earlier today, culminates 30 years' of efforts by the \nDepartment of Justice to remove the influence of organized crime within \nthe Teamsters Union''--to go back.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This was Attorney General Thornburgh commenting?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Just one question, because the Senator has been on the floor and I \nhave been listening very carefully. It initially started out as a \ndebate. I expressed my concern that I thought whatever the intentions \nwere--I said good intentions--on the part of the colleagues, but that I \nthought that you really couldn't talk about this except in the context \nof what has happened with the Teamsters, and I thought this was \nprofoundly mistaken. But now, what the Senator has been doing as a \nlawyer is--I am a lay person. I have been listening very carefully. As \nI understand the Senator, what he is really saying is that the most \nserious part of this above and beyond my concerns is that it really \ndoes--as the Senator from Oklahoma said earlier, he didn't see this as \nbeing anything in contradiction with the consent decree--the Senator \nfrom Maryland is arguing that it is most certainly in contradiction, in \nwhich case it becomes a very dangerous intrusion into the judiciary.\n\n  Is that correct? Is that the legal principle here, and the government \nprinciple?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator, yes. That is correct. What my \ncolleagues on the other side are failing to understand is the history \nout of which this consent decree arose. In other words, the Federal \nGovernment filed suit against the Teamsters alleging mob influence in \nthe Teamsters, and it went through an involved presentation of what the \nissues were, the campaigns of fear and extortion, and so forth and so \non. That suit is pending. The Government then reaches a consent decree \nwith the Teamsters. The matter never went to full-scale litigation. You \ndon't know what the outcome of the litigation would have been. They \nreached a consent decree, and the Attorney General stated at the time, \n``This settlement, which union leaders agreed to earlier today, \nculminates 30 years' of efforts by the Department of Justice to remove \nthe influence of organized crime within the Teamsters Union.'' And the \nobserver goes on to note that the Teamsters signed a consent decree \nwith the Federal Government to avoid a trial over a lawsuit. The union \nagreed to purge its mob connections and hold democratic elections. Then \nthey discussed the supervision that was taking place with respect to \nthe 1991 election. And the grumbling, in fact, on the part of some of \nthe rank and file of the Teamsters is that the union no longer belonged \nto them, ``their second-guessing of internal decisions that we make,'' \net cetera, et cetera. ``They are eliminating democracy to ensure \ndemocracy,'' one of these dissidents said.\n  We got that arrangement in order to supervise this election in order \nto try to root out this mob influence. Part of the consent decree was \nnot only that you have a supervisor for the 1991 election but you have \none for the 1996 election, which was a marked departure from how these \nthings are handled.\n  My colleagues on the other side say, well, we don't pay for the \nelections of any other unions. That is quite true. No. We don't pay for \nthem. We don't have election officers to supervise them either. We \ndon't have them under a consent decree. There is a national purpose or \nobjective to be achieved by rooting out the corruption that existed in \nthe Teamsters Union. This consent decree negotiated by Mr. Giuliani, or \nby his associates, when he was a U.S. attorney in New York, approved by \nthe Department of Justice, by Richard Thornburgh, the Attorney General, \nwas an effort to accomplish that objective. In order to do that, we \nwere able in effect to impose an election regime upon the Teamsters, \nnot only for the 1991 election, the immediately next forthcoming \nelection, but also for the 1996 election.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me finish my point, and I will yield. Obviously, as \npart of the effort to extend out supervision beyond another 5 years out \ninto the 1996 election, the Government undertook to pay the costs of \nthe supervision of the 1996 election. But we got an election officer to \nsupervise it. That is the election that is now in question. That is the \nelection that is going to be under the scrutiny of the Federal District \njudge in New York. Now we are sort of messing with that situation \nwithout even beginning to have any full appreciation of what the \nconsequences may be.\n  I yield for a question by my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague. In looking at the consent decree. \nWe talked a lot about it. I think we should look at it and see what it \nactually says with regard to the effort in the 1991 election. What I \nread it to say--perhaps there is more than I read. But this is what I \nhave. It says that the union defendants further consent to the United \nStates Department of Justice supervising any IBT elections--any. They \nconsent to them supervising any elections or special elections to be \nconducted after 1991 for the officers of the IBT, president, general \nsecretary treasury, vice president, and trustees.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What point is the Senator making?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think it says that it gives the United States clearly \nthe option to do so, and pay for that election or not. In fact, I have \nin my hand a memorandum of the U.S. Department of Justice which says \njust that--interprets it just that way. It says on page 2, ``Because of \nthe deep entrenchment of the La Cosa Nostra in the IBT's electoral \nprocess, the consent decree gave the Government the option to have the \n1996 elections supervised by a court appointed officer.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't think we would be in violation of the decree to \nhave the Government--and we speak for the Government, don't we?--say to \nthem we don't intend to fund the second one.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Do you think you could have an election officer to that \nelection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think you have an option to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How would you have an election officer?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The U.S. Government, because of its concern about the \nmob influence of a union, protected itself with the right to assert, \nthe right to provide an election officer in supervision, to supervise \nthe election. So we don't have to exercise that option.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to my colleague, a distinguished former U.S. \nattorney in Alabama, the consent decree specifically says the union \ndefendants consent to the election officer at Government expense to \nsupervise the 1996 IBT elections.\n  Now, if you do not regard this election that is coming up as a \ncontinuation of the 1996 election, how are you going to get an election \nofficer for it given the specific provisions that are in this consent \ndecree?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What page is the Senator on?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Sixteen.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Are you reading the first full paragraph there? It \ndoesn't say 1996 election. It says they consent to supervision of any \nelection. That means obviously the United States did not intend to \nsupervise all those elections. The United States only undertook to do \nso if it chose to do so.\n\n[[Page S8813]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I could interrupt my colleague----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is what the Department of Justice, the Clinton \nDepartment of Justice, memorandum says, that it has the option. I think \nthat's the most plain reading of it, and I suggest to you the union \nagreed to this reluctantly, preferring not to perhaps but because they \nhad to. I just don't think that would be a fair interpretation of it. I \nthink the most normal interpretation would be that they have the option \nto do so, and I think this body has the right to say we choose not to \nfund it. Let's not do it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to my colleague, the consent decree I am looking \nat, in the first sentence of the first full paragraph on page 16 says, \n``The union defendants consent to the election officer, at Government \nexpense, to supervise the 1996 IBT elections.''\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. But I think the option is the same.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That's the point.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let's look at what the Department of Justice memorandum \nsays. The point of the Department of Justice memorandum about the 1996 \nelection was that it concluded the Departments of Justice and Labor \nbelieved they should be involved in supervising the 1996 election.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That's right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And they chose to exercise that option. I think this \nbody has the right to say we don't think we should exercise the next \noption; at least we are not going to fund it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Department wanted to supervise the 1996 election. \nThey got the consent, they got it as part of the consent decree from \nthe union to do so, but the costs of the election would be borne by the \nGovernment.\n  We ought to let the court decide what the consent decree means \nbecause, if you start playing around with a consent decree with respect \nto the cost of the election, the next thing you may discover is that \nyou have let the Teamsters out from under the consent decree and you \nwill not have an election officer, which was part and parcel of the \narrangement that was made in the consent decree.\n  That is the point I am trying to make. You are running a very large \nrisk here that you are going to lose your election officer to moderate \nand supervise these Teamster elections. And we have a strong public \ninterest in preserving an election officer. Let the court decide what \nthe consent decree means, and the court can then do it in a way that \nassures you that the Teamsters will not come out from under application \nof the election officer. That is the point.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, I must say I am most \nimpressed with the eloquence that the Senator has brought to this \nargument and has done remarkably well, I think, with not a lot to work \nwith.\n  The Congressional Research Service has also indicated that:\n\n       Legislation enacted by Congress limiting or restricting the \n     funds for the 1996 election would be a Federal law, and the \n     Government parties would be bound to take appropriate action \n     in reliance on that law.\n       What are the consequences to the Congress of not \n     appropriating all the funds necessary to supervise the 1996 \n     IBT elections?\n       There would appear to be no consequences to the Congress. \n     The consent decree does not appear to obligate the Government \n     to supervise the 1996 elections, either directly or \n     indirectly. Rather, the decree embodies the consent of the \n     union defendants to governmental supervision.\n\n  Basically, the union consented that they would allow themselves, \ntheir private entity, to be supervised as a consequence perhaps of, as \npart of, a settlement to avoid even more severe punishment that could \nhave been enacted against them as a result of Mr. Giuliani's actions \nagainst that union. That would be to me the most logical interpretation \nof the agreement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That's right. The union agreed to this as part of the \nconsent. But the consent decree says the union defendants consent to \nthe election officer, at Government expense, to supervise the 1996 IBT \nelections.\n  You are coming along and saying we want to keep the election \nofficer--let me put this question to the Senator. Does the Senator want \nthe Teamsters to be able now to go ahead and have a private union \nelection without supervision, without an election officer?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This Member says that I would oppose strongly any more \nfunding of a $22 million election, and I am prepared to vote against it \nin that regard.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Even if the consequence of that is that you have an \nunsupervised Teamster election because they are out from under the \nconsent decree? Is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They may be. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I do not agree with the Senator. I mean, I put this \nquestion earlier, and it is interesting now to have this discussion \ntake this turn because now we are beginning to see apparently on the \npart of some Members, they are really prepared to countenance the \nnotion of having an unsupervised Teamster election.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. SARBANES. In effect, we are repudiating the option of continued \nGovernment payment of the election as a way of in effect losing your \nsupervision over the Teamsters election. I do not see how the Senator \ncan take that position when questions have been raised about the \nvalidity of the 1996 election. This is the very thing that the court is \ngoing to be deciding up in New York, and we ought to let the court \ndecide what the consent decree means.\n  I think this exchange just now is a pretty dramatic illustration of \nwhy we ought to let the court decide what it means because otherwise we \nare running the very high risk of exactly what the Senator said he \nwould countenance happening; namely, an unsupervised election. I am \nsure there are many Members who do not want an unsupervised election.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, I do not think the \nlegislation requires that. In 1991, we did not fund the elections but \nhad supervision. I think we can have supervision through the Department \nof Labor or Justice. But we do not have to fund a $22 million election.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is not quite the same. I say to the Senator that is \nnot the agreement that is embodied in the consent decree. This consent \ndecree was not done by this administration. This consent decree was \ndone by the Bush administration. Attorney General Thornburgh said about \nit, ``This settlement, which union leaders agreed to earlier today, \nculminates 30 years of effort by the Department of Justice to remove \nthe influence of organized crime within the Teamsters Union.''\n  The Senator had service as a U.S. attorney, and you know when you \nagree to enter into a consent decree, you know, in effect, there is \nsome give and take on both sides, and this was the arrangement that was \nmade. It was done by Giuliani, approved by Thornburgh, trumpeted by \nPresident Bush as a success. I thought it was a success. I continue to \nthink it is a success. And I certainly don't think we should run the \nrisk here of undoing the consent decree by refusing to carry out the \nGovernment cost of the elections and lose the election officer as a \nconsequence and allow the Teamsters to have an unsupervised election, \nand that is the fire you are playing with here.\n  What we really should do here is we should back off and let the court \nhandle this matter. The court has a consent decree to administer. It \nhas options. Under that consent decree, the court could, in effect, \nmaintain supervision and not pick up the costs of it. But that is a \nmatter for the court to do as it interprets the consent decree. If we \ntry to do it on the floor as we are trying to do right now, we run the \nrisk of upsetting this whole apple cart and the whole effort to purge \nthe Teamsters and to get an honest union.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for yielding, and I just would \ndisagree; I don't think the Government is required to conduct or fund \nthis election, and I do not think we should.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question not even related to \nthis at all? I would like to know if the Senator has any information or \nknowledge about how long we are going to be here this evening? I say \nthat as the minority manager of this bill.\n  If we are not going to vote this evening--maybe someone on the other \nside could tell me. If we are not going to vote this evening, I think \nwe ought to let Senators know so Senators can go home. It is now 8 \no'clock at night. We have had a fairly spirited discussion and debate. \nI don't mean to limit debate or anything, but I think we ought\n\n[[Page S8814]]\n\nto have some information so that Senators can either stay around for a \nvote or at least go home to be with their families.\n  Does the Senator know anything about that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. This isn't my amendment. I am just responding to \nthe offering of this amendment, which I think is a very bad idea and \nwhich I am trying to develop. Actually there is a benefit to be \ngathered by some discussion of this matter, which was illustrated by \nthe exchange we just had, because it was clear that at least there are \nsome Members who, in order to avoid the costs, are prepared to let the \nTeamsters have an unsupervised election and let them out from under the \nconsent decree. I think that would be very bad.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think that would be a bad consequence.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree entirely with the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And an undesired consequence.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree completely with the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think we are running a risk with what we are doing on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am just thinking about what the procedure is going to \nbe for the rest of the evening. There are only four or five Senators, \nsix, in the Chamber. I hope we would have some information so the \nSenators could make plans.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not have the floor. He has the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My understanding was that a vote was expected tonight \nbut that a number of Senators had some things they wanted to say about \nthis bill and were being provided the opportunity to do so. I am not \naware that there is any agreement not to vote. I thought the agreement \nin fact was to vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say in response to my colleague from \nIowa, I think there are Senators who want to speak on it. I don't know \nwhether or not there will be time tonight in order to accommodate \ndifferent people who want to comment on this amendment.\n  But as I understand it, and I will just try to summarize, there are \ntwo different sets of concerns I have. One set of concerns which I \nwould repeat has to do not with the intentions of colleagues at all but \nhas to do just with the sequence of events, the chronology. I just \nthink that there is a great deal of discussion about what the UPS \nworkers did. This was a Teamsters strike. There was a focus on the need \nto have more full-time jobs as opposed to part-time jobs. There was a \nfocus on living-wage jobs.\n  The interesting thing is that I think the public really rallied \nbehind the UPS workers. I think that the public felt that what the \nworkers were talking about, what this union was talking about, was how \nyou earn a decent living and how you are able to give your children the \ncare you know they need and they deserve.\n  I think that this amendment, the Nickles-Craig amendment, is such an \noverreach because now what we have, just on the heels of this \nsuccessful effort on the part of Teamsters to bargain collectively, is \nan effort--and now I have listened to this; I am not a labor lawyer--\nbut an effort which essentially overturns a consent decree which was \nextremely important and essentially says we are going to go right to \nthe heart of the judiciary and go back to an agreement which goes back, \nwhat, 30 years or thereabouts. I am sorry, this was initially agreed to \nin--I had it before me. Might I ask the Senator from Massachusetts a \nmoment, the original agreement with the Bush administration was in \n1989?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In 1989, yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In 1989. I have quoted Attorney General Thornburgh on \nthis. The idea was, look, this was, as my colleague from Maryland has \nsaid, an unprecedented situation. We were talking about corruption. We \nwere talking about workers who want to have a fair election. And we \nfinally had, after 30 years, an agreement here.\n  Now, this election has not yet been certified. The Kennedy amendment \nmade no judgment about expenditure of money. But the idea of \nessentially trying to overturn this consent agreement, to interfere \ndirectly with the judicial branch, to really preempt what kind of \nruling a judge might make before any kind of ruling has been made, and \nto do this on an appropriations bill, is profoundly mistaken. It is not \nprudent. So there are a number of Senators who have come to the floor \nand have raised a whole set of questions.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, raised some questions having \nto do with the judicial appointments being blocked here--now, yet, a \nkind of threat to interfere with the judicial branch of Government--and \nwhether or not this just was not the kind of political interference \nwhich is very inappropriate. He made the point that he felt that, as a \nSenator, if you were going to make a wise decision about this you would \nhave to be in opposition to this amendment.\n  Senator Kennedy started out tonight talking about both the context of \nthis, the UPS workers and the successful effort on the part of the \nTeamsters, and now this--what is this all about? Just raising questions \nabout the timing of it. But, then, more important, or just as \nimportant, Senator Sarbanes has been on the floor and he has, I think, \nprovided many of us his view--I certainly include myself, and this was \nessentially the position I think the Senator from Pennsylvania has \ntaken--which is this is just an overreach. I mean, to just try to \noverturn or basically contradict or subvert this consent agreement, to \ninterfere with the judicial branch, is a profound mistake.\n  So, my colleague from Alabama is correct. The point was that there \nwould be a vote after Senators had a chance to fully discuss this. But, \nfrom my point of view, there are now three sets of questions that have \nbeen raised that I think are extremely important. Other Senators may \nwant to discuss this as well. Or we might be able to reach some kind of \nagreement as to how we proceed. But, I think this is something that, if \nthe Senate is a deliberative body, then we need to be very deliberative \nabout this.\n  We had an agreement with a Republican administration, the Bush \nadministration, which really dealt with 30 years' history. It was \nimportant. It was an effort to root out corruption. We had an agreement \nthat was, I think, a very important step forward. Now what we have is \nan effort to essentially overturn that agreement. Now what we have is \nan effort to directly intervene or interfere with the judicial branch. \nNow we have an effort, which I think on political grounds, and probably \non constitutional grounds, though I am not a lawyer, I am not even sure \nthat, from a constitutional point of view--I believe the Senator from \nPennsylvania may have raised this question--we should even be doing \nthis, and for that reason there are a number of us who have been out on \nthe floor and have been speaking about this.\n  If other Senators want to speak, I have had an opportunity several \ntimes tonight to raise these concerns. Senator Sarbanes was on the \nfloor a long time, I think really zeroing in on what the implications \nof this are, just in terms of branches of Government and separation of \npowers and what our constitutional system is about, which I think are \npretty important questions. And one more time, as a Senator from \nMinnesota who had a chance to see what these workers were able to do \nand who strongly supported, I think, the justice, the justice goals of \nthe strike--I have raised concerns about. I don't think it looks good. \nI don't think it's the right thing to do for the Senate to be involved \nin such an overreach, taking such drastic action, which I think, \nunfortunately, certainly looks like--I don't know what the motivations \nare of Senators--that it is very connected to this UPS workers' strike.\n  Mr. President, I will not speak any longer on the floor of the \nSenate. I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I questioned earlier the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland as to a real problem that I have as it relates to \nthe\n\n[[Page S8815]]\n\namendment that has now been submitted by the Senator from Oklahoma and \nthe Senator from Idaho. My friend from Alabama, the junior Senator, has \nbeen a prosecutor. He has a great case. All of a sudden the Congress of \nthe United States blows him out of the water because we don't believe \nwhat he is pursuing there is in the best interests of politics.\n  So, now we are confronted with a question that is in the courts and \nwe are trying to make a judgment here to supersede what might be in the \ncourts. Do we have a right to do that? I am sure we do. But in this \nSenator's feeling about this institution and this country, we have \nthree separate branches. And those branches must set on their own \nbottom, as we would say down in west Kentucky. We should let them make \ntheir decision.\n  I think this is a very dangerous position. The emotion of the \namendment is good. We have a big, bad union here that we don't want to \nspend any more taxpayers' dollars to see that they have a noncorrupt \nelection. We want a noncorrupt election, but we don't want to spend any \nmoney. We made an agreement in 1989 under the Bush administration. \nThere is no question about that. Let it be under President x's \nadministration. The question still flies: Do we then, by our actions \nhere, micromanage the courts? We are about a hundred judges short in \nthis country now. The majority will not let those judges come to the \nfloor. Maybe 1 or 2 or 3, hopefully 4 we might get out, with 35 to 50 \nbeing held hostage.\n  So, what we have done, what we are doing tonight, even though the \nimage here is one thing, the end result is another. If there ever was a \nquestion that you must put aside, however you feel, I think it is \nimportant that we support the system that has made this country great. \nAnd that is not micromanaging the Federal courts.\n  One of the things the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has \nalways attempted to do is follow the procedure and the precedent on the \nseparation of powers. He just has helped take a piece of legislation \nthrough the courts on line-item veto. And we are getting ready to do it \nagain. So the courts will make a decision on what this body has been \nable to do. Now we are trying to take the position that we want to do \nthis ourselves, in lieu of what the courts are about to do.\n  I know the big bad union, and spending taxpayers' money and all that, \nis a pretty good issue. But, to me, to this Senator, there is a much \ndeeper question as it relates to the three branches of Government and \nthe strength of this great land of ours in that we are attempting now \nto usurp those things that we will go out and beat our chests about \nback to our constituents how great we have been doing to try to protect \nthem as consumers, those in our States or districts, as our \nconstituents. Yet we are tonight, in my judgment, trying to usurp the \npower of the judiciary. In my opinion, if I sign a contract, it ought \nto be valid. Then to have a valid contract canceled by the legislative \nbody just doesn't seem to me to be in the right direction.\n  I hope my colleagues will look beyond the emotion of the question and \nbe sure that their judgment does not usurp the strength and foundation \nof this great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to respond to some of the \nthings that have been said, or questions that have been raised when I \nwas off the floor a few moments ago. First of all, I think I just need \nto reiterate here what is at stake is taxpayers' money being used to \npay for labor union elections where there has been a record of fraud \nand abuse. Yes, there was a consent degree in 1989. How long does it \napply? In perpetuity? We had a fraudulent election, on which, to my \nabsolute horror, $22 million of taxpayers' dollars were spent. It \nturned out it had problems. The FBI has said so. The Justice Department \nhas even said so. So now they say, oh, yes, let's have another one and \nlet the taxpayers pay for that. So the American people understand very \nclearly here, this is taxpayers' money going to pay for labor union \nelections. Judges may or may not say that it ought to be done. All I \nhave to say is, if judges are saying taxpayers' money should be used to \npay for private sector, or labor union elections of any kind, I think \nit is time we take some action to say we are not going to allow that.\n  The second thing is, the question was raised, ``Why don't we have \nsome votes? Why doesn't somebody tells us when we will have some \nvotes?'' Hey, we are ready to vote. Let's vote on the Nickles amendment \nright now. The motion to table the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts carried; 56 Senators voted to table that motion. I \nbelieve the Senate is ready to vote for the amendment of Senator \nNickles.\n  But, as we try to do around here, we try to accommodate everybody's \nschedules and their desire to be able to check with the administration \nor I don't know who. We could probably work out something, to have a \nvote on Senator Nickles' amendment at some time certain other than \ntonight. He has indicated he would, perhaps, be willing to do that. But \nif anybody has raised any questions about why don't we vote, why isn't \nsomebody saying what the schedule is going to be--if you want to vote, \nlet's vote. If anybody wants to know that, any one of the Senators who \nhave been speaking, I am ready to vote. That's what we ought to do. We \nalready had a statement of the Senate on this issue. The Senate is \nconcerned about use of taxpayers' money to pay for labor union \nelections.\n\n  But I have also been working on a whole series of things that I think \nwould be fair to the Senate. Unfortunately, our business was \ninterrupted today. From 2 to 4, we had to go out so the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee could have a hearing and begin a markup on the \nSuperfund bill, a bill that the American people surely would be for, \nbecause it means improving the way that we clean up hazardous waste.\n  We all know now lawyers are cleaning up. They are doing fine. But we \nare not cleaning up any hazardous waste sites. We ought to have \nSuperfund reform. And yet there was an objection made to the committee \nmeeting, so we had to go out for 2 hours. We would not be here right \nnow probably if it had not been for that 2-hour interruption. But when \nwe take out 2 hours in the day, we are going to make up that 2 hours at \nnight, or 3 hours.\n  I have spent a year trying to be sensitive to Senators' needs, to \nknow what the schedule is going to be, to be with their families, to be \nwith their children, to be with their dog, dogs, so we can have a life, \nbut it takes cooperation on both sides.\n  I hope we won't start down that trail where we start these things \nthat force us to be in session late at night. But if it's necessary, we \nwill. That is why we are here now. I had offered a UC request, and I am \ngoing to ask for this unanimous-consent agreement that would allow us \nto not have any more votes tonight, not have any votes tomorrow, but \nhave further debate on amendments on the very important Labor and \nHealth and Human Services bill during the day tomorrow, with no votes; \nthat we would come in on Monday, we would have more amendments on the \nLabor and Human Services appropriations bill with a vote at 5 o'clock, \nbut only one at the request of the Democratic leader; and that we would \nget at the close of business Monday a final, finite list of all \namendments pending to this appropriations bill. Both the managers would \nvery much like for us to help them get that done. Then we would have \nother votes that might be pending from Friday or Monday on this bill \nTuesday at 9 or 9:30. Then we would be able to wrap up the finite list, \nwhich is not that long. There are a couple controversial issues. I \nthink we can get them worked out. Then we would have final passage on \nall amendments and the bill on Tuesday.\n  Then at 5 o'clock on Tuesday, we would go to the Food and Drug \nAdministration reform bill at 5 o'clock, not have any votes on cloture \ntomorrow, not go through the cloture exercise. An overwhelming number \nof Senators on both sides of the aisle support this FDA reform bill. It \nwas reported out of committee, I think, 13 to 2.\n  Mr. COATS. Fourteen to four.\n  Mr. LOTT. When we get to final passage, the vote on FDA is going to \nbe 95 to maybe 5, maybe more. Ninety-five Senators want to vote on the \nsubstance of FDA reform. The American people want that. The American \npeople want\n\n[[Page S8816]]\n\nto get a better system for approving drugs and medical devices and a \nmore active and a more efficient FDA. We ought to give it to them. I \nbelieve the House is going to act on this. So it was a process to allow \nthe Senators to continue on this bill, to get this bill completed, get \nFDA up in a reasonable way, and not have more votes tonight.\n  Senator Kennedy has indicated he can't agree to that. The alternative \nthen is this: We will have to pull down Labor-HHS tonight. We will then \ngo to two votes on Federal judges tonight. We will vote in the morning \nat 9:45 on cloture. If we get cloture, then, of course, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and others perhaps can talk all day tomorrow if they \nwant to. They can talk for 30 hours if they want to after cloture on \nthe motion to proceed--on the motion to proceed now, I want you to \nknow--to the FDA bill that over 90 Senators support.\n  Then on Monday, we will go back to Labor-HHS, and we will have a vote \non two more judges Monday, perhaps even earlier in the day than we had \nindicated earlier, and then we will go to votes at 5 o'clock.\n  I mean, we are trying to get these things cleared. We are going to \nhave recorded votes on them. I think plan A is in the best interest of \nthe Senate and the American people, our time and efficient legislating. \nWe can get our work done without unnecessary acrimony, without getting \noutdone by each other.\n  If the alternative is two votes tonight and a cloture vote in the \nmorning at 9:45, inconveniencing unnecessarily--and, again, I am trying \nto accommodate people, we need to go a little later because some can't \nquite be here at 9:45, others at 10. We will have the vote at 9:45, and \nwe are going to vote cloture. I just don't see why that is necessary. \nThat is where we are.\n  I am going to make a unanimous-consent request on that in a moment \nand then go to judicial nominations. Does anybody have any comment or \nquestions on that? I yield to Senator Kennedy for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know the Senator is going to make a proposal in just a \nmoment. I do want to just point out for the Members the obvious, and \nthat is that we have spent all day today debating two basic issues: One \nis the issue of fetal transplantation which, basically, has no position \non this legislation, an issue that we have debated and debated and \ndebated and which the Senate has voted on time and again and the \noutcome of which was fairly obvious. We took all morning to debate \nthat.\n  All afternoon we have been debating the Nickles amendment which, as \nthe Senator from Alaska has pointed out, is not really basic and \nessential to this appropriations bill, which the administration \nindicates it would very likely veto. So it has not been the Members on \nthis side who have delayed the Senate from moving ahead. As one, among \nothers, who is concerned about the Nickles amendment, I indicated that \nif the leader wanted to set that aside and continue to vote on other \nmeasures this evening, there would be no objection on our side.\n  So I think that it is important to understand what the situation is. \nWe are basically considering an item which is an antilabor item. It is \nraised in the wake of the successful UPS strike and, basically, is \nlegislative interference on a consent decree which raises very \nimportant constitutional issues. So there should not be any surprise \nabout that factor.\n  With regard to FDA reform, the Senator made a very good point about \nthe Members being ready and willing to vote on the medical devices and \nthe FDA reform. What the Senator didn't mention is the other provisions \nwhich apply to the cosmetic industry which effectively is going to \npreempt every State in this country from getting adequate warning in \nterms of health and safety in the utilization of cosmetics. We know it \nis a $20 billion industry that for the last 20 years has been trying to \nget this achieved and have a preemption on issues relating to health \nand safety that primarily affect the American women in this country.\n  I am not going to be a part of rushing and ramrodding that particular \nprovision through the U.S. Senate. And if I am the only one who votes \nagainst cloture tomorrow, I will take my time and explain in good time \nwhat we are being asked to consider. I have no regrets for insisting \nthat we have a cloture vote. I indicated to the majority leader, if he \nwanted to have the cloture vote later at a more convenient time on \nTuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday of next week, that is fine with me, \nabsolutely, whatever he wanted to do to accommodate other Members.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I can claim my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask recognition----\n  Mr. LOTT. On that particular point, I have been reasonable. I have \nput off scheduling.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I can finish my point and then I will be glad to \nyield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But I have made that, so if Members didn't want to vote \ntomorrow, we could vote on this on Tuesday or Wednesday, give the \nmajority leader an hour's notification to Members whenever that would \ncome up any time Tuesday or Wednesday, but that has been rejected. We \nare going to be here for another 5, 6 weeks in this body. We have been \nattempting to negotiate these particular issues. I am very hopeful we \nwill.\n  I want to vote for the medical devices and the pharmaceuticals. I \ncommend Senator Jeffords and all of our colleagues on the committee for \nthe excellent work that they have done. I think that measure is a very, \nvery important measure. There are one or two items which I think would \nbe addressed in terms of amendments, but on the issue of the cosmetics \npreemption of every State in the country in terms of health and safety, \nthat is an issue that is not going to go easily.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield, since his name, I believe, was invoked \nearlier, for a response to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I felt compelled to give the other side of the story. \nYesterday, when I offered the fetal tissue amendment to the Parkinson's \nlegislation, I had discussed the matter with Senator Wellstone. I had \nindicated I was willing to take a 20-minute time agreement on the \namendment, 10 minutes on each side. I didn't want to do anything that \nunnecessarily delayed the bill. I was informed that it was not--it was \nacceptable to Senator Wellstone but it was not acceptable to Democratic \nMembers who wanted to speak on the bill but didn't want to do it \nyesterday. That is within their rights. We could have proceeded. We \ndidn't.\n  This Senator agreed to allow to be pulled over until this morning. I \nonce again offered a time limit, and the time limit was not acceptable. \nSo we essentially sat here for 2\\1/2\\ hours this morning listening to \nMembers of the party of the Senator from Massachusetts oppose the \namendment, which they have a right to do. But there was no delay \ninitiated on the part of the Senator who offered the amendment, nor was \nthere any delay on the part of the majority leader.\n  In regards to the FDA legislation, we were ready to go with that \nlegislation before the recess, and it was the Senator from \nMassachusetts who prevented us from doing that. The Senator has every \nright to do that. If he has an objection to a part of the bill, he has \na right to utilize the rules of the Senate to stop the bill from moving \nforward. But the facts are that the Senator doesn't have the votes. I \ndidn't have the votes on some of my amendments. I didn't have the votes \non fetal tissue, but I didn't stand here and insist the Senate stay in \non a day when Members from both sides made plans and made travel plans \njust because I didn't have the votes or I couldn't get my way.\n  The Senator does not have the votes for the bill. He did not have \nthem in the committee, and he does not have them on the floor. There is \nwidespread support for the FDA reform bill, including the cosmetics \nprovision which was voted on in committee. We had debate, and we voted \non it in committee. The Senator didn't have the votes from the \nopposition party, didn't have the votes from his own party. He doesn't \nhave the votes on this floor.\n  If he wants us to go through this exercise on a motion to proceed--\nthis is just the procedure to start debate on the bill--why doesn't the \nSenator do what the rest of the Senators are doing, and that is, move \nforward on the bill, make your argument, have a vote, count the votes? \nIf you win, you win; if you lose, you lose. But you can use the\n\n[[Page S8817]]\n\nrules of the Senate. It is a right to the minority. We have used it. If \nthe Senator wants to do that, he has the opportunity to do that, but it \ninconveniences everybody else, and if you think it is going to change \nthe result, maybe it is worth it, but if it is just to be obstinate or \nintransigent because you didn't win or your point of view isn't \naccepted by your fellow colleagues, it puts everybody else at a \ndisadvantage. To imply the majority leader----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. Or the Republicans have somehow conspired to deny the \nSenator from Massachusetts the right to make his point or to argue his \npoint, my goodness, we have been hearing that over and over and over \nand over. We know what the Senator's position is. He has the right to \nargue it, and he has the right to delay it. Let's make sure it is not \nimplied somehow there is some devious effort on the part of the \nRepublicans to deny the Senator his opportunities.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. If you will allow me to respond to some of the things the \nSenator from Massachusetts said. He asked for 1 minute to wrap up, and \nI need to respond, and then I will be glad to yield.\n  With regard to the amendment before us, it was offered at 5:05. An \noffer was made to limit the time on that to 30 minutes. I believe the \nmanagers of the bill were very content with that. An offer was made to \nlimit speeches to 5 minutes on this issue. There was no desire to drag \nit out. So, again, to imply that we have been prolonging this is just \nnot accurate.\n  Now, with regard to the Food and Drug Administration effort to make \nthe bureaucratic FDA more responsive to the needs of the American \npeople, this really affects quality of life and health care, and I know \nthe Senator from Massachusetts cares a great deal about that. This is \none way we can help them to get medical devices and pharmaceutical \nproducts available to the American people. The vote in the committee \nwas 14 to 4. Usually when you have a vote in the committee and it is \noverwhelming in a bipartisan way, you bring it to the floor and you \nhave debate, amendments, vote, and move on.\n  But somehow or other, I mean, some folks seem to think when you have \na vote in a committee and lose, then the negotiations begin. The leader \nof both parties always has to be sensitive to that. I have allowed \nSenators on both sides of the aisle to continue negotiations on the \nfoster care bill, on other bills, but I have been very patient on this. \nAnd I wanted a cloture vote on this back in July. I was told \nrepeatedly, ``Oh, we're about to get it agreed to, about to get it \ndone.'' Every time we were about to get it done, the Senator from \nMassachusetts said, ``Oh, no, there's something else here I want.''\n  I think the Senator from Vermont has been doing the very best he can \nin the negotiations. I personally think he has negotiated too dang \nmuch. The vote in the committee was 14-4. Why are we negotiating on all \nthis stuff? Let us bring it to the floor and let us vote.\n  So when I get this magnanimous offer: Oh, you can have a cloture vote \nnext week, put it off another--I offered a UC that would have given the \nSenator from Massachusetts an opportunity to negotiate Friday, Monday, \nall day Tuesday, and go on the bill on Tuesday night. He said no. But \nif we wait until next Tuesday to have a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed, then he may try to force us to have a vote on going to the \nbill itself later on on a cloture vote, and then we might someday, in \nanother week or so, get to FDA. That is ridiculous. There has been \nenough time.\n  The Senate wants to vote on this issue, overwhelmingly, in a \nbipartisan way. The committee has spoken. On a cloture vote, on a \nmotion to proceed, the requisite number of Senators will vote for \ncloture, I believe. So I mean, that is not very responsive. It is time \nwe get to this issue. Make your case, offer your amendments.\n  On the cosmetic thing, I mean, the Senator from Massachusetts is \ndefending and worrying about States rights. Boy, getting some role \nreversals around here, when he doesn't want us to even get an amendment \nand vote on it. He may have the merits on his side. If he does, let us \nhear them; we will vote.\n  But, you know, it is time that we move forward on Labor-HHS. It is \ntime we vote on the merits of FDA reform. I cannot believe we want to \nfurther delay. Every day we delay on FDA reform, there is some other \ndelay by the bureaucracy at that agency that denies the people of this \ncountry medical devices and pharmaceuticals that help them with their \nlives and lifestyles. And so we are not going to delay it any longer. \nWe are going to get an agreement to go to the bill on Tuesday or we are \ngoing to have a cloture vote in the morning. And if the vote doesn't \nsucceed, we will have another one. I think I have been more than \nreasonable, and so has everybody else.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8792-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8817-S8818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nbe the only amendments remaining in order to the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill, other than the pending amendments, and they be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments, and that all first-degree \namendments must be offered prior to the close of business on Monday, \nSeptember 8, other than the amendments designated as managers' \namendments.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \namendments, the bill be advanced to third reading, and a vote occur on \npassage of S. 1061, and the bill remain at the desk. I further ask \nunanimous consent that once the Senate receives the House companion \nbill, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 1061 be inserted, the \nHouse bill be advanced to third reading, and passed, all without \nfurther action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.\n  I further state for the membership that any votes ordered with \nrespect to the Labor-HHS bill on Friday and Monday, September 8, be \npostponed to occur at 5 p.m. on Monday, with one vote at that time, on \na case-by-case basis. Thereafter, we will begin votes on Tuesday \nmorning at 9:30.\n  I further ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to S. 830 \nfollowing the passage of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill--that is the \nFood and Drug Administration reform bill--but not earlier than 4 p.m. \non Tuesday, September 9, to give the Senate plenty of time to continue \nto work on any agreements that they could come together on, and the \ncloture vote scheduled for Friday be vitiated.\n  That is the unanimous-consent request that I think is fair for all \nconcerned. I urge that it be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want to \njust point out that the person that sets the schedule is the majority \nleader. If the majority leader files the cloture motion on a Wednesday, \nwe end up having the cloture vote on a Friday. That is what the \nmajority leader has done. It was his decision. He has every right to. \nAnd that is what we have as the regular order that is before the \nSenate.\n  But effectively what the majority leader now is doing is asking a \nconsent to vitiate what the regular order would be in terms of the \ncloture motion. I do not question that we are short on the votes and \nthat there will be an overwhelming vote in favor of moving toward the \nbill. But the regular order is, as filed by the majority leader on \nWednesday, for a cloture vote on Friday. He knew what he was doing. He \nknew what he was doing.\n  He was the one that set the vote for Friday. And so I find it \nsomewhat difficult to accept easily the fact that somehow the burden \nought to be on other Members because the Senator now does not want to \nmove ahead and have the vote on Friday. He was the one that established \nthat process and procedure and set in motion those procedures. And for \nthe reasons that I have outlined earlier with regard to\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\nparticularly the preemption with regard to the cosmetics, and the \nprotection of the consumers on those issues, which I think is a \ntravesty in protecting the American families, and primarily the \nAmerican women, I am going to object to the elimination and vitiation \nof the cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. In view of what I just heard the Senator say--he is right, \nthat is the regular order. Of course, it is common practice, if you \nwork things out you vitiate the necessity for a cloture vote. But, yes, \nI knew exactly what I was doing. And what I was doing was trying to \ncarry out the will of the Senate, and not allow one Senator to any \nfurther delay the discussion of the merits of FDA reform.\n\n  In view of what the Senator said, I revise my unanimous-consent \nrequest to comply with what I thought I heard the Senator saying, the \nsame unanimous-consent request all the way down the line, except that \nwe would have the cloture vote in the morning at 9:45.\n  Would there be objection to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I personally do not believe I would object to it, I say \nto the Senator. I do not know whether the amendments that have been \nincluded--I have not seen the list. I have had some amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. It has been cleared----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have been given assurance by the staff--Mr. President, \nI object temporarily until I have a chance to talk to the minority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object until I have a chance to talk to him.\n  Mr. LOTT. In an effort to try to get a reasonable agreement worked \nout here--I believe our list has been cleared on both sides. I think \nthe Senator from Iowa has had a chance to review it. In the interest of \ntrying to get something worked out here, I would be prepared to take a \n5-minute quorum call so we can look over the list and discuss it. If we \ncannot get that worked out, then I would begin the process of taking up \nthe two judges and voting here in a few minutes.\n  So in view of the Senator's comments, and the idea that maybe we \ncould get an agreement, I would at this point----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes. By the way, this unanimous-consent request was worked \nout over a period of hours. I think it has been cleared on both sides \nby all Senators with the exception of one. Senator Daschle was \nintimately involved in it. And some of the things in the UC were at his \nrequest, including that we only have one vote at 5 o'clock on Monday. \nSo, I mean, everybody cleared it except Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. FORD. Would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. FORD. Is there any doubt that we will have two votes as it \nrelates to judges following whatever occurs on your unanimous consent \nrequest? I think that we need to alert your side and ours.\n  Mr. LOTT. That was not in the UC.\n  Mr. FORD. You mentioned you were going to have one.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my intent. If we do not have any cooperation on \nother matters, we would vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the leader would yield for a question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Might, while you are trying to work this out, have one of \nthose votes on the judges? We have to do them at some point anyway. Go \nahead and do it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, so that everybody will know we are on the \nverge of having a vote, I think it is in the interest of all of us to \ntake 5 minutes, look at the list, and everybody could be called to \nnotify them we are fixing to begin voting. And if the Senator was not \nhere, we plan to vote on two judges tonight, and hope to get two more \nperhaps Monday or so.\n  Mr. FORD. There will be a rollcall vote on this?\n  Mr. LOTT. I have been requested to get rollcall votes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. While both sides continue to check the amendment list and \nsee if we can get an agreement on the UC, let's start our first \nrecorded vote, that will be out of the way, and perhaps we can get a \nfinal agreement.\n  Mr. FORD. If the majority leader will yield, it is my hope that \neveryone has been notified that we are going to vote. I hope we would \nnot start until such time as we feel like both sides have been \nnotified.\n  This side is all right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8817-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8818-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\nUNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATIONS OF HENRY HAROLD KENNEDY, JR., \n                           AND FRANK M.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nnext recorded vote will be the last vote tonight. Unfortunately, we \nhave not been able to work out an agreement that will allow us to \nvitiate the cloture vote on the FDA reform bill tomorrow morning. So \nthere will be a vote at 9:45. After that, Senator Kennedy, assuming \ncloture is invoked, would have 4 hours of debate on FDA reform. We \ncould go back to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill tomorrow for other \namendments to be offered, but no further votes, other than the 9:45 \nvote.\n  On Monday, we will have FDA debate from 12 until 1. Then we will go \nto the Labor-HHS at Monday at 1. We will have a vote at 5 o'clock on \nMonday on either the Nickles amendment or any other amendment that \nSenators have taken up during the day, or any other pending amendment. \nI believe the McCain amendment is pending. We will have one vote at 5 \no'clock on Monday. And then, on Tuesday, we will have other amendment \nvotes, if there are any pending, at 9:30. We would complete the list we \nhave agreed on, all amendments, and final passage on Labor-HHS sometime \nTuesday afternoon, and then we will go to the FDA reform package, but \nnot earlier than 4 o'clock.\n  I had hoped we could get an agreement that would allow us not to have \nhad a cloture vote in the morning and be able to vitiate that. Senator \nKennedy didn't feel he could agree to that. I hoped that we would not \nhave to have votes on Monday, but we could not get all that worked out. \nSo that is the outline of the UC that I would like to renew. I have \ndiscussed this with Senator Daschle. The list has been worked over by \neverybody. So I would like to renew my request with respect to the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill that I made earlier and ask consent, if \ncloture is invoked Friday on the FDA reform package, that there be up \nto 8 hours divided between Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for debate on \nS. 830 and an additional 4 hours of debate on Monday, divided in the \nsame fashion, beginning at 11 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that the Senate proceed to S. 830 following \npassage of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, but not earlier than 4 \np.m. on Tuesday, September 9.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I want \nto ask a question. On Labor-HHS, amendments laid down by Monday, are \nyou saying all amendments have to then be dispensed with and voted on \nby Tuesday?\n  Mr. LOTT. By Tuesday afternoon. We don't have an exact time set. But \nlooking at the list of amendments, we believe we can do that by 4 or 5 \no'clock Tuesday afternoon.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is not part of the agreement. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me repeat, we have, we believe, a finite list. All \namendments have to be offered by the close of business Monday. Look, \nthere is not a lot of really tough stuff on the list. We believe we can \nfinish all amendments, and all amendments would have to have been \noffered by the close of business Monday. We believe we can be through \nat a reasonable hour Tuesday afternoon. We are not locking in final \npassage.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, again, there will be \none vote at 9:50 on Friday. Any other votes ordered Friday or Monday \nbefore 5 will be stacked to occur on Tuesday morning, except for the \none vote on Monday afternoon.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I ask that we proceed with the \nregular order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8819-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF FRANK M.

HULL AND HENRY HAROLD KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am encouraged that the Senate is taking up two of the \nnine judicial nominations on the Executive Calendar.\n  I am delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to take up \nthe nomination of Judge Frank M. Hull to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for \nthe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Since 1994, the nominee has been \na United States district judge for the Northern District of Georgia and \nprior to that she was a judge for the Superior Court of Fulton, County \nin Georgia. The ABA has unanimously found her to be well-qualified, its \ntop rating. With the strong support of Senator Coverdell and Senator \nCleland, this nomination has moved expeditiously through the committee \nand is being confirmed by the Senate. I congratulate Judge Hull and her \nfamily and look forward to her service on the Court of Appeals.\n  I am also delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to \ntake up the nomination of Judge Henry Harold Kennedy, Jr. to be a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the District of Columbia. Since 1979, the nominee \nhas been an associate judge for the District of Columbia and prior to \nthat he was a U.S. magistrate. The ABA has unanimously found him to be \nwell-qualified, its top rating. With the strong support of Senator \nThurmond and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, this nomination has moved \nexpeditiously through the committee and is being confirmed by the \nSenate. I congratulate Judge Kennedy and his family and look forward to \nhis service on the district court.\n  With these confirmations the Senate will raise to 11 the number of \nFederal judges confirmed this year and exceed, for the first time this \nyear, the snail-like pace of confirming one judge per month. The Senate \npace will rise to an anemic 1.2 judges per month. Meanwhile, vacancies \nhave continued to mount and the delays in filling vacancies continue to \ngrow.\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\n  It is discouraging to once again have to call attention to the fact \nthat of the 61 nominations sent to the Senate by the President some 40 \nnominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee--nominees who have \nyet to be accorded even a hearing during this Congress. Many of these \nnominations have been pending since the very first day of this session, \nhaving been renominated by the President after having been held up \nduring last year's partisan stall.\n  The committee has not yet worked through the backlog of nominees left \npending from last year. Several of those pending before the committee \nhad hearings or were reported favorably last Congress but have been \npassed over so far this year, while the vacancies for which they were \nnominated over 2 years ago persist. The committee has 12 nominees who \nhave been pending without action for more than a year, including 7 who \nhave been pending since 1995.\n  There is no excuse for the committee's delay in considering the \nnominations of such outstanding individuals as Professor William A. \nFletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. \nMargaret McKeown, Ms. Ann L. Aiken, and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name \njust a few of the outstanding nominees who have all been pending all \nyear without so much as a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway \nhad both been reported last year. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings \nlast year but have been passed over so far this year.\n  We continue to fall farther and farther behind the pace established \nby the 104th Congress. By this time 2 years ago, Senator Hatch had held \n8 confirmation hearings involving 36 judicial nominees, and the Senate \nhad proceeded to confirm 35 Federal judges.\n  Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must \nunderstand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of \njustice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot lock \nup criminals if you do not have judges. The mounting backlogs of civil \nand criminal cases in the emergency districts, in particular, are \ngrowing taller by the day.\n  I have spoken often about the crisis being created by the 103 \nvacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the \ncountry. At the rate that we are currently going this year, more and \nmore vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to \nthe detriment of greater numbers of Americans and the national cause of \nprompt justice. We are not even keeping up with attrition.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist has repeatedly acknowledged the crisis being \nposed for the Federal judiciary and, I believe, for all Americans. The \nChief Justice has called the rising number of vacancies ``the most \nimmediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.'' The Courts \nSubcommittee heard on Thursday afternoon from judges from the second \nand eighth circuits about the adverse impact of vacancies on the \nability of the Federal courts to do justice. The effect is seen in \nextended delay in the hearing and determination of cases and the \nfrustration that litigants are forced to endure. The crushing caseload \nwill force Federal courts to rely more and more on senior judges, \nvisiting judges and court staff.\n  The Attorney General spoke recently about the ``vacancy crisis that \nhas left so many Americans waiting for justice'' noting that vacancies \nare up at a time that filings are up, caseloads are increasing, \nbacklogs are increasing, and we are experiencing an ``unprecedented \nslowdown in the confirmation process'' that has ``very real and very \ndetrimental impacts on all parts of our justice system. She spoke about \nthe hundreds of appellate arguments being canceled, the Federal judges \nwho go for entire years without hearing a single civil case. She said: \n``Quite simply without enough judges, our laws will become empty \npromises and `swift justice' will become an oxymoron, and without the \nindependence they need to uphold those laws, our judges will become \nhostages to politics instead of being the guardians of our \nprinciples.''\n  In July I received a copy of a letter sent to President Clinton and \nthe Republican leader of the Senate by seven presidents of national \nlegal associations. These presidents note the ``looming crisis in the \nNation brought on by the extraordinary number of vacant federal \njudicial positions'' and the ``injustice of this situation for all of \nsociety.'' They point to ``[d]angerously crowded dockets, suspended \ncivil case dockets, burgeoning criminal caseloads, overburdened judges, \nand chronically undermanned courts'' as circumstances that ``undermine \nour democracy and respect for the supremacy of law.'' I agree with \nthese distinguished leaders that we must without further delay ``devote \nthe time and resources necessary to expedite the selection and \nconfirmation process for federal judicial nominees.'' The President is \ndoing his part, having sent us 61 nominations so far this year with \nmore on the way. The Senate should start doing its part.\n  In choosing to proceed on these two nominees, the Republican \nleadership has chosen once again to skip over the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow and to delay action on six other outstanding nominees \nwho were reported at the same time as those fortunate enough to be \nselected for consideration by the Senate this week.\n  I want to turn briefly to the long-pending nomination of Margaret \nMorrow to be a district court judge for the Central District of \nCalifornia. Ms. Morrow was first nominated on May 9, 1996--not this \nyear but May 1966. She had a confirmation hearing and was unanimously \nreported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June 1996. Her \nnomination was, thus, first pending before the Senate more than a year \nago. This was one of a number of nominations caught in the election \nyear shutdown.\n  She was renominated on the first day of this session. She had her \nsecond confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the \nJudiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When \nshe was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported \nwith the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the \nSenate Executive Calendar for more 3 months and has been passed over, \nagain.\n  This is an outstanding nominee to the District Court. She is \nexceptionally well qualified to be a Federal judge. I have heard no one \ncontend to the contrary. She has been put through the proverbial \nringer--including at one point being asked her private views, how she \nvoted, on 160 California initiatives over the last 10 years.\n  She has been forced to respond to questions about particular judicial \ndecisions. I find this especially ironic in light of the Judiciary \nCommittee's questionnaire in which we ask whether anyone involved in \nthe process of selecting the nominee discussed with her ``any specific \ncase, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be \ninterpreted as asking how you would rule on such case, issue, or \nquestion.'' We try to ensure that the administration imposes no litmus \ntests and does not ask about specific cases.\n  The committee insisted that she do a homework project on Robert \nBork's writings and on the jurisprudence of original intent. Is that \nwhat is required to be confirmed to the district court in this \nCongress?\n  With respect to the issue of ``judicial activism,'' we have the \nnominee's views. She told the committee: ``The specific role of a trial \njudge is to apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the \nSupreme Court and Courts of Appeals. His or her role is not to `make \nlaw.' '' She also noted: ``Given the restrictions of the case and \ncontroversy requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies \navailable, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the broad problems \nfacing our society, and should not undertake to do so. That is the job \nof the legislative and executive branches in our constitutional \nstructure.''\n  Margaret Morrow was the first woman president of the California Bar \nAssociation and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar \nAssociation. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is \ncurrently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. \nShe is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and \nby Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican \nadministration. Representative James Rogan attended her second \nconfirmation hearing to endorse her.\n  Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women \ninvolved in the practice of law and to\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\nmaking lawyers more responsive and responsible. Her good works should \nnot be punished but commended. Her public service ought not be grounds \nfor delay. She does not deserve this treatment. This type of treatment \nwill drive good people away from government service.\n  The president of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the \npresident of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the president of the Los \nAngeles County Bar Association, the president of the National \nConference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys \nfrom the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: ``Margaret Morrow is \nwidely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both \nparties'' and she ``is exactly the kind of person who should be \nappointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women \nacross the country.'' I could not agree more.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should move expeditiously to consider and \nconfirm Margaret Morrow, along with Anthony Ishii, Katherine Hayden \nSweeney, Robert F. Droney, Janet C. Hall, Joseph F. Bataillon, and \nRobert C. Chambers to be district court judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8819-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, another tragedy struck the people of Israel \ntoday. Three Palestinian suicide bombers attacked a crowded pedestrian \nmall in the center of Jerusalem. At least three Israelis were killed; \nmany more were wounded.\n  There was another bombing in the center of Jerusalem on July 30, in \nwhich 17 people were killed. Those murders were also claimed by the \nPalestinian terror group, Hamas.\n  As in July, all the requisite people will issue the required \ncondemnations, and comfort themselves that they have responded \nadequately. But how can we pretend that enough is being done about \nPalestinian terrorism? How can we look at pictures of Yasser Arafat \nembracing a terrorist on the front page of the New York Times and still \nmaintain the fiction that this is a man committed to fighting terror?\n  The answer, Mr. President, is simple: we cannot.\n  Last month, in the wake of the most recent Jerusalem bombing, \nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright said she would travel to the \nMiddle East if the PLO took the necessary steps to crack down on \nterrorists. Those steps clearly have not been taken. More innocent \ncivilians lie bleeding in the streets. But the administration still \nclings to the fiction of a peace process.\n  I have said many times, and I say again today: There is no peace in \nthis process. How long will we be expected to play along with this \ncharade, pretending that meetings, consultations, and formalities can \nsubstitute for genuine attempts to deliver peace and security to the \npeople of Israel?\n  In the coming months, the Congress will reconsider the provision of \nassistance to the Palestinians. At that time, we must ask ourselves \nwhether the PLO has complied with its commitments, not only to Israel, \nbut to the United States. We must ask ourselves whether Palestinian \nterritories have become a beachead for terrorists. We must ask \nourselves if the PLO and Yasser Arafat are partners worthy of the \nconfidence of the United States.\n  Mr. President, all we need do is look at the pictures on our \ntelevision screens to see that the answer to each of those questions is \nno.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8821-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending August 29, the United States imported \n8,513,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,786,000 barrels more than the \n6,727,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 57.4 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil?

Mr. President, periodically, I report to the Senate on \nthe work of the Rules Committee investigation into alleged fraud and \nirregularities that may have affected the outcome of the 1996 Louisiana \nSenate\n\n[[Page S8822]]\n\nelection. Our committee is conducting this investigation under the \nauthority given the Senate pursuant to article 1, section 5 of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Briefly recapping, I reported on May 8 of the committee's efforts to \nsecure a bipartisan investigation. On May 23, I reported our efforts to \nobtain the detail of FBI agents to the committee and the agreement to \nissue over 130 subpoenas, although for election records only. Then, on \nJune 26, I reported that the Rules Committee Democrats had, \nunexpectedly, withdrawn from the investigation--after only 2 weeks of \ncommittee action in the field. FBI support, likewise, was terminated by \nthe Attorney General.\n  I also reported that the results of the investigation had revealed a \nsignificant failure, by election officials, in numerous Louisiana \nstatutory provisions designed to safeguard the election from voter \nfraud. Given these numerous breaches of law, although many appeared to \nbe unintentional, I believed the Senate had an obligation to examine a \nbroad number of areas where the potential for fraudulent acts and \nvoting could have occurred.\n  On July 31, the committee authorized me to continue the preliminary \ninvestigation and granted me, by resolution, the authority to issue \nsubpoenas. To date, I have issued 38 subpoenas, in addition to the 134 \nSenator Ford and I jointly agreed to issue, which have resulted in \nthousands of pages of documents as well as the appearance of numerous \nwitnesses at 4 days of hearings held in New Orleans. We have received \ntestimony from officials in the LIFE [Louisiana Independent Federation \nof Electors, Inc.] organization, as well as the owners of Carl Mullican \nCommunications, Inc. [CMC], organizations prominently mentioned in the \nJenkins petition and supporting documents.\n  We have received testimony from representatives of gambling-related \ncompanies, witnesses who have voted more than once or had knowledge of \nthose who had, van drivers on election day, and election officials, \nincluding one who worked on election day as both an election official \nand as a canvasser for a gambling company.\n  Our investigators have also interviewed hundreds of people, regarding \nallegations of: mismatched signatures, precincts closing beyond the \nprescribed closing hour, multiple voting, noncompliance with State \nvoting laws, and involvement of gambling industry in the election.\n  On August 29, GAO detailed three persons to the committee to assist \nin the examination of election documents received as a result of \nsubpoenas. We are now negotiating for an additional detail of qualified \naccountants to help examine the subpoenaed gambling industry documents.\n  We also have requested the Department of Justice to reconsider its \nwithdrawal and to return this case with added support. To date, we have \nbeen met with their continued resistance.\n  As I concluded the second series of Louisiana hearings, on August 27, \nI stated that further hearings were needed. In consultation with the \ncommittee, I will soon set our next hearing.\n  The pullout of the Democrats. and resultant loss of FBI support have \ncomplicated our task, but we are continuing to make progress in this \ninvestigation. My goal remains to ensure that the committee's work is \nperformed in keeping with the precedents of the Senate in past election \ncases and to give the full committee my honest judgment of the \nestablished facts. The committee will then report to the full Senate \nits honest judgment of these facts respecting the Senate's duty under \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  Suffice it to say, the results of this investigation to date are as \nyet incomplete. We do not have that body of facts to convincingly state \nthat fraud or irregularities did, or did not, affect the results of the \n1996 election for the U.S. Senator from Louisiana.\n  As developments occur, of such significance as to inform Senators, I \nagain will give a timely report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8821-7", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8822-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED NATIONS \n       FOR CALENDAR YEAR 1996--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 62\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit herewith a report of the activities of the \nUnited States Government in the United Nations and its affiliated \nagencies during calendar year 1996.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to provide for nondiscriminatory coverage for substance abuse \ntreatment services under private group and individual health coverage; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            the substance abuse treatment parity act of 1997\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nthat will ensure that private health insurance companies pay for \nsubstance abuse treatment services at the same level that they pay for \ntreatment for other diseases. In other words, it is meant to guarantee \nthat insurance coverage for substance abuse treatment is provided in a \nnondiscriminatory manner. This bill, the Substance Abuse Parity Act of \n1997, provides this assurance.\n\n  For too long, the problem of substance abuse has been viewed as a \nmoral issue, rather than a disease. A cloak of secrecy has surrounded \nthis problem, as people who have this disease are often ashamed and \nafraid to admit their problem, for fear that they will be seen as \nadmitting a weakness in character. We have all seen portrayals of \nalcoholics and addicts that are intended to be humorous or derogatory, \nand only reinforce the biases against people who have problems with \nsubstance abuse. Can you imagine this type of portrayal of someone who \nhas a cardiac problem, or who happens to carry a gene that predisposes \nthem to diabetes?\n  Yet it has been shown that some forms of addiction have a genetic \nbasis, and we still try to hide the seriousness of this problem. We \nforget that someone who has a problem with drugs or alcohol can look \njust like the person we see in the mirror, or the person who is sitting \nnext to us on a plane. In fact, it is unlikely that any of us have not \nexperienced substance abuse within our families or our circle of \nfriends.\n  The statistics concerning substance abuse are startling. In a recent \narticle in Scientific American, December 1996, it was reported that \nexcessive alcohol consumption is estimated to cause more than 100,000 \ndeaths in the United States each year. Of these deaths, 24 percent are \ndue to drunken driving, 11 percent are homicides, and 8 percent are \nsuicides. Alcohol contributes to cancers of the esophagus, larynx, and \noral cavity, which account for 17 percent of the deaths. Strokes \nrelated to alcohol use account for another nine percent of deaths. \nAlcohol causes several other ailments such as cirrhosis of the liver. \nThese ailments account for 18 percent of the deaths.\n  We know that alcohol and other drugs contribute to other problems as \nwell. Addictive substances have the potential for destroying the person \nwho is addicted, their family and their other relationships. In a 1993 \nReport to Congress on Alcohol and Health, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services\n\n[[Page S8824]]\n\nstated that ``Alcohol is associated with a substantial proportion of \nhuman violence, and perpetrators are often under the influence of \nalcohol.'' There are high rates of alcohol and other drug involvement \nin domestic violence and child abuse. For example, in 1987, 64 percent \nof all reported child abuse and neglect cases in the city of New York \nwere related to alcohol and other drug abuse. With respect to domestic \nviolence, a study of over 2,000 American couples demonstrated that \nrates of domestic violence were almost 15 times higher in households \nwhere husbands were often drunk as compared to those households in \nwhich they were never drunk. And, alcohol has been shown to be present \nin over 50 percent of all incidents of domestic violence. In addition, \nsubstance use itself may result from direct experience with \ninterpersonal violence, as demonstrated by a study of 472 women. This \nstudy showed that 87 percent of alcoholic women had been physically or \nsexually abused as children as compared to 59 percent of the \nnonalcoholic women in the study. We know that over 40 percent of motor \nvehicle crash fatalities are alcohol-related, and that many of the \nalcohol drinkers involved in these crashes have had long standing \nproblems with alcohol abuse. It is estimated that over 25 percent of \nemergency department visits may be alcohol related, and that alcohol \nand other drug use accounts for at least 40 percent of hospital \nadmissions.\n  Data from the 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, which is \nconducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, provide the following estimates of substance use in the \nUnited States:\n\n\n                                Alcohol\n\n  There were about 9 million current alcohol, including beer, wine, and \ndistilled spirits, drinkers under age 21 in 1996. Of these, 4.4 million \nwere binge drinkers, including 1.9 million heavy drinkers.\n\n\n                               Marijuana\n\n  In 1996, an estimated 10.1 million Americans were current, past \nmonth, marijuana or hashish users. This represents 4.7 percent of the \npopulation aged 12 and older.\n  Marijuana is by far the most prevalent drug used by illicit drug \nusers. Approximately three-quarters, 77 percent of current illicit drug \nusers were marijuana or hashish users in 1996.\n\n\n                                Cocaine\n\n  The number of occasional cocaine users, people who used in the past \nyear but on fewer than 12 days, was 2.6 million in 1996, similar to \nwhat it was in 1995. The number of users was down significantly from \n1985, when it was 7.1 million.\n\n\n                             Hallucinogens\n\n  The rate of current use of hallucinogens among youth age 12-17 has \nnearly doubled in 2 years, 1.1 percent in 1994, 1.7 percent in 1995, \nand 2.0 percent in 1996.\n\n\n                                 Heroin\n\n  There were an estimated 141,000 new heroin users in 1995, and there \nhas been an increasing trend in new heroin use since 1992. A large \nproportion of these recent new users were smoking, snorting, or \nsniffing heroin, and most were under age 26. The rate of heroin \ninitiation for the age group 12-17 reached historic levels.\n  We know what the problems are, and we can document them. But we have \ndone little to treat the problems or prevent them. In order to decrease \nthe violence, the domestic violence, child abuse, homicide, suicide, \nthe motor vehicle crashes, the cancers and the other illnesses and \ndeaths due to alcohol and drug use, we must treat the alcohol and drug \nabuse problems. But right now, even if treatment is available and \naccessible, it is often unaffordable, as many health plans do not pay \nfor treatment for substance abuse at the same rate at which they pay \nfor treatment of other diseases. This seems counterintuitive, given the \nrelationship between substance use and other diseases. It would only \nseem logical that if we are willing to pay for the treatment of \nsubstance abuse, we would decrease costs of treatment for other \ndiseases in the long run, as we would decrease the occurrence of those \ndiseases that are related to substance abuse.\n  SAMHSA has summarized the importance of substance abuse treatment as \nfollows:\n\n       Substance abuse adds substantially to the nation's total \n     health care bill. Numerous studies show that providing \n     adequate and accessible treatment for those with alcohol and \n     illicit drug problems is the most effective method to improve \n     the health of drug abusers and relieve the growing burden of \n     drug-related health care costs. Treatment is a sound, long-\n     term and cost-effective investment in America's future.\n\n\n                 Substance Abuse and Health Care Costs\n\n       Approximately 35 percent of all AIDS cases are related to \n     intravenous drug use, and over 60 percent of all pediatric \n     AIDS cases are related to maternal exposure to HIV through \n     drug use or sex with a drug user.\n       On the average, untreated alcoholics generally incur \n     general health care costs that are at least 100 percent \n     higher than those of the non-alcoholic. In the last 12 months \n     before treatment, the alcoholic's costs are close to 300 \n     percent higher.\n       More than 5 percent (221,000) of the 4 million women who \n     give birth each year use illicit drugs during their \n     pregnancy.\n       The Health Insurance Association of America estimates an \n     expenditure of from $48,000 to $150,000 in costs of maternity \n     care, physicians' fees and hospital charges for each delivery \n     that is complicated by substance abuse.\n       The number of methamphetamine (speed)-related emergency \n     room episodes increased by 35 percent (from 7,800 to 10,600) \n     between the first half of 1994 and the first half of 1995.\n\n\n                       Health Care and Treatment\n\n       Chicago's Women's Treatment Center offers a wide variety of \n     residential and outpatient programs for adolescent girls, \n     pregnant women and women with young children. The Center has \n     the only crisis nursery in Chicago, which provides care 24 \n     hours a day to the infants and children of women undergoing \n     medically supervised detoxification. As a result of the \n     Women's Treatment Center's focus on responsible parenting, 67 \n     drug-free babies have been born to women in treatment.\n       Substance abuse treatment reduces overall hospital \n     admission rates by at least 38 percent. Hospital admissions \n     for drug overdose decreased by 58 percent among those who had \n     been treated.\n       Ninety-five percent of women reported uncomplicated births, \n     free of illicit drugs, after one year of treatment.\n       The state Alcohol and Other Drug Authority in Minnesota has \n     reported that, for chemical dependency clients, the state has \n     saved approximately $22 million in annual health care costs \n     by providing treatment.\n\n  So, it is apparent from these data that substance abuse treatment \nworks, and can help reduce health care costs and costs to society. We \nneed to ensure that health care insurance providers do not discriminate \nin their coverage of substance abuse treatment services.\n  The Substance Abuse Treatment Parity Act of 1997 provides for \nnondiscriminatory coverage of substance abuse treatment services by \nprivate health insurers. It does not require that substance abuse \nbenefits be part of a health benefits package, but establishes a \nrequirement for parity in coverage for those plans that offer substance \nabuse coverage.\n  Mr. President, my bill would prohibit private insurance providers \nfrom imposing caps, copayments, and deductibles and day and visit \nlimits for substance abuse treatment services that differ from those \nthat are described for other covered illnesses. In other words, private \nhealth insurers must treat substance abuse like any other disease. \nCovered services include inpatient treatment, including detoxification; \nnonhospital residential treatment; outpatient treatment, including \nscreening and assessment, medication management, individual, group and \nfamily counseling and relapse prevention; and prevention services, \nincluding health education and individual and group counseling to \nencourage the reduction of risk factors for substance abuse.\n  Mr. President, the Substance Abuse Treatment Parity Act of 1997 is \ndesigned to take a large step toward decreasing the problem of \nsubstance abuse and its consequences. We can't afford not to provide \nthis coverage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Substance Abuse Treatment \n     Parity Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require the \nforfeiture of counterfeit access devises and device-making equipment; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE COUNTERFEIT ACCESS DEVICES ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will strike a blow against counterfeiters and other criminals who \ncommit cellular telephone fraud and credit card fraud.\n  These criminal activities cost their respective industries hundreds \nof millions of dollars annually, and these costs are passed down to \nconsumers who use credit cards and cellular telephones. The cellular \ntelephone industry alone loses $650 million each year due to \ncounterfeit or cloned telephone. The credit card industry faces a \nsimilar problem.\n  The criminals who perpetrate these frauds use specialized equipment \nto clone cell phones and credit cards to create phony copies which can \nbe sold on the street or used to rack up thousands of dollars in \nunauthorized credit card purchases and telephone calls. There is no \nlegitimate reason for an individual to possess this special equipment \nused to create these phony copies. This equipment is only useful to \ncreate counterfeit credit cards and cell phones.\n  Under current law, this equipment is actually returned to the \ncriminal after he serves his sentence. The equipment is frequently used \nagain to commit the same crimes over and over. The Government cannot \nconfiscate the equipment without a separate expensive and time-\nconsuming forfeiture proceeding.\n  Mr. President, it is preposterous that the Government must return the \ntools used to commit these crimes to criminals, even if they are \nconvicted. These criminals are exploiting a loophole in the Federal \nforfeiture laws. My bill will close this loophole.\n  My bill would amend title 49 of the United States Code to make this \nequipment, as well as the counterfeit credit cards and telephones \nthemselves, contraband. This designation would make it a Federal crime \nto possess these items. My bill would also require that these items \nmust not be returned to the criminals.\n  Mr. President, these crimes take a tremendous toll on consumers whose \ntelephones and credit cards are cloned by this equipment. By the time \nthe consumer discovers that his or her telephone or credit card has \nbeen copied, the criminals usually have racked up thousands of dollars \nin unauthorized charges. This can have a devastating effect on \nconsumers' credit ratings, rendering them unable to purchase a car or \nhome or start a business. These problems can take years to correct.\n  Last Congress, I introduced a similar bill, S. 1380. Unfortunately, \nthe session ended before Congress was able to act. However, this bill \nis not without precedent. A similar measure was passed last year \nregarding counterfeit videos and music. These items are now considered \ncontraband under the new law. Industry leaders and law enforcement \nauthorities enthusiastically support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Government must stop unwittingly aiding criminals \nto swindle hundreds of millions of dollars at the expense of consumers \nand the cellular telephone and credit card industries. My bill would \nclose this outrageous loophole and help law enforcement crack down on \nthese brazen criminals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to provide for \nincreased education funding, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                the investment in education act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Investment \nin Education Act of 1997. This bill will close gaping loopholes in the \ncurrent bankruptcy code which allow companies that declare bankruptcy \nto cheat schools out of badly needed education funds. This bill has the \nsupport of Senator Durbin, the ranking member on my subcommittee. In an \neffort to work in a truly bipartisan way, I have reached out to the \nadministration and have made several changes in the bill to accommodate \nthe White House. As of now, I have received very positive signals from \nthe administration and I'm optimistic that the administration will come \nout in favor of the bill.\n  As we all know, our Nation's educators face difficult challenges \nevery day, whether from crumbling facilities or classes that are too \nlarge because a school district can't afford additional teachers. Money \nwon't solve every one of the problems facing our schools. But \nprotecting funding for education from losses due to bankruptcies will \ndo a great deal of good. That's why I believe that the Congress should \nenact the Investment in Education Act quickly to stem a federally \ncreated drain on already scarce education resources.\n  As President Clinton has said, the era of big Government is over, and \nwe have a responsibility in Congress to make certain that Federal \nlaws--like the bankruptcy code--do not tie the hands of State and local \ngovernments. My bill will close bankruptcy law loopholes and provide \nmillions of education dollars without raising taxes or spending any \nadditional Federal money.\n  Under current law, the bankruptcy code allows a Federal judge to \nretroactively lower the assessed value of a bankrupt debtor's \nproperty--often in\n\n[[Page S8828]]\n\ndirect conflict with State laws. And another part of the bankruptcy \ncode artificially subordinates local property tax revenues.\n  All of this lowers the amount of money available for education since \neducation is overwhelmingly dependant on local property tax revenue. In \nfact, there have been instances in which school districts have had to \nrefund money they have already received and spent. In this way, the \nbankruptcy code is taking money earmarked for education and spending it \ninstead on administrative costs such as lawyers' fees. We need to close \nthese loopholes to put kids, and not bankruptcy lawyers, at the top of \nour Nation's priorities.\n\n  During a hearing which I chaired before the Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, I found out about a school \ndistrict in Texas that lost enough money in one case to provide 375,000 \nmeals for needy children. And I heard testimony about a school that \ncould not rebuild its kindergarten which had been destroyed by a \ntornado as a result of money lost in a bankruptcy case earmarked for \nthe school. In the State of Texas alone, between just a few school \ndistricts, about $70 million earmarked exclusively for education are \ncurrently at risk. Because the Administrative Office of the United \nStates Courts does not keep comprehensive records on this, we don't \nknow how big this problem is. But we know that it's a substantial \nproblem. I say let's fix it now.\n  The Investment in Education Act will close these bankruptcy loopholes \nso that there will be more money for meals for needy children, more \nmoney to pay for teachers' salaries, and more money to repair \ndilapidated schools. By passing my bill, we can ensure that our \nschoolchildren get the education dollars they need.\n  Finally, section 3 of the Investment in Education Act will be of \ngreat help to children who are owned back child support. Section 3 of \nthe bill will permit children and spouses to go into the exempt assets \nof the bankrupt debtor in order to make sure that unscrupulous \ndeadbeats can't get out of paying child support by hiding their assets \nin bankruptcy. I don't think that Congress ought to let the bankruptcy \ncode stick it to kids and so my bill corrects that.\n  This bill has bipartisan support and has been endorsed by the \nNational School Boards Association and the Iowa Association of School \nBoards. And as I mentioned earlier, I am optimistic that the \nadministration will come out to support the bill. I know that time may \nbe short, but since this bill has bipartisan support, I hope that we \ncan pass it quickly. Mr. President, I have several letters supporting \nmy bill and several news articles regarding the negative effect of \nbankruptcy on education. I ask that they be entered into the Record and \nthat the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to thank you for \n     introducing and sponsoring ``The Investment in Education Act \n     of 1997''. This important legislation will pump millions of \n     badly-needed dollars into schools by closing loopholes in the \n     federal bankruptcy code which unscrupulous debtors use to \n     avoid paying delinquent property taxes. These delinquent \n     taxes go to fund important education programs such as school \n     lunch programs for needy children and school construction and \n     renovation projects. Thus, a loss of these revenues mean \n     fewer school lunches, school buildings in disrepair and fewer \n     teachers, since property tax revenues also fund teachers' \n     salaries.\n       This federally created drain on local revenues intended for \n     education, if not checked in the near future, will obviously \n     have a devastating impact on our ability to provide our \n     children with a quality education. Companies which declare \n     bankruptcy should not be allowed to use federal law to \n     shortchange our children's education.\n       With the federal government turning more power over to the \n     states, Congress has the responsibility to remove federal \n     laws--like these bankruptcy loopholes--which tie the hands of \n     local government. ``The Investment in Education Act of 1997'' \n     is a step in that direction. It increases education funding \n     by returning lost revenue to schools instead of raising taxes \n     and without sending local revenues to Washington.\n       On behalf of Iowa's 377 school districts, thank you for \n     your leadership in finding a solution to this problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Ronald M. Rice, E.D.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                         Office of\n\n\n                                       Sioux County Treasurer,\n\n                                   Orange City, IA, July 29, 1997.\n     U.S. Senator Charles Grassley,\n     ATTENTION: John McMickle,\n     Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. McMickle: Thank you for taking the time to discuss \n     the issues and concerns regarding bankruptcy and its affect \n     on local taxing bodies here in Iowa.\n       I have been following with interest the proposed changes to \n     the Federal Bankruptcy statutes as presented by the National \n     Association of County Treasurers and Finance Officers \n     (NACTFO) and concur with the findings and recommendations in \n     their report. I believe that you have a copy of the report, \n     entitled ``Local Governments Recommendations for Reform of \n     the United States Bankruptcy Code''.\n       Following our conversation of July 23, I did send an e-mail \n     message to all County Treasurers in Iowa, requesting \n     information on the affect of bankruptcy on tax collections. \n     To date, I have had a limited response to that request. \n     Approximately ten percent of the treasurers have contacted \n     me. Overall, their indications are that the statutes do not \n     present any big problems in Iowa. The main concern would be \n     the delay in payment of the taxes due.\n       An example here in Sioux County is to the point. In the \n     Boyden-Hull School District, $13,457 in taxes remain \n     uncollected due to bankruptcy by two property owners. $7,806 \n     of this amount due is to go to the local community school \n     district, if and when collected. These dollars are needed by \n     the local school to keep programs running.\n       We have been fortunate in the Iowa Bankruptcy Courts to not \n     have any judges that want to adjust amounts due on our \n     priority claims for taxes. We have usually received the \n     amounts that we file with the courts, although usually \n     without interest due to late payment.\n       My reading of the proposed changes indicates that the \n     judges would not have the latitude to change amounts due, \n     nationwide, and that would serve us well. Both of the\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\n     cases affecting the Boyden-Hull School District are filed \n     outside of Iowa and we are at the mercy of the local \n     bankruptcy judges on collection.\n       Thank you for your interest in the affect of this \n     legislation at the local level. If I may answer any further \n     questions that you or the Senator would have, please contact \n     me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert R. Hagey,\n     Treasurer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                         Polk County Attorney,\n\n                                    Des Moines, IA, July 31, 1997.\n     Senator Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: John McMickle of your office was \n     kind enough to send me a copy of your proposed ``Investment \n     in Education Act of 1997'', amending sections 724(b) and \n     505(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. I do not practice regularly in \n     Bankruptcy and so may not be as qualified to comment as many \n     of the people you will be hearing from, but I do represent \n     Iowa's largest county in its attempts to collect overdue \n     property taxes in those situations where Bankruptcy Court \n     involvement is unavoidable. I would strongly support your \n     attempt to reduce the impact on local governments of the \n     Bankruptcy Code's artificial lien priority shifting and pre-\n     emption of state law.\n       As you know, because of Iowa's consolidated tax system, a \n     County is responsible for collecting taxes not only for \n     itself but for the cities, school districts and other public \n     bodies in the jurisdiction. The Treasurer is an involuntary \n     creditor. He or she cannot evaluate and react to lending \n     risks the way a normal creditor can. The Treasurer cannot \n     police the debt or collateral or take additional steps to \n     protect the County when a debtor is in trouble. Taxes are \n     limited, so the County cannot build a reserve fund if it sees \n     danger ahead. It is difficult to reduce general relief or \n     quit collecting garbage or layoff teachers when economic \n     conditions result in delayed tax collections. That is often \n     when people look to government for additional assistance.\n       In Iowa, state law requires a wait of 21 months or more \n     after a missed September local tax payment before property \n     can be taken to pay the tax debt. This is reasonable \n     protection for property owners who may be in trouble. \n     Government is, after all, a service, not a business trying to \n     make money off of the debt. Our procedure does, however, \n     often result in local taxes being put off while other more \n     aggressive creditors are paid. To then allow these creditors \n     priority over local taxes, as the present section 724(b) does \n     in many instances, seems eminently unfair. These junior \n     lienholders were aware of tax priorities at the time they \n     took their liens and to allow them to jump over local \n     government seems, to me, to be a pure windfall. Your bill \n     would correct this by keeping everyone in the same lineup to \n     which they originally agreed.\n       We have had particular problems dealing with out of state \n     bankruptcies involving Iowa properties but courts which do \n     not understand the Iowa tax system and the fact that property \n     is valued for tax purposes twenty-one months ahead of the \n     first payment based on that value. We have often lost \n     moderate payments simply because we cannot fly off to another \n     state or hire a lawyer there to explain our case. Your \n     proposal to reduce the impact of section 724(b) would also \n     indirectly, but greatly, benefit Iowa local governments in \n     this regard.\n       Finally, as to your proposal to limit the retroactive \n     impact of section 505(a), I can only say that in my own \n     experience I have found this section to be used primarily as \n     a negotiating tool by debtor and junior creditor lawyers in \n     Chapter 11 cases, who use the threat of redetermination to \n     browbeat the County into compromising taxes to provide a \n     larger income stream for junior lienholders. I strongly \n     support your bill's effort to limit the impact of this \n     section on local government as well.\n       Thank you for your consideration and good luck in \n     convincing your associates of the desirability of your \n     proposals.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n                                               Michael J. O'Keefe,\n     Assistant Polk County Attorney.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Schools Turn To Income Tax--Most Districts Already Charge An Income \n                  Surtax. Should Des Moines Join Them?\n\n       Iowa school districts increasingly are turning to a new \n     tax--an income surtax--to supplement the property taxes and \n     state aid they've long relied on.\n       A movement is under way for Des Moines to join the trend.\n       The school-district income surtax may not be familiar \n     everywhere. It has not been used by the schools in most of \n     Iowa's largest cities, but 204 of the state's 379 school \n     districts now use it to raise extra money for education.\n       It's a simple concept that can raise a lot of cash for \n     classroom programs, new school buses, asbestos abatement, \n     routine maintenance, and remodeling. It works this way: A \n     school district approves a levy(ies) for one or more of those \n     purposes, either by a vote of the school board or citizens, \n     and designates the income surtax as a source of revenue.\n       Each person in the district who pays state income taxes is \n     then charged an additional amount to meet that obligation--up \n     to 20 percent of his or her state income-tax bill. On a state \n     tax bill of $200, at the maximum 20 percent rate, you'd send \n     the state an extra $40 to be returned to your school \n     district. (Counties may also use the income surtax for \n     emergency medical services. Taxpayers who live where both \n     their school district and county have an income surtax don't \n     pay more than 20 percent combined.)\n       Think of the income surtax as a tip-automatically tacked \n     onto a restaurant tab, and districts have been increasingly \n     hungry for it.\n       Why? Growing pressure on their budgets, including higher \n     expectations in general, more low-income students who need \n     help to succeed and aging buildings that need to be renovated \n     or replaced.\n       Iowa law first allowed use of the income surtax for school \n     districts in 1972, under restricted circumstances. Use of the \n     income surtax increased after lawmakers OK'd an ``enrichment \n     levy'' in 1975, which let school districts spend extra local \n     money on educational improvement through either the income \n     surtax, property taxes or both. But the explosion in the \n     number of districts with an income surtax came when the \n     ``instructional support levy'' replaced the enrichment levy \n     in 1991, with state money part of the bargain.\n       From Ackley-Geneva to Woodbury Central--and in districts \n     like Ames, Decorah and Sioux City--the income surtax raised a \n     total of $27.2 million statewide for the 1996-97 school year \n     that ended June 30. That compares to $1.9 million just 10 \n     years earlier. Of that $27.2 million, $24.6 million went to \n     the instructional support levy (which also got $43.3 million \n     in property taxes and $14.8 million in state money, with the \n     state paying less now than it originally promised).\n       The income surtax raised another $72,000 for the \n     educational improvement levy, a one-time opportunity for \n     school districts to boost their budgets that could be put in \n     place only in the 1991-92 school year and continued until \n     rescinded by the school board. (Just four districts have it). \n     The income surtax raised nothing in 1996-97 for the asbestos \n     levy. It raised $2.5 million for the physical plant and \n     equipment levy.\n       Who has the income surtax? Rural school districts \n     predominantly, where the push for it began as a way to reduce \n     reliance on property taxes and keep school budgets healthy, \n     although plenty of cities participate. Iowa City, for \n     example, raised the most--$2.6 million--this past school year \n     for the instructional support levy. In the immediate Des \n     Moines area, only the Bondurant-Farrar, Southeast Polk and \n     North Polk school districts have the income surtax.\n       The surtax has been proposed for the Des Moines school \n     district as a means to move ahead the $315 million Vision \n     2005 plan for updating its 63 buildings.\n       Residents of the Des Moines district paid $124.5 million in \n     state income tax in 1996. Based on that year's incomes, each \n     1 percent of surtax would bring in about $1.2 million for the \n     school district. The talk is of needing nearly $12 million \n     annually from the surtax, which would require nearly a 10 \n     percent rate.\n       Part of the appeal of the income surtax is that it spreads \n     the tax burden more equitably than property taxes or sales \n     taxes, and businesses are likely to support it since they \n     don't pay it. Part of the drawback is that it stands to \n     increase the differences in tax burdens among local school \n     districts, perhaps putting Des Moines at a further \n     competitive tax disadvantage.\n       Somehow Des Moines has to settle on a way to come up with \n     money it needs for its schools, and a tax increase of some \n     sort is inevitable.\n       Whether that ought to include the income surtax needs a \n     careful look, one taken knowing that many other Iowa \n     communities have found that it works for them.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   [School Board News, Aug. 19, 1997]\n\n                  Schools Lose When Firms Go Bankrupt\n\n       Your school system might be missing out on thousands of \n     dollars every year because corporations involved in \n     bankruptcy proceedings are able to get their tax obligations \n     cut.\n       The Dallas public school system, for example, is losing \n     $450,000 during the current year, due to a federal law that \n     makes it virtually impossible for school districts to collect \n     tax revenue from businesses that have declared bankruptcy.\n       Accordingly to Dallas Superintendent Yvonne Gonzalez, the \n     district could have used this money to hire 15 extra teachers \n     to reduce class sizes or provide $150 in school supplies for \n     more than 3,000 teachers. ``We anticipate an equal or greater \n     loss each year for the foreseeable future,'' she says.\n       That's because Dallas, like most local school districts \n     across the nation, depends heavily on ad valorem taxes, which \n     are assessed on businesses and individuals based on the value \n     of property.\n       When businesses declare bankruptcy, however, school \n     districts and other local governments tend to be last in line \n     to collect the back taxes owed by property owners. Lawyers \n     and banks holding mortgage liens are paid first. As a result, \n     schools often never see the money they are owed, and in some \n     cases, are required to refund taxes already received.\n       NSBA supports federal legislation to correct this problem. \n     The Investment in Education Act would amend the federal \n     bankruptcy code to increase local revenues derived from \n     property taxes.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \n     Administrative Oversight and\n\n[[Page S8830]]\n\n     the Courts held a hearing on the bill Aug. 1. The bipartisan \n     measure will be formally introduced in September by \n     subcommittee chair Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. \n     Richard J. Durbin (D-III).\n       A description of the bill prepared by Sen. Grassley's \n     office notes that ``virtually every state has experienced \n     some revenue shortfall'' in school funding, due to two \n     provisions in the bankruptcy code. The issue has been getting \n     a lot of attention in Texas lately, however, because the \n     state experienced so many real estate bankruptcies in the \n     early 1990s.\n       Elizabeth Weller of the Dallas law firm Blair, Goggan, \n     Sampson and Meeks notes that the Houston school district lost \n     $1 million in a single case. Weller, who represents some 200 \n     clients on this issue, a third of whom are Texas school \n     districts, adds that in the past few years, the Fort Worth \n     Independent School District (ISD) lost more than $480,000 in \n     a total of four cases; the Dallas ISD lost nearly $450,000 in \n     six cases; and the Lake Worth ISD $357,000 in a single case.\n       Section 505(a) of the bankruptcy code gives bankruptcy \n     judges broad power to overrule property valuation decisions. \n     This means a judge can decide to reduce a business's tax \n     burden to ensure that the company's debtors can receive more \n     of what they are owed.\n       Debtors often seek to have the taxable value of property \n     reduced for as much as 10 years before the bankruptcy filing \n     and request a refund of taxes already paid. Current law \n     allows judges to approve these requests.\n       The bill would amend Section 505(a) to permit a bankruptcy \n     court to reverse a property valuation decision only when the \n     bankruptcy debtor has the right to challenge such a decision \n     under applicable nonbankruptcy law.\n       Section 724(b) requires that most other claims on a \n     bankruptcy estate be paid before ad valorem liabilities. \n     Thus, various expenses, including lawyers' fees, are paid \n     before and at the expense of tax liabilities, eventually \n     forcing local jurisdictions to accept much less in delinquent \n     back taxes than they would otherwise be entitled to receive--\n     if they receive anything at all.\n       The bill would amend Section 724(b) to provide that ad \n     valorem taxes protected by liens are paid ahead of other \n     expenses, increasing the likelihood that local jurisdictions \n     receive the same revenues they would have received if the \n     company didn't file bankruptcy.\n       ``My clients are sympathetic to wage claimants and others \n     holding priority claims'' under the bankruptcy code, Weller \n     says. They are citizens that serve and protect,'' she says. \n     School districts are not asking for a special priority; \n     they just want to be treated like any other creditor.\n       Weller says there's been ``definitely a lot more cases'' on \n     this issue in the past few years, even though there hasn't \n     been an increase in corporate bankruptcies as there has among \n     individuals. What has changed in that ``corporate attorneys \n     have become more aware of how they can use the law to avoid \n     paying taxes.''\n       One of several examples cited by Weller involves the \n     bankruptcy of Merchants Fast Motor Lines. Taxes secured by \n     liens on personal property were reduced by a bankruptcy \n     court's application of Sections 505(a) and 724(b).\n       That resulted in five county governments, three city \n     governments, and the school districts of Dallas, Houston, and \n     Irving losing a total of more than $70,890. The taxing \n     entities face the threat of additional tax losses when the \n     properties are sold.\n       In some cases, a bank holding the mortgage on a property \n     demands that the seller declare bankruptcy so the taxes will \n     be reduced, thus increasing its profits from the sale.\n       That's what happened to the Hurst Euless Bedford \n     Independent School District in Texas, which filed suit in \n     state court in May 1992 to collect delinquent taxes for a \n     company for 1989 and 1990.\n       The day before the case was set to go to trial, the debtor \n     filed bankruptcy, attorney Barbara M. Williams said at the \n     hearing. The company succeeded in getting the taxes reduced \n     for 1989 and 1990, even though the debtor did not foreclose \n     upon the property until 1991. The property value was reduced \n     more than $1.5 million, and the school district lost more \n     than $61,000 in tax revenue. The debtor then filed a motion \n     to dismiss the bankruptcy.\n       A single bankruptcy can have a major impact on a small \n     school district. For example, when the Lancaster, Texas, \n     school district was involved in a legal battle over the \n     bankruptcy and foreclosure of a country and western bar, it \n     succeeded in obtaining $150,000 in back taxes, Weller notes. \n     That money was enough to restore kindergarten for the \n     district's schoolchildren, which had been eliminated when the \n     school suffered severe tornado damage.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                        Lancaster Independent School District,\n\n                                     Lancaster, TX, July 28, 1997.\n     Senator Charles E. Grassley,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     SH-325 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     RE: Proposed Changes to Bankruptcy Code Sec. Sec. 724(b) and \n         505.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am very pleased to write this \n     letter in support of your efforts to modify the Bankruptcy \n     Code to make revenue recovery easier for local governments. \n     As a small suburban school district, the Lancaster \n     Independent School District has felt the effects of debtors \n     using bankruptcy as a way to avoid paying ad valorem taxes. \n     In one particular case, a debtor avoided payment of taxes for \n     almost ten years before the tax-laden property was sold \n     through a bankruptcy plan to a new owner who paid the taxes. \n     As a result of this account being resolved, the School \n     District collected more than $130,000 and was able to fund \n     fullday kindergarten. I am attaching an article from our \n     local newspaper that describes the importance of the payment \n     of this account.\n       Although the example I have given would not have been \n     specifically affected by your proposed changes to the \n     Bankruptcy Code, it represents the types of issues facing \n     local governments who cannot collect essential revenue \n     because of abuses of the bankruptcy process by property \n     owners. In our case, the issue was much more than a matter of \n     an individual paying his fair share of taxes. For Lancaster \n     ISD, this was a matter of whether or not we could provide \n     essential public services.\n       Thank you very much for your actions on behalf of local \n     governments. Please let me know if I can provide any \n     additional assistance in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Bill Ward,\n     Superintendent.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [Today Lancaster, Aug. 10, 1997]\n\n      Money in the Bank--LISD Receives Biggest Back Taxes Payment\n\n                            (By Chuck Bloom)\n\n       Gary Faunce is a happy man. Happier than usual.\n       The Lancaster school district top finance man is breathing \n     a little easier with an infusion of more than $133,000 in \n     back taxes paid by the LISD's most notorious delinquent \n     account.\n       Bear Creek/GID II, representing the Crystal Chandelier, \n     delivered payment of $133,377 July 24 to the district's tax \n     attorneys, Blair, Coggan, Sampson and Meeks, closing out a \n     ``difficult chapter'' in the district's financial life, \n     Faunce said.\n       ``This helps us make next year's budget and it certainly \n     lifted us through this year's budget.'' he said. ``It has \n     been very helpful to fund a few programs.''\n       Faunce said much of the funds would be earmarked to cover \n     the cost of full-day kindergarten in the LISD, which begins \n     this Monday for all 5-year-olds.\n       The Crystal Chandelier, located at Bear Creek Road and I-\n     35, was purchased by John Drain earlier this year, and worked \n     with BGSM to resolve the delinquent tax problem.\n       ``With the property in the hands of a new owner, we are \n     hopeful that it will remain off the delinquent tax roll,'' \n     said Nancy Primeaux, BGSM regional manager. She said her firm \n     would monitor the GID account ``to ensure the property's \n     prior history is not repeated.''\n       In addition, the district received $6,915 from Jordan \n     Tractor and Marine, plus payment on five other accounts, \n     Primeaux said.\n       Needham Carpets, which is subject to seizure activity, had \n     its bankruptcy filing dismissed ``with prejudice'' by the \n     Bankruptcy Court. The ruling prevents Needham from filing for \n     bankruptcy for the next 12 months, and BGSM can proceed with \n     its litigation and seizure efforts.\n       The LISD has been working under an extremely tight \n     financial cloud, due in part to the large amount of back \n     taxes owed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    North Carolina\n\n\n                                     League of Municipalities,\n\n                                                  August 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Lauch Faircloth,\n     317 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Faircloth: We are aware of proposed amendments \n     to the Bankruptcy Code that will ensure better local tax \n     collection and administration when a taxpayer files for \n     bankruptcy. We support these amendments, included in Senator \n     Grassley's Investment in Education Act of 1997, that amend \n     Sections 724 and 505(a)(2) of Title 11 of the US Code.\n       The amendment to Section 724 will prevent the property tax \n     lien from being subordinated to other liens when property is \n     sold free and clear of liens during bankruptcy. This is \n     already the case under North Carolina law, as has been held \n     and affirmed by our courts, if the tax collector reads the \n     notice carefully enough to understand there is to be a sale \n     free and clear of liens and if the collector knows to contact \n     the city or county attorney and request that an objection be \n     filed to the sale.\n       Under existing Section 505, a bankruptcy court can \n     redetermine the value of property for tax purposes and \n     recompute the tax owed, if the debtor had not appealed the \n     value to the Board of Equalization and Review, and this is \n     true even though the time for making an appeal to the Board \n     has expired. This has happened in several cases in North \n     Carolina, and the taxes were always recomputed downward. The \n     proposed amendment to Section 505 prohibits a bankruptcy \n     court from making this reassessment if the time for making an \n     appeal under state law has expired.\n       We appreciate your consideration and, in the interest of \n     more equitable property tax collection and administration, we \n     feel these are good amendments and would request your \n     support. Would you please share your position on the \n     amendments?\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Terry A. Henderson,\n\n[[Page S8831]]\n\n       Director of Advocacy.\n     S.

Sec. 505 and 724(b).\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and \n         the Courts, 308 Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Salt Lake County's tax revenue, \n     including those of the several school districts located \n     within the county, has been adversely affected by 11 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 724(b) and 505. Both provisions discriminate \n     unfairly against governmental entities and take needed \n     governmental and school revenue and shift it to other \n     creditors of the estate.\n       For example, because 11 U.S.C. Sec. 505 permits the \n     bankruptcy court to redetermine the value of property for tax \n     purposes, Salt Lake County and schools have lost substantial \n     tax revenue because debtors have been permitted to challenge \n     assessments without the necessity of complying with state \n     law.\n       In one chapter 11 proceeding Salt Lake County and the \n     school districts lost $61,800 due to the provisions of 11 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 505. In another chapter 11 proceeding the debtor \n     attempted to obtain a refund of taxes paid three years prior \n     to the bankruptcy filing and one post-petition year totaling \n     approximately $80,000. The county settled after the trustee \n     agreed to drop his pre-petition refund but lost approximately \n     $18,000 which the Trustee would not have been entitled to \n     under state law. Further, in 1996 the county and school \n     districts lost another $13,500 in a chapter 7 proceeding \n     because of section 505 jurisdiction. The above actions could \n     not have been brought had state law applied.\n       Title 11, U.S.C., Sec. 724(b) is often used in this \n     jurisdiction to take county and school district tax money and \n     shift it to administrative expense and other priority \n     claimants. It should be eliminated or limited to federal \n     statutory liens. It is evident from the legislative history \n     of Sec. 724 and its predecessors that Congress never \n     contemplated the impacts of shifting local property tax \n     revenue away from schools and local governments, which \n     provide police and fire protection and other essential \n     services to estate property, to other creditors such as \n     chapter 11 administrative expense claimants and lienholders \n     junior to the tax liens.\n       Thank you for considering the foregoing issues. \n     Unfortunately we are not able to present this in person. \n     However, your assistance is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Mary Ellen Sloan,\n\n                                 Deputy Salt Lake County Attorney,\n     Civil Division.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                          Treasurers' Association of Virginia,\n\n                                                    July 29, 1997.\n     Re Investment in Education Act of 1997.\n     U.S. Senator Charles Grassley,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Treasurers' Association of Virginia to express our support \n     for the Investment in Education Act of 1997. The membership \n     of the Treasurers' Association consists of over 180 county, \n     city and town treasurers throughout the Commonwealth of \n     Virginia. In Virginia, the local treasurer is responsible for \n     the receipt and collection, safekeeping and investing, \n     accounting and disbursement of local government revenue.\n       Of primary importance to our members is the retention of an \n     effective ad valorem tax lien on real property. This lien is \n     paramount to all other debts under Virginia law. In giving \n     this lien the ultimate priority, the Virginia legislature \n     recognized the importance of real property taxes to Virginia \n     localities. Real property taxes are an indispensable method \n     of funding government functions including schools, police and \n     fire protection, sanitation and other essential government \n     services. Under the current bankruptcy scheme, however, this \n     first priority lien can be negated by a bankruptcy trustee \n     acting pursuant to Sec. 724(b).\n       The legislation which you have proposed would rectify this \n     anomaly of the Bankruptcy Code. This legislation would exempt \n     a ``properly perfected unavoidable tax lien arising in \n     connection with an ad valorem tax on real or personal \n     property . . .'' from the scope of Sec. 724(b). This \n     amendment is consistent with the original legislative history \n     of this subsection, and reflects the primary importance of ad \n     valorem taxes and tax liens in the operations of local \n     government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kevin R.

ON \n                           SEPTEMBER 4, 1997\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 50\n\n       Whereas on September 4, 1997, 3 bombs exploded in Jerusalem \n     on Ben Yehuda Street, killing at least 8 people and injuring \n     more than 165 others.\n       Whereas HAMAS, a terrorist organization, has a ``military \n     wing'' which has claimed responsibility for this cowardly \n     act;\n       Whereas Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestinian \n     Authority, has made statements in which he said ``HAMAS, even \n     its military wing is a patriotic movement.'';\n       Whereas on August 20, 1997, Chairman Arafat publicly \n     embraced the leader of HAMAS, Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi;\n       Whereas Yasser Arafat has recently ordered the release of \n     several HAMAS terrorists being held in Palestinian Authority \n     jails, including Nabil Sharihi, who is suspected in a bombing \n     that killed Alisa Flatow, an American citizen;\n       Whereas Israel has recently given Yasser Arafat a list of \n     150 suspected terrorists who are presently residing in \n     Palestinian-controlled territory;\n       Whereas Yasser Arafat has made public statements in which \n     he vowed not to ``bow down'' to Israeli requests that he \n     arrests suspected terrorists;\n       Whereas since the beginning of the Oslo peace process, over \n     260 Israelis have been killed, and hundreds more have been \n     injured, far more than in a similar period before the peace \n     process began; and\n       Whereas in violation of the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian \n     Authority has withheld full security cooperation with the \n     State of Israel, which may have made this attack more likely; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms this latest \n     bombing and those responsible for encouraging or inciting \n     such cowardly acts;\n       Whereas (2) expresses its deepest condolences to the \n     families of the victims of this latest bombing and expresses \n     its solidarity with the people of the State of Israel in this \n     tragic time;\n       (3) reaffirms that the United States should fully cooperate \n     with the State of Israel in helping to stem the tide of \n     terrorism, which has threatened the Oslo peace process and \n     the stability of this vital region; and\n       (4) affirms that the United States should provide no \n     monetary or other assistance to the Palestinian Authority \n     until it has fulfilled its obligations under the Oslo \n     Accords, including--\n       (A) taking affirmative steps to arrest and prosecute \n     suspected terrorists;\n       (B) resuming full security and intelligence cooperation \n     with the State of Israel;\n       (C) taking affirmative steps to confiscate all unlicensed \n     weapons and explosives;\n       (D) publicly condemning in Arabic this most recent \n     terrorist act and other such acts;\n       (E) prohibiting participation in the Palestinian security \n     services of individuals suspected of committing terrorist \n     acts;\n       (F) ceasing all anti-Israeli rhetoric, including statements \n     which refer to terrorist groups as ``patriotic'', statements \n     which praise terrorists or terrorist leaders, and statements \n     encouraging a ``battle'' or ``jiha'' against Israel;\n       (G) cooperating with Israel in the transfer of suspected \n     terrorists to Israel to stand trial;\n       (H) rescinding the proclamation that the death penalty \n     would be imposed for the sale of land to Jews or Israelis;\n       (I) ceasing the use of maps depicting ``Palestine'' as \n     encompassing the entire State of Israel;\n       (J) completing the process of amending the covenant of the \n     Palestinian Liberation Organization, including the recession \n     of those specific articles which call for armed struggle to \n     liberate ``Palestine'' or question the legitimacy of Zionism \n     or the State of Israel; and\n       (K) taking affirmative steps to reduce the size of the \n     Palestinian police force, in accordance with the limits set \n     forth in the Oslo and subsequent accords.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend and \ncolleague Congressman Jim Saxton, to submit a concurrent resolution \nthat condemns, in the strongest possible terms, today's bombing in \nJerusalem on Ben Yehuda Street.\n  Three bombs exploded in Jerusalem today killing at least 8 people and \ninjuring more than 165 others. Mr. President, once again the world \nwatches in horror as innocent citizens get blown up in a Jerusalem \nmarketplace.\n  Just weeks after a tragic bombing incident in July, Yasser Arafat \npublicly embraced the leader of Hamas. Two weeks later, today, three \nmore bombs kill and maim civilians on a crowded shopping street in \nJerusalem.\n  Mr. President, I am outraged by these continued terrorist actions \nunder the watch of the Palestinian Authority.\n  Mr. President, among other things, the resolution that I offer today \nwould require Congress to:\n  Reaffirm that the United States should fully cooperate with the state \nof Israel in helping to stem the tide of terrorism, which has \nthreatened the Oslo process and the stability of this vital region; \nexpress its deepest condolences to the families of the victims of\n\n[[Page S8833]]\n\nthis latest bombing and express its solidarity with the people of the \nState of Israel; and affirm that the United States should provide no \nmonetary or other assistance to the Palestinian Authority until it has \nfulfilled its obligations under the Oslo accords.\n  To many of my colleagues that may not already know this, I have just \nreturned from Israel, where I walked up and down Ben Yehuda street. \nTherefore, this resolution hits close to home for me.\n  Mr. President, it is time for Arafat to live up to the commitments he \nmade in the Oslo accords and break the back of the terrorist \ninfrastructure in Palestine.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning today's terrorist acts \nand cosponsor this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8832-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                D'AMATO (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1079\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, \nMr. Specter, and Mr. Stevens) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n1061) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 45, line 13, strike ``$854,074,000'' and insert \n     ``$854,074,000 (and an additional amount of $40,000,000 that \n     shall be used to carry out title III of such Act)''.\n       On page 85, line 19, strike ``$30,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$70,500,000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                LIEBERMAN (AND COATS) AMENDMENT NO. 1080\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Coats) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill, S. 1080, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 50, line 9, strike ``$1,271,000'' and insert \n     ``1,256,987,000'', and on line 10, strike ``$530,000,000'' \n     and insert ``$515,987,000''.\n       On page 53, line 12, strike, ``$310,000,000'' and insert \n     ``285,000,000''.\n       On page 59, line 12, strike, ``362,225,000.'' and insert \n     ``352,225,000, of which $40 million shall be made available \n     to carry out Park A of Title X of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965.''\n       On page 59, line 14, after ``said Act'' insert ``, \n     $100,000,000 shall be available to carry out part C of Title \n     X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               NICKLES (AND JEFFORDS) AMENDMENT NO. 1081\n\n  Mr. NICKLES (for himself and Mr. Jeffords) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill, S. 1061, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 25, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, with the help of a telesensory \nscreenpower Braille display and a Braille tape on the phone, Marie Blum \ntakes hundreds of customer reservations for Ramada Hotels each day. \nBlind since birth, Marie's perseverance has brought her to a successful \ncareer as a reservations agent for Hospitality Franchise Systems in \nPhoenix, Arizona.\n  ``If people would just apply themselves,'' says Marie, ``they might \nsurprise themselves at what they can really accomplish.'' This \nphilosophy and Blum's exemplary work performance brought her \nrecognition from National Industries for the Blind (NIB) as the 1997 \nPrivate-sector Employee of the Year.\n  Blum, 46, sought to reenter the work force in 1994 upon the death of \nher husband. Previously a homemaker, Blum needed a way to support both \nherself and her teenage daughter. She sought training at the work \nadjustment program at Arizona Industries for the Blind in Phoenix, \nwhere she assembled, collated, and packed various products. Just three \nmonths later, armed with confidence and new skills, Blum was hired by \nLaboratory Environmental Support, Inc. where she did production and \npackaging work.\n  A year later, Blum decided to change careers and attended a 10-week \nunpaid customer service training program offered by Discover Card in \nconjunction with the group Business Organization Office Services \nTraining (B.O.O.S.T). Again armed with new skills, Blum used her \ntraining to land her current job at Hospitality Franchise Systems.\n  The Private-sector Employee of the Year award is given annually by \nNIB. The award recognizes outstanding individuals who receive training \nand work experience in an NIB associated agency and then enter careers \nin the private sector.\n  National Industries for the Blind is a not-for-profit corporation \nwhose mission is to enhance the economic and personal indepen-dence of \npersons who are blind, primarily through creating, sustaining, and \nimproving employment.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nSouth Mission Viejo Little League team, the U.S. national champions, \nfor their outstanding 1997 season. All Americans, and all Californians, \nare very proud of them.\n  The Little League World Series has become a national tradition. Every \nyear, the best Little Leaguers from all over the world come to \nWilliamsport, PA to compete in the world championship. Participants \nleave with lifelong memories and lasting friendships.\n  The journey to the Little League World Series is a rigorous one. It \ndemands the highest levels of teamwork, talent, and perseverance. South \nMission Viejo reached the World Series by winning 21 of 22 games over a \n3-month stretch against the toughest competition in the United States.\n  Manager Jim Gattis and coaches Allen Elconin, and Ed Sorgi guided \nthese 11- and 12-year-olds first through the Division 55 tournament in \nSan Clemente, then through the sectional playoffs in Santa Ana, and \nfinally through the Division 2 playoffs in La Puente to determine the \nsouthern California champions. After winning all three of these \ntournaments, South Mission Viejo was on their way to San Bernardino, \nthe site of the western regional championship.\n  After trouncing New Mexico 11-1, South Mission Viejo went on to \ndefeat Arizona and Oregon to reach the western regional semifinals--a \nrematch with Oregon. A 3-run home run in the top of the fourth inning \ngave South Mission Viejo a 11-1 lead, and the game ended under the \nleague's 10-run mercy rule.\n  The final game, against the team from Sunnyvale, CA, was a classic \npitching duel. South Mission Viejo pitching rang up 11 strike-outs \nwhile Sunnyvale countered with 7 of their own. But in the end, South \nMission Viejo squeezed by with a 2-1 victory, earning them a chance to \ncompete in the Little League World Series.\n  They dominated the tournament from day one, winning all three of \ntheir first-round games. In the second game, against Dyer, IN, South \nMission Viejo once again displayed the depth of its pitching talent. \nThree teammates nearly made Little League World Series history by \npitching a combined perfect game--the pitching staff missed scoring a \nno-hitter by a single in the last inning.\n  The game for the national championship was a rematch of a first-round \ngame against Bradenton, FL. It was another typical South Mission Viejo \nvictory, a mix of consistent hitting, solid fielding, and strong \npitching. Their victory earned South Mission Viejo the right to compete \nin the world championships.\n  The final game was played before 37,000 fans and an international \ntelevision audience. As most Americans know, South Mission Viejo jumped \nto an early lead, only to fall to a heartbreaking rally in the last \ninning by Guadalupe, Mexico. For only the second time in 3 months, \nSouth Mission Viejo lost a baseball game.\n  In defeat, as in victory, South Mission Viejo represented our Nation \nwith honor and dignity. They played hard and they played fair, earning \nthe respect of Americans everywhere.\n  But they couldn't have done it without the unflagging support and \nenthusiasm of their parents, their families, and the thousands of \nvolunteers who put so much time and effort into making Little League a \nreality. These people are at the heart of the success of the Little \nLeague--not just in Mission Viejo but all across the nation. It is not \nan easy job, and too often goes unheralded. I applaud the commitment of \nthe Mission Viejo community to their team, and I congratulate them on a \njob well done.\n  I wish every member of the South Mission Viejo team the best of luck \nin the coming school year, and in future seasons. Congratulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the complete roster of the U.S. National \nLittle League Champions be printed in the record.\n  The roster follows:\n\n       Taylor Bennett, Mike Cusick, Adam Elconin, Gavin Fabian, \n     Gary Gattis, Brian Kraker, Chad Lucas, Nick Moore, Andrew\n\n[[Page S8835]]\n\n     Nieves, Greg Oates, Ryan O'Donovan, Adam Sorgi, Ashton White, \n     Jim Gattis, Manager, Al Elconin, Coach, Ed Sorgi, \n     Coach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8834-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONSTABLE SARA LEE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to give special \nthanks and appreciation for Constable Sarah Lee, who has visited us \nfrom Great Britain. Constable Lee serves as a Divisional Officer with \nthe British Special Constables in Metro Police Area 5. As a member of \nthe British Special Constables, I would like to honor her for the \nsacrifice which she, along with fellow British reserve police officers, \nmakes for her country. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I offer my highest \nappreciation for the the time and talent so generously given by both \nBritish and American police reserve officers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8835-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WILLIAM OSBORNE HART\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a \nbeloved figure in Wisconsin politics, William Osborne Hart, who passed \naway on August 22. As a longtime activist in the State's Socialist \nParty, Hart ran for political office 25 times, and lost 25 times. He \nspread his message by running for office, and understood that he didn't \nneed to win to make a difference. He once said ``I don't buy that Vince \nLombardi nonsense that winning is everything. Change is everything. \nMost politicians in American life who win have lost their souls.''\n  William Hart brought about change by challenging his opponents, and \nthe voters, with his ideas. He was a champion of the Bill of Rights, \nand always remained so, refusing to compromise when it was politically \nunpopular. A tireless political organizer, Hart was a cornerstone of \nWisconsin's Socialist Party and helped found Wisconsin's Labor and Farm \nParty.\n  A great example of Hart's tenacity was his run for the Presidency in \n1984. Though he was a well-known politician in his home State, Hart was \nalmost kept off Wisconsin's Presidential primary ballot, not considered \na viable candidate because he lacked national media exposure. He \nrefused to abide by a decision that equated the ability to buy \ntelevision time with the right to run for office, and sued for a place \non the ballot with the Wisconsin branch of the American Civil Liberties \nUnion. Hart won his lawsuit and scored an important legal victory. He \ndidn't win the primary, but he did make a difference.\n  ``I've always said that if I won an election, the first thing I'd do \nis demand a recount,'' said Hart, who loved to say that he'd once come \n``dangerously close'' to winning a seat on the Madison school board. In \n1992, at 80 years old, Hart ran in his 25th and last election. Walking \nwith two canes and suffering from heart problems, most people would \nhave decided 24 times was enough. But Hart defied convention to the \nend, and exemplified integrity and commitment to those who knew him.\n  Though he felt strongly about politics, Hart never let partisanship \nget the better of him. His dignity, kindness and humor won him the \nrespect and friendship of people across the political spectrum. He was \nalso a deeply religious man who often acted as a lay preacher and was \ninspired by faith in everything he did.\n  His message has resonated with me and so many others because of its \nsimple truth: being true to your own beliefs is the highest ideal. I \nhave tried to heed Hart's message in my own life, and I'll always be \ngrateful for his example of political courage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8835-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN HONOR OF MELINE KASPARIAN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on Saturday, August 16th, 1997, this \nnation lost a leader in the fight for quality public education. The \nhistory of this country demonstrates that it is only through education \nthat we can give the next generation the tools they need to prosper and \nadvance, and Meline Kasparian of Massachusetts embodied this commitment \nevery day of her professional life.\n  Meline spent twenty-five years in the classrooms of Springfield, \nMassachusetts, teaching two subjects that she loved dearly: English and \ntheater. Her students were profoundly touched by her ability to present \nworks from a broad spectrum of history and make them relevant and \napplicable to the modern age. In the course of teaching, she exposed \nher students to a broad variety of artists, including the works of \nAfrican-American playwrights and authors such as James Baldwin and \nJulius Lester. This love of art, literature and history inspired her to \nwork with the Black Repertory Theatre at the University of \nMassachusetts/Amherst, where her extensive contributions will be missed \nfor years to come.\n  Ultimately, though, Ms. Kasparian will be remembered for her \ncontributions to education on both the local and state level. From 1987 \nto 1996, Meline Kasparian devoted her time to numerous associations \ncommitted to retaining the highest educational standards in the \ncountry. Her career as a committed leader in Massachusetts began with \nher service as president of the Springfield Education Association in \n1987 and culminated in her election as president of the Massachusetts \nTeachers Association, an organization 80,000 members strong, in 1996.\n  Ms. Kasparian's fight for quality public education made her prominent \non the national stage, as well. At conferences, workshops and round-\ntables, she worked with politicians and education advocates from all \nover the country. She included in her focus numerous Democratic \nNational Conventions, where she proudly represented the people of \nMassachusetts as a delegate. At these and other national conferences, \nMeline distinguished herself as a tireless advocate for the expansion \nof educational opportunities. Realizing the impact it had on \neducational priorities, she invested considerable time in the electoral \nprocess of her state, working on campaigns for legislators such as John \nOlver, and, I am proud to say, in my re-election campaign in 1996.\n  Ms. Kasparian's charity and service extended beyond her profession. \nShe hosted fundraisers for international relief organizations, \ndemonstrating her deep and unselfish commitment to improving the \nquality of life for others throughout the world. In and of themselves, \nher contributions to housing through the work of the Amherst Housing \nReview Board, which she helped to establish, are worthy of recognition.\n  It is with our knowledge of Meline Kasparian as an influential leader \nand a selfless and caring woman that we honor her for her efforts in \neducating thousands of young people across Massachusetts and attempting \nto bring educational opportunities to every child.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/04/senate-section/article/S8835-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--VITIATION OF CERTAIN NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.
